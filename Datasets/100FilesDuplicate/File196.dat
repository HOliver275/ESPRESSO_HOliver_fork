Single-lung transplantation with atrial septal defect repair for Eisenmenger's syndrome. Heart-lung transplantation has been used successfully for patients with pulmonary vascular disease but its application has been very limited due to the scarcity of donors. We report a patient with Eisenmenger's syndrome who underwent right single-lung transplantation with closure of atrial septal defect; postoperative convalescence was uneventful. Serial magnetic resonance imaging examinations demonstrate improved right heart function. 
Toxic shock syndrome associated with pharyngitis and submandibular space abscess. Toxic shock syndrome continues to be encountered more frequently with the head and neck areas as sources of the toxin. In head and neck surgery practice it is most commonly noted following nasal packing. An unusual case associated with staphylococcal pharyngitis and spontaneous submandibular space abscess is reported and the literature concerning the subject is reviewed. Treatment is eradication of the infective focus, aggressive support of vital functions, and parenteral antistaphylococcal antibiotics. 
Hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia: specific findings at dynamic contrast-enhanced US with carbon dioxide microbubbles. Dynamic contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) with intraarterial infusion of carbon dioxide microbubbles was performed for four cases of histologically proved focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in four patients and for 167 cases of various hepatic nodules in 144 patients. No complications due to dynamic US were observed in any of the 148 patients. All FNH nodules were less than 3 cm in diameter. Consistent specific findings of FNH were not obtained with US, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, radiocolloid scanning, or angiography in the four cases of FNH. In contrast, the characteristic vascular pattern (ie, early central hypervascular supply with centrifugal filling to the periphery at the arterial phase and a uniform or lobulated dense stain at the capillary phase) was observed in all four cases of FNH with dynamic US. This vascular pattern demonstrated in FNH with dynamic US was not seen in any of the 167 hepatic nodules, including 44 small hepatocellular carcinomas less than 3 cm in diameter. Therefore, the newly developed, dynamic contrast-enhanced US technique seems to be extremely sensitive and specific for diagnosing FNH and is useful in the differentiation of FNH from other hepatic tumors, especially hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Expression of mdr-1/P-glycoprotein in human neuroblastoma. Increased expression of the mdr-1 gene encoding the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein is a well-established mediator of acquired drug resistance in vitro, and a similar role has been hypothesized in vivo in human malignancy. Because expression of mdr-1 is increased in neuroblastoma cell lines by differentiating agents, the authors hypothesized a similar correlation with differentiation in vivo in neuroblastomas. In 12 tumors from 11 patients, total RNA analysis demonstrated no correlation with differentiation, but a correlation could be detected in the cell-based methods of analysis. The very primitive 'stroma'-poor, poorly differentiated neuroblastomas had low levels of mdr-1/P-glycoprotein. The intermediate grades had higher levels of expression and although heterogeneity of differentiation appeared within these tumors, both primitive and more differentiated cells expressed the gene at comparable levels within the tumor. One very well-differentiated neuroblastoma, a ganglioneuroma, had no detectable expression in the neurofibrillary material, but demonstrated expression in adjacent large ganglionic cells. Thus mdr-1/P-glycoprotein expression increased with increasing differentiation among tumors, and was present in ganglionic cells in the most well-differentiated tumor. The three tumors with the highest levels of expression were obtained from patients who received preoperative chemotherapy. 
Pathophysiological basis for noninvasive functional evaluation of coronary stenosis. A number of tests are used for the noninvasive detection of coronary stenosis, which results from the combination of different stimuli (exercise, pacing, dobutamine, dipyridamole, etc.) and different signals and methodologies (ECG, echocardiography, scintigraphy). In this article, the theoretical assumptions for and the methodological limitations of the functional evaluation of the degree of coronary stenosis are considered within the framework of pathophysiology. In particular, the issues of dilating coronary circulation by either increasing myocardial O2 demand or infusing dipyridamole and of assessing coronary reserve by either flow- or ischemia-related techniques are examined. In addition, the hypotheses of a physiological blood steal during exercise, a decrement of exercise ischemic threshold secondary to additional pharmacological vasodilation, and coronary vasospasm in Prinzmetal's angina patients, following the sequence dipyridamole-aminophylline, are discussed on the basis of preliminary studies. 
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Systemic and regional hemodynamics in rats and humans. The systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been investigated using different experimental methods (pulsed Doppler, radioactive microspheres), either in rats (normotensive NT or genetically hypertensive SHRs) or in humans (healthy volunteers or patients with congestive heart failure CHF). All ACEIs decreased systemic vascular resistance but the profile of their peripheral vasodilating properties was heterogeneous. ACEI-induced vasodilation primarily affected the kidney in rats and in humans and this effect was accompanied by a strong and consistent increase in renal blood flow. This occurred even at non-hypotensive doses in SHRs and CHF patients and resulted in a favorable redistribution of cardiac output towards the kidney. In the muscular vascular bed, ACEIs also decreased local vascular resistance in rats and in humans, whether normotensive or hypertensive. In humans, this vasodilation affected both the arterioles and the large conductance vessels, more markedly in CHF patients than in normotensive subjects. Muscular blood flow was increased and a favorable redistribution of cardiac output towards the muscle occurred. Cerebral blood flow in SHRs and carotid blood flow in humans were augmented, whereas hepatosplanchnic blood flow was increased in rats but not modified in humans. There was no major difference between the regional vasodilating profiles of the different ACEIs, but captopril was somewhat less active at the muscular level. In conclusion, ACEI-induced regional vasodilation is heterogeneous, preferentially affecting the kidney and the muscle. In the latter, both arterioles and large conductance vessels are dilated. 
Milk-induced malabsorption in malnourished African patients. Fifty malnourished rural African patients were randomly assigned to whole milk (50 g lactose/L), acidified milk (24 g lactose/L), or a commercial lactose-free diet (LFD) as a constant nasogastric infusion for 3 d, starting at 2 L/d and increasing to 3 L/d if tolerated. During the first 2 d mild symptoms of intolerance developed in 63% of patients on whole milk, 37% on acidified milk, and 54% on LFD whereas severe intolerance, necessitating withdrawal, was encountered in 22% receiving whole milk and none receiving LFD. Stool weights and fat excretion on day 3 were greater (P less than 0.02) in the remaining milk-fed patients whereas nitrogen balance remained strongly positive in all three groups. Eighty-seven percent of patients were methane producers, and high excretion rates were associated with better milk tolerance. The results suggest that although undiluted cow milk will not form a suitable tube feed for malnourished African patients, products such as acidified milk may prove cost effective. 
Transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage: a reappraisal 25 years after its introduction. Most cerclage operations for cervical insufficiency are performed transvaginally. The transabdominal route is beneficial in treating patients with cervices that are either extremely short, congenitally deformed, deeply lacerated, or markedly scarred because of previously failed transvaginal cerclage procedures. The average gestational age at surgery was 11.5 weeks and the operation was performed after early ultrasonographic verification of fetal viability. Patients with advanced cervical effacement or dilatation in the second trimester were excluded. A 5 mm wide Mersilene band was applied in an avascular space above the junction of the cervix and the uterine isthmus without dissection or tunneling among broad ligament vessels. This simplified surgical approach resulted in little operative blood loss (mean, 75 ml; range, 50 to 200 ml). After transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage, 21 pregnancies in 20 patients resulted in 18 term births, one premature birth with favorable outcome, and two early fetal deaths (90% salvage rate). A review of the world literature indicated 130 pregnancies with transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage during pregnancy and a cumulative success rate of 89%. Preconceptional transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage was reported in 30 pregnancies with an overall fetal survival rate of 81%. A survey of specialists in maternal-fetal medicine indicated an increasing interest and familiarity with transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage since its introduction more than two decades ago although this procedure is still not widely applied in obstetric practice. 
The incidence of attempted CPR in nursing homes. We studied the frequency with which cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is attempted on residents of American nursing homes. Each author (all members of the Clinical Practice Committee of the American Geriatrics Society) completed a questionnaire in 1989 about policy and practice regarding CPR during 1988 in each of three to seven nursing homes, by questioning the medical or nursing director or the administrator. Because of the vagaries of nursing home record-keeping, data from some homes were allowed when they were "accurate to within 10%." Data from 58 nursing homes, totalling 10,836 bed-years were available. In 33 of these homes, accounting for 5,425 bed-years, CPR was never attempted. CPR was more likely to be foregone in nursing homes with religious affiliation than in nursing homes without (13 of 17 vs 18 of 38; chi 2 = 4.0; P less than 0.05). Religious affiliation was unknown for three nursing homes. Academic affiliation (10 of 16 vs 20 of 37 in non-affiliated nursing homes) and non-profit status (14 of 19 vs 16 of 23 in for-profit nursing homes) did not significantly affect the likelihood that CPR would never be used. In 31 of 54 nursing homes with explicit do not resuscitate (DNR) policies, CPR was never performed, compared to 2 of 4 homes without such policies. For nursing homes with complete data, there were 1,196 deaths in 32 facilities where CPR was never attempted compared to 1,294 deaths for 24 nursing homes with CPR. For 22 nursing homes without CPR, there were 2,172 emergency room transfers compared to 1,363 emergency room transfers in 18 nursing homes where CPR was attempted. 
High-dose cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide followed by autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation for patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease. Between February 1986 and March 1990, 56 patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide (CBV) received an autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT) rather than an autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) because each patient had a marrow abnormality, either hypocellularity or tumor involvement. At least 6.5 x 10(9) mononuclear cells/kg patient weight were collected from the peripheral blood of each patient, cyropreserved, and returned intravenously following CBV administration. Three patients had an early death 2, 22, and 25 days after PSCT. The actuarial event-free survival for these 56 patients at 3 years was 37% and was at least as good as that reported for relapsed Hodgkin's disease patients treated with CBV and ABMT. The 30 patients who had no marrow metastases at the time of PSC harvesting had an actuarial event-free survival of 47%, while those 26 patients with marrow metastases had a significantly different actuarial event-free survival of 27% (P = .02). CBV and PSCT for patients with relapsed Hodgkin's diseases who have marrow hypocellularity in traditional harvest sites or histopathologic evidence of BM metastases can result in long-term event-free survival. 
Benign and malignant adrenal masses: CT distinction with attenuation coefficients, size, and observer analysis. In a retrospective study of adrenal masses evaluated with computed tomography (CT), lesion x-ray attenuation was compared with size and radiologists' interpretations in discriminating benign lesions from malignant ones. Unenhanced CT attenuation coefficient and size were analyzed electronically in 55 patients with 66 adrenal masses. There were 38 nonhyperfunctioning adenomas in 33 patients and 28 malignant masses in 22 patients. Primary extraadrenal malignancies were present in 45 of the 55 patients. Three blinded readers characterized the adrenal masses using a seven-point scale of certainty. Results were subjected to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The mean CT attenuation coefficient for benign adrenal masses was -2.2 HU +/- 16.0 and was significantly different from the mean for malignant lesions (28.9 HU +/- 10.6). The area under the ROC curve for CT attenuation coefficients (0.91 +/- 0.04) was significantly larger than that for lesion size (0.84 +/- 0.05) or best observer interpretation (0.84 +/- 0.05). A threshold CT attenuation value of 0 HU had a sensitivity-to-specificity ratio of 47%:100% for characterizing benign adrenal masses, whereas a threshold attenuation of 10 HU had a ratio of 79%:96%. 
Inactive subretinal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration. Inactive subretinal new vessels (SRNVs), showing minimal leakage by fluorescein angiography and little progression, were observed in 15 eyes of 12 patients with age-related macular degeneration. In 8 (57%) of 14 eyes followed for longer than 6 months, the new vessels involuted and produced circumscribed areas of retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris atrophy; 6 (43%) showed a further decrease in the fluorescein leakage during the follow-up period (average, 30.1 months). None of the new vessels organized into an exudative fibrovascular scar. Visual acuity was improved or unchanged during the entire follow-up period in 12 (86%) eyes and deteriorated in 2 (14%). Nine patients (75%) were 80 years of age or older; three (25%) were between 65 and 70 years of age. These observations suggested that SRNV showing minimal fluorescein leakage, particularly when it occurs in patients older than 80 years, do not require photocoagulation because they are usually self-limited. 
Patterns of mortality in sickle cell disease in the United Kingdom. Eighteen of 384 patients entered on the Brent sickle cell disease register died between 1974 and 1989, a mortality of one per 128 years of follow up. Two children died from acute splenic sequestration and a third died from fulminant pneumococcal septicaemia: none was taking prophylactic penicillin. Acute chest syndrome was the cause of death in eight young adults and one child. Three deaths occurred after surgery. Cerebrovascular accidents contributed to the cause of death in three cases and there were two sudden unexplained deaths. Ten of the deaths occurred at home or within 24 hours of admission to hospital. Post mortem examinations were made in 14 cases, but the histological appearances of acute chest syndrome were often not recognised. In most cases for whom information was available, the cause of death (chest syndrome, pneumococcal sepsis, postoperative complications) could have been prevented. 
The effect of theophylline on hypoxic, hypercapnic hamster diaphragm muscle in vitro. Hypoxic, hypercapnic acidosis (HHA) decreases tension and enhances fatigue in hamster diaphragm in vitro. We hypothesized that theophylline would decrease the harmful effect of HHA. Hamster diaphragm strips were studied in Krebs solution aerated with 21% O2 and 12% CO2. The force-frequency responses and the tension and relaxation of brief, submaximal contractions were studied. Mild fatigue was produced by a series of 45 submaximal contractions, after which recovery of force was followed for 15 min. Theophylline (0.55 mM) was added at the time of exposure to HHA (early theophylline) in half the strips and at the end of the fatigue run (late theophylline) in the others. In contrast to our hypothesis, early theophylline had a limited effect on force production in unfatigued HHA diaphragm strips and resulted in lower force production in the recovery period. Late theophylline improved force in the recovery period for low-frequency contractions. Thus the effect of theophylline in the setting of HHA depended on the time it was added and was beneficial only if added after the muscle stopped contracting. 
Congenital keratinizing desquamative squamous epithelium of the entire urinary tract. We report the clinical and pathological findings of a case of congenital desquamative squamous epithelium of the entire urinary tract associated with body dysmorphism. This entity has not been described previously in the literature. 
Seminal polyamines as agents of cervical carcinoma: production of aneuploidy in squamous epithelium. The effects of several polyamines found in seminal fluid on the cell cycle and ploidy of three cervical cell lines and of primary epithelial cells cultured from cervical biopsy specimens were monitored by fluorescent flow cytometry. The rate of cell growth did not change but there were indications of either hypodiploidy or hyperdiploidy in some cultures at certain concentrations of spermine and spermidine. An interaction of exogenous polyamines with the DNA of cervical cells was shown to occur, leading to changes in ploidy with, perhaps, the potential to induce or promote dysplasia. 
Intracellular pH in rat resistance arteries during the development of experimental hypertension. 1. In order to examine the effects of experimental hypertension on intracellular pH in mesenteric resistance arteries, intracellular pH was measured in mesenteric resistance arteries from rats with coarctation 72 h, 9 days and 28 days after the aorta was partially constricted between the origins of the renal arteries. Carotid arterial pressure was significantly raised at all time points. 2. Second-order mesenteric resistance arteries were mounted in a myograph and were loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. Morphological measurements demonstrated that arteries from rats with coarctation had an increased media volume at 9 days and at 28 days compared with vessels from sham-operated control animals, but this was only statistically significant at 28 days. 3. Resting intracellular pH was not significantly different at any time point in arteries from rats with coarctation compared with control animals, although there was a rise in intracellular pH in both groups of rats between 72 h and 9 days. The application of 4,4-di-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid produced a fall in intracellular pH which was significantly greater in the sham-operated rats at 9 days; this difference was not found at 28 days. Blockade of Na+/H+ exchange with 60 mumol/l ethylisopropylamiloride led to a similar fall in intracellular pH in both groups of rats at 9 days but a significantly greater fall in intracellular pH in arteries of rats with coarctation at 28 days. Activation with noradrenaline (10 mumol/l) induced acid changes in intracellular pH that were similar in both groups of rats. 
Prognostic factors in Japanese patients with colorectal cancer: the significance of large bowel obstruction--univariate and multivariate analyses. In order to define prognostic factors in colorectal carcinoma, univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out on data from 113 Japanese patients treated in a typical general hospital in Japan. In the univariate analysis, a poor prognosis was seen in those with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, in tumors that perforated the visceral peritoneum or that invaded directly other organs or structures (T4), in metastasis to the nodes along the main vascular pedicle (N3), in lymphatic permeation, in blood vessel invasion, in peritoneal dissemination, in Dukes C stage, and in those with lesions presenting with large bowel obstruction. Of these, only lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination had an independent prognostic significance when a multivariate Cox analysis was performed. The significant risk factors related to an obstructing tumor were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The significant variables were patient's age, nodal involvement and peritoneal dissemination. Since lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination proved significant in both multivariate analyses, we propose that the presence of large bowel obstruction is not an independent prognostic factor in patients with colorectal carcinoma. In poor-risk patients who have an obstructing tumor, a staged operation should be attempted for definitive curative surgery. 
Incremental spinal anaesthesia using a 32-gauge catheter. Incremental spinal anaesthesia using a 32-gauge intrathecal catheter was studied in 13 males scheduled for transurethral resection of the prostate or repair of inguinal hernia. The spinal technique failed in four patients. Dose-response curves were obtained in the remaining nine patients using increments of 0.5% plain bupivacaine. The spinal block was extended safely and reliably without cardiovascular instability. No patient had any postoperative headache and all catheters were removed intact. 
Molecular cloning of PC3, a putatively secreted protein whose mRNA is induced by nerve growth factor and depolarization. PC3 is an immediate early gene induced by nerve growth factor in PC12 cells, a cell line derived from a tumor of the adrenal medulla that undergoes neuronal differentiation in the presence of nerve growth factor. This induction is independent of new protein synthesis as it can occur in the presence of cycloheximide. PC3 is also induced with similar kinetics, but at lower levels, by membrane depolarization (both in vivo and in vitro) and epidermal growth factor. It is induced at much lower levels by fibroblast growth factor and interleukin 6. In vivo it is found expressed in tissues, such as brain at embryonic day 13.5, placenta, amnion, and spleen, which are proliferating and/or differentiating. The deduced protein sequence from the cDNA indicates the presence of a signal peptide, suggesting that PC3 is secreted. 
Diagnostic imaging of heterotopic ossification with coexistent deep-venous thrombosis in flaccid paraplegia. Heterotopic ossification and deep-venous thrombosis can coexist. This raises potential problems because diagnosis depends heavily on imaging studies, and an ideal imaging study which will cost-effectively and noninvasively diagnose both conditions simultaneously is not readily available. A case of coexistent heterotopic ossification and deep-venous thrombosis in flaccid paraplegia is presented. In this case, deep-venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus were diagnosed and treatment was begun without knowledge of the coexistent heterotopic ossification. Alternative imaging and laboratory diagnostic strategies are discussed. It was concluded that, at this time, clinical acumen and judicious use of traditional diagnostic alternatives is the best means of selecting appropriate treatment. Awareness of the coexistence of the two conditions are careful attention to the patient's clinical course can minimize treatment delays and resultant morbidity. 
Evaluation of combined systemic aspirin and cromolyn sodium in intractable vernal catarrh. The steroids in vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) are not always effective and may result in glaucoma. Cromolyn sodium inhibits degranulation from mast cells, thus preventing release of prostaglandins and the mediators of inflammation when used topically. Aspirin, which blocks the production of inflammation-producing prostaglandins in mast cells released in VKC, especially prostaglandin D2, was used orally in 11 patients with intractable VKC of mixed type with limbal predominance. The chi 2 test of combined therapy showed a significant improvement in itching, lacrimation, and limbal edema (P less than .005) and improved photophobia, palpebral lesions, and corneal staining (P less than .02) at six weeks. 
Sarcoidosis of the CNS: comparison of unenhanced and enhanced MR images. Sarcoidosis involving the CNS has a predilection for the leptomeninges, although parenchymal involvement occurs. We retrospectively evaluated the appearance of CNS sarcoidosis on unenhanced and enhanced MR images. MR studies were abnormal in 17 of 20 patients with CNS sarcoidosis. In all 17 patients, meningeal disease was detected on the gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced T1-weighted images; the disease was detected on unenhanced images in three patients. Well-defined leptomeningeal patterns of enhancement were present in 15 patients. Other areas of involvement were the dura; brain parenchyma including hypothalamus, periventricular white matter, and ventricular ependyma; optic chiasm; and pituitary gland. Gadopentetate dimeglumine optimally evaluates meningeal disease and highlights the importance of the leptomeninges and Virchow-Robin spaces in the pathogenesis of CNS sarcoidosis. Enhanced MR is the preferred imaging technique for the evaluation of CNS sarcoidosis. 
Obesity and cardiovascular risk intervention through the ad libitum feeding of traditional Hawaiian diet. The Waianae Diet Program is a community-based intervention strategy designed to be culturally appropriate by using a pre-Western-contact Hawaiian diet to reduce chronic-disease risk factors in Native Hawaiians. This paper describes a trial of the traditional Hawaiian diet fed ad libitum to Native Hawaiians with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease to assess its effect on obesity and cardiovascular risk factors. Twenty Native Hawaiians were placed on a pre-Western-contact Hawaiian diet for 21 d. The diet was low in fat (7%), high in complex carbohydrates (78%), and moderate in protein (15%). Participants were encouraged to eat to satiety. Average energy intake decreased from 10.86 MJ (2594 kcal)/d to 6.57 MJ (1569 kcal)/d. Average weight loss was 7.8 kg (P less than 0.0001) and average serum cholesterol decreased 0.81 mmol/L (P less than 0.001) from 5.76 to 4.95 mmol/L. Blood pressure decreased an average of 11.5 mm Hg systolic (P less than 0.001) and 8.9 mm Hg diastolic (P less than 0.001). 
A phase II evaluation of menogaril in cisplatin-refractory advanced ovarian carcinoma. A collaborative trial of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and the Mayo Clinic. Forty-one women with advanced, recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma (in whom prior chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen failed) were treated with menogaril 200 mg/m2 intravenously every 4 weeks in a Phase II trial. Partial responses were seen in two of 19 (10.5%) measurable disease patients and three of 12 (25%) nonmeasurable but evaluable patients, an overall objective response rate of 16.1% (95% confidence interval, 5% to 34%). Median time to progression for all patients was 2 months and median survival, 5 months. Toxicities were acceptable and consisted primarily of leukopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity. Twenty-nine percent of the patients had venous irritation or painful phlebitis at the intravenous injection site. Menogaril, as administered in this protocol, had modest antineoplastic activity in previously treated ovarian carcinoma patients. The responses were of short duration, and there appeared to be no survival advantage with menogaril treatment. 
Factors influencing postoperative urinary retention in patients undergoing elective inguinal herniorrhaphy. We retrospectively studied 295 men who had undergone herniorrhaphy under spinal or general endotracheal anesthesia to determine the incidence of postoperative urinary retention and to assess factors influencing it. The type and location of hernia had no effect on retention. In contrast, the use of general anesthesia, patient age above 53 years, and perioperative administration of more than 1,200 mL of fluid were significantly associated with an increase in retention. Our results suggest that urinary retention after herniorrhaphy may be prevented by limiting the amount of fluid given perioperatively and by using a spinal anesthetic, especially in older patients. 
Effects of felodipine ER and hydrochlorothiazide on blood rheology in essential hypertension--a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. The haemorheological effects of felodipine extended release (ER), a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, were compared with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in 28 mild to moderate hypertensives (18 men and 10 women, aged 30-70 years) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Antihypertensive drugs were gradually discontinued. Felodipine Er, 10 mg, was given once daily for 2 weeks, and after another wash-out period of 1 week, patients were switched to 25 mg HCTZ, once daily, and vice versa. Whole blood viscosity (BV) at three different shear stresses, haematocrit (Hct), plasma viscosity (PV), red blood cell (RBC) aggregation, RBC deformability, and fibrinogen were measured under standardized conditions 2.5 h after medication, and after 2 week of treatment (24 h post-dosing). Felodipine ER improved BV acutely, but not during treatment over a 2-week period. By contrast, HCTZ did not affect BV, but decreased RBC deformability 2.5 h after medication intake. After 2 weeks of treatment, the negative effect on RBC deformability had increased slightly. Furthermore, fibrinogen and PV were significantly elevated at this stage. In summary, felodipine ER did not improve blood rheology over a 2-week treatment period in this study. HCTZ exhibited marginal but significant negative effects on fibrinogen, PV and indices of RBC deformability, but not on RBC aggregation. 
Effect of hemoglobin concentration on maximal O2 uptake in canine gastrocnemius muscle in situ. O2 delivery to maximally working muscle was decreased by altering hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and arterial PO2 (PaO2) to investigate whether the reductions in maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) that occur with lowered [Hb] are in part related to changes in the effective muscle O2 diffusing capacity (DmO2). Two sets of experiments were conducted. In the initial set (n = 8), three levels of Hb [5.8 +/- 0.3, 9.4 +/- 0.1, and 14.4 +/- 0.6 (SE) g/100 ml] in the blood were used in random order to pump perfuse, at equal muscle blood flows and PaO2, maximally working isolated dog gastrocnemius muscle. VO2max declined with decreasing [Hb], but the relationship between VO2max and both the effluent venous PO2 (PvO2) and the calculated mean capillary PO2 (PcO2) was not linear through the origin and, therefore, not compatible with a single value of DmO2 (as calculated by Bohr integration using a model based on Fick's law of diffusion). To clarify these results, a second set of experiments (n = 6) was conducted in which two levels of Hb (14.0 +/- 0.6 and 6.9 +/- 0.6 g/100 ml) were each combined with two levels of oxygenation (PaO2 79 +/- 8 and 29 +/- 2 Torr) and applied in random sequence to again pump perfuse maximally working dog gastrocnemius muscle at constant blood flow. In these experiments, the relationship between VO2max and both PvO2 and calculated PcO2 for each [Hb] was consistent with a constant estimate of DmO2 as PaO2 was reduced, but the calculated DmO2 for the lower [Hb] was 33% less than that at the higher [Hb] (P less than 0.05). 
Group-specific serum antibody responses in children with primary and recurrent respiratory syncytial virus infections. Antigenic group-specific serum antibody responses to first and second respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections were studied in children who had been followed longitudinally from early infancy in a research day-care center. Plaque-reduction neutralizing (PRN) antibody assays and ELISAs for the fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins were done using antigens of prototype RSV strains from groups A and B. Responses to antigens of viruses homologous and heterologous to the antigenic group of the infecting viral strain were compared. Primary group A infection elicited antibodies cross-reactive with group B virus in the PRNB and the ELISAS for GB and FB. In contrast, primary group B infection induced significant increases in mean concentrations of antibody cross-reactive with group A virus only in the FA ELISA. Second RSV infections caused by group B viruses in children with histories of primary group A infection induced heterologous rises in the PRNA and GA assays, suggesting that prior group A infection had primed for a more extensive cross-reacting antibody response at the time of second RSV infections with group B viruses. 
Evaluation of restenosis after balloon dilatation in adult aortic stenosis by repeat catheterization. To evaluate the restenosis rate after successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty, clinical evaluation and repeat catheterization were performed in 96 patients who had undergone balloon dilatation 7 +/- 5 months earlier. Restenosis, defined as a loss of greater than 50% of the benefit in aortic valve area obtained after balloon valvuloplasty, was observed in 48% of the patients. Actuarial analysis showed that the restenosis rate was time dependent and was 80% at 15 months. However, functional improvement was observed in most of the patients with or without restenosis. The restenosis rate was not correlated with the degree of enlargement of the aortic orifice produced by the valvuloplasty procedure. Because of the high incidence of restenosis, balloon aortic valvuloplasty should be limited to patients who have a contraindication to surgery or are at high risk for surgery, or as a bridge to surgery. 
Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in morbidly obese patients. Twenty-seven morbidly obese patients (13 men and 14 women) with body mass index greater than or equal to 40 kg m-2 were examined. The mean age of the subjects was 36.9 +/- 8.2 years (range 23-51 years), and the mean BMI was 50.2 +/- 6.2 kg m-2 (range 40.0-62.9 kg m-2). A whole-night sleep recording was made for all patients with signs or symptoms indicative of possible obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). If the first nocturnal sleep recording was abnormal, it was controlled after 1 year. Eleven (10 men and one woman) of the 27 patients had an oxygen desaturation index (ODI) of 10 h-1. They were symptomatic with excessive daytime sleepiness or other daytime symptoms of OSAS. The occurrence of OSAS in men and women was 76.9 and 7.1%, respectively. Arterial hypertension was associated with OSAS, but not with smoking or the degree of obesity. Antihypertensive treatment was received by nine of the 27 patients; six of them had OSAS. Thus six of the 11 (54.5%) patients with OSAS and three of the 16 (18.8%) nonapnoeic patients were treated for arterial hypertension (Fisher exact test, P = 0.042). The odds ratio of OSAS for arterial hypertension is 5.2 (95% CI, 0.71-43.6). Vertical-banded gastroplasty was performed in 14 patients, three of whom had OSAS. The selection of patients for gastroplasty was made without taking into account the results of sleep recordings. In the three OSAS patients, a 30-38% reduction in BMI was achieved by surgery. Eight patients with OSAS were treated with an intensified dietary regimen, and the reduction in BMI ranged from -2.6 to 33%. OSAS was either cured or significantly improved in six (55%) patients, with a mean reduction in BMI of 27%, while in patients with persistent OSAS the mean reduction in BMI was only 7%. 
Ultrasonographical investigation of periportal fibrosis in children with Schistosoma mansoni infection: reversibility of morbidity seven months after treatment with praziquantel. Five hundred thirty six Sudanese schoolchildren with Schistosoma mansoni infection were treated at random with either 20 mg or 40 mg/kg praziquantel. Seven months later 420 children could be reinvestigated by ultrasonography. Reduction of egg excretion and reversibility of sonographically-proven periportal fibrosis (PF) was not significantly different in the two groups. Schistosoma mansoni-induced PF grade II decreased from 22.9% to 6.7% and grade III from 5.2% to 1.6%. An increased prevalence of PF grade I, from 10% to 29.8% of the investigated patients, was observed. This increase was caused partly by a downshifting of patients who had PF II (n = 45) and PF III (n = 8) before therapy, but also by patients who developed PF I in the seven months after therapy (n = 56). The overall percentage of patients with PF before and after treatment was 38.1%. Of 420 children, 17.4% increased in their PF grade, 55% remained at the same level and 27.6% improved. Children younger than 11 years of age had a higher rate of complete reversibility than older ones. The percentage of patients with hepatomegaly decreased significantly (11.6% to 6.9%; p = 0.001). The rate of splenomegaly remained unchanged. It was concluded that within seven months therapy with praziquantel resulted in a considerable qualitative improvement of PF in Sudanese schoolchildren with S. mansoni infection. 
Cimetidine and ranitidine may not cross-react to cause thrombocytopenia. We report the case of a patient with peptic ulcer disease who developed cimetidine-induced thrombocytopenia. The thrombocytopenia resolved spontaneously following discontinuation of cimetidine, and did not recur with ranitidine. We concluded that cimetidine and ranitidine do not necessarily cross-react to induce thrombocytopenia. Thus the exclusion of both H2-blockers in the event that one has caused thrombocytopenia may not be justified. 
Lack of association between neutropenia and the incidence of bacteremia associated with indwelling central venous catheters in febrile pediatric cancer patients. To assess the incidence of bacteremia in pediatric cancer patients with indwelling central venous catheters with fever, we reviewed the records of all 67 such patients sequentially admitted during a 10-month period at our institution. There were a total of 140 episodes of fever in these 67 patients. In 55 of the episodes (39%) patients were nonneutropenic (absolute neutrophil count, greater than 500/mm3); 85 episodes (61%) were associated with neutropenia. Twenty-four percent of all episodes of fever in nonneutropenic patients were related to bacteremia vs. 9.5% of episodes of fever in the presence of neutropenia (P less than 0.05). When clinical evidence of an exit site infection was absent, the incidence of bacteremia in the neutropenic and nonneutropenic groups was similar (11% in the neutropenic group; 10% in the nonneutropenic group). We conclude that bacteremia is frequently observed in febrile pediatric cancer patients with indwelling venous catheters who are not neutropenic, particularly if there is clinical evidence of an exit site infection. Thus empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted in all pediatric oncology patients with indwelling catheters who develop fever. 
Arterial hemodynamics in human hypertension. Effects of adrenergic blockade. BACKGROUND. Resistance, pulse wave velocity, and wave reflections have been shown to be increased in patients with essential hypertension compared with normotensive controls. These alterations are completely normalized by nitroprusside infusion but exacerbated during beta-adrenergic blockade, suggesting an enhanced smooth muscle tone that is in part modulated by adrenergically mediated vasodilation. The present study was performed to examine the extent to which this apparently enhanced smooth muscle tone is a result of alpha-adrenergically mediated vasoconstriction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Age-matched normotensive and hypertensive Chinese subjects were instrumented with catheter-tipped micromanometers and an electromagnetic flow velocity sensor positioned in the ascending aorta. Aortic impedance and wave reflection properties were obtained from Fourier analysis of the pressure and flow signals during baseline conditions, after beta-blockade with propranolol (0.15 mg/kg i.v.), and after alpha-blockade with intravenous phentolamine (range, 15-80 mg) that was sufficient to either normalize blood pressure or produce a pressure that could not be further lowered. Compared with normotensives, in the baseline state, hypertensives had elevated resistance (1,962 versus 1,268 dyne.sec/cm5, p less than 0.001), total power (1,893 versus 1,568 mW, p less than 0.08), reflected pressure wave component (25.6 versus 13.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), ratio of reflected to forward wave (0.65 versus 0.42, p less than 0.001), and pulse wave velocity as determined from the frequency of the first zero-crossing of impedance phase angle (4.6 versus 3.5 Hz, p less than 0.03). During combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, blood pressure decreased into the normal range (from 162/103 to 131/87 mm Hg) but was still somewhat higher than that in the normotensive subjects. Resistance (1,914 dyne.sec/cm5, p less than 0.03), reflected wave (19.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and ratio of reflected to forward wave (0.61, p less than 0.001) were, however, persistently elevated above normal values. CONCLUSIONS. alpha-Adrenergically mediated vasoconstriction cannot account for all of the hemodynamic alterations seen in essential hypertension. 
Relationship between glucose tolerance and quantitative changes of islet cells in chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer. This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between indicators of preoperative glucose tolerance and quantitative changes of endocrine cells in the islet of Langerhans in patients with chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer. Twenty-one specimens of pancreatic tissue obtained from patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy for pancreatoduodenal cancer were divided into four groups according to the degree of fibrosis (Grades 0-III). Islet cells in serial sections were stained immunohistochemically to determine the proportions of B-, A-, D-, and PP-cells in the islets of Langerhans. In patients with pancreatic tissue with the most severe fibrosis, of several preoperative glucose metabolism indices measured, it was found that the ratio of integrated value of change in serum insulin to that of serum glucose (sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS) was significantly decreased. There was a significant positive correlation between proportion of B-cells, and both the ratio of change in insulin to that of glucose (delta IRI:delta BS) and sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS. On the other hand, there was a significant negative correlation between proportion of A-cells and sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS. The present data strongly suggest that it is possible to estimate the degree of fibrosis and to quantify changes of the islet cells prior to surgery in patients with obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer by calculating these glucose metabolism indices, and that sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS is a particularly useful index. 
Pathophysiological basis for noninvasive functional evaluation of coronary stenosis. A number of tests are used for the noninvasive detection of coronary stenosis, which results from the combination of different stimuli (exercise, pacing, dobutamine, dipyridamole, etc.) and different signals and methodologies (ECG, echocardiography, scintigraphy). In this article, the theoretical assumptions for and the methodological limitations of the functional evaluation of the degree of coronary stenosis are considered within the framework of pathophysiology. In particular, the issues of dilating coronary circulation by either increasing myocardial O2 demand or infusing dipyridamole and of assessing coronary reserve by either flow- or ischemia-related techniques are examined. In addition, the hypotheses of a physiological blood steal during exercise, a decrement of exercise ischemic threshold secondary to additional pharmacological vasodilation, and coronary vasospasm in Prinzmetal's angina patients, following the sequence dipyridamole-aminophylline, are discussed on the basis of preliminary studies. 
Nutritional consequences of major gastrointestinal surgery. Patient outcome and starvation. Advances in major gastrointestinal surgery and the existence of a significant number of high-risk patients necessitate a detailed knowledge of the metabolic response to surgery and the need for adjunctive nutritional therapy. Such surgery has the potential to cause significant nutritional consequences affecting patient outcome. Often, patients present malnourished preoperatively because of their chronic gastrointestinal disease, advanced age, or comorbidity. Still others are at great risk for developing malnutrition postoperatively secondary to the hypercatabolism of prolonged illness or postoperative complications. In addition, the surgical alterations of the gastrointestinal tract might disrupt normal function sufficiently to result in chronic nutritional deficiencies. Because starvation is no longer an acceptable condition, these concerns need to be recognized prior to surgery, and if indicated, nutritional support must be initiated preoperatively. Placement of feeding jejunostomy catheters for early enteral support should be considered for all high-risk patients. Equally important, surgeons should maintain a watch for future nutritional innovations that will improve their ability to meet patients' nutritional requirements. 
Mutations in the precore region of hepatitis B virus DNA in patients with fulminant and severe hepatitis BACKGROUND. The presence of the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in serum is known to be a marker of a high degree of viral infectivity. However, fulminant hepatitis may occur in persons who are negative for HBeAg. A single point mutation has been reported to produce a stop codon in the precore region of hepatitis B virus DNA and prevent the formation of the precore protein required to make HBeAg. To determine whether a precore-mutant virus is causally related to severe liver injury, we analyzed the entire precore region in viral strains isolated from patients with fatal cases and uncomplicated cases of hepatitis B. METHODS. Serum was obtained from 9 patients with fatal hepatitis B (5 with fulminant and 4 with severe exacerbations of chronic hepatitis) and 10 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. Serum samples from a sex partner implicated as the source of the virus in one case of fulminant hepatitis were also studied. The 87 nucleotides in the precore region of the hepatitis B virus were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and then directly sequenced. RESULTS. Of the nine patients with fatal hepatitis, seven had retrievable hepatitis B DNA. In all seven there was a point mutation from G to A at nucleotide 1896 of the precore region, converting tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG). In contrast, this mutation was not found in the 10 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. The hepatitis B DNA from the implicated source contained a sequence with the stop-codon mutation that was identical to the sequence in her partner, who had fulminant hepatitis. CONCLUSIONS. The presence of a mutant viral strain is associated with and may be involved in the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis B and severe exacerbations of chronic hepatitis B. 
Assessment of severity of coronary narrowings by quantitative exercise echocardiography and comparison with quantitative arteriography. To determine the correlation of quantitative assessment of coronary narrowings with left ventricular functional impairment induced by exercise, 57 patients with 1-vessel coronary artery disease and without evidence of collateral flow were studied. A significant relation was observed between minimal cross-sectional area, percent area stenosis, minimal lumen diameter, percent diameter stenosis and the percentage of segmental area change from rest to peak exercise in a vascular distribution territory (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001; r = -0.55, p less than 0.001; r = 0.56, p less than 0.001; r = -0.75, p less than 0.001, respectively). For minimal cross-sectional area, the best cut-off value to separate significantly patients who had a decrease in contractility at peak exercise testing from those who had a normal response was 2 mm2 (p less than 0.001); for percent cross-sectional area stenosis, it was 75% (p less than 0.001); for minimal lumen diameter, it was 0.7 mm (p less than 0.001); and, for percent diameter stenosis, it was 85% (p less than 0.001). High cut-off values for angiographic variables are necessary to separate significantly patients who have a decrease in contractility at peak exercise testing from those who have a normal response. Several patients with mild coronary stenoses may have either normal or abnormal wall motion during exercise. Thus, exercise echocardiography is a useful tool in detecting the presence of fairly severe anatomic narrowing, whereas it is of limited clinical use in the assessment of intermediate coronary atherosclerotic lesions. 
The assessment of visuo-spatial neglect after acute stroke. Forty four consecutive patients with acute hemispheric stroke and forty seven elderly controls with no neurological disease were assessed for visuo-spatial neglect, using a modified neglect test battery. Neglect was found to be equally common in patients with right hemisphere and left hemisphere stroke three days after stroke (72% versus 62%). It was more severe in those with a right hemisphere stroke and resolved more frequently in those with a left hemisphere stroke. The battery was validated against an occupational therapist's assessment of neglect on self-care tasks. The inter-observer reliability was good and it was possible to monitor changes over time with the battery. 
Muscle hypertrophy response to resistance training in older women. We conducted a 12-wk resistance training program in elderly women [mean age 69 +/- 1.0 (SE) yr] to determine whether increases in muscle strength are associated with changes in cross-sectional fiber area of the vastus lateralis muscle. Twenty-seven healthy women were randomly assigned to either a control or exercise group. The program was satisfactorily completed and adequate biopsy material obtained from 6 controls and 13 exercisers. After initial testing of baseline maximal strength, exercisers began a training regimen consisting of seven exercises that stressed primary muscle groups of the lower extremities. No active intervention was prescribed for the controls. Increases in muscle strength of the exercising subjects were significant compared with baseline values (28-115%) in all muscle groups. No significant strength changes were observed in the controls. Cross-sectional area of type II muscle fibers significantly increased in the exercisers (20.1 +/- 6.8%, P = 0.02) compared with baseline. In contrast, no significant change in type II fiber area was observed in the controls. No significant changes in type I fiber area were found in either group. We conclude that a program of resistance exercise can be safely carried out by elderly women, such a program significantly increases muscle strength, and such gains are due, at least in part, to muscle hypertrophy. 
Intraoral reconstruction with a microvascular peritoneal flap. The microvascular peritoneal flap offers a new reconstructive option for closure of intraoral defects. The flap is easy to raise, and donor-site morbidity is low. Unlike fascial flaps, in which the raw surface may take weeks to "mucosalize," the peritoneal surface heals primarily. Finally, the rectus muscle effectively covers all forms of mandibular reconstruction, and the reliable skin paddle makes possible the closure of substantial cutaneous defects. 
Cerebral vasospasm in elderly patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Cerebral vasospasm in elderly patients who were operated on the acute stage after subarachnoid hemorrhage was studied under strict criteria. The 138 patients were classified into three age groups: 59 years or younger (group A: 73 cases), 60 to 69 years (group B: 37 cases), and 70 years or older (group C: 28 cases). Severity of both the subarachnoid hemorrhages on computed tomography scan and the angiographic vasospasms was graded. The angiographic vasospasms were analyzed at the internal carotid artery, M1 segments of the middle cerebral artery, and A2 segments of the anterior cerebral. In all the relationships among the subarachnoid hemorrhage grades, the Hounsfield numbers, and the operative approaches to the angiographic vasospasm grade, there was a tendency for the angiographic vasospasm grades to be lower with increasing age in both the internal carotid artery and the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery. This tendency was more apparent in the larger vessels, that is, the internal carotid arteries. Close correlations of the angiographic vasospasm grades to the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and to low-density area on computed tomography scan were found in both the M1 and A2 territories in the three groups. However, there were no significant differences among the three groups in the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and low-density area on computed tomography scan. Regarding the surgical outcome, the older the patients, the higher were the mortality rates: 8% in group A, 11% in group B, and 25% in group C. 
Blockade of endogenous anterior hypothalamic atrial natriuretic peptide with monoclonal antibody lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. We have previously shown that the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) content of the anterior hypothalamic region of NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) is higher than that of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. ANP has been shown to inhibit neuronal norepinephrine release and to reduce the excitability of hypothalamic neurons. This study tested the hypothesis that blockade of endogenous ANP in the anterior hypothalamus by local microinjection of a monoclonal antibody to ANP (MAb KY-ANP-II) lowers blood pressure in SHR-S. Purified MAb KY-ANP-II (0.055 and 0.55 micrograms) or control mouse IgG in 200 nl saline was microinjected into the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) of conscious SHR-S and control WKY rats. As a further control, Mab KY-ANP-II (0.55 microgram) was microinjected into the posterior hypothalamic area (PHA) of SHR-S. Anterior hypothalamic microinjection of MAb KY-ANP-II caused significant dose-related decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in SHR-S but not in WKY rats. Control injections of equal volumes of IgG had no effect on MAP or HR. Microinjection of Mab KY-ANP-II into PHA produced no significant alteration in MAP or HR in SHR-S. These data provide the first demonstration that endogenous ANP in a region of brain known to influence cardiovascular function mediates BP and HR control in the rat. These findings suggest that the increased endogenous ANP in the anterior hypothalamus of SHR-S may be involved in the central regulation of BP in the model. 
Blood loss in total knee arthroplasty. Over a two-year period, 112 consecutive primary total knee arthroplasties (TKA) were performed according to a standard protocol and were evaluated to determine the effects of intraoperative tourniquet deflation, suction drainage, and immediate continuous passive motion (CPM) on blood loss and the need for blood transfusions. It has been reported that these measures lead to increased morbidity following TKA. The tourniquet was deflated before closure, hemostasis was obtained, and two suction drains were placed for 24 to 48 hours. CPM was started immediately, and continued for a mean of seven days. Serial hematocrits (Hct) were obtained. Mean age of the 64 males and 48 females was 65 years. The diagnosis was osteoarthritis in 86% and rheumatoid arthritis in 14%. Seventy-three percent of the prostheses were cemented and 27% were uncemented. The mean tourniquet time was 104 minutes and the mean length of surgery was 140 minutes. Blood loss measured at surgery averaged 222 ml. Total calculated blood loss averaged 794 ml, but was higher for patients with a cemented versus uncemented prosthesis (p less than .05), and males versus females (p less than .005). It was not related to diagnosis, tourniquet time, or length of surgery. Of the 38% of patients requiring a transfusion (mean, 2.2 units), there was not a significantly greater drop in Hct (from 36.6 to 26.5; change, 10.1) when compared to patients not receiving a transfusion (from 43.1 to 32.5; change, 10.6). Therefore, the need for transfusion was related to preoperative Hct and not the intraoperative or postoperative blood loss. 
Successful surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. Review and clinical update Atrial fibrillation is the most common of all sustained cardiac arrhythmias, yet it has no effective medical or surgical therapy. During the past decade, multipoint computerized electrophysiological mapping systems were used to map both experimental and human atrial fibrillation. On the basis of these studies, a new surgical procedure was developed for atrial fibrillation. Between September 25, 1987, and July 1, 1991, this procedure was applied in 22 patients with paroxysmal atrial flutter (n = 2), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (n = 11), or chronic atrial fibrillation (n = 9) of 2 to 21 years' duration. All patients were refractory to all antiarrhythmic medications, and each patient failed to receive the desired therapeutic benefits of an average of five drugs administered preoperatively. There were no operative deaths and all perioperative morbidity resolved. All 22 patients have been successfully treated for atrial fibrillation with surgery alone. Three patients developed one late isolated episode of atrial flutter at 5, 6, and 15 months postoperatively, and each of these patient's symptoms is now controlled by a single antiarrhythmic drug. Preservation of atrial transport function has been documented in all patients postoperatively, and all have experienced marked clinical improvement. 
Cyst of the ligamentum flavum: report of six cases. Six cases of cyst of the ligamentum flavum with compression of a lumbar nerve root are reported. All patients exhibited recurrent back pain and sciatica. Investigation included computed tomography, myelography, or both. The correct diagnosis was reached before operation in only half the patients. High-resolution computed tomography performed in the four last patients outlined the cystic lesion with its low-density center. Surgical excision was performed in all patients. Microscopic examination showed a dense fibrous cyst arising from the ligamentum flavum. The lumen contained myxoid or necrotic material, but no epithelial lining. Cysts of the ligamentum flavum must be considered in the differential diagnosis of causes of sciatica. A firm radiological diagnosis may, at present, still require myelography combined with high-resolution computed tomography. Differentiation from synovial or ganglion cysts of the spine is discussed. 
Vestibular compensation after labyrinthectomy and vestibular neurectomy in cats. Labyrinthectomy and vestibular neurectomy are two ablative procedures used for definitive control of disabling vertigo. It is not known if vestibular compensation after labyrinthectomy and vestibular neurectomy differs. We have addressed this question by examining the pattern of recovery of the vestibular ocular reflex in cats after either labyrinthectomy or vestibular neurectomy. Temporal bone histologic examination confirmed the surgical lesion. Our results demonstrate a reduction of the long time constant of the vestibular ocular reflex in both groups of animals. Although gain of the vestibular ocular reflex recovered substantially, it never returned to control levels in either group. In general, animals that had undergone vestibular neurectomy demonstrated greater vestibular ocular reflex asymmetries than did labyrinthectomized animals. The recovery pattern of the vestibular ocular reflex indicates vestibular compensation is more rapid after labyrinthectomy than after vestibular neurectomy. We believe this result is related to survival of the vestibular nerve after labyrinthectomy, but not after vestibular neurectomy, suggesting that the vestibular nerve can contribute to the adaptive response after labyrinthectomy. 
The outcome of prostatectomy on chronic retention of urine. A total of 68 men with bladder outflow obstruction and chronic retention (residual urine greater than 300 ml.) underwent investigation before and after prostatectomy with medium fill cystometry and natural fill long-term bladder pressure monitoring. Postoperatively, upper tract dilatation (present in 28 men preoperatively) resolved in all but 2 men and serum creatinine levels improved significantly. Irritative and obstructive symptom scores improved postoperatively (p less than 0.00006), although 17% of the men still had significant symptoms. Residual urine volumes decreased and flow rates improved (p less than 0.00006) but 32% of the men still had a residual urine of greater than 200 ml. Urodynamic parameters improved during medium fill cystometry and long-term monitoring. The main risk factors for upper tract dilatation are a pressure increase during bladder filling on conventional cystometry and the frequency of phasic detrusor activity during long-term monitoring, and they decreased postoperatively. 
Fibrinopeptide A excretion in urine: a marker of the cumulative thrombin activity in stable versus unstable angina patients. Plasma levels and 24-hour urine excretion of fibrinopeptide A were measured in a consecutive series of 179 patients with angina pectoris. Sixty-four patients had stable angina and 115 patients had unstable angina. Urine was collected over 24 hours the day before coronary arteriography, and blood samples were taken at the end of urine collection. When the values of fibrinopeptide A in plasma and in the 24-hour urine specimens were compared, no significant correlation was found in patients with either stable (rs = 0.16, difference not significant) and unstable (rs = 0.07, difference not significant) angina. The concentrations of fibrinopeptide A in the plasma did not differ significantly when patients with stable angina (range 0.1 to 82.6, median 7.4 ng/mL) were compared with patients with unstable angina (range 0.2 to 61.7, median 14 ng/mL, p = 0.055), whereas fibrinopeptide A 24-hour urinary excretion was significantly higher in patients with unstable angina (range 0.3 to 38.1, median 11.8 micrograms/24 hr) than in patients with stable angina (range 0.4 to 38.1, median 3.8 micrograms/24 hr, p less than 0.001). Twenty-four-hour urine excretion of fibrinopeptide A in patients with unstable angina and angiographically documented intracoronary thrombi were higher than the corresponding values in patients with unstable angina without such angiographic characteristic (p less than 0.001). The largest increase in plasma and urine concentration of fibrinopeptide A was observed in patients whose first episode of angina at rest occurred within the previous 48 hours. We conclude that the cumulative thrombin activity, assessed by 24-hour urinary excretion of fibrinopeptide A, is a more useful index, compared with single fibrinopeptide A measurement in plasma, for discriminating between patients with stable and with unstable angina pectoris. 
Evidence for a central but not a peripheral analgesic effect of clomipramine in rats. The effect of clomipramine (CMI), a tricyclic antidepressant, was studied on an acute inflammatory pain model in an attempt to understand its potential antinociceptive activity, the involvement of a central and/or peripheral component and its influence on the inflammatory process. When administered (i.v.) before the inflammatory agent, carrageenan (CAR), CMI (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) completely prevented the development of the hyperalgesia for 70-120 min according to the doses. This antinociceptive effect was suppressed by naloxone (100 micrograms/kg i.v.) for 65 min. Neither higher doses (1, 2 and 20 mg/kg, i.v.) nor CMI injected into the inflamed paw (15 min before CAR) modified pain thresholds. Moreover, CMI (0.5 and 2 mg/kg, i.v.) administered 15 min before CAR markedly increased the volume of the CAR-induced oedema. These results (1) demonstrate an opioid-dependent antinociceptive effect of CMI on this model, the doses used being lower than those active in thermal or electrical tests, and (2) tend to exclude a peripheral mechanism and an NSAID-like anti-inflammatory activity suggested by previous in vitro studies. 
Perfusion redistribution after alveolar flooding: vasoconstriction vs. vascular compression. We compared the effects of left caudal lobe (LCL) alveolar hypoxia on regional pulmonary blood flow (PBF) with the effects due to alveolar edema induced by plasma instilled directly into the LCL airways of 16 dogs. Regional measurements were made with positron emission tomography. After hypoxic ventilation of the LCL (n = 11), the LCL-to-right caudal lobe (L/R) PBF ratio fell from 0.94 +/- 0.21 during 100% oxygen ventilation of the LCL to 0.46 +/- 0.21 (P less than 0.05). After instillation of either isooncotic (n = 5) or hypooncotic plasma (n = 3) into the LCL, the L/R PBF ratio was similar to that during LCL hypoxia (0.50 +/- 0.27 and 0.64 +/- 0.10, respectively, P less than 0.05 compared with 100% oxygen ventilation of the LCL before plasma instillation). The changes in regional PBF due to LCL hypoxia and plasma instillation could be completely prevented (n = 8) by the prior administration of a single dose of endotoxin (15 micrograms/kg iv). In contrast to previous work, these results indicate that perfusion redistribution occurs regardless of the oncotic state of alveolar edema. More importantly, any change that does occur in regional PBF can be completely prevented by blocking regional vasoconstriction, indicating that mechanical compression cannot be the major factor determining the regional response of PBF to alveolar flooding. 
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty utilizing prolonged balloon inflations: initial results and six-month follow-up. Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) using prolonged balloon inflation has obviated emergency coronary bypass surgery in some patients with acute occlusions at the time of PTCA. However, the use of prolonged balloon inflations has not been shown to improve long-term restenosis rates. As an alternative to the passive autoperfusion catheter, we evaluated a hemoperfusion system in which blood was obtained from the side arm of an arterial sheath and infused through the central lumen of standard balloon catheters via a modified Medrad IV pump during balloon inflation. PTCA was performed in 71 male patients (median age 57 yr). The median balloon inflation time was 4.8 minutes and the median rate of blood perfusion was 30 ml/min. PTCA was successful (lumen increase by 20 percentage points) in 83% of patients (59/71) with diameter stenosis decreasing from a median 82% to 30%. Emergency coronary bypass was required in four patients (5%). Angiographic data for six-month followup was available on 37 patients. The restenosis rate (loss of 50% of gain) was 46% (17/37). The conclusion is that prolonged balloon inflation angioplasty has a role in complicated PTCA but offers no advantage in improving long-term restenosis rates in elective PTCA. 
The relation of dizziness to functional decline. OBJECTIVE: to assess the effect of dizziness on the probability that an older person will die or become functionally disabled within 2 years. Dizziness is a common symptom for which the prognosis is uncertain. This report compares the prognoses for dizzy and not-dizzy older people in order to assist clinicians who diagnose and treat these patients. DESIGN: a prospective study of a representative sample of elderly (70+) non-institutionalized Americans. Elderly subjects (n = 3,798) in the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) were asked questions about the presence of dizziness, medical conditions, and functional disability in 1984. The cohort was reinterviewed about functional disability in 1986. OUTCOME MEASURE: transition from functional ability to disability after 2 years. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed that dizziness predicts functional decline but not mortality. Multivariate models revealed that age, race, sensory impairment, vascular disease, and other morbidity are independent predictors of becoming disabled. Controlling for these potential confounders, dizziness does not predict an increased probability of becoming disabled. CONCLUSION: Elderly people who are dizzy should be evaluated for the presence of these related conditions. 
Relation between myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor and left ventricular function in patients with left ventricular volume overload due to chronic mitral regurgitation with or without aortic regurgitation. The relation between myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor and left ventricular (LV) function was studied in 10 patients, aged 41 to 61 years (average 51), with LV volume overload mainly due to chronic mitral regurgitation. Beta-adrenergic receptors were examined using crude membrane in LV papillary muscle obtained at mitral valve replacement. Cardiac function was evaluated at preoperative cardiac catheterization with the interval to surgery of 1 to 33 months (average 7). Beta-adrenergic receptor density in 7 patients with New York Heart Association class II or III congestive heart failure was higher than that in 3 patients with class IV heart failure (59 +/- 19 vs 37 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05). Beta-adrenergic receptor density showed a positive correlation with end-systolic stress/end-systolic volume index ratio, the index for contractile function (p less than 0.005). Other parameters such as cardiac index, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and LV ejection fraction had no significant correlation to beta-adrenergic receptor. The results demonstrated that increases in symptom and LV dysfunction, particularly of the contractile state, was associated with decreased myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density from possible down-regulation in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation with or without aortic regurgitation. 
Use of a rapid, efficient inoculation method to induce papillomas by cottontail rabbit papillomavirus DNA shows that the E7 gene is required. A simple inoculation method to induce papillomas efficiently with cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) DNA is described. Using a jet injector, recombinant CRPV DNA is easily delivered to 100 or more sites per rabbit and induces typical epithelial papillomas in approximately 50% of those sites. Papillomas begin to form by 3 weeks and continue to develop for up to 7 weeks, a pattern similar to that reported following infection with intact virus. This system readily lends itself to investigation of viral gene function by delivering mutant viral genomes into an immunologically intact host. Two mutations in the E7 open reading frame were introduced into the complete CRPV genome and analyzed by this method. One was a frameshift mutation encoding just nine amino-terminal amino acids of the E7 protein; the other was an in-frame insertion mutation at position 9. Both E7 mutations were in a region of homology to the 300-kDa protein binding domain of adenovirus E1A protein. Neither mutant construct was able to induce papillomas, thereby demonstrating that the E7 gene participates in this biologic function. Exploitation of this approach, which demonstrates that a papillomavirus E7 gene is involved in the induction of papillomas in vivo, should permit detailed studies into molecular mechanisms involved in papilloma induction, malignant conversion, and host immune response. The high efficiency of papilloma induction with recombinant CRPV DNA suggests that the jet injector can also be used to study the biologic effects of other genetic elements in rabbits or in other species. 
Human hepatocyte growth factor in blood of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Basic aspects. Human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) was purified from the plasma of six patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to hepatitis B in two and non-A, non-B hepatitis in four. The purified hHGF from each patient contained two major protein bands having molecular weights of 79,000 and 86,000 and several minor bands having molecular weights between 76,000 and 92,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed under nonreduced conditions. After reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, three major bands having molecular weights of 58,000, 34,500, and 31,500 were evident. In addition, a band having a molecular weight of 21,000 was detected. hHGF activity was destroyed by its reduction. The hHGF purified from patients demonstrated a dose response in terms of an increase in DNA synthesis using cultured hepatocytes. The hHGF concentration in the plasma of the patients with grade III-IV hepatic coma was calculated to be in the range of 1.8-3.0 nM. Finally the heavy chain of hHGF was not recognized by an anti-human albumin antibody, indicating that hHGF is not biliprotein, an albumin-bilirubin complex, that has been reported to be a putative liver growth factor. 
Complement consumption in a patient with necrobiotic xanthogranuloma and paraproteinemia. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma and paraproteinemia have been reported to be associated with acquired deficiency of the early components of the classic pathway of complement. We describe a patient in whom activation of complement was suggested by a high level of C3d, an accelerated catabolism of C1q, and a rapid consumption of C4 after an intravenous infusion of fresh-frozen plasma. This infusion was followed by an episode of pulmonary edema. Patients with complement deficiency or depletion should be monitored closely while receiving plasma, to avoid this potential complication. 
Resectoscopic myomectomy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of resectoscopic myomectomy for control of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and/or reproductive wastage. DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive patient follow-up. SETTING: Private practice, outpatient, hospital. PATIENTS: All patients (92) having resectoscopic myomectomy between September 1, 1986 and December 31, 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Resectoscopic myomectomy with or without concomitant procedures such as endometrial ablation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and reproductive outcome after surgery. RESULTS: Elimination of dysmenorrhea in 24 of 28, absence of menorrhagia in 65 of 80, and pregnancy in 10 of 13 with two abortions in a total of 11 gestations. One patient was admitted and treated with one unit of autologous blood and mechanical tamponade with an intrauterine balloon. Three cases of uterine perforation had no sequelae. One patient had mild endometritis responding to outpatient antibiotics. Two cases of leiomyosarcoma were diagnosed histologically and accounted for two of the three hysterectomies noted during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Resectoscopic myomectomy is a safe, effective, and relatively simple outpatient surgical procedure. 
Idarubicin: a second-generation anthracycline. Because of its in vitro activity in leukemic cell lines and Phase I studies of acute leukemia, Phase II and III clinical trials with idarubicin hydrochloride were conducted in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. In the Phase III comparative trials between the combinations of idarubicin and cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride and cytarabine, the idarubicin/cytarabine combination resulted in significantly greater complete remission rates and longer overall survival in two of three studies conducted in the US. As a result, the Food and Drug Administration approved intravenous idarubicin with a Class 1A rating in September 1990 for use in combination with other antileukemic drugs (e.g., cytarabine) for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia in adults. The recommended dose of idarubicin is 12 mg/m2 daily for three days by slow intravenous injection in combination with cytarabine. Although idarubicin causes myelosuppression similar to that described with daunorubicin, the incidence of cardiotoxicity in animal models is lower. Idarubicin also has the advantage of oral administration, but the oral formulation of the drug remains investigational. The use of idarubicin in pediatric patients also remains to be established. 
Fat-saturation MR imaging of the upper abdomen. The fat-saturation (fatsat) MR technique decreases the signal intensity of fat, thereby enhancing the definition of upper abdominal organs and reducing artifacts while maintaining the T1 and T2 information available on spin-echo sequences. To evaluate the potential of fatsat in examining the abdomen, we conducted a prospective study involving 30 subjects, including four normal volunteers, 18 patients investigated for liver disease, and eight patients studied for miscellaneous abdominal disease. Short TR, 300-600/15-20 (TR/TE), and long TR, 2000-2500/20-30, 70-80, spin-echo images with and without fatsat were compared. The images were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative assessment was made with receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the confidence level of observers to detect the presence of disease, comparing fatsat with standard spin-echo sequences. ROC analysis showed greater interpreter confidence and accuracy for fatsat sequences than for standard spin-echo sequences. The measured signal-difference-to-noise (SD/N) ratio comparing upper abdominal organs with surrounding tissue revealed the highest values for short TR/TE regular spin echo, followed by short TR/TE fatsat. The highest SD/N ratio for hepatic masses was with long TR/TE fatsat followed by short TR/TE fatsat. The results of this study suggest that the fatsat technique may improve abdominal MR imaging. 
Pediatric cardiac rehabilitation. Sixteen patients participated in a Pediatric/Young Adult Cardiac Rehabilitation Program that included exercise training, education about cardiovascular diseases, dietary counseling, and counseling on stress management. Seven patients completed the program, and complete data were available on six. The subjects demonstrated significant changes in their hemodynamics and exercise tolerance after completing the program. Resting blood pressure decreased by 7%, from 119 +/- 12 to 111 +/- 10 mm Hg; peak oxygen consumption increased by 20%, from 31.9 +/- 4.3 mL/kg of body weight per minute to 38.4 +/- 6.0 mL/kg of body weight per minute; and exercise treadmill time increased by 21%, from 8.5 +/- 1.4 to 10.3 +/- 1.0 minutes. No complications occurred during exercise training or testing. Supervised exercise training at moderate intensity is safe and produces significant and beneficial changes in hemodynamics and exercise time in children with cardiac disease. 
Hyperalgesia induced in the rat by the amino-terminal octapeptide of nerve growth factor. Nerve growth factor (NGF) in the mouse submandibular gland undergoes cleavage of its amino-terminal octapeptide when salivation is induced by epinephrine. The significance of this event is uncertain; cleaved NGF demonstrates bioactivity and no function has been attributed to the octapeptide produced (NGF-OP; Ser-Ser-Thr-His-Pro-Val-Phe-His). Enzyme inhibition studies indicating structural relatedness of NGF-OP and bradykinin (BK) prompted us to determine whether NGF-OP would elicit BK-like actions. We found that like BK, NGF-OP induced a decrease in mechanical nociceptive threshold (i.e., produced hyperalgesia) in the hairy skin of the rat. This effect was dose-dependent and sequence-specific; like BK it was attenuated by sympathectomy and indomethacin pretreatment. However, NGF-OP actions appeared to be distinct from those for BK in that tissue injury was required for NGF-OP to induce hyperalgesia. Furthermore, we found no evidence that NGF-OP bound to or activated BK receptors. Our data indicate that NGF-OP is a distinct mediator of hyperalgesia. We suggest that NGF-OP alters pain threshold in the injured target regions of NGF-responsive neurons. 
Chinese medicinal herbs reverse macrophage suppression induced by urological tumors. Tumors are known to produce factors suppressing macrophage function. In this study we demonstrated in vitro suppression of macrophage chemiluminescent oxidative burst associated with viable cells and cell-free extracts of two urological neoplasms--murine renal cell carcinoma (Renca) and murine bladder tumor (MBT). Suppression was reversed by extracts of two Chinese medicinal herbs, Astragalus membranaceus (AM) and Ligustrum lucidum (LL). Murine macrophage cell line J774 was incubated with either the viable tumor cells or the cell-free tumor extract for 18 hours at 37C and 5% CO2. Chemiluminescent oxidative burst as an indicator of macrophage function was triggered by adding zymosan A suspension containing luminol and assayed in an automated luminometer. Photon emission over time was counted and the results were expressed as integrated photon emission. Significant dose-related depression of oxidative burst occurred with either the viable tumor cells or the cell-free tumor extracts. Depression was partially or completely reversed by the presence of 50-100 micrograms./ml. of either the AM or the LL extract. AM and LL have previously been shown to modulate immune response. Data from this study suggest that they may also exert their antitumor activity via abolition of tumor-associated macrophage suppression. 
Effects of DM-9384, a cyclic derivative of GABA, on amnesia and decreases in GABAA and muscarinic receptors induced by cycloheximide. The effects of N-(2,6-dimethyl-phenyl)-2-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)-acetamide [DM-9384], a cyclic derivative of GABA, were investigated in the cycloheximide (CXM)-induced amnesia animal model using the passive avoidance task. Pre- and post-training and pre-retention test administration of DM-9384 attenuated the CXM-induced amnesia as indicated by prolongation of step-down latency. Aniracetam, another cyclic derivative of GABA, also showed antiamnesic effects. Scopolamine, a muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist, and the GABA antagonists, picrotoxin and bicuculline, all antagonized the antiamnesic effects of DM-9384. CXM decreased the number of GABAA and muscarinic ACh receptor binding sites. DM-9384 not only inhibited this effect but actually increased the latter. These results suggest that DM-9384 attenuates CXM-induced amnesia by interacting with GA-BAergic and AChergic neuronal systems and enhancing protein synthesis in the brain. 
Extracellular matrix disruption and pain after eccentric muscle action. Pain, stiffness, and indicators of muscle damage occur at different times after eccentric muscle action. After a single bout of maximal resisted lengthening of the elbow flexors, elbow position, pain perception, and indicators of cellular damage were measured. Immediately postexercise, a significant decrease in resting muscle length was observed that continued to 48 h. At this time, an increase in perceived muscle soreness was noted (P less than 0.05), and a biopsy of the biceps brachii revealed mast cell degranulation, separations of the extracellular matrix from myofibers, and increased plasma constituents in the extracellular space. It is proposed that myofiber disruption allows intracellular proteins to escape and extracellular proteins and ions to enter, causing swelling, whereas the disrupted extracellular matrix initiates the inflammatory response, which includes the release of mast cell granules seen at 48 h postexercise. Thus the delayed sensation of pain (soreness) after repeated eccentric muscle actions probably results from inflammation in response to extracellular matrix disruption. 
Ascitic fluid pH and lactate: insensitive and nonspecific tests in detecting ascitic fluid infection. Ascitic fluid pH and lactate concentration have been proposed as useful tests for the detection of ascitic fluid infection. However, past studies involved small numbers of infected patients, and all did not use optimal culture techniques. This large study was performed using highly sensitive culture methods and sought (a) to compare the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of pH and lactate to that of the ascitic fluid neutrophil count and (b) to determine whether evaluation of ascitic fluid pH or lactate (or arterial-ascitic fluid pH or lactate gradient) would result in improved decision-making regarding empirical treatment of suspected ascitic fluid infection. Analysis of 206 ascitic fluid specimens obtained in 175 patients, including 101 infected specimens, revealed that ascitic fluid (or arterial-ascitic fluid) pH and lactate were less than 50% sensitive in detecting bacterial peritonitis and that these tests did not improve clinical decision-making about empirical treatment of suspected ascitic fluid infection. Although statistically significant differences in ascitic fluid pH were detected between infected samples and control samples, these differences did not appear to be clinically helpful. The ascitic fluid pH was 0% sensitive in detecting the presence of bacteria in the absence of neutrophils (i.e., no such specimens had a pH lower than 7.35). Ascitic fluid pH correlated well with neutrophil count and appears to be, at least in part, an indirect measure of the presence of neutrophils in ascitic fluid. Measurement of pH or lactate (or arterial-ascitic fluid gradients) is not helpful in the clinical management of infected ascitic fluid. 
Stapled ileoanal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis without a temporary diverting ileostomy. Between March 1989 and August 1990, we performed 21 stapled J pouch ileonal procedures (20 ulcerative colitis [UC], 1 familial polyposis [FP]) without an ileostomy in 19, of whom 13 were taking prednisone and eight underwent semi-emergent surgery for uncontrollable bleeding. During the same time, an additional four patients required a standard ileonal procedure. The results of anal manometry and clinical function were compared to 25 patients who had previously undergone mucosal stripping and a sutured J pouch ileoanal anastomoses with a temporary diverting ileostomy between October 1982 and August 1990. During this same time period, an additional 19 patients underwent an anti-peristaltic reversed J pouch and 18 an S pouch, for a total of 83 ileoanal procedures. The reversed J pouch had a lower stool frequency than a standard J pouch but had an unacceptable incidence of complications and problems with pouch emptying. The S pouch had a stool frequency similar to the standard J pouch but provided greater length in patients with a short mesentery. Stapled J pouch ileoanal patients had a better (p less than 0.02) maximum and sphincter resting pressure (46 +/- 11 versus 34 +/- 12 mmHg), fewer (p less than 0.05) night-time accidents (22% versus 68%), daytime (17% versus 55%) or night-time (28 versus 61%) spotting, or use of a protective pad at night (11% versus 42%) than nonstapled J pouch ileoanal patients. Stool frequency was similar in the two groups. All but one UC patient had residual disease at the anastomosis. Anal mucosa between the dentate line and stapled anastomosis was 1.8 +/- 1.3 cm (range, 0 to 3.5 cm). Complications in the nonstapled J pouch group included 4 pouches excised (2 for complications, 2 for excessive stool frequency), 1 pelvic abscess, 2 stenosis requiring dilation under anesthesia, 1 enterocutaneous fistula after ileostomy closure, 1 ileostomy site hernia, and 2 small bowel obstructions. Of the 65 patients who underwent ileostomy closure in the entire series, 8 (12%) developed a complication requiring surgical intervention. Complications in the stapled group included 1 anastomotic leak, 1 pouch leak, and 1 pelvic abscess. Patients were managed successfully with drainage (all 3) and diverting ileostomy (1). One patient developed stenosis requiring dilation under anesthesia. The stapled J pouch ileoanal anastomosis is a simpler, safer procedure with less tension than a standard handsewn J pouch but leaves a very small cuff of residual disease. It provides significantly better stool control and may obviate the need for an ileostomy with its complications. 
Diastolic perfusion time at ischemic threshold in patients with stress-induced ischemia BACKGROUND. To evaluate the relevance of diastolic perfusion time on the mechanisms underlying stress-induced ischemia, 16 patients with coronary artery disease and seven patients with syndrome X underwent five randomized stress tests (upright and supine exercise with and without therapy, transesophageal atrial pacing). METHODS AND RESULTS. Exercise duration Time to 0.1 mV ST segment depression, heart rate, rate-pressure product, and diastolic perfusion time were evaluated for each patient during stress tests. In both groups, variability coefficients of the above-mentioned parameters were not different at rest. At ischemic threshold (0.1 mV ST segment depression) in patients with coronary artery disease, the variability coefficient of exercise duration (40.1 +/- 22.2) was significantly higher (p less than 0.0001) than those of heart rate (12.8 +/- 2.9), rate-pressure product (14.8 +/- 3.3), and diastolic perfusion time (0.39 +/- 0.1). The variability coefficient of diastolic perfusion time was also significantly (p less than 0.0001) lower than those of heart rate and rate-pressure product. Similarly, the variability coefficient of diastolic perfusion time (0.44 +/- 0.1) in syndrome X patients was significantly lower (p less than 0.0001) than those of exercise duration (28.2 +/- 9.4), heart rate (12 +/- 1.4), and rate-pressure product (14.6 +/- 1.3). CONCLUSIONS. Fixed diastolic perfusion time at ischemic threshold, despite different kinds of stress tests and variability of heart rate and rate-pressure product, indicates the relevant role of diastolic perfusion time in determining myocardial ischemia. 
Use of recombinant human interferon gamma to enhance neutrophil chemotactic responses in Job syndrome of hyperimmunoglobulinemia E and recurrent infections. Recombinant human interferon gamma enhances neutrophil respiratory burst and bactericidal activity in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. Mononuclear leukocytes of patients with the hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome (Job syndrome) produce low or undetectable levels of this lymphokine. For these reasons we have restudied neutrophil chemotaxis in a group of our patients with the syndrome and determined the effect of recombinant human interferon gamma on the responses. Each of the patients had neutrophil chemotactic responses ranging from 22% to 55% of simultaneous control values (p less than 0.001). After incubation with interferon gamma, a significant improvement in chemotactic responsiveness was observed in the neutrophils of each of the patients (mean 301% of baseline chemotaxis; p less than 0.008). These data suggest the need for a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of interferon gamma in a larger group of patients with the syndrome of hyperimmunoglobulinemia E and recurrent infections. 
Alveolar hydatid disease of the liver: a report on thirty-nine surgical cases in eastern Anatolia, Turkey. The charts of 39 consecutive patients who underwent surgery between 1979 and 1989 with a diagnosis of alveolar hydatid disease (AHD) of the liver were reviewed. The analysis of these cases from eastern Anatolia, which is the endemic region in Turkey, was undertaken to determine the current experience for AHD lesions. Of these patients, 33 (84.6%) had unresectable disease and the remaining six patients (15.4%) were treated by hepatic resection of the primary lesion. In the unresectable cases, laparotomy with biopsy was the most commonly used surgical procedure (56.4%), followed by tube drainage of the necrotic cavity (18.0%), marsupialization (5.1%), and cystojejunostomy (5.1%). Diagnostic studies and operative findings were useful in detecting the AHD lesions. Differential diagnosis was established mainly by histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen or resected tissue. Pulmonary metastases were seen in two cases, and mortality occurred due to brain metastases in two other cases. Mebendazole was administered postoperatively to 19 patients with indications for 1) advanced AHD, 2) adjuvant therapy to radical and palliative surgical procedures, and 3) recurrences of disease after hepatic resection. The patients were treated with daily doses of approximately 50 mg/kg for periods of one and six years (median 3.2 years). Encouraging results were obtained in 11 of nineteen patients. Five-year survival was seen in 8 of the patients with AHD in this series. There were 18 deaths (46.2%) in our 39 patients. Long-term follow-up was not possible in four cases, and 17 patients (43.6%) were still living. The causes of mortality were advanced AHD in 14 cases, brain metastases in two, and acute myocardial infarction in another two. 
Acute pancreatitis and systemic lupus erythematosus: necropsy of a case and review of the pancreatic vascular lesions. The role of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the development of acute pancreatitis is a matter of controversy since, in many cases, this complication has been attributed to the drugs administered. In this study, we present a patient diagnosed as having SLE who developed acute pancreatitis with no apparent cause aside from her basic disease, and in whose necropsy was observed vascular damage consisting of severe intimal proliferation. Pancreatic vascular lesions in previously reported patients with lupus are reviewed. 
No excess prior cancer in patients with uveal melanoma. To determine whether there were more prior cancers in uveal melanoma patients than in a geographically matched control group, the authors compared the history of prior cancer in 407 uveal melanoma patients who lived in the western United States with that of 870 control subjects. Control subjects were selected by random digit dial and frequency-matched for age at diagnosis of patient, race, and sex. Fifty-one (12.5%) patients and 86 (9.9%) control subjects reported skin cancers whereas 25 (6.1%) patients and 47 (5.4%) control subjects reported other cancers. No statistically significant elevated estimates of relative risk (RR) were found for uveal melanoma with history of skin cancer in either men (RR = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-2.3) or women (RR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.58-2.0), or with history of other prior cancer in either sex (men, RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.42-2.2; women, RR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.55-2.1). Data from this study do not support an association between prior cancer and increased risk of uveal melanoma. 
Rehabilitating elderly cardiac patients. The aging cardiovascular system undergoes many anatomic and physiologic changes. Increased vascular resistance, myocardial "stiffness," abnormalities of rhythmicity of the sinoatrial node, irregular cardiac rhythms, and alterations in heart rate and blood pressure responses are all seen more frequently in older patients. These changes are likely to impair these patients' ability to make the rapid adjustments necessary to maintain cardiac output during exercise and activity. When cardiovascular disease processes are superimposed on the "normal" concomitants of aging, greater alterations in hemodynamic response to exercise activity are noted than usually occur in younger cardiac patients. Exercise testing of older cardiac patients is safe and is usually needed to prescribe an appropriate intensity of exercise activity. The choice of the exercise protocol, the timing of the exercise test in relation to taking prescribed cardiac medication, the choice of exercise equipment, and special considerations for devices such as pacemakers and automatic implantable cardiodefibrillators must be considered before the exercise test is done. Many of these factors and the presence of either silent or overt cardiac symptoms or untoward hemodynamic events will also affect the exercise prescription. Elderly patients usually show substantial functional improvement when participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program and comply well with prescribed exercise. Early educational intervention may be crucial to reducing disability in these patients. 
Botulinum toxin treatment of tremors. We report the results of an open trial of botulinum toxin (Botox) in the treatment of 51 patients with disabling tremors, classified as dystonic (14), essential (12), combination of dystonic and essential (22), parkinsonian (1), peripherally induced (1), and midbrain (1). The average age of the patients was 55.8 years, and duration of symptoms was 13.9 years. During a total of 160 treatment visits, an average of 242 +/- 75 units of Botox was injected per visit in cervical muscles of 42 patients with head tremor and 95 +/- 38 in forearm muscles of 10 patients with hand tremor; one patient was injected in both. The average peak effect for all patients was rated as 3.0 (0 to 4 scale). Thirty-five (67%) patients improved (peak effect greater than or equal to 1). The average latency from injection to response was 6.8 days, and the average duration of maximum improvement was 10.5 weeks. Local complications, lasting an average of 20.6 days, were noted in 17 (40%) patients injected for head tremor, consisting chiefly of dysphagia in 12 (29%), transient neck weakness in four (10%), and local pain in two (5%). Six (60%) patients with hand tremor had transient focal weakness. EMG recordings showed decreased amplitude of EMG bursts after Botox treatment. The results of this pilot study indicate that Botox injections can be used to control tremor in patients in whom other forms of therapy have failed. 
Glycerol injection into the trigeminal ganglion provokes a selective increase in human cerebral blood flow. Fourteen patients suffering from idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (refractory to medication) were treated by injection of glycerol into the trigeminal ganglion. The changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) after glycerol injection were quantified by intravenous 133Xe emission tomography. There was a significant 11% (P less than 0.01) increase in ipsilateral CBF and an 8% (P less than 0.05) increase in contralateral CBF 1 h after glycerol injection. The interhemispheric difference was significant (P less than 0.05). The increase was significantly greater in the ipsilateral internal carotid territory, in the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery territories (superficial (P less than 0.05), deep territories (P less than 0.001]. We suggest that these changes are due to the release of substance P and/or calcitonin gene-related peptide, from terminals of the trigeminal-vascular system during glycerol injection. 
Intraoperative localization of colorectal cancers using radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies. Radiation detectors may allow the intraoperative localization of small cancer deposits following administration of radiolabelled tumour-associated antibodies. This technique was evaluated in 16 patients with colorectal tumours (14 cancers, one adenoma, one lipoma) with the 111In-labelled monoclonal antibody (MAb) ICR2 which recognizes the tumour-associated epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). At operation counting was carried out (3 x 20 s per site) using a hand-held radiation probe over the primary lesions and any palpable lymph nodes in the mesocolon. The tumour to normal colon (T/NC) ratio of counts recorded at operation was more than 1.5:1 in eight of the 14 patients with cancer (mean(s.d.), 1.54(0.41):1) and 0.91:1 and 1.06:1 respectively in the two patients with benign tumours. Node to normal colon ratios were higher in lymph nodes containing metastases. The uptake of radiolabelled antibody (T/NC ratio) was higher in EMA-expressing cancers than in those not expressing the target antigen (mean(s.d.), 2.45(0.65):1 versus 1.40(0.20):1, P = 0.019). An abdominal tumour model was also developed. Radioactively filled containers of 0.5-10 ml representing tumour deposits were suspended in a tank of 111In solution representing the background activity found in normal tissues. The ratio of radioactivity in the 'tumour' to that of background varied from 2:1 to 8:1. The 'tumour' was considered to be detectable if the mean counts recorded over the 'tumour' exceeded the mean of counts recorded over background by three standard deviations. At a ratio of 2:1 only 'tumours' greater than 5 ml could be detected with a sodium iodide probe and those over 10 ml could be detected with a cadmium telluride (CdTe) probe. At a ratio of 8:1, 'tumours' of 0.5 ml could be detected with either probe. At all ratios and counting periods the NaI probe was more sensitive than the CdTe. 
Measurement of serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in a patient with congenital agranulocytosis (Kostmann's syndrome). A 12-month-old boy with Kostmann's syndrome was admitted with cavitary pulmonary disease. He had also had bacterial conjunctivitis, periorbital cellulitis, pneumonitis, and otitis media since the age of 10 days. His umbilical cord had not fallen off until he was 3 weeks old. Neutropenia was diagnosed at 4 weeks of age. Antineutrophil antibody studies were negative. A bone marrow aspirate showed granulocytic hypoplasia and a maturation arrest at the promyelocyte stage. Hematopoietic cell culture showed normal numbers of colony-forming units-granulocyte macrophage. Serum granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor level, was 0.24 ng/mL (normal, greater than 0.05 ng/mL). Serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor levels, measured by enzyme immunoassay, were undetectable. The patient was successfully treated with filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), with an increase in the absolute neutrophil count to 10.0 x 10(9)/L. Thus, our case of Kostmann's syndrome appears to represent a defect in regulation or production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. 
Experience with a gastrointestinal marker (51CrCl3) in a combined study of ileal function using 75SeHCAT and 58CoB12 measured by whole body counting. Introduction of a radioactive gastrointestinal marker (51CrCl3) into a combined study (75SeHCAT + 58CoB12) of ileal function by whole body counting has been undertaken. The technique was assessed in 23 subjects (15 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, six on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, and two normal subjects). Mean (SD) 51CrCl3 retention was only 4.1 (6.0)% on day 4, and was similar on day 7 in subjects given a second dose of 51CrCl3 on day 4. Only one subject had more than 20% of 51CrCl3 retention after four days. A 51CrCl3 correction method adequately corrected for colonic hold up of 58CoB12, when compared with final equilibrium values of 58CoB12 retention. Use of the non-absorbed 58CoB12 fraction as a gastrointestinal marker gave good agreement with the 51CrCl3 method in correcting 75SeHCAT values. In all subjects studied, corrections for colonic retention of 75SeHCAT on day 4, were small (less than 7% of dose) and did not affect the assessment of any subject. In conclusion, an additional gastrointestinal marker such as 51CrCl3 is unnecessary in our combined study since that role can be effected, when indicated by the non-absorbed 58CoB12 fraction. 
Cholesterol uptake by human glioma cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is a carrier of the cholesterol found in human plasma. Cells utilize cholesterol for membrane synthesis by taking up LDL via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the present study, interactions of LDL with human malignant glioma cell lines (U-251 MG and KMG-5) were investigated biochemically and morphologically. The LDL, labeled with the fluorescent dyes 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), was internalized by both cell processes and cell bodies. Reductive methylation of DiI-labeled LDL, which abolishes the ability of the cell to bind to the LDL receptor, prevented the internalization of the cholesterol moiety of LDL. Cellular binding of 125I-LDL to U-251 MG cells at 4 degrees C revealed the presence of a specific saturable-associated receptor (dissociation constant (Kd) approximately 38 micrograms/ml). Endocytic uptake of 125I-LDL or 3H-cholesterol oleate-labeled LDL (3H-LDL) at 37 degrees C demonstrated the cell-associated 125I-LDL and 3H-LDL increase. The intracellular degradation of protein moiety increased linearly with time. Reductive methylation of 3H-LDL led to a remarkable decrease in the cell-associated cholesterol moiety of LDL. The difference in uptake of the cholesterol moiety of LDL between U-251MG cells and KMG-5 cells showed that the U-251MG cells, which proliferate more actively than KMG-5 cells, take up more of the cholesterol moiety of LDL than do the KMG-5 cells. Thus, LDL cholesterol seems to be endocytosed predominantly via the LDL receptor present on the plasma membrane of malignant glioma cells. In addition, for growth, these cells may require large amounts of the cholesterol moiety of LDL. 
The changing pattern of infective endocarditis in childhood. Forty-eight cases of infective endocarditis (IE) that occurred in 42 patients with congenital heart disease were reviewed from 1970 through 1990 and were compared with a 20-year review of 108 cases diagnosed between 1953 and 1972. The review demonstrates that the natural history of IE in children has changed over the last 2 decades, with half of the cases occurring after surgery for congenital heart disease. In the postoperative group, 46% of patients had undergone valve replacement and 7 of these (29%) had a right ventricular to pulmonary artery valved conduit as the site for IE, suggesting significant additional risk in this setting. Among patients with nonsurgically treated congenital heart disease and IE, mitral valve prolapse has emerged as an important underlying heart lesion occurring in 29% of patients. The bacterial spectrum has shifted, with a significant increase in the incidence of uncommon causative organisms. Mortality has continued to decline with survivorship of 90% in this series. 
Hip disarticulation: factors affecting outcome. Hip disarticulation, especially in patients with peripheral vascular disease, has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This report describes patient characteristics that influence the clinical outcome of hip disarticulation. The medical records of all patients undergoing hip disarticulation from 1966 to 1989 were reviewed for surgical indication, perioperative wound complications, and postoperative deaths. Fifty-three patients underwent hip disarticulation for limb ischemia (10), infection (12), infection and ischemia (14), or tumor (17). The overall incidence of wound complications was 60%, and no significant differences were found among the groups. Prior above-knee amputation and urgent/emergent operations were significantly associated with increased wound complications (p less than 0.05). The overall mortality rate was 21%, ranging from 0% (tumor) to 50% (ischemia) and differed significantly among the groups (p less than 0.02). Mortality was significantly associated with urgent/emergent operations (p less than 0.01). Age, diabetes mellitus, and previous inflow procedures did not influence mortality rates. The presence of limb ischemia influenced mortality rates to a greater extent than did infection, and a history of cardiac disease was statistically predictive of death. Wound complications frequently accompanied hip disarticulation, regardless of operative indication, and were significantly increased by urgent/emergent operations and prior above-knee amputation. Hip disarticulation can be performed with low mortality rates in selected patients. Both limb ischemia and infection substantially increase operative mortality rates. 
Treatment of hypertensive urgencies with oral nifedipine, nicardipine, and captopril. Sixty-five patients with uncomplicated hypertensive urgencies were treated in the emergency and cardiology departments with 20 mg nifedipine, 20 mg nicardipine, or 25 mg captopril in a randomized study. The study population consisted of 65 patients ranging in age from forty-one to seventy-one. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed for six hours after intake of the antihypertensive agents. Within sixty minutes nifedipine reduced blood pressure by an average of 74.7 mmHg for the systolic and 35.4 mmHg for the diastolic. Average heart rate increased significantly by 11.6 beats/min at within thirty minutes. Nicardipine and captopril produced equivalent falls in systolic (-81.6 and -79.4 mmHg) and diastolic (-37.3 and -33 mmHg) blood pressure respectively, but did not increase heart rate significantly. The antihypertensive effect of each drug was maintained until six hours after medication. In conclusion, nifedipine, nicardipine, and captopril show similar efficacy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies. The authors believe that these drugs can be used as first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies safely and effectively. 
Linkage analysis in spinal muscular atrophy, by six closely flanking markers on chromosome 5. The proximal spinal muscular atrophies (SMA) represent the second most common autosomal recessive disorder, after cystic fibrosis. The gene responsible for chronic SMA has recently been mapped to chromosome 5q by using genetic linkage studies. Among six markers mapping to this region, five were shown to be linked with the SMA locus in 39 chronic SMA families each containing at least two affected individuals. Multilocus analysis by the method of location score was used to establish the best estimate of the SMA gene location. Our data suggest that the most likely location for SMA is between loci D5S6 and D5S39. The genetic distances between these two markers are estimated to be 6.4 cM in males and 11.9 cM in females. Since meiosis were informative with D5S39 and D5S6 in 92% and 87% of SMA families, respectively, it is hoped that the present study will contribute to the calculation of genetic risk in SMA families. 
Neonatal diaphragmatic paralysis caused by chest drains. A boy delivered at 32 weeks' gestation developed bilateral pneumothoraces that required multiple chest drains. He was dependent on the ventilator for 52 days because of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. Electrophysiological studies confirmed phrenic nerve damage. He eventually made a full recovery. It is likely that this damage was caused by the insertion of the chest drains. 
Clinical follow-up and progression of carotid atherosclerosis determined by duplex scanning in patients suffering from TIA. We investigated the clinical outcomes and the progression of the internal carotid arterial lesions of a group of patients presenting with hemispheric TIAs. The cumulative frequency of TIAs during a mean follow-up period of 40 +/- 14 months was 14%, and no relationship was found between new TIAs and the presence of known cardiovascular risk factors or plaque characteristics as determined by duplex scanning. With the exception of one patient who died of stroke, none of the patients developed a permanent neurologic deficit. The cumulative death rate was 6.5%; myocardial infarction was the most common cause (3 out of 7). Anatomic progression of plaques was determined by duplex scanning in 22% of the internal carotid arteries. No relationship between progression of these plaques and the development of new TIAs was evident. We conclude that, in this group of patients, TIAs do not inevitably lead to stroke and that TIAs are not predictable based on risk factors or plaques characteristics. 
Knowledge of diagnosis and reproductive history among survivors of childhood plumbism. As part of a study of the long-term consequences of childhood plumbism, 35 survivors of lead poisoning in the period 1930 through 1944 were interviewed along with 22 controls matched for age, sex, and town of residence. Subjects were asked to recall all pregnancies they engendered (men) or carried (women), outcome, and intellectual development of resulting children. Matched female plumbism subjects reported a higher proportion of spontaneous abortion or stillbirths among pregnancies (relative risk = 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-4.0) and a higher proportion of learning disabilities among school-age children (relative risk = 3.0, 95% CI = 0.9-10.2) in comparison with their controls. There was no evidence of clustering of learning disabilities within families or confounding by parental educational level. These results suggest that women with a history of childhood lead poisoning may be at risk for having spontaneous abortions or stillbirths and having children who manifest significant learning disabilities. 
Heparin treatment in sinus venous thrombosis. Treatment of sinus venous thrombosis (SVT) is controversial. Although heparin has been used for this condition, many investigators have opposed its use because of the frequent occurrence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and SVT. Therefore we have evaluated anticoagulation with adjusted-dose intravenous heparin for treatment of aseptic SVT in a randomised, blinded (patient and observer), placebo-controlled study in 20 patients (10 heparin, 10 placebo). The clinical course of the two groups, as judged by a newly designed SVT-severity scale, started to differ in favour of the heparin group after 3 days of treatment (p less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test) and the difference remained significant (p less than 0.01) after 8 days of treatment. After 3 months, 8 of the heparin-treated patients had a complete clinical recovery and 2 had slight residual neurological deficits. In the placebo group, only 1 patient had a complete recovery, 6 patients had neurological deficits, and 3 patients died (p less than 0.01, modified Fisher's exact test). An additional retrospective study on the relation between heparin treatment and ICH in SVT patients was based on 102 patients, 43 of whom had an ICH. 27 of these patients were treated with dose-adjusted, intravenous heparin after the ICH. Of these 27 patients, 4 died (mortality 15%), and 14 patients completely recovered. Of the 13 patients that did not receive heparin after ICH, 9 died (mortality 69%) and only 3 patients completely recovered. We conclude that anticoagulation with dose-adjusted intravenous heparin is an effective treatment in patients with SVT and that ICH is not a contraindication to heparin treatment in these patients. 
Computer- and robot-assisted resection of thalamic astrocytomas in children. Six children ranging in age from 2 to 10 years who harbored deep benign astrocytomas were operated upon using a computer- and robot-assisted system. A radical excision was achieved in all cases with no significant morbidity nor any mortality. The system consists of an interactive, three-dimensional display of computed tomographic image contours and digitized cerebral angiograms taken using the Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic frame. The surgical retractor is held and manipulated using a PUMA 200 robot. The position and orientation of the surgical retractor is displayed on the three-dimensional display. Preoperative planning and simulation are important features of this system. Movement of the brain after removal of the tumor and cerebrospinal fluid is substantial, so the tumor removal is based on visually defined margins. Enhanced computer graphics and robotic devices are important adjuncts to neurosurgical procedures and will find increasing use in the future. 
Reversal of a dense, persistent, holohemispheric neurological deficit after an endarterectomy of the carotid artery: case report. The role and timing of a carotid endarterectomy in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke-in-evolution remain controversial. Although computed tomographic (CT) scans typically show no abnormalities in the acute stage, it is generally agreed that a dense neurological deficit (hemiplegia) and/or multiple modality neurological disturbance (involving motor, sensory, gaze, and visual field impairment) represent contraindications to surgical intervention. We present a case of an acute right holohemispheric neurological deficit including dense hemiplegia, hemisensory loss, gaze disturbance, hemineglect, and impaired level of consciousness. This persisted for 4 days while serial CT scans showed no evidence of infarction. Angiography revealed pre-occlusive stenosis of the right internal carotid artery with sluggish antegrade flow. The anterior collaterals of the circle of Willis were impaired, and the right middle cerebral artery territory filled via the posterior communicating artery. Despite the dense neurological deficit persisting for 4 days, a carotid endarterectomy was performed. Gradual neurological improvement was noted within hours of the operation, and all neurological deficits resolved within the subsequent 3 days. This case is consistent with prolonged holohemispheric hemodynamic compromise below the threshold of neurological dysfunction, but above the threshold of tissue infarction ("idling neurons"). Features assisting in the recognition of this unusual scenario and the indications and risks of revascularization in this setting are discussed. 
Cocaine-associated chest pain. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical and ECG features of cocaine abusers evaluated in the emergency department and admitted to the medical coronary care unit with chest pain consistent with myocardial ischemia. DESIGN: A four-month retrospective review of all cocaine abusers who presented to the ED with chest pain and a diagnosis of possible myocardial infarction. SETTING: Urban county hospital. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight adult cocaine abusers admitted with chest pain. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients included 34 men and 14 women with a mean age of 29 +/- 7.3 years. The average duration of cocaine abuse in 28 patients for whom it was reported was 5 +/- 4.8 years. Chest pain occurred within one hour of cocaine abuse in 13 admissions (27%), more than one hour after abuse in 13 admissions (27%), and it was not recorded in 23 admissions (47%). Initial ECGs were evaluated in all patients and revealed significant repolarization abnormalities consisting of abnormal ST segment elevations in 18 (37%) and T-wave inversions in 20 (41%) that often persisted on subsequent ECGs. Three patients sustained acute myocardial infarctions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm a small but significant incidence of myocardial infarction in cocaine abusers presenting to the ED with chest pain. The chronicity of cocaine abuse, the persistence of ECG abnormalities, and the variable temporal relationship of chest pain to cocaine abuse suggest possible chronic myocardial changes as etiologies of ischemia. 
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of proximal subclavian artery stenosis after left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery bypass surgery. A patient is described who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, through a brachial approach, of a high grade stenosis at the proximal portion of the left subclavian artery 1.5 years after coronary artery bypass grafting including left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery anastomosis. Symptoms of class IV angina, vertebrobasilar insufficiency and occupational arm claudication that developed after bypass surgery were promptly relieved after balloon dilation. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian artery can be performed safely and provides an alternative to carotid-subclavian or axillary-axillary bypass surgery for treatment of internal mammary artery graft malfunction. 
Plasma levels of an endogenous Na(+)-K+ pump inhibitor in relation to haemodynamic data in cardiopathic patients. 1. Despite the fact that numerous studies provide evidence for the existence of an endogenous inhibitor of the cell membrane Na(+)-K+ pump in plasma, little is known about the relationships between this factor and the main haemodynamic parameters. 2. In order to shed some light on this, we attempted to correlate haemodynamic parameters, measured during heart catheterization in a group of 22 cardiopathic subjects, with plasma digitalis-like activity levels, determined by two different procedures. 3. The ability of plasma to inhibit a human renal Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase showed an inverse correlation with cardiac index and a direct correlation with peripheral resistance. Plasma cross-reactivity with digoxin antibodies correlated directly with left atrial pressure. 4. These results furnish confirmation of a number of theoretical assumptions which attribute to the digitalis-like factor the ability to modify the contractility of the cardiovascular system. 
Nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill: product of aspiration or translocation? OBJECTIVE: To examine the possibility that nosocomial pneumonias might be caused by the translocation of enteric bacteria and their toxins. DESIGN: Prospectively collected previous database was examined by logistic regression analysis. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty-two ICU patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The best stand-alone predictors for nosocomial pneumonia were bleeding from stress ulceration (p less than .001), the severity of illness present (p less than .001), and intramucosal acidosis in the stomach (p = .023), a metabolic indication of mucosal ischemia. Mechanical ventilation (p = .038) and the administration of antacids/cimetidine (p = .054) were also of stand-alone predictive value, but did not significantly improve the best predictive model for nosocomial pneumonia derived from the severity of illness present and the intramucosal pH in the stomach. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ischemic mucosal injury and its associated translocation of enteric bacteria and toxins might be more important in the pathogenesis of nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill than the aspiration of contaminated nasopharyngeal secretions. 
Female DUI offenders: a comparison to male counterparts and an examination of the effects of intervention on women's recidivism rates. Female DUI offenders who participated in a controlled, random assignment DUI intervention study, the Mississippi DUI Probation Follow-Up Project, were compared to their male counterparts on demographic, drinker status and recidivism variables. In comparison to men, women in the project were less likely to be married, more likely to be between 30 and 50 years of age, less likely to have less than a 9th grade education, less likely to be screened as a high-problem-risk drinker, less likely to have prior DUI and public drunkenness arrests and less likely to recidivate. The effects of short-term rehabilitation, 1 year's probation and administration of the Life Activities Inventory-Current Status Questionnaire (LAI-CSQ) on the long-term recidivism rates of women were examined. The analysis for screened low-problem-risk women was inconclusive due to lack of statistical power. However, the repeated administration of the LAI-CSQ was detrimental for screened high-problem-risk women and tended to be detrimental for women with fewer than 12 years of education. Implications for intervening with female DUIs are discussed. 
Risk of peritonitis and fatal septicaemia and the need to defunction the low anastomosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the need to defunction the low anastomosis after anterior resection of the rectum with total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. Two hundred consecutive patients (125 defunctioned, 75 non-defunctioned) undergoing low anterior resection for carcinoma were included in the study. Peritonitis requiring emergency laparotomy occurred in 8 per cent of the patients who did not have a defunctioning stoma compared with less than 1 per cent of those patients who had a defunctioning stoma (P less than 0.01). There was no mortality related to closure of the stoma but seven patients developed a faecal fistula and ten developed an incisional hernia. Despite current trends to avoid the defunctioning stoma, these results suggest that after total mesorectal excision the faecal stream should be temporarily diverted away from the anastomosis that is 6 cm or less from the anal verge to protect against potentially life-threatening anastomotic leakage. 
Laser laparoscopic vagotomy and pyloromyotomy. We performed bilateral truncal vagotomy and gastric drainage procedure using standard laparoscopic instruments in five mongrel dogs. The procedure consisted of a transthoracic thoracoscopic bilateral truncal vagotomy and transperitoneal laparoscopic pyloromyotomy. A contact Nd:YAG laser fiber was used. There was no mortality, minimal morbidity, and post-operative gastric emptying was satisfactory. Pathologic studies indicated vagotomy was complete. We believe that this may be the initial step in the development of a simple, safe, and effective endoscopic procedure for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. 
Reoperations for late complications following abdominal aortic operation. Fifty patients were identified who, following abdominal aortic operation, developed late complications affecting the vascular graft or endarterectomy and who underwent their first reoperation between 1979 and 1989. Thrombosis was the commonest complication affecting 28 (56 per cent) patients, followed by false aneurysm in 11 (22 per cent), enteric fistula in nine (18 per cent) and graft infection in two (4 per cent). The 30-day mortality rate for reoperation was 8 per cent; longer follow-up revealed mortality rates of 22, 50 and 63 per cent at 1, 3 and 5 years respectively. Thirty-four complications required reoperation within 5 years of the original surgery. Reoperation was needed for 35 patients whose original pathology was occlusive disease and for 15 whose original pathology was aneurysm. The nature of the complication was related to initial pathology; thrombosis was far commoner in those with occlusive disease, and enteric fistula and false aneurysm were commoner in those with aneurysmal disease. 
Delayed cardiac rupture due to blunt chest trauma. A 7-year-old boy fell from a 2.5-m height and suffered contusion of the thorax with hematoma in the soft tissues of the lateral chest wall. The rib cage itself remained intact. After 3 days, there was only local pressure sensitivity of the left hemithorax. On day 8 after the trauma, the child, who up to then had seemed to be in good health, suddenly died during lessons at school. Autopsy revealed a full-thickness rupture of the left ventricle with resultant cardiac tamponade. The macroscopic and histopathologic findings are presented and discussed. 
Frequency of adverse systemic reactions after fluorescein angiography. Results of a prospective study. Intravenous fluorescein angiography is a commonly performed and extraordinarily valuable diagnostic procedure. The frequency of adverse reactions after angiography has varied considerably in previous reports. In a prospective study of 2789 angiographic procedures in 2025 patients, the authors found that the percentage of adverse reactions depended strongly on the patient's angiographic history. Overall, adverse reactions followed 4.8% of the angiographic procedures. These reactions included nausea (2.9%), vomiting (1.2%), flushing/itching/hives (0.5%), and other reactions (dyspnea, syncope, excessive sneezing) (0.2%). No cases of anaphylaxis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, or seizures occurred. The percentage of reactions was 1.8% for patients who had had previous angiography without ever having had an adverse reaction. In contrast, the percentage of reactions was 48.6% for patients who had had an adverse reaction to angiography previously. 
Cerebrospinal fluid interleukins, immunoglobulins, and fibronectin in neuroborreliosis. Intrathecal synthesis of IgM and IgG, oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands, and the levels of fibronectin, soluble interleukin 2 receptor, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were investigated with the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 46 paired cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples from 32 patients with meningopolyradiculoneuritis due to Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme borreliosis stage 2). Cerebrospinal fluid and serum interleukin 6, although not specific for neuroborreliosis, were good indicators of disease activity, while the serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor level was only mildly elevated. Tumor necrosis factor alpha was never detected in cerebrospinal fluid or serum specimens, and cerebrospinal fluid IgM, IgM index, and cerebrospinal fluid IgM/cerebrospinal fluid IgG ratios were significantly higher than in all other neuroimmunologic disorders evaluated and may be valuable diagnostic indicators for neuroborreliosis. The estimation of intrathecally synthesized IgG and IgM fractions for the differential diagnosis of neuroimmunologic disorders did not add to IgG and IgM index calculations. 
Hippocampal degeneration differentiates diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) from Alzheimer's disease: light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry of CA2-3 neurites specific to DLBD. Immunocytochemistry with antibodies to ubiquitin is currently the most sensitive method for detecting cortical Lewy bodies, which are a sine qua non for the diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), an increasingly recognized form of primary degenerative dementia. In the systematic application of ubiquitin immunocytochemistry to sections of hippocampus from control subjects and patients with a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, we noted the frequent occurrence of ubiquitin-immunoreactive neurites in the CA2-3 region in DLBD. The nature of these neurites was investigated with immunocytochemistry in DLBD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), normal elderly subjects, and Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the number of neurites varied from case to case, they were virtually always detected in DLBD but not in normal, AD, or PD brains. Double immunolabeling studies with anti-ubiquitin demonstrated a small fraction of double-stained neurites with antibodies to neurofilament or Alz-50, but no double staining with an antibody to Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles. These results are different from those for neurites in AD, which are rarely seen in CA2-3 and which are immunoreactive with all these antibodies. Neuritic degeneration in the CA2-3 region of the hippocampus appears to be a specific histopathologic feature of DLBD. 
Pregnancy after myocardial infarction: are we playing safe? The safety of pregnancy after myocardial infarction remains a significant dilemma for both the obstetrician and the cardiologist. Only 20 cases of pregnancy after myocardial infarction have been reported. To clarify this problem, we add our experience of four such cases in which conception occurred 9 months to 9 years after myocardial infarction with no previous consultation. Each woman had an uneventful pregnancy with no cardiac or obstetric complications related to the myocardial infarction. All patients were under the strict supervision of an obstetrician and a cardiologist during pregnancy in our conjoined antepartum-cardiologic clinic. The mode of delivery in all patients was related to the obstetric indications. Our experience and the accumulated experience in the literature demonstrate good prognosis for patients who conceive after myocardial infarction. 
The effect of the pneumatic antishock garment (PASG) on hemodynamics, hemorrhage, and survival in penetrating thoracic aortic injury. To determine if the increased blood pressure associated with application of a pneumatic antishock garment (PASG) affects outcome in thoracic hemorrhage, we assessed hemodynamics, blood loss, and survival in three groups of eight anaesthetized piglets with a 2.5-mm laceration of the descending thoracic aorta. Baseline measurements were made before aortic hemorrhage. During one hour of aortic hemorrhage or until death of the animal, the PASG was not inflated in Group I while the PASG in the other two groups was inflated to maintain carotid artery pressure at 15 torr below baseline (Group II) and at baseline (Group III), respectively. Survival was 100% in Group I, 50% in Group II, and 0% in Group III. Hemorrhage at 22.5 +/- 4.0 mL/min stopped after 18-24 minutes in Group I; the survivors in Group II bled at a rate of 32.5 +/- 3.0 mL/min compared with 43.6 +/- 4.0 mL/min over 26-35 minutes in the Group II nonsurvivors. Group III pigs bled at 107.5 +/- 8.0 mL/min over the 10-18 minutes of survival. The intended blood pressure could not be maintained beyond 30 minutes. Bleeding stopped in Group I when the blood pressure fell to 58.2 +/- 4.5 torr from a baseline of 119.0 +/- 10.0 torr. The blood pressure fell to 48.0 +/- 5.0 torr in the four Group-II survivors. After a transient maintenance of baseline blood pressure in Group III, a precipitous drop in blood pressure with death in 10-18 minutes occurred in all these animals. In this porcine model of thoracic aortic injury, PASG inflation increases hemorrhage and mortality. 
Soft-tissue sarcoma: MR imaging vs sonography for detection of local recurrence after surgery. To determine the value of MR and sonography in detecting local recurrences of soft-tissue sarcomas after surgery, 26 MR and sonographic studies performed in 21 patients were reviewed retrospectively. Recurrences were confirmed histologically in 12 (46%) of 26 studies. The MR images and sonograms were obtained within 1 month of each other. The findings were classified as recurrence, no recurrence, or indeterminate. Sonography was instrumental in guiding fine-needle aspiration biopsy of impalpable lesions. In two cases, the findings on sonography were indeterminate. In both of these cases, the sonograms had been obtained soon after surgery (at 2 and 4 months). The sensitivity and specificity in the detection of local recurrences were 83% and 93%, respectively, for MR and 100% and 79%, respectively, for sonography. These differences were not statistically significant. We conclude that MR and sonography appear to be equally useful in the detection of local recurrences of soft-tissue sarcomas, sonography can be used for routine follow-up and in guiding needle biopsies, sonography may be more difficult to interpret than MR during the early postoperative period, and MR should be used if sonography is inconclusive. 
Circulating and tissue endothelin immunoreactivity in advanced atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND. Atherosclerosis is characterized by endothelial injury and the proliferation of arterial smooth-muscle cells. The latter may be a result of the release of growth factors from the vessel wall; such growth factors may include an endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor for peptide with mitogenic properties. We tested the hypothesis that plasma endothelin concentrations are elevated in persons with symptomatic atherosclerosis, independently of age. METHODS. We measured plasma endothelin levels in 100 normal subjects and in 40 patients with atherosclerosis predominantly of the following types: aortic and peripheral vascular disease (14 patients), renovascular disease (9 patients) coronary artery disease (9 patients), and carotid disease (8 patients). We also performed immunohistochemical staining for endothelin in the walls of atherosclerotic vessels. RESULTS. In the normal subjects, the mean (+/- SD) plasma endothelin concentration was 1.4 +/- 0.2 pmol per liter, with no correlation between age and plasma endothelin concentration (r = 0.13, P = 0.2). In the patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis, the mean plasma endothelin concentration was 3.2 +/- 1.2 pmol per liter (P less than 0.001), and there was a significant correlation between plasma endothelin and the number of sites of disease involvement (r = 0.89, P less than 0.001). In the immunohistochemical studies, endothelin-1-like immunoreactivity was observed in vascular smooth muscle as well as in endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS. Endothelin may be a marker for arterial vascular disease. Whether it participates in the atherogenic process or is merely released from damaged endothelial cells is unclear. 
Acute cutaneous vasculitis associated with prolonged intravenous ritodrine hydrochloride therapy. A patient with twin gestation was hospitalized because of preterm labor and treated with intravenous ritodrine hydrochloride (Yutopar, Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Westborough, Mass.). After greater than 4 weeks of therapy, the patient had a petechial rash and prolonged bleeding time, which were diagnosed and confirmed by skin biopsy at cesarean section as vasculitis. This is the first documented case of vasculitis associated with ritodrine use. 
Defining the proper role for self-administered sublingual nitroglycerin. A survey of physicians and patients. Within a half-year period, we encountered six cases of patients harmed by the adverse effects of self-administered nitroglycerin--syncope, delayed definitive medical care, and the worsening of nonischemic symptoms. We therefore surveyed 112 patients after a remote myocardial infarction, and 121 cardiologists and internists, regarding the use of sublingual nitroglycerin. Of the physicians, 84 percent routinely prescribed nitroglycerin to patients after a myocardial infarction, and 79 percent of the patients had the tablets available (83 percent of these, at all times). Most patients used the tablets less than once per month, and 37 percent of the patients who always carried nitroglycerin had not used it at all during the preceding year. Although 89 percent of the patients claimed to know when to use the drug, 57 percent had used it or would use it for symptoms such as dizziness, rapid heartbeat, or presyncope. All patients having nitroglycerin claimed it relieved their symptoms, even if the relief was only partial, the time elapsed until relief could not be specified, and the symptoms were of a type unlikely to be relieved by the drug. We suggest that the practice of routinely prescribing nitroglycerin to patients after a myocardial infarction should be reassessed. 
A 'stress' test for memory dysfunction. Electrophysiologic manifestations of early Alzheimer's disease. Long-latency event-related potentials (P300) were assessed in patients with early probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), age-matched controls, and young adults during a task that imposed various degrees of demand on memory. Although patients with AD did not differ from age-matched controls when one item had to be remembered, their P300 potential was dramatically reduced in amplitude or absent with increasing memory load. Aged controls did not differ from young adults on this measure. P300 latency, however, did not differentiate patients with AD. Thus, electrophysiological abnormalities detected in the context of mnemonic demand may provide a sensitive marker of the early stages of probable AD. 
In vitro comparison of different gall stone dissolution solvents. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) of gall bladder stones leaves residual fragments that need to be dissolved by chemical solvents. In this study we compared the in vitro dissolving capacity of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), mono-octanoin, limonene, and limonene/mono-octanoin (70%/30%). From nine sets of five human gall stones obtained at cholecystectomy, four stones were used for dissolution and the fifth was used for chemical analysis of cholesterol, calcium, and bilirubin contents. Eight sets were cholesterol stones with a mean (SD) cholesterol content of 89.9 (5.6)%. These stones dissolved completely in either solvent, often leaving sand-like debris, with the exception of one stone. MTBE dissolved cholesterol gall stones 100 times faster than mono-octanoin and 10 times faster than limonene or the limonene/mono-octanoin mixture (p less than 0.001). The combination of limonene and mono-octanoin was as effective as limonene alone. Of the four solvents, MTBE is the best one to evaluate for dissolution of residual fragments after ESWL treatment of gall bladder stones. 
Changes in the serum levels of CK-MB, LDH, LDH1, SGOT and myoglobin due to cardiac surgery. Elevation of serum levels of enzymes due to myocardial necrosis is considered to be a specific finding for myocardial infarction. This study was designed to determine the changes in the levels of LDH, SGOT enzymes, LDH1, CK-MB isoenzymes and myoglobin in patients who have had coronary bypass grafting and who have had atriotomy for surgical correction without any evidence of myocardial infarction diagnosed by clinical, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic findings. It was found that CK-MB, LDH, LDH1 and myoglobin showed significant elevations which mimicked a perioperative myocardial infarction. SGOT also increased, but remained within the normal range. CK-MB, LDH and LDH1 increased more in the coronary bypass grafted patients whereas myoglobin increased in the patients who had atriotomies. It was concluded that in order to demonstrate a perioperative myocardial infarction it is necessary to determine at least two of these enzymes for a long period and to correlate these results with the clinical, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic findings. 
Non-infective verrucous endocarditis in a patient with 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome. A 27-year-old women with 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome, who developed a haemodynamically significant non-infective verrucous endocarditis is reported. Her mother suffered from antiphospholipid syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. A pathogenetic role of antiphospholipid antibodies in heart valve lesions is suggested. 
The prevention of the maternal manifestations of pre-eclampsia by intensive antihypertensive treatment. The purpose of the study was to determine if reduction of pregnancy hypertension to normal prevented the clinical maternal manifestations of pre-eclampsia. Thirty-six women with hypertension, but without proteinuria, were allotted at random to a test group of 17 who received intensive treatment, and a control group of 19 who were managed according to routine methods by hospital staff unconnected with the study. The development of proteinuria was chosen as an indicator of pre-eclampsia. Proteinuria developed significantly more often in the control group (in six of the 19 women) than in the test group (in one of the 17 women). 
The myth of the aortic annulus: the anatomy of the subaortic outflow tract. Surgical repair of the small aortic root is limited in part by the very structure of the outflow tract from the left ventricle. The root is not constructed on the basis of a ringlike annulus supporting the leaflets of the aortic valve. The only truly circular structure within the outflow tract is the junction of the aortic wall with the underlying ventricular structures, themselves partly muscular and partly fibrous. This circular ventriculoarterial junction is crossed by the semilunar attachments of the leaflets of the aortic valve, producing an interlinking arrangement between the expanded aortic sinuses and three triangles of fibrous tissue placed beneath the apexes of the commissures between the valve leaflets. The triangles form extensions of the left ventricle that are related, in part, to the pericardial cavity surrounding the heart. The arrangements of the attachment of the leaflets in malformed valves with two (or only one) effective leaflets are highly abnormal, although these valves are usually produced on the template of three aortic sinuses. The valve with two leaflets rarely gives problems during childhood. In valves producing "critical stenosis", there is usually only one effective leaflet, a condition due to incomplete liberation of two of the anticipated three commissures. Detailed study shows that, in these malformed hearts, the attachment of the leaflets is much more annular than in normal valves, with inadequate formation of the fibrous triangles. 
Treatment of acute systemic toxicity after the rapid intravenous injection of ropivacaine and bupivacaine in the conscious dog. Two groups of six beagle dogs received rapid intravenous (IV) injections of ropivacaine or bupivacaine on two occasions in a blinded random fashion. Initially, a dose sufficient to cause convulsions (CD) was given followed by twice the CD (2 x CD), which was administered 48 h later. The CD of bupivacaine (4.3 mg/kg) and ropivacaine (4.9 mg/kg) caused significant (P less than 0.05) increases in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. There was no difference between drug groups. Seizures were abolished by 10 mg/kg of intravenous thiamylal. Endotracheal intubation and controlled respiration with O2-enriched air with no other treatment resulted in rapid and complete recovery in all dogs. All dogs receiving 2 x CD of bupivacaine (8.6 mg/kg) or ropivacaine (9.8 mg/kg) were initially treated with thiamylal and mechanical ventilation. Two dogs in the bupivacaine group developed hypotension, respiratory arrest, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, which were resistant to closed chest cardiac massage, treatment with epinephrine, bretylium, and atropine, and direct current cardioversion. The four remaining dogs in the infusion group were successfully resuscitated. All of the animals in the ropivacaine-treated group survived the administration of the 2 x CD dose. Mild hypotension developed in one dog and was treated with intravenous epinephrine (0.75 mg). This resulted in nodal tachycardia, which was abolished after treatment with bretylium. Another dog had two 1-s bursts of premature ventricular contractions requiring no treatment. The rapid treatment of convulsions and cardiovascular toxicity resulted in a decreased number of deaths in both groups when compared with dogs from a previously published study in which no therapy was instituted. Thus, early aggressive treatment of central nervous system and cardiovascular system toxicity is capable of reducing the incidence of mortality associated with the rapid intravenous administration of excessive doses of local anesthetics. 
Abdominal wall tenderness: a useful sign in chronic abdominal pain. The outcome in 72 patients with obscure abdominal pain and a positive Carnett's (abdominal wall tenderness) test, seen in one firm's surgical outpatient clinic between 1975 and 1983, was sought by a combination of hospital note retrieval and general practitioner questionnaire. Full follow-up data to date or death were available for 58 (81 per cent) patients and partial follow-up for 14 patients. The study showed that the patients generated a good deal of investigation and a number of surgical procedures but that seldom were their symptoms attributable to serious pathology. Familiarity with the test, taken in the context of a proper history and examination, has been found helpful in assessing such patients and saves the inconvenience, expense and occasional hazard of investigation, and even surgery. 
Long-term results after lateral cranial base surgery. The surgical management of patients with slow-growing benign temporal bone neoplasms has been criticized because of its significant morbidity and mortality compared with results after radiation therapy, but long-term control by irradiation remains unproved. Long-term surgical results have not been studied previously. One hundred twenty-nine skull base operations were performed in 126 patients at the Otology Group, Nashville, Tenn., from January 1970 through May 1987. Fifty-eight patients responded to questionnaires focusing on recovery from loss of cranial nerves. All patients regained some degree of facial function (class V or better), no alimentary tubes or tracheotomies were in use, and no patients had debilitating aspiration. Long-term compensation from the cranial nerve deficits of lateral skull base surgery can be expected in most patients and should not be used as an argument for irradiation in patients with a long life expectancy at time of diagnosis. 
Pulsed dye laser lithotripsy of bile duct stones. Efficacy and safety of pulsed dye laser lithotripsy was tested in 25 consecutive patients in whom bile duct stones could not be extracted after endoscopic sphincterotomy. The patients had one to six (mean, 1.8) bile duct stones (diameter, 10-35 mm; mean, 18 mm) located in the common bile duct (18 cases), the intrahepatic bile ducts (6 cases), or in a long cystic duct stump (1 case). Different approaches were tested depending on the presence of a T tube and on the localization of the bile duct stones. When a T tube was present (7 cases), the lithotripsy was performed under direct vision using a choledochoscope inserted through the T-tube tract. In 18 patients without a T tube in place, the lithotripsy was performed under fluoroscopy using a retrograde approach in case of common bile duct stones (14 cases) or under choledochoscopy using a percutaneous transhepatic approach in case of intrahepatic bile duct stones (4 cases). Fragmentation of all the bile duct stones and a complete bile duct clearance were obtained in all 11 cases with procedures performed under direct vision as compared with only 5 of 14 cases with procedures under fluoroscopic control. Moreover, 6 of the 9 failures using the latter approach were offered another session using a choledochoscope inserted through a percutaneous transhepatic tract and were also successfully treated. No complication related to the laser beam was noted. It is concluded that pulsed dye laser lithotripsy of bile duct stones (that are unable to be removed by standard endoscopic techniques) is safe and efficacious provided that it is performed under direct vision. Technical refinements are needed before this procedure can be reliably performed under fluoroscopy. 
Complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy. A prospective series with emphasis on the increased risk associated with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and nondilated bile ducts. Mostly retrospective series with limited use of sphincter of Oddi manometry have indicated that early complications are more common when endoscopic sphincterotomy is performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction than for common duct stones. The current study was undertaken to prospectively evaluate the frequency and type of complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction compared with endoscopic sphincterotomy performed for other conditions. Four hundred twenty-three patients underwent sphincterotomy for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (166), common duct stone(s) (163), tumor (60), and miscellaneous reasons (34). Patients were observed in the hospital for at least 24 hours after the procedure, and 30-day follow-up data were obtained. The overall complication rate was 6.9%, but complications were more frequent when sphincterotomy was performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction than for all other indications (10.8% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.009). Precut sphincterotomy was more frequently required in the sphincter of Oddi dysfunction group (21.1% vs. 11.7%, P = 0.009) but was no more likely to result in a complication (6.2%) than standard sphincterotomy. The risk of a complication was considerable for a small-diameter common bile duct (less than or equal to 5 mm), particularly when sphincterotomy was performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (37.5%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 1.7%, but the procedure-related mortality rate was believed to be 0.2%. It is concluded that endoscopic sphincterotomy for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is more hazardous than for other conditions, particularly when a small common bile duct is present. 
Utilization of bone scans in conjunction with prostate-specific antigen levels in the surveillance for recurrence of adenocarcinoma after radical prostatectomy. Follow-up evaluation of patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy routinely consists of serial bone scintigraphy and, more recently, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. The utility of serial bone scans in combination with PSA levels is retrospectively reviewed in 118 men treated by radical prostatectomy for clinical Stage A or B disease who, at the time of surgery, had no evidence of metastatic disease. Of the 118 patients, 75.4% had no abnormality on either test (mean follow-up 32.4 mo), 9.3% demonstrated a detectable or rising PSA level with negative bone scan (mean follow-up 35 mo), and 8.5% exhibited a detectable and or rising PSA level and positive bone scan (mean follow-up 30.7 mo). Follow-up bone scans were read as either positive or indeterminate with undetectable PSA levels in 6.8% of patients (mean follow-up 27.3 mo). Critical review of the equivocal studies suggests that postoperative PSA levels more truly represent the clinical situation than bone scans. Following radical prostatectomy, routine bone scintigraphy provides little additional information when PSA levels are negative. If PSA becomes detectable or the patient develops symptoms, bone scintigraphy should then be performed. 
Intrahypothalamic clonidine infusion prevents NaCl-sensitive hypertension. We have previously shown that dietary NaCl supplementation increases blood pressure and sympathetic nervous system activity in association with decreased norepinephrine release and increased alpha 2-adrenergic receptor number in the anterior hypothalamic area of salt-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) but not in salt-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-R) or Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Further, acute microinjection of clonidine into the anterior hypothalamic area produced depressor responses that were augmented by high salt feeding in SHR-S but not in SHR-R or WKY rats. The current study tested the hypothesis that chronic infusion of clonidine into the anterior hypothalamic area prevents salt-sensitive hypertension in SHR-S. Beginning at age 7 weeks, immediately before initiation of 1% or 8% salt diets, clonidine (2 ng/min) or saline vehicle was infused into the anterior hypothalamic area or femoral vein of male SHR-S via osmotic minipump for 20 days. In SHR-S fed an 8% salt diet, chronic microinfusion of clonidine into the anterior hypothalamic area offset the hypertensive effect of the dietary salt supplementation and reduced the enhancing effects of dietary salt on left ventricular weight and plasma norepinephrine levels. In contrast, chronic microinfusion of clonidine into the anterior hypothalamic area did not significantly affect any of these measures in 1% salt-fed SHR-S. Intravenous infusion of clonidine at the rate used for the anterior hypothalamic area infusion did not alter any of these measures in 8% salt-fed SHR-S. 
Integration of conservative surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for the treatment of early-stage, node-positive breast cancer: sequencing, timing, and outcome. The optimal means of combining breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with early-stage, node-positive breast cancer is not known. We reviewed the results in 295 patients treated at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy and affiliated institutions from 1976 to 1985. All patients had positive axillary nodes on dissection, had no gross residual disease in the breast or axilla after surgery, and received breast irradiation (with or without nodal irradiation) and three or more cycles of a cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF)-based or doxorubicin-containing regimen. Median follow-up in patients without any failure was 78 months. Breast failure rates were assessed in relation to the sequencing of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The different sequences were not randomly assigned, and the characteristics of the sequence groups differed. The actuarial 5-year breast failure rate was 4% in 99 patients receiving radiotherapy before chemotherapy; 8% in 54 patients sequentially receiving some chemotherapy, then radiotherapy without concurrent chemotherapy, then further chemotherapy; and 6% in 116 patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the failure rate was 41% in 26 patients who received all chemotherapy before radiotherapy. The crude incidences of local failure within 4 years of treatment in these groups were 3%, 2%, 4%, and 15%, respectively (P = .065 for all four groups not being the same). The actuarial 5-year local failure rate was 5% for 252 patients irradiated within 16 weeks after surgery compared with 35% for 34 patients irradiated more than 16 weeks after surgery. The 4-year crude incidences were 4% and 12% for the two groups, respectively (P = .06). These results suggest that delaying the initiation of radiotherapy may result in an increased likelihood of local failure. Formal randomized controlled trials will be needed to confirm these results and to improve the integration of these treatment modalities. 
Disk drusen and angioid streaks in pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Visual field loss secondary to optic disk drusen became evident before the development of angioid streaks in a patient with pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The incidence of optic disk drusen in cases of pseudoxanthoma elasticum is 20 to 50 times greater than that in the healthy population. We postulate that the abnormal aggregation of macromolecules with a high affinity for calcium (resulting in abnormalities in elastin in cases of pseudoxanthoma elasticum) also develops at the cribriform plate, disrupting axonal flow and leading to disk drusen formation. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is associated with marked cardiovascular and gastrointestinal morbidity. Moreover, macular hemorrhage and precipitation of angioid streaks have frequently been noted after trauma. Prompt diagnosis of pseudoxanthoma elasticum will allow necessary prophylaxis and must be considered in patients with optic disk drusen. 
Prehospital hypertonic saline/dextran infusion for post-traumatic hypotension. The U.S.A. Multicenter Trial. The safety and efficacy of 7.5% sodium chloride in 6% dextran 70 (HSD) in posttraumatic hypotension was evaluated in Houston, Denver, and Milwaukee. Multicentered, blinded, prospective randomized studies were developed comparing 250 mL of HSD versus 250 mL of normal crystalloid solution administered before routine prehospital and emergency center resuscitation. During a 13-month period, 422 patients were enrolled, 211 of whom subsequently underwent operative procedures. Three hundred fifty-nine patients met criteria for efficacy analysis, 51% of whom were in the HSD group. Seventy-two per cent of all patients were victims of penetrating trauma. The mean injury severity score (19), Trauma Score plus Injury Severity Score (TRISS) probability of survival, revised trauma scores (5.9), age, ambulance times, preinfusion blood pressure, and etiology distribution were identical between groups. The total amount of fluid administered, white blood cell count, arterial blood gases, potassium, or bicarbonate also were identical between groups. The HSD group had an improved blood pressure (p = 0.024). Hematocrit, sodium chloride, and osmolality levels were significantly elevated in the Emergency Center. Although no difference in overall survival was demonstrated, the HSD group requiring surgery did have a better survival (p = 0.02), with some variance among centers. The HSD group had fewer complications that the standard treatment group (7 versus 24). A greater incidence of adult respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, and coagulopathy occurred in the standard treatment group. No anaphylactoid nor Dextran-related coagulopathies occurred in the HSD group. Although this trial demonstrated trends supportive of HSD in hypotensive hemorrhagic shock patients requiring surgery, a larger sample size will be required to establish which subgroups of trauma patients might maximally benefit from the prehospital use of a small volume of hyperosmolar solution. This study demonstrates the safety of administering 250 mL 7.5% HDS to this group of patients. 
Management of intraoperative rupture of aneurysm without hypotension. A retrospective analysis was performed on all aneurysms operated on by one of us (SLG) from July 1980 to October 1988 to determine the factors that govern outcome from the intraoperative rupture of aneurysms. A total of 276 consecutive surgical procedures for 317 intracranial aneurysms produced 41 perioperative or intraoperative ruptures for analysis. Five cases were pre-exposure ruptures, 3 of which occurred during anesthetic induction. Four of these patients died, and 1 made a good recovery. Of the remaining 36 cases, outcome was analyzed in terms of the adjuncts used to deal with the intraoperative rupture. There was no statistically significant difference in outcome between those cases in which tamponade was used to control hemorrhage versus temporary clipping; however, those cases in which hypotension was used did less well than those in which it was not used. From October 1986 to October 1988, 108 operations for 132 aneurysms were performed without the use of induced hypotension. There were 16 intraoperative ruptures (14.8%). All 16 of these patients made a good recovery. In the group before 1986, of which there were 20 intraoperative ruptures (of 168 operations, 11.9%), 11 of those 20 patients suffered a permanent deficit or died. We conclude that hypotension may not be a necessary adjunct to the management of intraoperative rupture of aneurysms. 
High frequency of asymptomatic visual field defects in subjects with transient ischaemic attacks or minor strokes. The hypothesis that asymptomatic visual field defects can be found in patients with carotid transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) or minor strokes was tested. Twenty-two consecutive male patients with TIA and 18 patients with minor strokes from the carotid artery territory were examined by perimetry, cerebral computerised tomography and regional cerebral blood flow. Asymptomatic visual field defects were found in many TIA and minor stroke patients, 29% (5/17) and 57% (8/14), respectively (NS). Eighty-five per cent (11/13) of the scotomas were solely or predominantly located in the upper part of the visual field (P = 0.008 for absolute defects and P = 0.03 for relative defects). We conclude that both carotid territory TIA and minor stroke patients have a high frequency of asymptomatic visual field defects, predominantly located in the upper part of the visual field. 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease. When antacids aren't enough. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a very common condition that is usually manifested by heartburn or regurgitation. Reflux esophagitis, caused by mucosal exposure to the backflow of caustic gastric contents, is primarily a result of lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction. Diagnostic workup varies but commonly includes esophagoscopy, 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, and radiography of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Treatment, which progresses from simple life-style changes and antacids to histamine2 receptor antagonists to omeprazole (Prilosec) or surgery, is tailored to individual needs and is generally successful. 
Protruding atheromas in the thoracic aorta and systemic embolization. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether protruding atheromas in the thoracic aorta are a risk factor for systemic embolization. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: A referral hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 122 patients with a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral emboli and an equal number of age- and sex-matched control patients. MEASUREMENTS: Evaluation using transesophageal echocardiography was done in case patients to detect protruding atheromas in the thoracic aorta and in control patients for cardiac indications other than emboli. MAIN RESULTS: Matched logistic regression showed that the presence of protruding atheromas was strongly related to the occurrence of embolic symptoms (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% Cl, 1.6 to 6.5; P less than 0.001). Furthermore, atheromas with mobile components were present only in case patients. When known risk factors for stroke (hypertension and diabetes) were added to the model, the presence of protruding atheromas remained an independent risk factor for embolic symptoms (odds ratio, 3.8). Hypertension was also independently associated with embolic symptoms (odds ratio, 2.7), but diabetes was not (odds ratio, 1.0). CONCLUSION: Protruding atheromas in the thoracic aorta can be detected by transesophageal echocardiography and should be considered as a cause of strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and peripheral emboli. 
The antinociceptive effects of anterior pretectal stimulation in tests using thermal, mechanical and chemical noxious stimuli. Four behavioural tests have been used to study the antinociceptive effects of electrical stimulation of the anterior pretectal nucleus (APtN) in the rat. The antinociceptive effects of stimulating this nucleus, which lies dorsally in the posterior diencephalon, have recently been studied extensively but always using briefly applied heat stimuli. It is reported here that APtN stimulation effectively inhibited responses to briefly applied noxious pressure and longer-lasting noxious chemical (formalin) stimuli. Although the tail-flick reflex to noxious heat was very potently depressed by APtN stimulation, responses to noxious heat in the hot-plate test were not. Three doses of morphine were also studied with each test and it was concluded that 15 sec of 35 microA r.m.s. current into the APtN was as effective as 3-5 mg/kg morphine s.c. in the rat. 
Constipation--some provocative thoughts [editorial] Constipation is a collective term with different definitions and manifestations. In the present communication, I hope to shed light on the pathogenesis, investigation, and treatment of these manifestations. The levator ani is the principal muscle of defecation; together with anorectal reflex actions, it conducts the act of defecation. Strainodynia is the term I give to excessive and exhaustive straining at defecation. Band strainodynia has normal stool character but elevated rectal neck pressure due to the presence of a fibrous band in the rectal neck. Diet strainodynia presents with lower stool weight and frequency than normal; the internal anal sphincter is fibrous. The stools in levator strainodynia have been repeatedly obstructed at defecation due to levator dysfunction. Idiopathic oligofecorrhea or infrequent defecation was studied in 146 patients. Three stages could be identified: the deep and the everted intersphincteric groove and the cone anus. Fecoflowmetry is introduced as a new method for investigating anorectal disorders. It measures the defecated volume per time unit, and provides quantitative as well as qualitative data concerning the act of defecation. Changes in the fecal flow parameters or curve configuration from normal point to a defecation disorder. 
Regional cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in patients with chronic liver disease. Subtle impairments of cognitive function may be an important cause of occupational and psychosocial morbidity in patients with chronic liver disease. Correlation of structural brain abnormalities with cognitive deficits has yielded inconsistent results. 10 patients with cirrhotic liver disease were compared with 10 age, education, and intelligence matched control subjects. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant overall cognitive impairments in cirrhotic patients compared with controls (p = 0.02). Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPET or SPECT) and showed increased uptake of radiotracer in the right and left posterior parts of the basal ganglia and right occipital lobe, together with reduced uptake in the right anterior cingulate region. The degree of cognitive impairment was directly correlated with functional abnormalities in the basal ganglia and limbic cortex (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that impaired cognitive status may be associated with abnormalities of regional brain function in patients with chronic liver disease. Since these deficits are clinically inapparent, our findings have important implications for identification and management of patients with chronic liver disease. 
Thiamine deficiency in patients with congestive heart failure receiving long-term furosemide therapy: a pilot study. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that long-term furosemide therapy in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with clinically significant thiamine deficiency via urinary loss. DESIGN: (1) Biochemical evaluation of thiamine status in hospitalized patients with CHF treated with long-term furosemide and in age-matched control patients. (2) Uncontrolled trial of the effect of intravenous thiamine on cardiac performance in a subset of six patients with CHF. SETTING: General medical ward of a teaching community hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients with chronic CHF receiving furosemide, and 16 age-matched control patients without heart failure and not taking diuretics. Daily furosemide doses were 80 to 240 mg, and duration of furosemide therapy was 3 to 14 months. Patients with identifiable causes of inadequate thiamine intake, absorption, or utilization or increased metabolic requirements were excluded. INTERVENTION: A 7-day course of intravenous thiamine, 100 mg twice daily, in six consenting patients with CHF. RESULTS: A high thiamine pyrophosphate effect (TPPE), indicating thiamine deficiency, was found in 21 of 23 furosemide-treated patients and in two of 16 controls (p less than 0.001). The mean (+/- SE) TPPE (normal: 0% to 15%) in furosemide-treated and control patients was 27.7 +/- 2.5% and 7.1 +/- 1.6%, respectively (p less than 0.001). Despite the high TPPE, the mean (+/- SE) urinary thiamine excretion in the furosemide-treated patients (n = 18) was inappropriately high (defined as greater than 130 micrograms/g creatinine), 410 +/- 95 micrograms/g creatinine, even in comparison with that in the controls (n = 14): 236 +/- 69 micrograms/g creatinine. In six patients treated with intravenous thiamine, the elevated TPPE decreased to normal, from a mean (+/- SE) of 27.0 +/- 3.8% to 4.5 +/- 1.3% (p less than 0.001), indicating normal thiamine utilization capacity. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased in four of five of these patients studied by echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that long-term furosemide therapy may be associated with clinically significant thiamine deficiency due to urinary loss and contribute to impaired cardiac performance in patients with CHF. This deficit may be prevented or corrected by appropriate thiamine supplements. 
Deregulation of a homeobox gene, HOX11, by the t(10;14) in T cell leukemia. Molecular cloning of the t(10;14)(q24;q11) recurrent breakpoint of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has demonstrated a transcript for the candidate gene TCL3. Characterization of this gene from chromosome segment 10q24 revealed it to be a new homeobox, HOX11. The HOX11 homeodomain is most similar to that of the murine gene Hlx and possesses a markedly glycine-rich variable region and an acidic carboxyl terminus. HOX11, while expressed in liver, was not detected in normal thymus or T cells. This lineage-restricted homeobox gene is deregulated upon translocation into the T cell receptor locus where it may act as an oncogene. 
Five-year vascular audit from a district hospital. Vascular patients under the care of one surgeon over a 5-year period have been reviewed, from computer-based discharge records, with regard to in-hospital measures of outcome to determine whether or not surgery was being performed to an acceptable standard. Out of 466 procedures, 30 per cent of patients had at least one complication, 14 per cent had further surgery and 9 per cent died. Outcome was examined within the following treatment groups: aorto/iliac aneurysm, aortofemoral bypass, femoroproximal popliteal bypass, femorodistal popliteal bypass, femorocrural bypass, embolectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Patients having below-knee bypass surgery were found to have an unacceptably high rate of complications, reoperations and amputations. An overall rate of reoperation for postoperative bleeding of 5 per cent was also considered to be high. With these exceptions, it was concluded that the surgery was being performed to an acceptable standard, but that comparative audit of this type remained difficult while there was a deficiency of national statistics against which the work of individual surgeons could be judged. 
Enhanced malignant transformation induced by expression of a distinct protein domain of ribonucleotide reductase large subunit from herpes simplex virus type 2. The 1.3-kilobase (kb) Pst I DNA fragment C (Pst I-C) of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) morphological transforming region III (mtrIII; map unit 0.562-0.570) encodes part of the N-terminal half of the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RR1; amino acid residues 71-502) and induces the neoplastic transformation of immortalized cell lines. To assess directly the role of these RR1 protein sequences in cell transformation, the Pst I-C fragment was cloned in an expression vector (p91023) containing an adenovirus-simian virus 40 promoter-enhancer to generate recombinant plasmid p9-C. Expression of a protein domain (approximately 65 kDa) was observed in p9-C-transfected COS-7 and Rat2 cells but not in those transfected with plasmid pHC-14 (Pst I-C in a promoterless vector). In Rat2 cells, p9-C induced highly transformed foci at an elevated frequency compared with that of pHC-14. Introduction of translation termination (TAG) condons within the RR1 coding sequence and within all three reading frames inactivated RR1 protein expression from p9-C and reduced its transforming activity to the level seen with the standard pHC-14 construct. Wild-type p9-C specified a protein kinase capable of autophosphorylation. Computer-assisted analysis further revealed significant similarity between regions of mtrIII-specific RR1 and amino acid patterns conserved within the proinsulin precursor family and DNA transposition proteins. These results identify a distinct domain of the HSV-2 RR1 protein involved in the induction of enhanced malignant transformation. In addition, the data indicate that the mtrIII DNA itself can induce basal-level transformation in the absence of protein expression. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of plasminogen activator expression in human colorectal carcinomas: correlation with CEA distribution and tumor cell kinetics. Fifty cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma were immunohistochemically examined for the relationship between distribution of plasminogen activators (PAs) and the degree of differentiation of cancer cells as reflected by carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expression as well as tumor cell kinetics. The A chain of urokinase-type PA (u-PA-A) was mainly observed in the apical portions of highly differentiated cancer cells. Increased expression and change in localization to the cytoplasm were found with progressive dedifferentiation. The numbers of DNA polymerase alpha (pol. alpha) positive cancer cells also increased in line with u-PA-A expression. The B chain of u-PA (u-PA-B), and the A and B chains of tissue-type PA (t-PA-A and -B) did not show similar alteration. The present findings suggest that the distribution of u-PA-A in colorectal carcinoma tissues, the degree of tumor differentiation, and the proliferation kinetics of cancer cells are closely related. 
Increased incidence of solid malignant tumors after bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia. From May 1980 to December 1989, 107 consecutive patients with non-constitutional severe aplastic anemia underwent bone marrow transplantation at our institution using cyclophosphamide and thoraco-abdominal irradiation as conditioning regimen. During the same period, 40 patients with Fanconi anemia were also grafted after a similar conditioning, giving a total series of 147 patients. With a mean follow-up of 64 months, four male patients developed a solid malignant tumor, a number that leads to an 8-year cumulative incidence rate of 22% (eg, relative risk to general population = 41, P less than .001). These results should be considered as a warning to clinicians who follow these successfully grafted long-term patients. 
Intraventricular blood flow during isovolumetric relaxation and diastole in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Forty patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were investigated by Doppler echocardiography for intraventricular blood flow abnormalities. None had a bundle branch block. The patients were recruited on the basis of the presence of at least one of four different types of abnormal left ventricular blood flow movements during systole, isovolumetric relaxation, and diastole (time after mitral valve opening). The abnormal blood flow patterns were composed of the following: (1) systolic left ventricular outflow and midventricular obstruction in 20 of 40 and in 6 of 40 patients, respectively; (2) retrograde isovolumetric relaxation flow (IVRFretro; mean velocity, 0.7 +/- 0.3 m/sec), that is, flow toward the apex of the left ventricle, in 28 of 40 patients; (3) antegrade isovolumetric relaxation flow (IVRFante; mean velocity, 1.6 +/- 1.0 m/sec), that is, flow toward the left ventricular outflow tract, in 3 of 40 patients; and (4) diastolic antegrade flow (DFante; mean velocity, 0.9 +/- 0.3 m/sec), that is, flow opposite to mitral inflow, in 10 of 40 patients. There were significantly fewer patients with asymmetric septal hypertrophy (group 1) than with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (group 2) showing DFante (1/29 versus 9/11, p less than 0.01). IVRFretro and DFante revealed higher velocities in patients with marked left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy than in those with mild hypertrophy. Thus, in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and especially in patients with marked asymmetric hypertrophy, there are different types of abnormal intraventricular blood flow movements during isovolumetric relaxation and disatole. This phenomenon is probably caused by asynchronous relaxation of the asymmetrically distributed, hypertrophied myocardium. DFante is more often observed in the apical cardiomyopathy than other forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy probably attributable to apically localized left ventricular cavity obliteration. 
Polycystic ovarian syndrome: safety and effectiveness of stepwise and low-dose administration of purified follicle-stimulating hormone. OBJECTIVE: An attempt to induce ovulation with a single dominant follicle in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients. DESIGN: Comparing ultrasound and estradiol (E2) measurements during treatment with a low-dose protocol (using purified follicle-stimulating hormone, starting with 75 IU/d and increasing every 7 days by 37.5 IU/d) with those obtained following treatment with a conventional protocol using the same drug. SETTING: Specialist Reproductive Endocrine Unit. PATIENTS PARTICIPANTS: Eight PCOS patients of whom six had failed to respond adequately to the conventional protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Rate of cancellation of cycles, number of leading follicles, and serum E2 concentration at the time of ovulation. RESULTS: Treatment with the low-dose protocol resulted in a significant reduction in the number of leading follicles (P less than 0.04), serum E2 concentrations (P less than 0.0002), and a higher rate of ovulation. As a result, five patients conceived compared with none in the conventional protocol. CONCLUSION: Using the low-dose protocol permitted induction of ovulation safely and successfully in a selected group of PCOS patients who were previously difficult to treat with the conventional ovulation induction protocol. 
Therapeutic advances in the prevention of hepatitis B: yeast-derived recombinant hepatitis B vaccines. Viral hepatitis is second to gonorrhea as the most commonly reported infectious disease in the US. Hepatitis B accounts for the majority of viral hepatitis cases. Fortunately, the disease is self-limiting and frequently resolves completely with minimal complications; however, a significant number of individuals may experience long-term sequelae. Research utilizing genetic engineering has led to the development of yeast-derived recombinant DNA (YDR) hepatitis vaccines--a significant advancement in the control and prevention of hepatitis B. The recombinant process allows production of unlimited quantities of vaccine at considerably lower cost and without the potential threat of blood-borne illness. Clinical trials in various high-risk populations have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of YDR vaccines. However, questions regarding optimal regimen and the need for periodic revaccination remain unanswered. Persons at risk should be adequately vaccinated against hepatitis B. 
Application of Doppler color flow imaging to determine valve area in mitral stenosis. This study was undertaken to examine whether Doppler color flow imaging could accurately estimate the valve area in mitral stenosis. Doppler color flow assessments were performed in both an in vitro model and in 30 patients with mitral stenosis undergoing cardiac catheterization. In the experimental Doppler study using a circuit model, color jet width correlated well with actual orifice diameter (r = 0.99). In the clinical Doppler study, the mitral valve orifice was assumed to be elliptic and the mitral valve area was calculated from the following equation: (pi/4) (a x b), where a = color jet width at the mitral valve orifice in the apical long-axis view (short diameter) and b = the width in the 90 degrees rotated view (long diameter). Mitral valve area was also determined by two-dimensional echocardiography and the pressure half-time method, and the results for all three noninvasive methods were compared with those obtained at cardiac catheterization. By Doppler color flow imaging, mitral valve area could be determined in all patients and there was a significant correlation between the Doppler jet and catheterization estimates of mitral valve area (r = 0.93). Valve area determined by two-dimensional echocardiography correlated well with catheterization measurements in 26 patients (r = 0.84). However, the area could not be determined in 4 (13%) of the 30 patients because of technical problems. Although there was a fair correlation between the valve area determined by the pressure half-time method and catheterization (r = 0.79), this method tended to overestimate valve area in patients with aortic regurgitation. 
Hemangiopericytoma of the spleen. A splenic tumor is reported with the light microscopic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features of a hemangiopericytoma. The findings in this case are compared with the only previously reported splenic hemangiopericytoma. Differences in the clinical presentation and the gross appearance of the two cases are described, and similarities in the microscopic features are discussed. 
Changing rates of stroke in the province of Quebec, Canada: 1981-1988. Using more than 37,000 hospital discharges attributed to hemorrhagic or occlusive stroke in the province of Quebec, Canada, we analyzed trends in stroke incidence during the period 1981-1988. There were large and statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increases in the rates of hemorrhagic stroke over this period. Dramatic increases occurred among men in the rates of both intracerebral (International Classification of Diseases--Ninth Revision [ICD9] code 431) and intracranial (ICD9 code 432) hemorrhagic strokes (40-204% depending on age). In contrast, the rates of occlusion of the precerebral arteries (ICD9 code 433) declined in younger men and women but increased substantially (107%) in older men. Rates of occlusion of the cerebral arteries (ICD9 code 434) declined in men over the age of 50 years and in women aged 50-79 years. Despite the decline in the rate of occlusion of the cerebral arteries, the rate of hemorrhagic stroke appears to have increased. Changes in the hospitalization rates for hemorrhagic stroke were not accompanied by consistent decreases in the case-fatality rate. This finding tends to support the hypothesis of an actual increase in the hospitalization rate fo hemorrhagic stroke rather than an artifactually elevated rate due to enhanced diagnosis by computed tomography. 
Prevention of coronary heart disease in black adults. Development of strategies to prevent CHD in blacks is impeded by the virtual absence of clinical trials demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of interventions in blacks. The wholesale generalization that interventions effective (or ineffective) in whites are similarly effective in blacks may risk the employment of worthless or even dangerous interventions in blacks. Using available epidemiologic data, a number of risk factors may be more important in blacks than whites by virtue of higher prevalence, increased relative risk, or both. These may include hypertension, lipoprotein (a), smoking, diabetes, and obesity. Thus, health agencies might emphasize these risk factors when developing preventive programs targeted at black populations. Prevention programs may best seek to prevent the onset of risk factors found highly prevalent in black communities, rather than the costly and side-effect-prone interventions to treat risk factors once established. Thus, there is a role for community-based as well as a high-risk approaches. The community-based approaches should seek to work with organizations such as churches, which traditionally play strong roles in the black community. Physicians treating black patients should be aware of the potentially different roles played by risk factors, and treat aggressively those individuals identified to be at high risk. Risk factor management should be emphasized, rather than reduced, in patients with already established CHD. CHD has been clearly shown to be preventable; both blacks and whites should benefit from specific interventions aimed toward this worthy goal. 
High blood pressure due to alcohol. A rapidly reversible effect. The hypothesis that the action of alcohol on blood pressure is rapidly reversible and that its effect is therefore mainly due to very recent alcohol consumption was examined in this study. Five hundred and seventy-seven subjects were screened in an occupational survey. Alcohol consumption, documented with a 1-week retrospective diary was divided into two categories: "recent" and "previous" intake. Recent intake was defined as the amount consumed on days 1, 2, and 3 immediately preceding blood pressure measurement. Previous intake was defined as the amount consumed on days 4, 5, and 6 preceding blood pressure measurement. High recent alcohol intake significantly raised systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both men and women. Previous alcohol intake, however, did not appear to influence blood pressure. We conclude that the effect of alcohol on blood pressure appears to be predominantly due to alcohol consumed in the few days immediately preceding blood pressure measurement, with alcohol consumption before those few days exerting little effect on blood pressure. 
Progesterone receptor in hepatocellular carcinoma. Correlation with androgen and estrogen receptors. Progesterone receptors (PgR), estrogen receptors (ER), and androgen receptors (AR) were assayed consecutively for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that was surgically removed from 19 men and three women. The methods of receptor assay were the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for PgR and the dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) technique for ER and AR. The patients ranged in age from 32 to 77 years (average, 60.3 years). No patients had received any specific anti-cancer therapy before tissue collection. All patients but one had underlying liver disease: cirrhosis in 13 and chronic hepatitis in eight. The positive rate of each receptor was 18% for PgR, 48% for ER, and 82% for AR. The titer was highest for AR, intermediate for ER, and lowest for PgR. The titers of PgR in four PgR-positive patients ranged from only 1.1 to 3.0 fmol/mg of protein. There was no relationship between PgR, ER, and AR in terms of positivity and titer. Also, other clinical and histopathologic data did not influence the positivity or concentration of these three sex hormone receptors. It can be concluded that no or little PgR exists in the cytosol of untreated HCC. 
Relation of left ventricular volume and function over one year after acute myocardial infarction to infarct size determined by technetium-99m sestamibi. Twenty patients with a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (15 anterior, 5 inferior) who received successful reperfusion therapy underwent tomographic imaging with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi and radionuclide ventriculography at discharge, 6 weeks, and 1 year after AMI. Patency of the infarct-related artery after reperfusion (thrombolysis, 8 patients; coronary angioplasty, 12 patients) was confirmed by angiogrpahy in all patients. Tc-99m sestamibi perfusion defect at discharge (a measure of infarct size) was quantitated using previous methods and expressed as a percentage of the left ventricle (28 +/- 19%, range 0 to 59%). This perfusion defect size correlated closely with ejection fraction at discharge (r = -0.87), 6 weeks (r = -0.81) and at 1 year (r = -0.78, all p less than 0.0001). Perfusion defect size at discharge also correlated closely with end-systolic volume index at discharge (r = 0.71, p less than 0.0005), 6 weeks (r = 0.63, p less than 0.005) and at 1 year (r = 0.76, p less than 0.0001). Perfusion defect size at discharge did not correlate significantly with end-diastolic volume index at discharge or at 6 weeks, but did correlate at 1 year (r = 0.66, p less than 0.005). There was no significant group change in end-systolic or end-diastolic volume indexes from discharge to 1 year later, although 7 patients had definite individual changes in end-diastolic volume index (3 increased and 4 decreased). There was no relation between defect size and late changes in end-systolic volume index, but there was a weak correlation between defect size and late changes in end-diastolic volume index (r = 0.42, p = 0.07). 
Relationship of epidermal growth factor receptor detectability with the A, B, H blood group antigens. Emphasis on normal and neoplastic urothelium. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a glycoprotein that carries on its extracellular domains oligosaccharide chains, some of which are similar to blood group determinants. The author examined the expression of the EGFR using immunohistochemistry and three anti-EGFR antibodies with different fine specificities. These were applied to frozen sections from 120 tissue biopsies, including normal and neoplastic urothelium. The expression of blood group A, B, H determinants was also evaluated in the same tissues. Significant differences were noted, depending on the fine specificity of the anti-EGFR antibody, cellular differentiation, and the tissue donor's blood group. The most interesting finding was a reciprocal relationship between the reaction patterns obtained using antibodies with carbohydrate specificity and those with peptide specificity. These patterns were characteristic of cellular differentiation and suggested that the EGFR peptide determinants are detected in excess in immature and malignant cells that, however, appear deficient in oligosaccharide determinants. The combination of 'loss' of blood group antigen and an apparent overexpression of EGFR peptide determinants is indicative of invasive growth in transitional cell carcinomas. 
Acantholytic dyskeratotic epidermal naevus in a patient with guttate psoriasis on PUVA therapy. A 79-year-old male with psoriasis developed a zosteriform acantholytic dyskeratotic epidermal naevus during PUVA therapy. The eruption was successfully treated with etretinate 0.75 mg/kg/day and a subsequent course of PUVA with the affected area covered prevented a recurrence of the naevus. 
Susceptibility to and severity of rheumatoid arthritis in multicase families. Fifteen sibships, each having two or more siblings affected by classical or definite RA were studied. They comprised 31 patients with RA (all in remission) and 21 normal siblings. The total severity index of RA was assessed by clinical and radiological indices. For all the patients the following investigations were carried out: (1) HLA antigens determination for nine antigens at A locus and 15 at B locus and 6 at DR locus; (2) rheumatoid factor. We found: (1) RA disease is genetically controlled and the responsible genes are linked to the HLA system; (2) association between seropositivity and DR4 and DR4/B27 genotypes; (3) significant effect of the genotype DR4/B27 on the age of onset; (4) association between the increase in disease severity both clinical and radiological and DR4/X and DR4/B27 phenotypes. Thus the genetic control is probably composed of two types of genes: disease susceptibility genes and disease severity genes linked to DR4/X and DR4/B27 phenotypes. 
Elevation of plasma concentrations of haloperidol after the addition of fluoxetine. Fluoxetine (20 mg/day) was added for 7-10 days to stable doses of haloperidol given to eight psychotic patients. Mean plasma concentrations of haloperidol were elevated by 20% (p less than 0.05), but extrapyramidal side effects did not increase appreciably, indicating a relatively minor interaction between these agents. 
A comparison of treatment outcomes for black patients and white patients with metastatic breast cancer. The Piedmont Oncology Association experience. Prior studies have shown that black patients with breast cancer have poorer survival times compared with white patients even when adjusted for stage. Seventy-four black patients treated on six Piedmont Oncology Association (POA) protocols were compared with 74 randomly selected white patients treated with the same protocols to determine if race had any independent effect on response, time to progression, or survival time. Patients were evenly matched for pretreatment characteristics with the exception that white patients had a significantly higher percentage of bone metastases and significantly less skin involvement. Response rates and median time to progression were similar for black patients and white patients at 31% and 25%, and 9.3 and 9.1 months, respectively. Black patients had poorer survival times even when adjusting for covariables; median survival time was 14.3 months for black patients and 20.3 months for white patients (P less than 0.05). The reason for this survival difference in Stage IV patients is unclear, but is unlikely to be related to treatment. Additional research in this area will be necessary to resolve this issue. 
Lymphatic abnormalities in Alagille's syndrome. Chylous pleural effusions developed in a patient with Alagille's syndrome who had dysplasia of the lymphatic system. Lymphatic abnormalities are not a recognised feature of Alagille's syndrome. 
Juvenile progressive systemic sclerosis: report of five cases. Five cases of juvenile progressive systemic sclerosis (SSc) are reported (4 girls and 1 boy). The age of onset of the disease ranged from 4 to 13 years. The clinical features included Raynaud's phenomenon present in 4 of 5 cases; hyperpigmentation, skin tightening and contractures of the large joints were noted in all 5 cases. One patient initially diagnosed as having eosinophilic fasciitis developed SSc 3 months later. Another patient was diagnosed initially as having juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. There was one case of pulmonary fibrosis and another of mild restrictive lung disease. Two cases of esophageal and intestinal hypomotility were reported. Scleroderma nephropathy was absent in all 5 cases. 
Injury current and gradients of diastolic stimulation threshold, TQ potential, and extracellular potassium concentration during acute regional ischemia in the isolated perfused pig heart. During acute regional myocardial ischemia, a "current of injury" flows between the ischemic and the normal tissue. Its direction and magnitude change during the cardiac cycle. During diastole, the injury current flows intracellularly from the ischemic cells toward the normal cells and tends to depolarize the latter. The gain insight into the possible role of the injury current in arrhythmogenesis, we simultaneously determined diastolic stimulation threshold, [K+]o and TQ potential at multiple sites closely spaced across the cyanotic border in Langendorff-perfused pig hearts during the first 10 minutes after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The position of the electrodes relative to the border was validated by their response to 1) regional ischemia and 2) selective perfusion with a high-K+ perfusate of the left anterior descending coronary artery. A temporary decrease of diastolic stimulation threshold preceded a rapid increase in the central ischemic zone; a lasting reduction (by +/- 20%) without a concomitant increase of [K+]o was observed at seven sites (of 39 sites tested), five of which were less than 2 mm outside the electrophysiological border. Moreover, up to 4 mm inside the electrophysiological border, a similar lasting decrease of diastolic stimulation threshold was accompanied by a moderate increase of [K+]o. We conclude that 1) the injury current causes increased excitability in normal tissue close to the "ischemic" border and 2) increased excitability related to a moderately increased [K+]o may persist up to 10 minutes of ischemia at the ischemic side of the border. Both factors may facilitate the induction of life-threatening arrhythmias in acute myocardial ischemia. 
Colorectal cancer: current trends in initial clinical manifestations. Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a common cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in the United States. There continues to be controversy regarding the effectiveness and feasibility of various screening programs for CRC. To determine how cases of CRC are currently detected, we reviewed a series of 246 consecutive patients with well-documented pathologic staging and clinical presentation. Patients with low stage CRC (0 or A) had smaller tumors, were less likely to be anemic at presentation, and were more likely to have tumors located in the left side of the colon than patients with tumors at stage B or higher. Thirty-two of the 246 tumors were detected in asymptomatic patients through screening. These tumors were more likely to be of a lower stage than those in patients with active gastrointestinal symptoms. In our experience active screening programs detect a relatively small number of CRCs. A majority (66%) of CRCs are still detected from symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal tract. 
Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis involving the paranasal sinuses. Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis is a destructive, locally invasive process, with a propensity for local recurrence after inadequate excision. Although it does not metastasize, uncontrolled growth can eventually lead to death. The role for radiation and chemotherapy is controversial and these modalities are best reserved for advanced unresectable or recurrent lesions. The treatment of choice is en bloc surgical resection with wide margins. 
Cytoprotection and stress ulceration. The stomach possesses many mechanisms for protection against stress ulceration. The gastric microcirculation, prostaglandins, mucus secretion, epithelial cell renewal, and muscle tone are factors involved in gastric cytoprotection. Therapy is partially directed at augmenting these natural physiologic defense mechanisms to prevent and promote healing of stress ulceration. Drugs such as sucralfate, carbenoxalone, colloidal bismuth, and prostaglandins are used. Stress ulceration is an important cause of upper gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage in postoperative and critically ill patients in the intensive care unit setting. Preventive therapy includes neutralization of gastric acid by antacids, suppression of gastric acid secretion by H2-receptor blockers, administration of cytoprotective agents, and correction of the underlying stress state. Active bleeding requires accurate diagnosis by gastroscopy. Additional therapy may be necessary, including intra-arterial administration of vasopressin and occasionally surgery. Dieulafoy's lesion is an unusual stress-related cause for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The area of mucosal injury is minute but underneath lies a large submucosal gastric artery. It can cause massive bleeding and is often missed at initial gastroscopy. The pathogenesis of Dieulafoy's lesion is complex and the mainstay of therapy has been surgical. Ligation of the vessel, wedge resection, or proximal gastric resection is performed. Therapeutic endoscopy with endoscopic cauterization or injection has changed the approach to this lesion. 
Conjugate eye deviation: side, site, and size of the hemispheric lesion. Conjugate eye deviation (CED) is a well-known sign that occurs rather frequently in stroke patients. To study the lateralizing and localizing value of this sign, we investigated prospectively 78 consecutive patients presenting with CED due to a hemispheric lesion. CED occurred more frequently after right-sided hemispheral damage (64%). The lesions in the right hemisphere were located predominantly in the subcortical (fronto-) parietal region and the internal capsule; the lesions in the left hemisphere were larger, covering the entire fronto-temporo-parietal area. In the majority of patients there was no direct involvement of the frontal eye fields on either side. The results indicate that a lesion at different sites within the circuit between the inferior parietal lobule and frontal eye fields, and their projections to the superior colliculus or paramedian pontine reticular formation, can be responsible for CED. The right-left asymmetry is probably related to cerebral asymmetry for directed spatial attention. 
Rest and exercise radionuclide angiography for diagnosis in chronic ischemic heart disease. Rest and exercise radionuclide angiography is frequently employed for the diagnosis of chest pain syndromes. Its value and limitations in this regard have been well studied, but proper utilization of the technique requires an understanding of five critical concepts: 1) Radionuclide angiography is superior to treadmill exercise testing and probably equivalent to thallium scintigraphy, although the published series did not use current methods. 2) The true specificity of radionuclide angiography is about 80%, intermediate between the early optimistic estimates and the later pessimistic ones. 3) The peak exercise ejection fraction is the preferred test parameter for diagnosis, although exercise hemodynamics, symptoms, and electrocardiographic changes should also be considered. 4) Although radionuclide angiography is clearly helpful for noninvasive diagnosis, significant numbers of patients will continue to fall in an uncertain category. 5) The proper application of the technique requires recognition of its limitations and careful attention to technical details. When properly applied, this modality can make an important contribution to clinical decision making. 
A randomized trial of ticarcillin and clavulanate versus gentamicin and clindamycin in patients with complicated appendicitis. Secondary bacterial peritonitis is usually a polymicrobial infection of facultative gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Treatment consists of operation and broad-spectrum antibiotic administration. The antibiotic treatment of choice in these infections has been the combination of gentamicin and clindamycin. However, this combination can have toxic side effects and necessitates frequent monitoring of serum levels. Beta-lactam antibiotics provide broad-spectrum coverage and low toxicity, but can be inactivated by species of bacteria producing beta-lactamase enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and has been shown to extend the efficacy of ticarcillin to bacteria producing these enzymes. This combination was compared with gentamicin and clindamycin in 99 consecutive patients with complicated appendicitis. Eradication of identified pathogens was greater in the ticarcillin and clavulanate group (98 per cent) than in the gentamicin and clindamycin group (92 per cent), even for the subgroup of organisms producing beta-lactamases (97 versus 90 per cent eradication). Complications and clinical response were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. Ticarcillin and clavulanic acid is a safe and effective alternative to gentamicin and clindamycin in the treatment of secondary bacterial peritonitis and offers advantages in dosing simplicity and freedom from ototoxic and nephrotoxic effects. 
Acute hemodynamic effects of terazosin in hypertensive and normotensive patients. Terazosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, was administered intravenously to 10 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization to determine its short-term hemodynamic effects. Hemodynamic measurements were performed before and 30 minutes after three doses of the drug: 1, 1, and 3 mg. One milligram of terazosin reduced the blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, mean) from a mean of 152.0/86.3, 110.7 mm Hg by -24.3/-9.4, -15.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). In the five patients who received 5 mg of the drug, blood pressure declined in a dose-dependent manner by -21.8/-3.8, -11.6 mm Hg after 1 mg, and by -35.8/-14.8, -22.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after all 5 mg of the drug. The changes in blood pressure paralleled the terazosin-induced decrease in systemic resistance. Similar changes were recorded for pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance. The greatest hemodynamic response was noted with the first drug dose; succeeding doses had a progressively diminished incremental effect. Cardiac output, heart rate, and maximum left ventricular dp/dt demonstrated little change, whereas left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased after all three doses, reaching significance after 2 mg (-3.4 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction tended to increase (+5.6% +/- 2.4%, p less than 0.05 after 1 mg) and showed a dose dependence analogous to that of systemic resistance. Although not generally reaching statistical significance, indexes of aortic stiffness and compliance displayed a favorable effect. These data are consistent with terazosin's specific alpha 1-antagonism. Left ventricular performance is improved by afterload reduction, since terazosin demonstrated no direct effect on cardiac contractility. 
Use of combined exogenous gonadotropins and pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone in patients with polycystic ovarian disease [published erratum appears in Fertil Steril 1991 Jun;55(6):1213] We previously tested a combined regimen based on the administration of gonadotropin in the early follicular phase followed by pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) until complete follicular maturation in patients suffering from polycystic ovarian disease. Despite good clinical results, a high rate of premature luteinization was observed with this approach. We therefore evaluated in this study whether starting pulsatile GnRH therapy before gonadotropin administration might reduce premature luteinization. Eight women underwent induction of ovulation with both combined therapy and pure exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone alone using a crossover scheme. No premature luteinization and a single follicular growth were recorded with the modified combined regimen. Clinical results (8/8 versus 3/7 ovulatory cycles; 3/8 versus 1/7 pregnancies) favor the combined approach over gonadotropin alone. 
Preeclampsia as the great impostor. In contrast with a generation ago when preeclampsia was misdiagnosed as medical or surgical disease unrelated to pregnancy, today's diagnostic errors are those that consider surgical and medical problems as either pregnancy-induced hypertension or as the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome. Eleven case histories are presented of significant medical or surgical problems that were initially diagnosed as hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome or pregnancy-induced hypertension. The incorrect diagnosis of medical-surgical cases during pregnancy often meant that appropriate therapy was delayed and that the rate of iatrogenic prematurity was increased. 
Fulminant hepatic failure due to acute hepatitis B and delta co-infection: probable bloodborne transmission associated with a spring-loaded fingerstick device. Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) due to acute hepatitis B and delta co-infection occurred in a 74-yr-old female, who eventually died. There was no clear-cut epidemiology other than probable bloodborne transmission from a contaminated spring-loaded fingerstick device used for glucose determination, in an outpatient facility. This unusual mode of transmission reiterates the importance of using sterile cleansing and disposal procedures anytime there is a possibility of contamination with blood. 
Medullary catecholaminergic neurons in the normal human brain and in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is thought to cause degeneration of melanin-pigmented catecholaminergic neurons throughout the brainstem, but little quantitative information is available on the fate of catecholaminergic neurons associated with the dorsal vagal complex or medullary reticular formation. We therefore examined these neurons in the normal human medulla and in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, using both a melanin stain and immunohistochemical methods with an antiserum against tyrosine hydroxylase. The greatest numbers of catecholaminergic neurons in the ventrolateral reticular formation (A1/C1 group) were located in the far rostral medulla, whereas the largest populations of catecholaminergic cells in the dorsal vagal complex (A2/C2 group) were found at the level of the area postrema. No loss of cells was observed in the A1/C1 group in the parkinsonian brains. In contrast, the A2/C2 group showed moderate loss of neurons, most marked at the level of the area postrema. This difference was entirely due to the loss of neurons in the medial component of the A2 group, a population that normally is only lightly pigmented, while the heavily pigmented neurons in the ventral and intermediate components of the A2 complex were unaffected. Parkinson's disease causes degeneration only of selected populations of medullary catecholaminergic neurons, without apparent relationship to the extent of melanin pigmentation. 
Prevalence of renal artery stenosis in diabetes mellitus--an autopsy study. The prevalence of renal artery stenosis in diabetic patients is unknown, since no noninvasive and valid screening procedures are available. We have therefore evaluated 5194 consecutive autopsy protocols from patients who died between 1980 and 1988. In addition, all available clinical records for patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS) and a random sample were evaluated. It was found that 73% of patients with RAS were hypertensive, and 53% had diabetes, all but one being Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent). Renal artery stenosis was present in 225 (4.3%) of all patients [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.8-4.9], and was not reported in the patients' clinical records in 93% of cases. RAS was present in 8.3% of all diabetic patients (95% CI, 6.8-9.8%), the odds ratio being 3.5 (95% CI, 2.6-4.6). The frequency of renal artery stenosis in diabetic patients with hypertension was 10.1%. Bilateral renal artery stenosis was found in 43% of patients with RAS and diabetes, and in 30% of non-diabetic patients with RAS (P = 0.059). Our results indicate that renal artery stenosis often goes undetected before autopsy. The presence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus increases the risk of renal artery stenosis. The risk of bilateral renal artery stenosis is greater in diabetic patients. These results may be of significance with regard to the diagnostic evaluation and choice of antihypertensive treatment in hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. 
Granulomatous angiitis of the spinal cord associated with Hodgkin's disease. A 28-year-old man had a 5-month history of focal and generalized neurologic symptoms culminating in a thoracic myelopathy. Evaluation revealed granulomatous angiitis of the spinal cord in association with occult nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. In previous reports, manifestations indicative of intracranial involvement have dominated the clinical presentation of granulomatous angiitis associated with Hodgkin's disease. Successful therapy for Hodgkin's disease may result in marked improvement of associated granulomatous angiitis, whereas the lack or failure of therapy results in a uniformly fatal outcome. Definitive antemortem diagnosis of granulomatous angiitis requires a biopsy of involved tissue. The cause of granulomatous angiitis, as well as the nature of its association with Hodgkin's disease, remains unexplained. 
Modifications of the nasal cycle in patients with hypothalamic disorders: Kallmann's syndrome. The nasal cycle is a phenomenon characterized by cyclic changes in the airflow resistance of each nasal fossa from congestion or constriction of the nasal erectile tissue. This phenomenon is caused by alterations in the influence exerted by the autonomic nervous system and is believed to be regulated by a hypothalamic center. In order to verify this hypothesis on the hypothalamic regulation of the nasal cycle, the authors studied a group of subjects with Kallmann's syndrome. This disorder is characterized by coexisting hypothalamic hypogonadism and hyposmia or anosmia due to hypothalamic and olfactory center hypoplasia. An anomalous nasal cycle was found in all the subjects with Kallmann's syndrome. This disorder might be related to hypothalamus atrophy. 
Zinc deficiency. A public health problem? Zinc deficiency occurs in individuals and populations whose diets are low in sources of readily bioavailable zinc such as red meat, and high in unrefined cereals that are rich in phytate and dietary fibers. Dietary zinc deficiency was described nearly three decades ago among the poor of the Middle East. It is now known to occur in children and adolescents from widely diverse areas including Egypt, Iran, Turkey, China, Yugoslavia, Canada, and the United States; and among pregnant women from Iran, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States. Major manifestations include retarded growth and development and an increased incidence of pregnancy complications. Other manifestations may include suppressed immunity, poor healing, dermatitis, and impairments in neuropsychological functions. Precise information as to the numbers of people affected by dietary zinc deficiency is not available. Even so the nature of diets associated with zinc deficiency suggests that mild deficiency is common in some populations. 
Effects of laser-generated tissue debris on aggregation of human platelets. This study examined the effects of laser-generated tissue debris from thrombus, atheroma, and normal aorta on platelet aggregation. Debris supernatant and suspension from lased thrombus induced dose-related aggregation, maximal at 48 +/- 12% and 65 +/- 2%, respectively. Debris suspension from normal aorta induced maximal aggregation of 35 +/- 12%, but the debris from atheromatous aorta surprisingly had no effect on platelet aggregation. The debris particle count was in the range of 10(10) to 10(12) per liter. Aspirin, 0.2 and 2.0 mmol/L, only weakly inhibited the debris-induced aggregation, and heparin up to 10 U/ml was ineffective. However, iloprost reduced aggregation to 40 +/- 11% of control at 0.3 ng/ml, and totally abolished it at 3 ng/ml. Soluble and particulate laser-generated debris from vascular tissue and thrombus may cause platelet aggregation in vitro. This may have implications for laser coronary angioplasty. 
Relation between ST segment shifts during ischemia and thrombin activity in patients with unstable angina. This study was designed to determine in patients with unstable angina whether specific electrocardiographic abnormalities associated with ischemia, the presence of coronary lesions consistent with thrombosis on angiography or the presence of recurrent ischemia reflects increases in thrombin activity as manifested by increased plasma concentrations of fibrinopeptide A. The concentration of fibrinopeptide A in plasma was increased to 6.7 +/- 3.1 nM for the group as a whole (n = 29). Increases were greater in the 17 patients who exhibited reversible ST segment shifts (10.2 +/- 5.2 nM) than in the 12 patients exhibiting reversible T wave abnormalities alone (1.6 +/- 0.2 nM) (p less than 0.01). Nine of the 17 patients with reversible ST segment shifts who underwent coronary angiography had lesions with morphologic characteristics consistent with atherosclerotic plaque complicated by thrombosis compared with only 2 of 9 patients with T wave changes only (p less than 0.05). Plasma concentrations of fibrinopeptide A were markedly elevated in 7 of the 11 patients in whom complex lesions were noted on angiographic examination. Thus, the occurrence of reversible ST segment shifts identifies a group of patients with unstable angina in whom ongoing thrombosis is likely and who may be particularly likely to benefit from antithrombotic therapy. 
Use of intrathecally administered morphine in the treatment of postoperative pain after lumbar spinal surgery: a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Improved control of postoperative pain is now known to reduce the incidence of morbidity. Although spinally administered narcotics have found a clear role in chest and abdominal surgery, their role in lumbar spinal surgery is debated. We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intrathecally administered morphine sulfate after lumbar spinal surgery in 56 patients. Patients received 0, 0.125, 0.25, or 0.5 mg of intrathecally administered morphine during extradural lumbar spinal operations, and the effects on postoperative analog pain scores, narcotic consumption, complications, and length of hospitalization were assessed. As compared with systemic narcotic administration, intrathecally administered morphine provided superior analgesia in a dose-dependent fashion without an increase in narcotic side effects. Consumption of parenteral narcotics on the first postoperative day and over the total hospitalization period decreased in correlation with increasing doses of intrathecally administered morphine. Mean length of hospitalization was significantly decreased, as compared with the control group, in patients receiving 0.25 or 0.5 mg of intrathecally administered morphine. When proper precautions are observed, intrathecally administered morphine can improve the postoperative care of patients undergoing lumbar spinal surgery. 
Common complaints with cardiac implications in children. Chest pain, palpitations, and dizziness are not infrequent complaints in the office of a primary care physician. Historical events and physical findings can lead to a more accurate determination of cardiac causes of these symptoms. Electrocardiogram and chest radiographs are two additional tests most often helpful in determining cardiac causes of symptoms. 
The influence of CLS 2210 on the course of myocardial infarction: a pilot study in man. To assess the effect of CLS 2210 (a new formulation of calcium dobesilate) on the evolution of acute myocardial infarction, 100 patients presenting their first infarct were distributed, according to their sequential admissions to the hospital, into CLS 2210-treated group (50 patients) or a comparison group (50 patients not receiving CLS 2210). The two groups were similar in age, sex, predisposing factors, and site of infarction. Intravenous infusion of CLS 2210 was begun within six hours of onset of chest pain and continued for seventy-two hours. Thereafter, it was given, as oral capsules, in a dose of 1,000 mg every eight hours throughout the hospitalization. Before and during the trial, blood samples were drawn for the measurements of serum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK), and twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained serially in each patient. All objective data were analyzed on a coded basis without reference to the treatment. In the comparison group, thirty-six to forty-eight hours was required for CK to fall to 50% of the baseline value, whereas in the CLS 2210-treated group it reached 50% of the baseline in eighteen to twenty-four hours. For each infarction site, a statistically significant fall was reached earlier in the CLS 2210 group. CK, the ECG index, and the sum of the ST segments showed earlier and more rapid improvement in the CLS 2210 group than in the comparison group. The consumption of narcotic analgesic agents and nitroglycerin was substantially less in the CLS 2210 group than in the comparison group. 
Liver tumors in cirrhosis: experimental study with SPIO-enhanced MR imaging. The influence of cirrhosis on superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the liver was studied in 31 rats. Experimental models included carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis and liver engrafting of rhabdomyosarcoma S4T cells. Hepatic uptake of SPIO measured with relaxometry decreased dramatically with histologic grade, while splenic uptake increased; the same results were achieved by calculating K values. Imaging of 13 tumorous cirrhotic rats confirmed these results by showing a muted decrease in liver signal intensity on spin-echo images after injection of SPIO. Nevertheless, all intrahepatic tumors could be visualized, as confirmed by postmortem examination. On gradient-echo images, postinjection contrast between the tumor and the liver was not affected by cirrhosis. Thus, despite strong impairment of hepatic uptake in cirrhosis, the diagnostic efficacy of MR imaging with SPIO did not seem to be significantly affected. 
Oxygen free radicals and congestive heart failure. Plasma lipid peroxides (malondialdehyde) and thiols were measured in 45 patients with congestive heart failure and 45 controls. Malondialdehyde concentrations were significantly higher in the patients with congestive heart failure (median 9.0 nmol/ml interquartile range (IQR) 7.9-10.2) than in the controls (median 7.7 nmol/ml (IQR 6.9-9.2)). Plasma thiols were significantly lower in congestive heart failure (median 420 mumol/l (IQR 379-480)) than in the controls (median 463 mumol/l (IQR 445-525)). There was a significant but weak negative correlation between malondialdehyde and left ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.35) and a positive correlation between plasma thiols and left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.39). This study provides clinical support for experimental data indicating that free radicals may be important in heart failure. It also suggests that the degree of free radical production may be linked to the severity of the disease. 
The effects of activin on follicle-stimulating hormone secretion and biosynthesis in human glycoprotein hormone-producing pituitary adenomas. The effects of activin on pituitary FSH biosynthesis have been previously characterized using primary rat pituitary cultures; however, little is known of the effects of activin on FSH biosynthesis and secretion in human pituitary tissue. Production of intact glycoprotein hormones and free subunits is increasingly recognized in pituitary tumors; however, the regulation of gonadotropins in such tumors has not been addressed. We have investigated the effects of human recombinant activin on glycoprotein hormone biosynthesis and secretion in primary cultures of 12 human glycoprotein hormone-producing pituitary adenomas and compared this with the effects of activin in normal rat anterior pituitary cells. In 33% of the human pituitary tumors studied, significant (P less than 0.05) increases in FSH beta secretion occurred in response to incubation with 20 ng/mL activin for 24 h (19-287% stimulation), without changes in the production of intact FSH. A Northern analysis performed on cells derived from one tumor indicated that FSH beta mRNA levels increased 350% after activin treatments; however, FSH secretion did not parallel the mRNA changes. None of the human glycoprotein hormone-producing tumors significantly increased FSH secretion in response to activin. To validate the biological activity of recombinant human activin-A and to confirm time and dose conditions for the human tumor cultures, we also examined its ability to stimulate FSH production in rat pituitary cultures. Activin (20 ng/mL) added to the culture medium significantly increased FSH secretion and steady state levels of FSH beta mRNA after 24 h. These data indicate that some glycoprotein hormone-producing pituitary tumors treated with purified activin have discordant responses of intact gonadotropins and free subunit responses. In contrast to responses in normal rat gonadotrophs, FSH beta biosynthetic pathways may be uncoupled from intact FSH secretion in a subset of glycoprotein hormone-producing pituitary adenomas. 
Factors influencing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease in childhood. We have reviewed the outcome of all patients undergoing their first intestinal resection for Crohn's disease at this hospital between 1970 and 1987. Recurrence rates, defined by recurrent intestinal symptoms and radiological confirmation of mucosal disease, were calculated using survival analysis. Age, sex, anatomical location of disease, indication for surgery, preoperative duration of symptomatic disease, use of preoperative bowel rest, and pathological features of the resected bowel were analysed individually and jointly as potential risk factors influencing postoperative recurrence of disease. Eighty two patients (age, mean (SD) 14.8 (2.5) years) underwent intestinal resection and were followed postoperatively for a minimum of one year (mean 5.3 (3.3) years). Anatomical location of disease, indication for surgery, and preoperative duration of symptomatic disease were the only factors that significantly influenced the duration of the recurrence free interval. Patients with diffuse ileocolonic inflammation experienced earlier recurrence (50% at one year) than children with predominantly small bowel disease (50% recurrence at five years, p less than 0.0001). Failure of medical therapy independent of disease location as the sole indication for surgery was associated with an earlier relapse than when surgery was performed for a specific intestinal complication such as abscess or obstruction (p less than 0.003). Patients undergoing resection within one year of onset of symptoms experienced delayed recrudescence of active disease (30% recurrence by eight years) compared with patients whose preoperative duration of symptomatic disease was longer (50% recurrence by four years when preoperative duration of disease was one to four years and 50% by three years when disease had been present greater than four years preoperatively, p = 0.03). 
Testing for Helicobacter pylori in the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with almost all cases of peptic ulcer. Using Bayes' formula, we evaluated whether testing for H. pylori in a patient with proven ulcer might help in the work-up of a Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZE). A negative test for H. pylori in a patient with duodenal ulcer would raise a pretest probability for ZE of 10-20% to a posttest range of 61-78%. The information provided by a negative test result with respect to ZE is greater in younger than in older ulcer patients. It is also greater in duodenal than gastric ulcer. We conclude that testing for H. pylori in ulcer patients, in whom ZE constitutes a possible differential diagnosis, adds substantially to the decision making at relatively low cost and little additional risk to the patient. 
Rectal potential differences in irritable bowel syndrome and in inflammatory bowel diseases in man. We have studied rectal potential difference (pd) in 200 subjects: 30 healthy volunteers or control patients, 46 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and painless diarrhoea (group I), 60 IBS patients without diarrhoea (group II) and 64 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with (group III, n = 41) or without (group IV, n = 23) rectal involvement. Pd measurement used a rectal perfused probe and a subcutaneous needle both connected, via agar-KCl bridges, to calomel electrodes and a millivoltmeter. Statistical analysis used Student's t-test for paired and unpaired data and Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate. Mean rectal pd values were, respectively -43.5 +/- 8.7 mV in control group, -32.9 +/- 10.2 mV in IBS-group I patients (P less than 0.001), -41.3 +/- 12 mV in IBS-group II patients (NS), -21.4 +/- 14.1 mV in IBD patients with rectal involvement (P less than 0.001), and -45.1 +/- 14.3 mV in IBD-group IV patients (NS). A histological examination was performed in 36 IBS patients; mean rectal pd was significantly decreased in patients showing abnormal patterns (n = 27, pd = -31.8 +/- 9 mV) compared to patients with normal mucosa (n = 9, pd = -41.1 +/- 6.5 mV; P less than 0.01). These results show that: (1) potential difference is significantly decreased in patients with ulcerative and rectal involvement; (2) in patients with Crohn's disease, normal rectal pd values do not assess the appearance of colonic mucosa above; (3) patients with IBS and diarrhoea also present a significant diminution in mean rectal pd. Although the mechanisms involved remain unclear, rectal pd measurement appears to be an objective test for intestinal mucosae weakness in functional or inflammatory diseases of the large intestine and rectum. 
Colonoscopic surveillance after polypectomy: considerations of cost effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of the current recommendation that persons who have had an adenomatous colon polyp removed have periodic colonoscopic surveillance at fixed and regular intervals. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using data from the medical literature in a simulation model to estimate the costs of and the risk for perforation associated with periodic colonoscopic surveillance for a 50-year-old man followed for 30 years. MAIN RESULTS: A program of colonoscopy every 3 years would incur cumulatively a 1.4% risk for colon perforation, a 0.11% risk for perforation-related death, and direct physician costs of $2071 for colonoscopy (discounted at 5%). If a 50-year-old man's cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer is 2.5% after the removal of a single small adenoma and if effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance every 3 years is 100%, then one death from cancer could be prevented by doing 283 colonoscopies, incurring 0.6 perforations, 0.04 perforation-related deaths, and direct physician costs of $82,000. If surveillance were 50% effective and the cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer were 1.25%--a plausible scenario--1131 colonoscopies would be required to prevent one death from cancer, incurring 2.3 perforations, 0.17 perforation-related deaths, and physician costs of $331,000. CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance is very sensitive to estimates of the cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer after polypectomy as well as to surveillance efficacy. For persons whose remaining risk for death from cancer may be low, such as persons with a single small adenoma, recommendations for colonoscopic surveillance at fixed and regular intervals may be excessively costly. 
Dehydration syndromes. Oral rehydration and fluid replacement. Dehydration caused by diarrhea remains a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Dehydration is a common clinical presentation seen by most physicians. Clinical diagnosis depends on the recognition of signs and symptoms as well as change in weight. Laboratory studies are helpful in categorizing the dehydration as isotonic, hyponatremic, or hypernatremic, which is necessary to plan appropriate therapy. In many situations, oral rehydration therapy is possible and desirable. Intravenous rehydration remains the standard of care for children with severe dehydration and shock. 
Evaluation of the painful shoulder. A prospective comparison of magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomographic arthrography, ultrasonography, and operative findings. Twenty-one patients who had had pain in the shoulder for more than three months were evaluated with ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging followed by computerized tomographic arthrography. The results of the imaging studies were then compared with the operative findings. Magnetic resonance imaging was found to be the most useful modality for establishment of the etiology of pain in the shoulder due to disease of the rotator cuff, instability associated with abnormality of the glenoid labrum, subacromial impingement, stenosis of the coracoacromial arch, and osteoarthrosis of either the glenohumeral or the acromioclavicular joint. The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging was found to depend on both the operator and the technique and was decreased in extremely obese patients, due to difficulties in positioning, and in patients who had had a previous operation. Magnetic resonance imaging was more accurate than either computerized tomographic arthrography or ultrasonography in identifying partial-thickness tears (intrasubstance changes in the rotator cuff). Magnetic resonance imaging provided the same level of accuracy as computerized tomographic arthrography in the detection of abnormalities of the glenoid labrum. 
Single center experience of the effect of delayed function on outcome in retransplant recipients of cadaveric renal allografts. The incidence of DRF in the regraft study group was most commonly seen in patients with a historic high level of HLA sensitization. Primary NF was an immune mediated event seen in 63% of third regrafts. Delayed use of CyA with ALG induction coverage provides good graft survival with either double or triple maintenance therapy. Stricter patient selection for third transplants and aggressive clinical monitoring of the regrafted patient has provided a 1-year actuarial graft survival result of 88% at our transplant center. 
Uterine incarceration during the third trimester: a rare complication of pregnancy. Uterine incarceration that manifests during the third trimester or at term is a serious and rare complication of pregnancy. The pregnant patient may complain of low-abdominal pain, low-back pain, urinary retention, and constipation, or the patient may be asymptomatic until labor begins. The diagnosis is difficult, and physical findings can be misleading. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful if the anteriorly displaced cervix is clearly depicted. If incarceration of the retroverted uterus persists until term, a cesarean section is necessary. Recurrent uterine incarceration has been reported; therefore, the patient should be monitored closely during subsequent pregnancies. Herein we describe three cases of uterine incarceration during the third trimester and review the literature with respect to incidence, differential diagnosis, management, and complications of this condition. 
Pathologic review of consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens. Nerve sparing versus nonnerve sparing. Retrospective pathologic analysis was conducted of specimens from 88 radical retropubic prostatectomy operations performed between 1982 and 1987 inclusive. The median age of patients was sixty years (range, 46 to 73 years). Of the 88 radical prostatectomies performed, 51 were nerve-sparing (40 bilateral) and 37 were nonnerve-sparing (11 unilateral) procedures. Preoperative clinical staging was similar in both groups. Thirty-five of 37 patients (95%) in nonnerve-staging group and 51 of 51 patients (100%) in nerve-sparing group had clinical Stage B2 disease or less. Pathologic staging in both groups was also similar. In 26 of 37 patients (70%) in nonnerve-sparing group and in 35 of 51 patients (69%) in nerve-sparing group, disease remained localized to the prostate. Both groups were analyzed retrospectively to determine whether or not the incidences of microinvasion of capsule and of extraprostatic disease differed. Review of the apical and lateral margins of the specimens revealed no statistically significant difference in either the degree of microinvasion of capsule or the incidence of extraprostatic disease between the groups. 
Cessation of driving and unsafe motor vehicle operation by dementia patients. We surveyed 522 consecutive patients from a dementia clinic to assess duration of driving after disease onset and instances of unsafe motor vehicle operation in the preceding 6 months. Among the 333 patients licensed to drive at the onset of dementia, the median duration of driving after onset was 28.6 months. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease drove significantly longer than those with other dementia syndromes. Of the 93 patients still driving at the time of the survey, approximately one third were reported to have had at least one form of unsafe motor vehicle operation in the past 6 months, including 21 patients with motor vehicle accidents. Motor vehicle accidents were associated with use of prescription medications with sedative properties and with lower subjective ratings of the patient's driving ability by the informant. 
Inguinal herniorrhaphy. Reduced morbidity by service standardization. To ascertain if service specialization and procedure standardization would improve the complication rate of inguinal herniorrhaphy, the results of all inguinal herniorrhaphies performed during a 3-year period by board-certified general surgeons who also performed a variety of other procedures common to the field of general surgery, assisted by general surgical residents (group B, 390 patients), were compared in the same institution with the results of inguinal herniorrhaphy when performed during 3 years under protocol by a Hernia Service directed by a senior faculty member assisted by junior surgical residents (group C, 442 patients). Group B patients had essentially no follow-up until they reappeared for care at the Hernia Service, whereas patients in group C achieved an 82% 7-year follow-up. The infection and recurrence rates of group C patients (0.45% and 0.9%, respectively) were significantly better than those of group B patients (5.9% and 4.6%, respectively). These results suggest that in our institution, the concentration of patients with hernias in a hernia service, manned by a specialized surgeon, produced better short- and long-term results than those obtained by general surgeons not dedicated to the field of hernia repair. Further studies will be necessary to confirm these findings. 
Primary cutaneous adenoid cystic carcinoma: a case report and review of the literature. A case of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the ear in a 67-year-old man is presented along with a review of the literature. Adenoid cystic carcinoma most commonly arises in the salivary glands. Primary cutaneous adenoid cystic carcinoma occurs principally in the scalp and chest. Perineural invasion is seen in at least half the cases and is associated with an increased recurrence rate. Treatment consists of wide local resection with tumor-free margins. Just over half the patients will develop recurrence, with long tumor-free intervals necessitating long-term follow-up. Distant metastases are rarely seen. Radiation therapy is not curative and should be reserved for palliation. 
Hepatosplenic candidiasis: successful treatment with fluconazole. PURPOSE: To determine if fluconazole is effective treatment for hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients (ages 3 to 44) with acute leukemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who did not respond to prior antifungal therapy were treated with fluconazole. RESULTS: All six patients had fever and three had nausea and vomiting; computed tomographic (CT) scan showed lucencies in the liver in six, lucencies in the spleen in five, and lucencies in the kidneys in three. Prior therapy with 1.6 to 4 g of amphotericin B in the five adults and 526 mg of amphotericin B in the child (with the addition of flucytosine in four) failed to improve clinical symptoms or lucencies in the liver, spleen, and kidneys seen on CT scan. Fluconazole was given at a dose of 200 to 400 mg daily (70 to 100 mg in the child) for 2 to 14 months. All patients had resolution of fever and other symptoms in 2 to 8 weeks. Improvement of the lesions noted on CT scan was seen in 4 to 8 weeks in all patients. Total resolution of lesions noted on CT scan occurred by 4 weeks in two patients, but took 4 to 5 months for three patients and 13 months for one patient. Three patients had relapse of their acute leukemia and two died, presumably cured of their candidiasis. Two patients underwent successful bone marrow transplantation without relapse of their candidiasis. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole appears to be useful in the treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine therapy. 
Usefulness of noninvasive diagnostic tools for diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in patients with a normal chest radiograph. The value of bedside examination and noninvasive tests in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) among patients with a normal chest radiograph was investigated. Normal chest radiographs were present in 20 of 260 patients (8%) with acute PE and in 113 of 642 (18%) with suspected acute PE, in whom the diagnosis was excluded. A partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood less than or equal to 70 mm Hg in a dyspneic patient with a normal chest radiograph was more often seen among patients with PE (9 of 17, 53%) than among patients in whom PE was excluded (18 of 93, 19%; p less than 0.01). However, no combinations of blood gases, signs and symptoms were strictly diagnostic. High probability ventilation/perfusion scans among patients with a normal chest radiograph were indicative of PE in only 6 of 9 patients (67%). Among patients with low-probability ventilation/perfusion scans, 8 of 47 (17%) had PE. This study showed that the combination of dyspnea and hypoxia in a patient with a normal chest radiograph is a useful clue to the diagnosis of PE. Although intuition suggested that ventilation/perfusion scans would yield better results in patients with a normal chest radiograph, the ability to diagnose PE by ventilation/perfusion scans in this subset of patients was not enhanced, except by a reduction of the percentage of patients with intermediate probability scans. 
Pulmonary hemorrhage and necrotizing glomerulonephritis without glomerular immune deposits: report of two cases. Two children with a syndrome of pulmonary hemorrhage and necrotizing, nonimmune glomerulonephritis are reported. A boy and girl, both of East Indian descent, developed recurrent lung infiltrates from the age of 3 months and 2 years, respectively. Both subsequently presented with pulmonary hemorrhage, fever, arthritis, hematuria, and nephrotic range proteinuria at 1.5 and 6 years of age, respectively. Renal biopsy in each case showed acute, severe, focal and segmental, necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis without immune deposits. Subsequent renal biopsies revealed severe glomerular and tubulointerstitial scarring. No vasculitis or granulomas were seen on renal, skin, or lung biopsies. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were not detected in sera taken 1.5 years in the boy and 3.5 years in the girl after the onset of renal disease. The boy was treated with prednisone, azathioprine, and plasmapheresis, but developed progressive renal impairment and commenced dialysis within 4 years. Subsequent to renal transplantation, he developed an immunoblastic lymphoma and died. The girl was treated initially with prednisone and later with cyclophosphamide. After 4 years, she had a normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). While necrotizing nonimmune glomerulonephritis associated with pulmonary hemorrhage is rare, and cases are characteristically difficult to classify because of many overlapping features, it is possible that these children had a unique illness. 
Detection of deletions and cryptic translocations in Miller-Dieker syndrome by in situ hybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using two cosmid probes (41A and P13) from the Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) critical region in 17p13.3 was performed in a blinded comparison of three MDS patients with submicroscopic deletions and in four normal relatives used as controls. The controls showed both chromosome 17 homologues labeled in 85%-95% of cells, while each patient showed only one homologue labeled in 75%-80% of cells. Two MDS patients with cryptic translocations were also studied. In one case, a patient and her mother had the same der(17) (p+), but the reciprocal product of the translocation could not be identified in the mother by G-banding (i.e., it was a "half-cryptic" translocation). FISH revealed a 3q;17p translocation. The other case involved a patient with apparently normal karyotype. Because a large molecular deletion was found, a translocation involving two G-negative telomeres (i.e., a "full-cryptic" translocation) was postulated. FISH studies on her father and normal brother showed an 8q;17p translocation. These studies demonstrate that in situ hybridization is an efficient method for deletion detection in Miller-Dieker syndrome. More important, parental studies by FISH on patients demonstrating molecular deletions and a normal karyotype may identify cryptic translocation events, which cannot be detected by other molecular genetic strategies. Similar in situ strategies for deletion detection can be developed for other microdeletion syndromes, such as Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome. 
Complication of a penile prosthesis reservoir: venous compression masquerading as a deep venous thrombosis. We report a case of vascular compromise secondary to the reservoir of an inflatable penile prosthesis. The problem masqueraded as deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity of a patient 3 years after a spinal cord injury. 
Antibiotic prophylaxis and tourniquet inflation in total knee arthroplasty. Twenty-four patients receiving total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were randomized into one of three groups based on tourniquet inflation one, two, or five minutes after administration 1 g cefazolin. Simultaneous serum, soft-tissue, and bone samples were obtained at regular intervals during surgery. All soft-tissue and bone samples were corrected for cefazolin content. The percentage of cefazolin penetration into soft tissue and bone was calculated using the area under the concentration time curve. Adequate cefazolin concentrations for soft tissue and bone were defined as greater than or equal to 4 x minimum inhibitory concentration90 (MIC90 = 1 microgram/ml) of cefazolin to Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Patients were similar in age, actual body weight, creatinine clearance, and length of tourniquet inflation. The median percentage of cefazolin penetration into soft tissue and bone for the five-, two-, and one-minute groups was 14.5% and 4.6%, 6.7% and 3.0%, and 5.9% and 4.6%, respectively; the percentage of penetration into soft tissue between the five- and one-minute groups was statistically significant. A higher percentage of patients achieved the desired cefazolin concentration (greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/g) if a five-minute interval was selected. The five-minute group achieved the highest mean ratios of concentration to MIC compared with the two- and one-minute groups, although the differences were not statistically significant. The standard 1 g of cefazolin with a five-minute interval between administration and tourniquet inflation resulted in adequate mean soft-tissue and bone concentrations for prophylaxis during TKA with a tourniquet time less than two hours. Additional doses are not warranted after tourniquet release. 
A time-dependent study of passive esophageal wall properties and collagen content in rabbits with esophageal varices. The passive biomechanical wall properties of the esophagus were studied in rabbits with esophageal varices and controls using a four-electrode impedance technique. Stepwise pressure inflation and deflation was done for analysis of esophageal cross-sectional area, compliance, and hysteresis monthly during six months. At sacrifice, the esophageal collagen content was determined. A small but statistically insignificant increase in compliance was observed during the six-month observation period in both groups. No differences were observed between the groups (P greater than 0.3). No change in hysteresis was observed in either group. The group with esophageal varices had significantly higher collagen content in the distal esophagus when compared to controls (P less than 0.05). No difference was demonstrated in the proximal part. No correlation was demonstrated between the collagen content and esophageal compliance. The study demonstrated that the method allows measurement of luminal cross-sectional area and tissue elasticity. No relationship was found, however, between the collagen content and compliance of the rabbit esophagus. 
Validity of cerebrovascular mortality rates. Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) mortality rates are being increasingly used to establish a relationship with coronary heart disease risk factors. Cerebrovascular mortality rates suffer from the same general defects as coronary heart disease mortality rates but with greater diagnostic error in regard to subdivisions of CVD or stroke. These vital statistics, whether national or regional, are too inaccurate for scientific use and cannot be regarded as representing true mortality rates for any country. Moreover, clinical CVD is an inappropriate surrogate for severity of atherosclerosis, providing inexact data and allowing indeterminate overlap in epidemiologic studies. 
Blood conservation techniques and platelet function in cardiac surgery. Postoperative alterations in platelet function induced by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are of importance. The effect on platelet aggregation of three different techniques for reducing blood consumption was studied in 30 patients undergoing elective aortocoronary bypass grafting from the beginning of anesthesia until the 1st postoperative day. The patients were randomly divided into three groups, in which 1) a cell separator was used during and after CPB; 2) a hemofiltration device was used; and 3) high-dose aprotinin was used in order to reduce the need of homologous blood. A fourth group undergoing neurosurgery procedures served as a control. Platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (concentration 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, and 2.0 microM), collagen (4 microliters/ml), and epinephrine (25 microM) was determined by the turbidimetric method. Platelet aggregation was not significantly changed in the control group, indicating that the operation itself did not impair platelet function. At the end of the operation (after retransfusion of the salvaged pump blood), the maximum aggregation and maximum gradient of aggregation induced by all three inductors were most reduced (significantly) in the cell-separator patients. On the 1st postoperative day, platelet aggregation in the hemofiltration patients and the patients treated with aprotinin had normalized. Aggregation of patients pretreated with high-dose aprotinin was not different from that of the hemofiltration patients throughout the investigation. Blood loss was significantly highest in the cell-separator group (770 +/- 400 ml on the 1st postoperative day) but was not different between the hemofiltration (390 +/- 230 ml) and the aprotinin-treated patients (260 +/- 160 ml). 
A prosthesis augmentation device for the prevention of recurrent hip dislocation. A preliminary report. At present, revision is the only standard option for cases of recurrent hip prosthesis dislocation. A device is described that contains the head of the femoral component, preventing dislocation, while only slightly restricting external rotation of the affected leg. The device can be inserted through a small incision, minimizing operation time. This device differs from others, e.g., the reversed acetabular cup, by being predrilled (with drill guide supplied), modular in design, and tailored to the dimensions of the cup site. 
Transvaginal sonographic characterization of ovarian disease: evaluation of a new scoring system to predict ovarian malignancy. With the advent of high-frequency transvaginal ultrasonography, new opportunities are presented to better define ovarian lesions. The goal of this study was to develop a scoring system using transvaginal sonographic characterization of pelvic/ovarian lesions. Our purpose was to maximize the discrimination between benign and malignant entities. Transvaginal sonographic pelvic images of 143 patients were correlated with surgical findings or histopathology. Of 281 ovaries, 108 had benign lesions (30 endometriomas, 24 teratomas, 21 simple cysts, and 33 other abnormalities) and 20 had malignancies. The scoring system devised was useful in distinguishing benign from malignant masses, with a specificity of 83%, sensitivity of 100%, and positive and negative predictive values of 37 and 100%, respectively. Further experience and refinements of this method of scoring should maximize the benefit of high-resolution transvaginal sonography of ovarian lesions. 
Conformational structure of a monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody to the monoclonal anti-adenocarcinoma-associated carbohydrate antibody YH206. The mAb AI206 (IgG1) is an anti-Id antibody of mAb YH206 (IgM) to adenocarcinoma-associated carbohydrate Ag and inhibits the reaction of mAb YH206 to YH206 Ag at low concentrations. By Western blot analysis, mAb AI206 only reacted with unreduced mAb YH206, whereas it did not react with reduced mAb YH206. Furthermore, mAb AI206 reacted with IgM subunit (180 kDa), F(ab')2 (110 kDa), and F(ab) (50 kDa) of pepsin-treated unreduced mAb YH206. Thus, mAb AI206 recognized the structure of F(ab) of mAb YH206. The mAb YH206 reacted with unreduced mAb AI206, F(ab')2 (110 kDa), and F(ab) (50 kDa) of pepsin-treated unreduced mAb AI206. It is presumed that mAb YH206 and mAb AI206 recognize each other in an unreduced condition but not a reduced condition. The recognition of such a conformational Id on F(ab) is important. Because mAb YH206 recognized the carbohydrate on YH206 Ag as well as the peptide on mAb AI206, the conformation on F(ab) of mAb AI206 may mimic the carbohydrate structure on YH206 Ag. In fact, YH206 antibody activity was induced in syngeneic mouse serum immunized with mAb AI206. These observations suggest that the internal image of YH206 carbohydrate Ag is preserved within the conformational Id on F(ab) of mAb AI206. 
Growth-inhibitory effect of combination chemotherapy for human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Sensitivities to anti-tumor drugs, mitomycin C (MMC), aclarubicin hydrochloride (ACR), doxorubicin hydrochloride (ADR), cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5FU), were examined using PK-1, -8, -9, -12, -14, and -16 cell lines derived from human pancreatic cancer. These cell lines showed different sensitivities to each of the above anti-tumor drugs. The concentrations required for 50% growth-inhibition (IC50) after 2 hours of exposure were 0.096 to 0.35 micrograms/ml for MMC, 0.0074 to 0.0076 micrograms/ml for ACR, 0.033 to 0.23 micrograms/ml for ADR, 0.35 to 1.9 micrograms/ml for cisplatin, and 21 to 42 micrograms/ml for 5FU, IC50 of each anti-tumor drug decreased significantly after 48 hours of exposure. The combination of any two out of MMC, ACR, and 5FU showed synergistic inhibition of the growth of PK-1 and PK-8 cell lines. These results show that MMC, ACR, ADR, cisplatin, and 5FU have sufficient anti-tumor effect against six human pancreatic cancer cell lines even at clinically achievable concentrations and exposure times, and chemotherapy for pancreatic cancers requires naturally effective drug delivery into cancer tissues. 
Cerebrospinal fluid atrial natriuretic factor in intracranial disease. We tested the hypothesis that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is an indicator of brain injury in patients with intracranial disease. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was measured in 72 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from 28 patients with intraventricular drains and in nine samples from outpatient controls undergoing diagnostic lumbar puncture. Levels were correlated with diagnosis; systemic fluid administration; concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma; intracranial pressure; sodium, glucose, and protein concentrations, osmolality, and cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid; sodium concentration in the serum; and hemodynamics. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was highest in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with intracerebral hematoma, followed by those with obstructive hydrocephalus and subarachnoid hemorrhage (19 +/- 2, 13 +/- 3, and 8 +/- 2 pg/ml, respectively); atrial natriuretic factor concentration was less than 4 pg/ml in the controls. Patients treated with fluid restriction had significantly higher atrial natriuretic factor levels than those receiving maintenance or high-volume fluids (16 +/- 3, 8 +/- 2, 10 +/- 1 pg/ml, respectively). The concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma was significantly elevated in patients with intracerebral hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage (155 +/- 38 and 92 +/- 20 pg/ml, respectively) and did not correlate with fluid administration or the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid. Neither cerebrospinal fluid nor plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor correlated with intracranial pressure; cerebrospinal fluid sodium, glucose, or protein concentrations, osmolality, or cell count; serum sodium concentration; or hemodynamics. We conclude that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is a nonspecific indicator of brain injury. 
Incidence of venous thromboembolism verified by necropsy over 30 years. OBJECTIVE--To determine the incidence of venous thromboembolism in all necropsy reports over 30 years. DESIGN--Study of all necropsies in one hospital in 1987 and longitudinal analysis of results of necropsy in 1957, 1964, 1975, and 1987. SETTING--Departments of general surgery, infectious diseases, internal medicine, oncology, and orthopaedics in a Swedish general hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Number of cases of venous thromboembolism. RESULTS--About a third of all necropsies showed venous thromboembolism. In 1987, 260 of 347 necropsies showing venous thromboembolism found pulmonary embolism, of which 93 were classified as fatal, 90 as contributory, and 77 as incidental. Only 21 contributory or fatal postoperative pulmonary emboli were seen. In only 106 of 260 patients with pulmonary embolism did routine necropsy not show the source of embolism. Calf veins were not routinely examined. Deep venous thrombosis was seen in 239 patients in 1987. The incidence of venous thromboembolism in the four years studied was remarkably stable except in the department of orthopaedics, where the proportion fell from 60.7% in 1975 to 32.2% in 1987 (p less than 0.05), although there were only a few patients. CONCLUSIONS--The overall incidence of venous thromboembolism has not changed over 30 years. During this period the proportion of the population aged over 65 has doubled, and this may have masked the beneficial effects of prophylaxis and early mobilisation. Prevalences corrected for age are needed. 
Bypass surgery for chronic stable angina: predictors of survival benefit and strategy for patient selection. The variable mortality risk associated with chronic stable angina calls for careful selection of patients for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) if the aim of management is to prolong life. The randomized and observational studies done in the last 20 years have identified the variables relevant to patient selection and thus have provided a rational basis for such clinical decisions. These studies showed that the sicker the patient, as gauged by relevant measures of coronary disease and cardiovascular morbidity, the more likely it is that CABG will prolong life. A CABG-related improvement in survival is therefore more likely to occur the worse the left ventricular function; the greater the number of diseased vessels; the more proximal the location of coronary lesions (more muscle is threatened by such lesions); the greater the severity of the lesions as determined by angiography; the more severe the angina; the more easily provocable the ischemia or the more extreme the measures of ischemia; and, within limits, the older the patient. Greater survival gain after CABG also occurs in patients with peripheral vascular disease, in patients with baseline electrocardiographic ST-segment and T-wave changes, and probably in women. Thus, patients are likely to live longer after CABG if they have left main disease; three-vessel disease with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 50%), class III or IV angina, provocable ischemia, or disease in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery; two-vessel disease with proximal left anterior descending artery involvement; and two-vessel disease with class III or IV angina as well as either severe left ventricular dysfunction alone or moderate left ventricular dysfunction together with at least one proximal lesion. When the decision of whether to do CABG is less clear-cut, the presence of peripheral vascular disease, female sex, baseline electrocardiographic ST-segment and T-wave changes, or older age (over 60 but under 80 years) should weigh in favor of doing CABG. In general, patients with single-vessel disease do not seem to derive survival benefit from CABG. 
A case of chronic mountain sickness diagnosed by routine pulmonary function tests. In summary, this is a patient who presented with respiratory acidosis and cor pulmonale. The major diagnostic challenge was in differentiating primary cardiopulmonary disease from a central abnormality of ventilatory drive. The arterial blood gases showed a normal A-a gradient suggesting hypoventilation as the etiology of his hypoxemia. Pulmonary function testing showed air trapping, but a relatively normal FEV1/FVC and airways resistance. The literature suggests that most altitude natives have depressed hypoxemic and hypercapnic drives with a distinct subset demonstrating a profoundly depressed drive to ventilation. This latter group has been labeled as having chronic mountain sickness or Monge's disease. As one might expect, ventilatory control during sleep is also abnormal in these patients with CMS. Our patient indeed showed typical frequent severe desaturations with hypopnea. The diagnosis of CMS in our patient was made with routine arterial blood gases and standard pulmonary function tests. Additional tests of ventilatory responsiveness to oxygen and carbon dioxide could have been performed, but are not necessary to make the diagnosis. 
Factors common to successful therapy for the obese patient. The majority of patients treated for obesity regain lost weight after treatment. We speculate on what might be done to improve long-term success rates by examining the factors associated with success or relapse. An emphasis on exercise and prescribing more gradual changes in diet and exercise appears to be associated with better outcomes. There may be a need to conceptualize obesity as a food dependency disorder not amenable to self-control strategies. External social control through peer support groups may be indicated to help patients through temptations. 
Fulminant hepatic failure after repeated exposure to isoflurane anesthesia: a case report. A previously healthy but obese 26-yr-old woman was diagnosed as having hepatic dysfunction 17 days after the third of three consecutive exposures to isoflurane anesthesia for paranasal sinus surgery. Serum laboratory findings included elevated aminotransferases and bilirubin. Radiographical evaluations showed no evidence of extrahepatic disease. Serological studies were negative for acute viral infections, and serum copper was normal. The patient's condition deteriorated over the ensuing 17 days, with hyperreflexia, hypoglycemia and a rapid fall in serum aminotransferases with a concomitant rise in bilirubin level and prothrombin time despite maximal medical support. The liver volume as shown by computed tomography fell from 1,290 cm3 to 680 cm3 over 6 days. The patient underwent successful orthotopic liver transplantation 25 days after onset of symptoms. Histopathological examination of the resected liver showed submassive and massive necrosis, with a few foci of microvesicular steatosis and ultrastructural evidence of mitochondrial abnormalities. Although we found insufficient evidence to prove that this case was caused by isoflurane anesthesia, the clinical course and histopathological findings are similar to those in hepatic injury caused by halothane anesthesia. Therefore we report this as a possible case of fulminant hepatic failure resulting from isoflurane anesthesia. 
Anterior decompression in cervical spine trauma: does the timing of surgery affect the outcome? To clarify the ideal timing of anterior decompression and stabilization for all patients with cervical spine trauma as well as its efficacy for patients with complete deficits, we reviewed the records of 103 consecutive patients with cervical spine trauma (50 incomplete deficits, Group A; 53 complete deficits, Group B) who underwent this procedure during a 5-year period at the Shock Trauma Center. We subdivided each group according to time of surgery: early and delayed (less than 24 and greater than 24 hours past injury, respectively). In Group A, 10 patients underwent early surgery and 40 patients underwent delayed surgery (range, 2 to 77 days past injury; mean, 13 days). One patient (2.5%) in the delayed group died. The following data refer to the early and delayed subgroups, respectively: average acute hospitalization, 20 and 22 days; patient motor score improvement (at discharge), 37.2 and 45.0%; functional grade improvement (at discharge), 5 (50.0%) and 9 (22.5%) patients. At 1-year follow-up, every patient who had had a deficit had progressed to a higher functional grade. In Group B, 35 patients underwent early surgery and 18 underwent delayed surgery (range, 2 to 45 days past injury; mean, 13 days). One patient (2.9%) in the early group died. The following data refer to the early and delayed subgroups, respectively: average acute hospitalization, 38.7 and 45.2 days (P less than 0.05); respiratory care (number of daily suction procedures), 6.0 and 9.86 (P less than 0.05); patient motor score improvement (at discharge), 3.9 and 4.5%; functional grade improvement (at discharge), 4 (11.4%) and 1 (5.6%) patients. 
Increased circulating concentration of the N-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor prohormone in persons with pheochromocytomas. To investigate the possible relationship of hypertension and the N-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) prohormone which contains two peptides [i.e. pro ANF-(1-30) and pro-ANF-(31-67)] with blood pressure-lowering effects, we examined the circulating levels of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone in three patients with pheochromocytomas before surgery, during an increase in their blood pressure with surgical manipulation of their tumors, and after surgery when their blood pressures returned to normal. The circulating levels of the whole N-terminus [amino acids 1-98; pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) from the midportion of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone were increased 2-fold in patients with both extraadrenal and intraadrenal pheochromocytomas. In both the intraadrenal and extraadrenal patients N-terminus [pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) circulating levels increased further during surgical manipulation and returned to normal after surgical removal of their respective tumors. Each of these pheochromocytomas was found to have pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67)-binding sites that were functional, since they could enhance the guanylate cyclase-cGMP system 2-fold in these pheochromocytomas. The entire 126 amino acids of the prohormone were present within each of the pheochromocytomas, since both the whole N-terminus and C-terminus (i.e. ANF) of the prohormone were present. Examination of the pheochromocytomas by electron microscopy revealed electron-dense granules similar to those in the heart, which have been associated with the synthesis and storage of the ANF prohormone. We conclude that 1) the whole N-terminus [pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) of the ANF prohormone circulate at higher concentrations in persons with pheochromocytomas and return to normal with removal of the tumors; 2) pheochromocytomas contain specific binding sites for pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67); 3) these binding sites are functional, since pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67) could enhance the enzyme guanylate cyclase within these tumors; and 4) the entire 126 amino acids of the ANF prohormone are present within these tumors, which have electron-dense granules associated with polypeptide hormone synthesis, suggesting that the ANF prohormone is being synthesized within the pheochromocytomas. 
A case-control study of the effects of birth by caesarean section on intrapartum and neonatal mortality among twins weighing 1500-2499 g. The aim of this nationally-based, matched case-control study was to assess the impact of birth by caesarean section on intrapartum, and neonatal mortality among twins weighing 1500-2499 g, born in Sweden between 1973 and 1983. By using data held at the National Medical Birth Registry, Stockholm, 91 such pregnancies (study cases) where one or both twins died were identified. For each case, two controls (in all 182 pregnancies) were allotted at random from the rest of the twin pregnancies, with similar birthweight (+/- 100 g) and year of delivery (+/- 1 year). The number of twins that died was reduced from 73 during the first four years to 22 between 1977 and 1980, and to 6 during the last 3 years of the study period. Almost a quarter (23.1%) had a lethal malformation. The caesarean section rate increased during the study period, but did not differ between cases and controls (chi 2 = 1.0; P greater than 0.05). The analysis could not confirm a significant difference between cases and controls regarding the number of infants born vaginally in non-vertex presentation (chi 2 = 0.1; P greater than 0.05). The results of this study appear to indicate that birth by caesarean section was not a major factor related to the improved fetal outcome. 
The prognostic significance of glial fibrillary acidic protein staining in medulloblastoma. Histologic and immunohistochemical properties of 53 medulloblastomas were analyzed with regard to clinical features and survival rate. No correlation was found between survival rate and histologic features of the tumor, such as desmoplastic reaction, number of mitoses, hemorrhages, necrosis, endothelial proliferation, glomerular arrangement, calcifications, rosettes, or oligodendroglial cells. However 82% of the patients with positive glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining in numerous tumor cells survived more than 5 years; only 30% survived that long if their tumor cells were GFAP negative (P = 0.0093). This significant difference was not related to the mode of therapeutic protocol used. The authors suggest that GFAP staining may be a useful prognostic tool in medulloblastoma. 
Lacunae: a urographic finding in chronic obstructive uropathy. Lacunae, small spaces in the renal sinus that communicate with the caliceal fornices, have been mentioned rarely in the radiologic literature. These lesions have been reported to opacify during excretory urography in patients with current or previous urinary obstruction. Lacunae have been presumed to form in response to urine extravasation through the fornices, but there has never been gross anatomic or histologic proof of their existence. In two patients with obstructive uropathy, urographic-pathologic correlation confirmed the existence and nature of lacunae. On excretory urography, the appearance is likely to be confused with papillary necrosis. 
Monitoring functional patency of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Duplex scanning and Doppler-derived blood pressure measurements were used to serially monitor lower limb hemodynamics in 73 patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Ninety percutaneous transluminal angioplasty sites judged technically satisfactory by arteriography were evaluated. Significant hemodynamic improvement was seen in 81 (90%) of the 90 limbs, although both hemodynamic and clinical improvement were achieved in only 77 (86%) limbs. Duplex scanning within 1 week of successful angioplasty identified moderate (20% to 49% diameter reduction) or severe (greater than 50% diameter reduction) residual stenosis in 49 (63%) of 77 balloon-dilated arterial segments. The presence of a greater than 50% diameter reduction residual stenosis predicted further restenosis and late clinical failure (11% success rate at 1 year). When the degree of residual stenosis at the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty site was less than 50% diameter reduction by duplex scanning, the procedure was durable (80% success rate at 2 years), even in patients with critical ischemia, poor runoff, or diabetes mellitus. 
Anterior mediastinal masses: utility of transthoracic needle biopsy. The results of 143 transthoracic needle biopsies (TNBs) in 126 patients with anterior mediastinal masses were compared with the final diagnosis, which was proved with pathologic study (n = 95) or clinicoradiologic methods (n = 31). In the 26 patients with lymphoma, the sensitivity of TNB was 42%; the specificity, 96%. In the 15 patients with Hodgkin disease, the sensitivity was 20%. In the 28 patients with thymoma, the sensitivity was 71%; the specificity, 94%. In the 11 patients with germ cell tumors, the sensitivity was 91%; specificity, 98%. The sensitivity in the 33 patients with metastatic disease was 70%; specificity, 100%. The cytologic specimens were examined with light microscopy and the Papanicolaou method only, a limitation that explains the difficulty in differentiating lymphoma from thymoma and that can now be overcome with immunohistochemical study. TNB of anterior mediastinal masses is useful in metastatic disease and germ cell tumors. Lymphoma and thymoma are less reliably diagnosed unless immunohistochemical cytologic methods are applied. 
Entrapment of the popliteal artery. Although entrapment of the popliteal artery is uncommon, it is an important cause of arterial insufficiency in younger patients. Accurate diagnosis depends on a high index of suspicion combined with dynamic noninvasive testing and "stress angiography." Although angiographic demonstration of medial deviation of the artery is diagnostic, absence of this finding does not exclude the diagnosis of entrapment of the popliteal artery. Positional angiography may be necessary in these instances. Surgical exploration should be performed by a posterior approach, since this facilitates identification of the precise anatomic variant while allowing easy arterial repair, if necessary. The condition of the popliteal popliteal artery must dictate the extent of the surgical procedure. If the popliteal artery is normal, then relief of the constricting lesion alone will suffice. If the artery appears diseased or is thrombosed, then myotomy and arterial reconstruction must be performed. This is best accomplished by bypass grafting using autogenous vein or artery. If thromboendarterectomy is used, the clinician can expect a higher percentage of acute postoperative thromboses. 
Can esmolol manage surgically-induced tachycardia? Bolus esmolol treatment of intra-operative tachycardia due to surgical stimulation. A double-blind, randomised study was conducted to examine the efficacy of a single bolus dose of esmolol in treating surgically-induced tachycardia. Anaesthetic technique was identical in all patients, and consisted of premedication with midazolam and glycopyrronium, induction with thiopentone followed by suxamethonium, tracheal intubation, and maintenance with isoflurane 0.6% (end-tidal) and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Forty-eight patients developed a heart rate of greater than 95 beats/minute or 20% more than pre-induction values at an average time of 34 minutes after tracheal intubation and received placebo (15 patients), esmolol 50 mg (16 patients), or esmolol 100 mg (17 patients). Controlled intervention was instituted if heart rate or blood pressure was not adequate. Both 50 and 100 mg of esmolol resulted in lower heart rates compared to placebo (p less than 0.05), with no difference between the two esmolol groups (p greater than 0.05). Patients who received placebo had more episodes of medical intervention than those given esmolol (p less than 0.05). No adverse effects occurred in any patient. 
Tamoxifen in premenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer: a review. The antiestrogen tamoxifen is the most widely used hormonal therapy for breast cancer. The drug exerts its antiproliferative effects primarily through estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated mechanisms, although other cellular actions may augment tumor inhibition. Clinically, tamoxifen has been less well studied in premenopausal than in postmenopausal patients. The drug has complex endocrine effects that are dependent on the treatment duration and dose, menopausal status, and target organ. In postmenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, serum estrogen levels remain low, and the normally elevated gonadotropin levels decrease. In contrast, serum estrogen levels are strikingly elevated in many premenopausal women, and gonadotropin concentrations are either unchanged or slightly increased. Large systematic trials in metastatic breast cancer have established tamoxifen as the recommended hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with ER-positive tumors. Tamoxifen is also an active agent for premenopausal metastatic disease, and response rates are comparable to those reported for oophorectomy. Clinical experience with tamoxifen in this younger age group, however, is more limited. Few premenopausal women (less than 400) have been included in phase II and phase III trials. Two randomized trials (total of 160 patients) comparing oophorectomy with tamoxifen do not definitively establish therapeutic equivalence, and a survival advantage for either treatment cannot be excluded. Many questions remain concerning the appropriate role for tamoxifen in premenopausal patients. Still, tamoxifen has an attractive toxicity profile, and it offers a favorable therapeutic alternative for premenopausal women with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer who wish to avoid surgical or radiation castration. 
Transient loss of consciousness: the value of the history for distinguishing seizure from syncope. We studied 94 consecutive patients (age 15 or over) to investigate which aspects of the history and clinical findings help to distinguish seizures from syncope and related conditions. Clonic movements or automatism observed by an eyewitness classified an event as a seizure. The seizure group consisted of 41 patients and the syncope group of 53 patients. The likelihood ratio was used to calculate the predictive power of single findings and logistic regression to analyse combinations of findings. The best discriminatory finding was orientation immediately after the event according to the eyewitness and the age of the patient in the absence of an eyewitness report (P less than 0.001). We found a seizure five times more likely than syncope if the patient was disoriented after the event and three times more likely if the patient was less than 45 years of age. Nausea or sweating before the event were useful to exclude a seizure. Incontinence and trauma were not discriminative findings. 
Fc receptor function and circulating immune complexes in gluten sensitive enteropathy--possible significance of serum IgA. The capacity to clear IgG containing immune complexes from the circulation was studied in patients with coeliac disease (n = 13), dermatitis herpetiformis (n = 8), and coeliac disease with concomitant serum IgA deficiency (n = 4). A small group of patients with active ulcerative colitis (n = 4) was included as a bowel disease control group. Clearance was estimated by measuring the disappearance rate of a bolus dose of intravenously injected IgG coated autologous erythrocytes. The mean T1/2 of clearance was prolonged in both coeliac disease (86 (24) minutes) and dermatitis herpetiformis (111 (35) minutes), compared with healthy subjects (20 (5) minutes) and coeliac patients with concomitant serum IgA deficiency (T1/2 = 17 (6) minutes). Patients with ulcerative colitis had a prolonged clearance, with a T1/2 of 195 (63) minutes. Values of circulating immune complexes were measured by four assays; C1q binding and C3, IgG, and IgA containing immune complexes. C1q binding immune complexes were detected only in IgA deficient gluten sensitive enteropathy. Patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis had higher values of C3, IgG, and IgA containing immune complexes than control subjects and serum IgA deficient patients with coeliac disease. The clearance rate was inversely correlated to the amount of immune complexes for the subgroups of gluten sensitive enteropathy. 
Glandular excision in total glandular mastectomy and modified radical mastectomy: a comparison. Total glandular mastectomy and modified radical mastectomy were compared for the amount of breast tissue remaining after surgery. Multiple biopsies were taken from the anterior chest walls of women following total glandular mastectomy (N = 27) and modified radical mastectomy (N = 28) to try to detect any residual glandular tissue. Regardless of procedure performed, breast tissue was identified histologically in 5 percent of all biopsy specimens (159 and 161, respectively). One of every five operative fields was shown to have glandular elements in at least one of the biopsy sites; the positive biopsies did not form a discernible pattern. The residual breast tissue in each of these patients averaged less than 1 gm. On the basis of this study, modified radical mastectomy and total glandular mastectomy appear to be equally effective in removing most of the breast. 
Fingerstick glucose determination in shock. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of fingerstick glucose measurements in severely hypotensive patients. DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized comparison study. SETTING: Emergency department in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-five severely hypotensive patients (systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 80 mm Hg) and 39 normotensive patients. MEASUREMENTS: Simultaneous fingerstick reagent strip glucose, venous reagent strip glucose, and laboratory glucose values were compared. Data were analyzed using error-grid analysis. RESULTS: In hypotensive patients, the mean fingerstick glucose values were significantly lower than the values obtained either by venous reagent strip or laboratory glucose measurements. Fingerstick glucose values in the hypotensive group were 67.5% of laboratory glucose values, and were significantly lower than the values obtained in the normotensive group (91.8%, P less than 0.001). Only 36% of the hypotensive patients had fingerstick glucose values within the acceptable range of 20% of the laboratory glucose value. Thirty-two percent of hypotensive patients were incorrectly diagnosed as hypoglycemic (glucose less than 3.89 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]); 2 of these patients were actually hyperglycemic (glucose greater than 11.10 mmol/L [200 mg/dL]). Venous reagent strip measurements accurately reflected laboratory glucose values in both hypotensive and normotensive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fingerstick glucose testing does not accurately represent venous glucose levels in severely hypotensive patients. If fingerstick glucose testing is relied on for these patients, errors in clinical management may be made. Venous reagent strip glucose testing correlates well with laboratory glucose measurements and should be the preferred method for rapid assessment of glucose level in critically ill patients with severe hypotension. 
Does atrial appendectomy aggravate secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide? The present study was designed to clarify how atrial appendectomy affects hemodynamics and secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide in the failing heart. Eleven mongrel dogs were prepared for the experimental model of high-output heart failure by creation of arteriovenous fistulas between femoral arteries and veins. Two months after the first operation, effects of bilateral atrial appendectomies on basal and pacing-induced secretions of atrial natriuretic polypeptide were investigated in five dogs with simultaneous measurement of various hemodynamic indices. In the remaining six dogs, used as a control group, pacing-induced secretion of atrial natriuretic polypeptide was examined in the same way as in the appendectomy group. After excision of the atrial appendages, neither systolic blood pressure nor either atrial pressure changed, but plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide level was decreased (292 +/- 54 to 188 +/- 47 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and cardiac output fell (3.7 +/- 0.9 to 3.0 +/- 0.8 L/min, p less than 0.01). During pacing-induced tachycardia, the peak level of plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide was lower in the appendectomy group than in the control groups (593 +/- 213 versus 1170 +/- 324 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), despite similar left atrial pressures in the two groups. The excised appendages contained approximately 30% of the total amount of atrial natriuretic polypeptide. These results demonstrate that atrial appendectomy decreases secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide and reduces cardiac output in dogs with experimental high-output heart failure. 
Extended aortic valvuloplasty: a new approach for the management of congenital valvar aortic stenosis. A new technique for the treatment of congenital valvar aortic stenosis is described. It consists of augmenting the aortic cusp by extending the commissurotomy incision into the aortic wall around the leaflet insertion, mobilizing the valve cusp attachment at the commissures, and freeing the aortic insertion of the rudimentary commissure. The results of standard valvotomy performed on 48 patients (group 1) were compared with those of the new extended valvuloplasty carried out on 16 patients (group 2). The two groups were comparable in age at operation (2.7 +/- 2.1 years for group 1 versus 2.1 +/- 1.7 years for group 2; p = not significant) and in preoperative pressure gradient (58 +/- 25 mm Hg for group 1 versus 61 +/- 36 mm Hg for group 2; p = not significant). There was no operative mortality in either group. Follow-up is available on all patients, with a mean of 4.3 +/- 2.6 years for group 1 versus 1.7 +/- 0.5 years for group 2 (p = 0.05). There was one late death in group 1. Postoperative gradient was 47 +/- 13 mm Hg in group 1 versus 19 +/- 13 mm Hg in group 2 (p = 0.05). Moderate or severe regurgitation was present in 18 patients (38%) in group 1 and 2 patients (13%) in group 2 (p = not significant). Reoperation was needed in 8 patients (17%) in group 1 versus 2 patients (13%) in group 2 (p = not significant). The described valvuloplasty procedure addresses the unique pathological features of valvar aortic stenosis and provides better relief of the obstruction than the presently available techniques. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the late results of this approach. 
Cocaine and indomethacin: fetal anuria, neonatal edema, and gastrointestinal bleeding. A case is reported in which exposure to cocaine and indomethacin was associated with development of fetal anuria, anasarca, and neonatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Cocaine and indomethacin may act synergistically to adversely affect renal, cardiovascular, and platelet function. It may be prudent to obtain a drug history and urine screen for cocaine before instituting indomethacin therapy for preterm labor or polyhydramnios. 
Pathologic and hemodynamic sequelae of unilobar biliary obstruction and associated liver atrophy. A patient is presented with unilobar biliary obstruction associated with marked liver atrophy and compensatory hypertrophy. Characteristically she was not jaundiced and had no portal hypertension. Quantitative measurements of the degree of hepatocyte hyperplasia showed that over 50% of cells in the hypertrophied lobe were hyperplastic. Surprisingly, a similar percentage of cells in the atrophied lobe were also hyperplastic. No difference was found in the size of hepatocytes between the two lobes or among the hepatocyte subpopulations in the atrophied lobe. The findings in this case suggest (1) lobar atrophy induces a hyperplastic response in more than one half of the cells of the contralateral lobe; (2) the development of atrophy consequent on biliary obstruction is likely the result of destruction of whole cells rather than cytoplasmic loss; (3) the development of a hyperplastic response within the atrophied lobe is a new finding and is consistent with the hormonal theory of hepatic regeneration; and (4) striking compensatory hypertrophy of the liver is associated with normal portal venous pressure. 
A randomized, controlled study of behavioral intervention for chemotherapy distress in children with cancer. Fifty-four pediatric cancer patients were studied to determine the relative efficacy of two forms of behavioral intervention for reducing chemotherapy-related distress. Following baseline assessment, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either hypnosis, non-hypnotic distraction/relaxation, or attention placebo (control) during the subsequent identical chemotherapy course. Observational and interview measures of anticipatory and postchemotherapy nausea, vomiting, distress, and functional disruption served as outcome data. Results indicated that treatment condition was the single best predictor of change from baseline to intervention, with children in the hypnosis group reporting the greatest reduction of both anticipatory and postchemotherapy symptoms. The cognitive distraction/relaxation intervention appeared to have a maintenance effect in which symptoms did not get much worse or much better, while children in the control group had symptoms that consistently became worse over time. Emetic potential of the chemotherapy and the prophylactic use of antiemetics each appeared to contribute to the overall severity of symptoms. While the efficacy of hypnosis in the management of chemotherapy distress is supported, the complexities of interacting biologic and psychologic factors are highlighted. 
Prospective, randomized controlled trial of interferon-alpha in children with chronic hepatitis B. Thirty-six children with chronic hepatitis B were entered into a randomized controlled trial of recombinant human interferon-alpha. All patients had hepatitis B virus DNA and increased levels of aminotransferases in serum for at least 1 yr. Twelve children received 10 MU of interferon-alpha 2b/m2 body surface area three times a week (group I); 12 children received 5 MU/m2 under the same conditions (group II); and 12 children served as controls (group III). During 6 mo of therapy, 12 of 24 (50%) treated patients (7 from group I, 58%, and 5 from group II, 42%) and 2 of 12 (17%) controls lost hepatitis B virus DNA from serum and subsequently remained negative. Comparison of the rate of response in group I vs. controls showed a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05). Eleven of 12 (92%) treated patients who cleared hepatitis B virus DNA from serum lost HBeAg, seroconverted to anti-HBe and had improvement in liver histological findings with loss of hepatitis B virus DNA from liver. In 10, serum ALT levels became normal. Interferon-alpha was well tolerated and all children finished therapy. These findings indicate that a 6-mo course of interferon-alpha is effective in inducing a serological, biochemical and histological remission of disease in approximately 50% of children with chronic hepatitis B. 
High-attenuation mediastinal masses on unenhanced CT. On unenhanced CT scans, a variety of mediastinal masses contain areas with attenuation values higher than the attenuation value of the chest wall musculature. The increased attenuation may be diffuse or focal and may be a result of calcium deposition, high iodine content, or areas of acute hemorrhage. This report illustrates the gamut of high-attenuation mediastinal masses seen on unenhanced CT. Masses that are of high attenuation only on IV contrast-enhanced images (e.g., aberrant vessels) are not included. 
Is reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension beneficial? The left ventricle increases its mass and wall thickness in hypertension as a result of the progressive increase in hemodynamic overload offered by increasing arterial blood pressure and total peripheral resistance. However, evidence is increasing that nonhemodynamic factors may also be important in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This LVH resulting from hypertensive disease conveys an independent risk of premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The specific mechanisms accounting for this increased risk are not known with assurance, although several mechanisms are under active study; they include more prominently ventricular dysrhythmias and myocardial ischemia. It is possible to diminish the increased left ventricular mass with pharmacological agents, although currently it is not known whether this reversal also diminishes the risk associated with LVH. Therefore, at the present time the best means for preventing the risk of LVH is to prevent its development in the first place, and this seems to be preventable through control of arterial blood pressure at the earliest stages of hypertension. Risk may also be diminished in patients with existing LVH who are receiving digitalis or diuretics or who have chronic fluid- and electrolyte-disturbing diseases. Under these circumstances, the careful use and selection of antihypertensive therapy and control of electrolyte balance no doubt will prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality. 
Gastric cancer after gastric bypass for obesity. Case report. We describe a patient in whom gastric cancer developed after gastric bypass for morbid obesity. In addition, we review the literature to emphasize the technical problems involved in diagnosing disease in the excluded portion of the stomach. 
Ophthalmoplegia with headache. Be aware of diabetes. Cranial neuropathy affecting the eyes is a possible symptom of type II diabetes. In this article, Dr Dickerman describes a case in which diabetes was diagnosed in a 63-year-old woman who presented with unilateral headache and eye pain. 
Endoscopic sphincterotomy complications and their management: an attempt at consensus. Despite its relative safety (in comparison with surgery), and undoubted role in many clinical circumstances, biliary sphincterotomy is the most dangerous procedure routinely performed by endoscopists. Complications occur in about 10% of patients; 2 to 3% have a prolonged hospital stay, with a risk of dying. This document is an attempt to provide guidelines for prevention and management of complications, based on a workshop of selected experts, and a comprehensive review of the literature. We emphasize particularly the importance of specialist training, disinfection, drainage, and collaboration with surgical colleagues. 
Psychological stress and susceptibility to the common cold BACKGROUND. It is not known whether psychological stress suppresses host resistance to infection. To investigate this issue, we prospectively studied the relation between psychological stress and the frequency of documented clinical colds among subjects intentionally exposed to respiratory viruses. METHODS. After completing questionnaires assessing degrees of psychological stress, 394 healthy subjects were given nasal drops containing one of five respiratory viruses (rhinovirus type 2, 9, or 14, respiratory syncytial virus, or coronavirus type 229E), and an additional 26 were given saline nasal drops. The subjects were then quarantined and monitored for the development of evidence of infection and symptoms. Clinical colds were defined as clinical symptoms in the presence of an infection verified by the isolation of virus or by an increase in the virus-specific antibody titer. RESULTS. The rates of both respiratory infection (P less than 0.005) and clinical colds (P less than 0.02) increased in a dose-response manner with increases in the degree of psychological stress. Infection rates ranged from approximately 74 percent to approximately 90 percent, according to levels of psychological stress, and the incidence of clinical colds ranged from approximately 27 percent to 47 percent. These effects were not altered when we controlled for age, sex, education, allergic status, weight, the season, the number of subjects housed together, the infectious status of subjects sharing the same housing, and virus-specific antibody status at base line (before challenge). Moreover, the associations observed were similar for all five challenge viruses. Several potential stress-illness mediators, including smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, diet, quality of sleep, white-cell counts, and total immunoglobulin levels, did not explain the association between stress and illness. Similarly, controls for personality variables (self-esteem, personal control, and introversion-extraversion) failed to alter our findings. CONCLUSIONS. Psychological stress was associated in a dose-response manner with an increased risk of acute infectious respiratory illness, and this risk was attributable to increased rates of infection rather than to an increased frequency of symptoms after infection. 
Chronic pain and substance abuse: a pilot study of opioid maintenance. Recent reports suggest that opioid maintenance may be appropriate for treatment-resistant patients with chronic nonmalignant pain syndromes. However, a history of substance abuse is thought to be a contraindication for such treatment. We present a pilot study of a methadone maintenance-type treatment for patients with both chronic pain and substance abuse, evaluating the ability to attract and hold patients, the methodology for assessing change, and the potential problems and pitfalls. Weekly random urinalysis, weekly psychotherapy, and quarterly self-report tests of pain, mood, and function were used to evaluate change. Three out of 4 patients remained in treatment for 19-21 months, stopped needle use, and/or markedly decreased substance abuse, and appear to have improved functionally. Surprisingly, all 3 patients had significant psychopathology requiring treatment with psychotropic medication. This treatment may warrant further research. 
Ciprofloxacin: drug of choice in the treatment of malignant external otitis (MEO). Ciprofloxacin, a fluorinated quinolone with high efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was used in the treatment of 10 consecutive patients with malignant external otitis. All patients had skull base osteomyelitis documented by nuclear and computed tomography (CT) scans. Dosages of 1.5 g of ciprofloxacin daily were used for a mean average of 10 weeks. All patients were considered cured with a minimum follow-up of 18 months after completion of therapy. A new classification of malignant external otitis (MEO) is presented. 
Role of early fluid resuscitation in pediatric septic shock. OBJECTIVE. To examine the association of the volume of fluid administered at 1 and 6 hours after presentation, with survival and the occurrence of the adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and persistent hypovolemia during the resuscitation of children with septic shock. SETTING AND PATIENTS. All pediatric patients with septic shock presenting to the emergency department over a 6-year period and having a pulmonary artery catheter inserted by 6 hours after presentation were identified. METHODS. Patients were analyzed together and in three groups based on fluid volume in the first hour: group 1, less than 20 mL/kg; group 2, 20 to 40 mL/kg; and group 3, more than 40 mL/kg. Adult respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed by the presence of alveolar infiltrates, hypoxemia, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or less. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema was diagnosed similarly, except the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was greater than 15 mm Hg. Hypovolemia was diagnosed by the presence of oliguria, hypotension, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 8 mm Hg or less 6 hours after presentation. RESULTS. We identified 34 patients (median age, 13.5 months). At 1 and 6 hours, respectively, group 1 (n = 14) received 11 +/- 6 and 71 +/- 29 mL/kg (mean +/- SD) of fluid; group 2 received 32 +/- 5 and 108 +/- 54 mL/kg of fluid; and group 3 received 69 +/- 19 and 117 +/- 29 mL/kg of fluid. Survival in group 3 (eight of nine patients) was significantly better than in group 1 (six of 14 patients) or group 2 (four of 11 patients). Adult respiratory distress syndrome developed in 11 patients (32%) and cardiogenic pulmonary edema developed in five patients (15%). Having adult respiratory distress syndrome was associated with increased mortality, but adult respiratory distress syndrome was not increased in any group. Similarly, cardiogenic pulmonary edema was not associated with the fluid volume received or with decreased survival. Hypovolemia occurred in six patients in group 1 and two patients in group 2; all eight subsequently died. CONCLUSION. Rapid fluid resuscitation in excess of 40 mL/kg in the first hour following emergency department presentation was associated with improved survival, decreased occurrence of persistent hypovolemia, and no increase in the risk of cardiogenic pulmonary edema or adult respiratory distress syndrome in this group of pediatric patients with septic shock. 
Vigabatrin and psychosis. We report a series of 14 cases of psychosis occurring in patients with severe intractable epilepsy, following the prescription of vigabatrin, a new antiepileptic drug. Nine patients had no previous history of psychosis. In eight patients the psychosis occurred following a change in the habitual pattern of seizure activity; in four it developed after a period of seizure freedom followed by a cluster of seizures, and in the other four patients an alternating psychosis was observed. In five patients there was no clear relationship to seizure pattern. Another patient developed psychosis after taking an overdose of between eight and 12 g of vigabatrin. A further three patients, who developed psychosis following vigabatrin withdrawal, were not included in this series. The mean dose at onset of the psychosis (excluding the patient who took an overdose) was 2580 mg, and the period from initiation of therapy to the onset of psychosis varied from five days to 32 weeks (and occurred 24 hours after the overdose of vigabatrin). In all cases the psychosis resolved, but necessitated the withdrawal of vigabatrin, except in the single patient who took the overdose. The mechanism of this behaviour change is unclear, but in some instances may reflect vigabatrin's powerful anti-epileptic action. This is clearly not the case for all patients. Vigabatrin should be started with caution in patients with severe epilepsy, particularly in the presence of a previous history of psychosis, and such patients should be carefully monitored. 
Concomitant benefit of preoperative irradiation in preventing pancreas fistula formation after pancreatoduodenectomy. Preoperative irradiation improves both the resectability and curability of carcinoma of the pancreas head area and should improve patient survival. We retrospectively investigated the value of preoperative irradiation in preventing pancreatic fistula formation. Of 76 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticojejunostomy by mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis with a stent catheter after pancreatoduodenectomy, 22 had received preoperative irradiation. The irradiation field included the anastomotic site. In two patients, accidental dislocation of the stent catheter was the apparent cause of fistula formation, but the other 21 patients in the irradiated group developed no fistula. In contrast, nine (17%) of 53 patients in the nonirradiated group developed fistulas. In the irradiated group, preoperative selenomethionine Se 75 scintigraphy revealed a cold area corresponding to the pancreas body, which was included in the irradiation field. Thus, a putative decrease in exocrine function at the pancreatic anastomotic site could explain why fistula formation was prevented by preoperative irradiation. 
Clinical application of a patient-controlled apparatus for ventricular administration of morphine in intractable pain: report of 28 cases. The authors developed a patient-controlled apparatus (L-224) for ventricular administration of pain-relieving medication and utilized it in the treatment of 28 patients with intractable pain. The initial dose of morphine hydrochloride was 1 mg, which afforded pain relief for an average of 170 hours. At an average dose of 1.8 mg, the average time of pain relief obtained was 137 hours. Therefore, they conclude that L-224 is a satisfactory apparatus for the ventricular administration of pain medication; it is patient controlled, safe, and reliable in clinical application. 
Peripheral adaptations in congestive heart failure: a review. In congestive heart failure, peripheral adaptive mechanisms play a significant and largely underestimated role. In acute heart failure, sympathetic-mediated peripheral vasoconstriction together with chronotropic and inotropic actions serves to maintain perfusion pressure and blood supply to the vital organs. In chronic heart failure, activation of the renin-angiotensin system increases peripheral vascular resistance and arterial tone and decreases arterial compliance and vasodilator capacity. Endothelium-mediated, flow-dependent vasodilation is reduced as a consequence of reduced blood flow. Deconditioning renders the blood vessels incapable of dilating in response to increased flow. Simultaneously, reduced blood flow and inactivity are induced by deconditioning, with functional and structural consequences within the skeletal muscle. Exercise performance is limited by reduced overall blood flow, reduced conductance of the feeding arteries, elevated tone of the resistance vessels, reduced vasodilator capacity, impaired dissipation of heat from the working muscle, and functional and structural changes of the skeletal muscle due to underperfusion and inactivity. The adaptive mechanisms operate at different time scales. Under therapeutic intervention, their reversibility also follows different time constants. Restoration of the vasodilator capacity of the large arteries and of the abnormalities of skeletal muscle in heart failure requires time. Vasodilation with reduced pre- and/or afterload will retard progression of the superimposed ventricular dilation and hypertrophy, and therefore retard the progress of the disease. However, restoration of the peripheral blood flow and of organ function will require time. Restoration of the vascular compliance and of the full amplitude of adaptive flow-dependent vasodilation in the large arteries requires weeks or months. Similarly, restoration of functionally and morphologically altered skeletal muscle can be expected to be reversible over a longer time period. 
Cell-surface ganglioside GD2 in the immunohistochemical detection and differential diagnosis of neuroblastoma. The expression of the disialoganglioside GD2 was analyzed in 67 solid tumors and normal tissues from children by using the GD2-specific murine monoclonal antibody 3A7 and the indirect immunoperoxidase method. GD2 was expressed in all of 28 neuroblastomas and was most abundant in stroma-poor tumors. In differentiating stroma-rich neuroblastomas, neuroblastic clusters, neurofibrils, and most ganglion-like cells were positive, whereas Schwann's-cell stroma did not express GD2. In ganglioneuromas, only a few ganglion-like cells showed GD2, whereas all other structures were negative. Scattered foci of ganglioside GD2 also were found in some non-neuronal tumors, such as rhabdomyosarcomas and osteosarcomas, but not in lymphomas, Askin tumors, or most Wilms' tumors. The monoclonal antibody 3A7 is a useful aid in the immunohistochemical diagnosis of neuroblastoma. In addition, the intense cell surface staining of neuroblastoma cells by this reagent makes it potentially useful for detecting residual neuroblastoma in bone marrow samples and lymph node biopsies. 
Objective antitumor activity of acivicin in patients with recurrent CNS malignancies: a Southwest Oncology Group trial. Acivicin (AT-125) is a glutamine antagonist with dose-limiting, schedule-dependent CNS toxicity and predictable CSF penetration after intravenous administration. Because of these properties, a trial in CNS malignancies was initiated. Thirty-two patients with recurrent or residual malignant astrocytomas were treated with AT-125. The majority of patients had glioblastoma multiforme (24) and had received prior nitrosoureas (21). The median age was 50 years, and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) performance status was 2. The major determinant of response was based upon radiologic criteria using computed tomographic (CT) scanning and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The tumor mass was measured in two perpendicular planes, which yielded the largest cross-sectional area. Standard solid tumor criteria for response were used. All responding patients also had a stable or tapered dose of corticosteroids with stable or improved performance status and neurologic examination. There were four objective responses (12%): one complete remission (3 1/2+ years) and three partial remissions (57, 86, and 322 days). Two patients had improvement in disease that did not meet requirements for a partial remission. Toxicity was mild and primarily consisted of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy. Two patients were removed from study due to neurotoxicity (depression and hallucinations). The strict response criteria used in this trial were not those that have been used in testing other active agents such as carmustine (BCNU). We conclude that AT-125 has objective antitumor activity in malignant astrocytomas and warrants further study. 
Lovastatin inhibits gallstone formation in the cholesterol-fed prairie dog. The efficacy of lovastatin, an inhibitor of hepatic cholesterol synthesis in the prevention of cholesterol gallstone formation, was evaluated in the prairie dog model. Two groups of animals were maintained on either nonlithogenic or 1.2% cholesterol-enriched chow for 21 days. Seven of the animals in each group received lovastatin, and the remaining six received only distilled water. All of the cholesterol-fed/water-treated animals had crystals and 83% had gallstones, but none of the cholesterol-fed/lovastatin-treated animals had gallstones and only three had microscopic crystals. These data indicate that lovastatin inhibits cholesterol gallstone formation in a diet-induced model of gallstone disease. 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(4;11) translocation after osteogenic sarcoma. The authors report a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(4;11) (q21;q23) occurring 9 months after treatment of osteogenic sarcoma. Cell surface marker and molecular analyses suggest early B lineage involvement. This is the first report, to the knowledge of the authors, of t(4;11) ALL arising after an osteogenic sarcoma. The observations of the authors support the possibility of a causal relationship between exposure to carcinogens and the occurrence of leukemia with t(4;11). 
Experimental hyperthermia: protective effect of oxygen carrying fluorocarbon and crystalloids intraperitoneally. The treatment of hyperthermia produced by passive warming was studied in anesthetized rats weighing 250-300 grams. In the first set of seven experiments, the authors found that venous blood oxygen fell as core temperature rose. Intraperitoneal injection of 20 ml of the oxygen carrying fluorocarbon (perfluorotributylamine, FC-43) emulsion in three of the animals shifted the curve to the right improving venous oxygen content (p less than 0.1). In the second series of experiments, a catheter was placed in the carotid artery. This catheter was attached to a pressure transducer for continuous recording of blood pressure and heart rate. Periodic blood samples were removed for measurement of blood gases, pH, and lactate. Four of the animals received 20 ml of isotonic saline, three received 20 ml of FC-43 emulsion both given intraperitoneally, and four served as controls. In the control group, there was an increase in systolic blood pressure and heart rate which peaked at a colon temperature of 42 degrees C, followed by cardiovascular collapse and death around 43 degrees C. Arterial PO2 (corrected for temperature) remained relatively constant up to 42 degrees C, and then fell. The arterial PCO2 rose sharply when the core temperature exceeded 43 degrees C. Arterial lactate content began to increase at 42 degrees C and above 43 degrees C was 2.5 fold elevated. Isotonic saline provided circulatory support but did not change the hypoxia or mixed acidosis from CO2 and lactate above 43 degrees C. FC-43 emulsion decreased hypoxia and improved circulatory performance but was associated with a mild respiratory alkalosis as arterial PCO2 fell. 
Planned delayed nephrectomy after ethanol embolization of renal carcinoma. Planned delayed nephrectomy after preoperative ethanol infarction was done in 6 patients with renal carcinoma. Three patients had intracaval extension of tumor, 2 had renal vein but no vena caval extension and 1 had no renal vein or vena caval involvement. Nephrectomy was delayed 22 to 44 days after embolization. In the patients with inferior vena caval extension shrinkage of tumor thrombus after embolization allowed for easier surgical resection. Furthermore, delay of nephrectomy after preoperative infarction was of value in improving the clinical status of high risk patients. 
Surgical management of essential blepharospasm. We have reviewed the surgical management of essential blepharospasm over the last 15 years, comparing the results from facial nerve avulsion with those from orbicularis muscle stripping. After facial nerve avulsion 50% of patients remained free of troublesome spasm for 15 months after surgery, but only 25% remained so for more than two years. Following orbicularis oculi myectomy 50% of patients were free of troublesome spasms for 30 months after surgery and 55% of patients had relief from spasm for more than two years. Secondary effects of the two procedures are compared and are found to be fewer after orbicularis myectomy. There were no major complications after either form of surgery. Botulinum toxin is the treatment of first choice for this condition. If this becomes ineffective or inconvenient, surgical treatment is warranted and should not be deferred for fear of severe side effects of treatment, since these are rare. Protractor myectomy gives longer relief from blepharospasm than facial nerve avulsion and has fewer complications. However, it is technically difficult, time consuming, and has greater peroperative morbidity. Facial nerve avulsion may therefore still have a role in selected patients. 
Recent trends in acute care hospital utilization in Ontario for diseases of the circulatory system. OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in the use of acute care hospital services for diseases of the circulatory system in Ontario. DESIGN: Observational study. DATA EXTRACTION: Information on diagnoses, procedures and demographic characteristics was obtained from routinely collected computerized abstracts of separations from all acute care hospitals in Ontario during 1979-80, 1983-84 and 1988-89. The data were combined with population estimates to calculate overall separation rates and rates specific for age, diagnosis and procedure. Resource intensity weights were used to estimate changes in resource use. MAIN RESULTS: The overall separation rate increased by 3% and the resource-intensity-weighted separation rate by 12% from 1979-80 to 1988-89. The overall medical separation rate increased by 2%, whereas the surgical rate increased by 12%. The surgical separation rate increased among patients 55 to 79 years of age but decreased in all the other adult age groups. The separation rates for coronary artery bypass surgery and cardiac valve surgery increased rapidly among patients 65 years of age or older. The medical separation rate decreased for patients of all ages except those less than 5 years and those 80 years or more. The medical separation rates decreased by less than 1% for diagnoses related to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and increased dramatically for coronary artery revascularization. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing elderly population has not resulted in large increases in acute care hospital utilization for diseases of the circulatory system. The impact of an aging population has been balanced by decreased utilization rates in the younger groups. The intensity of hospital care has risen primarily because of increases in surgical rates, especially in the elderly population. The large decrease in the rate of death from IHD over the past two decades has not been associated with similar decreases in acute care hospital utilization for this disorder. 
Surgical management of diffuse subaortic stenosis: an integrated approach. An integrated approach to the surgical management of diffuse subaortic stenosis has been designed to provide adequate relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction whatever the anatomical features encountered at operation. This approach was used in 22 patients with tunnel subaortic stenosis (19 patients) or diffuse hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (3 patients). The obstructive tissue was resected through an aortoseptal approach. In 18 patients, associated hypoplasia of the aortic orifice necessitated aortic valve replacement using the Konno procedure; in 4 patients with a normal-sized aortic orifice, the native aortic valve was preserved. There were two early deaths and one late death (all after a Konno operation). Long-term adequate relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was achieved in all survivors. Operation for diffuse subaortic stenosis should be performed with two main goals: (1) to obtain complete relief of the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction by the appropriate procedure and (2) to preserve the native aortic valve whenever possible, particularly in young patients. 
Enteral hyperalimentation with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion improved severe diarrhea in poorly controlled diabetic patient. Little is known about effective treatment for severe diarrhea in the insulin-dependent diabetic patient. A 41-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of hyperglycemia and dysuria. She had stopped insulin self-injection therapy for 2 years and diarrhea had become worse, resulting in malnutrition. Following enteral alimentation by elemental diet (ED) with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), frequency of diarrhea remarkably decreased and general nutritional condition was improved. At the first step, the patient was given 600 kcal/d ED through the tube sustained in the jejunum. Total calorie intake for 24 hours was gradually increased to the level of 2400 kcal/d and this therapy continued for 5 months. During this period, blood glucose level was kept in almost normal range (between 100 and 200 mg/dL) through the continuous insulin infusion of regular insulin (1.0-1.5 U/h). Thereafter, general conditions were improved and frequency of diarrhea gradually decreased. When this treatment was stopped, watery diarrhea, steatorrhea, and hypoalbuminemia completely disappeared and she gained 12 kg of body weight. Furthermore, spontaneous urination appeared following this treatment. This case suggests that the enteral hyperalimentation combined with strict control of blood glucose, using the CSII, may be an effective therapy for such severe diarrhea with malnutrition in diabetes. 
Percutaneous coronary angioscopy in patients with restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioscopy with a flexible steerable microangioscope was performed in five patients undergoing repeat angioplasty. Recurrent lesions were assessed by angioscopy before and after the angioplasty procedure. The most common surface morphology observed in these restenosis lesions was that of white unpigmented lesions consistent with the proliferation of fibrous tissue. Also noted during angioscopy was the presence or absence of thrombus or dissection in association with the lesions either before or after angioplasty. Filmy wisps of tissue, presumably intimal flaps, were commonly visualized after angioplasty. There were no complications related to angioscopy or angioplasty in these patients. The surface morphology of restenosis lesions appears to be different from that of primary atherosclerotic lesions. The lesions in these five patients with restenosis were generally white and fibrotic in appearance, as opposed to the pigmented yellow to yellow-brown lesions commonly seen in undilated atherosclerotic lesions. It was also noted that the presence of intracoronary thrombus was strongly associated with the clinical syndrome of unstable angina. These findings support the hypothesis that restenosis lesions are the result of a reparative process consisting of smooth muscle cell proliferation and fibrosis. 
Cervical cancer screening: who is not screened and why? BACKGROUND: The decline in death rates from cervical cancer in the United States has been widely attributed to the use of Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for early detection of cervical cancer. METHODS: Pap smear screening rates, beliefs about appropriate screening intervals and factors affecting screening were examined using 1987 National Health Interview Survey data. RESULTS: Results indicate that through age 69, Blacks are screened at similar or higher rates than Whites. Hispanics, particularly those speaking only or mostly Spanish, are least likely to have received a Pap smear within the last three years. Of women who had never heard of or never had a Pap smear, nearly 80 percent reported contact with a medical practitioner in the past two years, while more than 90 percent reported a contact in the past five years. Overall, the most frequently reported reason for not having a recent Pap smear was procrastinating or not believing it was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, in developing screening programs, Hispanics, particularly Spanish speakers, must be targeted. In addition, educational programs should target unscreened women who forego the test due to underestimating its importance, procrastination, or because their medical care provider did not suggest the procedure. Women must be intensively educated that Pap smears should be scheduled routinely to detect asymptomatic cervical cancer. 
Alcoholic liver disease in heterozygotes of mutant and normal aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes. To clarify the pathogenetic role of acetaldehyde in the development of alcoholic liver disease, genotyping of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes was performed and the clinical features of the alcoholic liver disease patients with different genotypes were compared. Genotyping of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 was performed in 47 patients with alcoholic liver disease using the polymerase chain reaction and slot-blot hybridization. Of the 47 patients with alcoholic liver disease, 40 were homozygous for the normal aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 gene and the remaining seven cases were heterozygous for the normal and mutant aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes. No homozygote was found for the mutant aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes. Daily alcohol intake was less than 100 gm in all heterozygotes without relation to the type of alcoholic liver disease. On the other hand, all but four patients homozygotic for the normal aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 gene drank more than 100 gm alcohol/day. The mean daily alcohol intake in the heterozygotes was significantly lower than that in the normal homozygotes. The incidence of alcoholic fibrosis tended to be lower in the heterozygotes than in the normal homozygotes (14.2% vs. 52.5%). On the other hand, the incidence of alcoholic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis tended to be higher in the heterozygotes than in the normal homozygotes. These results indicate that alcoholic liver disease develops even with moderate amounts of alcohol intake in heterozygotes of the aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes, in which acetaldehyde metabolism in the liver is impaired and liver damage in the heterozygotes is more severe than that in the normal homozygotes, suggesting that habitual drinkers who are heterozygotes of the aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes may be at high risk for alcoholic liver disease. 
Comparative immunohistochemical staining for desmin and muscle-specific actin. A study of 576 cases. Muscle-specific actin (MSA) and desmin are considered to be sensitive and specific markers for muscle differentiation. The authors compared staining patterns for these markers in 576 samples of normal, reactive, and neoplastic tissues. The standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique was performed with the use of two commercial antibodies against MSA (HHF35; Enzo Biochemical, Inc., New York, NY) and desmin (DER11; DAKO Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA), respectively, on consecutive paraffin-embedded tissue sections from these cases. Both MSA and desmin were found in all 80 normal muscle samples. Although MSA appeared diffusely in all vascular smooth muscle samples, desmin was demonstrated focally in vascular smooth muscle cells in 100 of 196 samples. MSA but not desmin always was found in myoepithelial cells (25 samples), pericytes (286 samples), and decidual cells (7 samples). Among 76 cases of myofibroblast-containing lesions, 14 and 54 were found to have desmin and MSA, respectively. MSA and desmin were found in 4 of 4 cardiac rhabdomyomas, 34 of 34 rhabdomyosarcomas, and 5 of 6 leiomyomas. Among 22 leiomyosarcomas, 7 displayed either MSA or desmin and 7 showed both markers. In general, more tumor cells showed staining for MSA than desmin, but the reverse was true in some cases. Tissue fixed in Zenker's solution seemed to show a significant decrease in MSA immunoreactivity, but no significant change for desmin staining was observed. None of the 154 normal tissues and 22 benign nonmyogenic tumors expressed MSA or desmin. Among 133 malignant nonmyogenic tumors, positive staining for both desmin and MSA was found in 3 of 8 cases of glioblastoma multiforme, 1 of 10 malignant schwannomas, and 1 of 14 malignant fibrous histiocytomas; staining for only MSA was found in 3 of 14 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 1 of 10 malignant schwannomas, 6 of 6 fibromatoses, 1 of 1 mammary myofibroblastoma, and 1 of 7 malignant mesotheliomas; and staining for desmin only was seen in 1 of 7 malignant mesotheliomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Dementia. Age-dependent incidence, prevalence, and mortality in the old old. Age has been reported as a strong risk factor for dementia. Supporting data have been derived mainly from prevalence studies, which had varied criteria and sample compositions that precluded direct comparisons, especially among those aged 85 years and older. Data regarding rates of dementia are presented based on 85 incident cases in the Bronx (NY) Aging Study, a prospective study of 488 initially nondemented, old old persons (mean age on entry, 79 years). Overall, the incidence rate over 8 years of follow-up for all-cause dementia was 3.4 per 100 per year (43% Alzheimer's disease, 30% mixed Alzheimer's and vascular, and 27% other). Incidence rose significantly, irrespective of gender, as subjects were followed up through three age intervals--ages 75 to 79 years (1.3/100 per year), 80 to 84 years (3.5), and 85 years and older (6.0). The comparable age-associated prevalence rates of dementia were 3.7%, 12.2%, and 23.9%, respectively, with an overall period prevalence of 22.8%. Additionally, there was a threefold greater mortality associated with dementia. In conclusion, despite the shortened life expectancy of demented persons, dementia is a highly prevalent condition among those aged 85 years and older. Public policy attention is warranted, since this group is the fastest growing population subgroup. 
123I-iodoamphetamine SPECT brain imaging in alternating hemiplegia. Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is an unusual disorder characterized by early onset (occurring before 18 months of age); repeated attacks of hemiplegia involving both sides of the body; other paroxysmal phenomena, such as tonic stiffening, dystonic posturing, choreoathetoid movements, ocular motor abnormalities, and autonomic disturbances, in association with bouts of hemiplegia or occurring independently; and evidence of mental or neurologic deficits. A girl was examined because of left hemiplegia at the age of 16 months. The patient had begun exhibiting episodes of alternating hemiplegia at approximately 4 months of age. They consisted of tonic stiffening and dystonia of the right or left extremities, lasting from 30 min to several hours and followed by residual hemiparesis. They were invariably accompanied by ocular motor abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and angiography all were normal. Single proton emission computed tomography brain images during an acute episode of right hemiplegia demonstrated hypoperfusion of the left cerebral hemisphere. Following improvement of the hemiplegia, the patient was re-evaluated. The uptake of the radiotracer in the left hemisphere was increased. The scan did not demonstrate significant asymmetry in cerebral perfusion. 
Unimpinged and impinged anterior cruciate ligament grafts: MR signal intensity measurements. Regionalized magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensities were quantitatively measured in impinged and unimpinged anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) grafts. Images were obtained with a 1.5-T imager, and signal intensity was measured in the proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the graft. In 15 unimpinged ACL grafts, the signal intensity remained low and did not vary during the 1st year of graft implantation (45 images). In contrast, 17 impinged ACL grafts showed an increase in signal intensity in the distal two-thirds of the graft that persisted 1-3 years after implantation (P less than .001). Unimpinged grafts were placed in tibial tunnels posterior and parallel to the slope of the intercondylar roof. Reconstructions with anterior tibial tunnels resulted in graft impingement that caused increases in graft signal intensity. This increase demonstrates a clear association between surgical technique and the subsequent MR appearance of the graft. 
Multiple drug therapy in the treatment of essential hypertension. Treatment for high blood pressure is aimed to prevent the excess morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension by reducing the blood pressure to acceptable levels and by improving the cardiovascular risk status. Antihypertensive medications can be selected that not only reduce blood pressure but also have beneficial effects in concomitant illness and neutral or positive effects on other cardiovascular risk factors. Multiple drug therapy offers not only the possibility of greater therapeutic efficacy than that achieved with single agents but also the possibility of reduced incidence of side effects through complementary actions. The antihypertensive regimen should be simple and acceptable to the patient to promote compliance. Nurses, along with physicians, have an integral role in the long-term management of hypertensive patients through education, counsel, and follow-up for blood pressure control and health promotion. 
Screening dyspepsia by serology to Helicobacter pylori. Owing to limited endoscopy resources, various screening strategies for endoscopy have been proposed. Helicobacter pylori can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity by serology, and therefore we assessed the effects on diagnostic accuracy and endoscopic workload of a policy of screening clinic patients with dyspepsia before endoscopy by a strategy based on age, Helicobacter pylori serology, and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 1153 patients were studied, of whom 842 were of known histological H pylori status (histology group) and 293 had serum assessed prospectively by in-house and commercial ELISAs for detection of IgG antibodies to H pylori. Overall, the screening strategy would have reduced endoscopy workload by 23.3% (95% confidence interval 20.9-25.8%) and would have had a sensitivity for detection of peptic ulcer of 97.4% (94.5-99.1%). No peptic ulcer or malignant disease was missed in the patients studied prospectively, but 6 of 192 peptic ulcers in the histology group would have been missed. A policy of screening young dyspeptic patients for H pylori by serology is more sensitive than symptom-based screening strategies, and may have an important role in reducing endoscopy workload. 
Failure of dithiothreitol and pronase to reveal a false-positive cryptococcal antigen determination in cerebrospinal fluid. A patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and a serum rheumatoid factor (RF) of 1:1,280 had a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) latex agglutination test (LAT) for cryptococcal antigen, in culture-negative, India-ink-negative CSF. Pretreatment of the sample of CSF with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) ablated the antigen titer and established the presence of a false-positive LAT, whereas CSF pretreated with dithiothreitol (DTT) and pronase continued to yield a false-positive result. The differing ability of pronase, DTT, and 2-ME to eliminate interfering substances from CSF has not been previously described. Moreover, because RF is unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier, the authors postulated that malignant disease was responsible for the patient's false-positive LAT in CSF. Hence, the authors report the case to emphasize that false-positive LAT results in CSF are unlikely to be produced by RF and to underscore the benefit of using enzymatic and sulfhydryl-reducing agents when the validity of the initial test results are in doubt. Such a procedure will optimize the chances of accurately identifying false-positive LAT results in CSF. 
Effects of altered PaO2 and PaCO2 on left ventricular function and coronary hemodynamics in sheep. The effects of acute changes in arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen tension, produced by altering the inspired gas mixtures while maintaining constant-volume intermittent positive pressure ventilation, on global function, regional left ventricular function, and coronary hemodynamics were studied in eight sheep during halothane anesthesia. Hypercapnia (Paco2, 73.5 +/- 2.3 mm Hg, mean +/- SD) increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output but decreased systolic shortening in the base of the left ventricle. Hypocapnia (PaO2, 24 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) decreased cardiac output and coronary flow below levels seen with hypercapnia but not below levels seen with normocapnia. Systolic shortening decreased in both apical and basal regions, and left ventricular relaxation was impaired as evidenced by a reduction of the nadir of LV dP/dt. Hypoxemia (PaO2, 39 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) elicited a hyperdynamic response of the circulation, increased coronary blood flow, and exhausted the coronary flow reserve. Neither changes in PaCO2 nor changes in PaO2 caused postsystolic shortening, although hypercapnia caused nonuniformity of contraction in the left ventricle. Thus, marked alterations in oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions do not cause left ventricular dysfunction, even though moderate hypoxia reduces the coronary flow reserve. 
Estimation of morbid risk and age at onset with missing information. Investigators of genetic illnesses are currently employing life-table techniques to estimate the lifetime risk of disease and the age-at-onset distribution. This methodology assumes that onset ages are known for affected individuals and that censoring ages are known for unaffected individuals. We extend these methods to incorporate affected individuals with unknown onset ages and unaffected persons with unknown censoring ages and illustrate how conventional life-table methods can produce seriously biased estimates, particularly of lifetime risk. The methodology is not restricted to genetic illnesses and can be applied to more complex illnesses with unknown etiology. We present an example for Huntington disease, which is generally assumed to be a Mendelian autosomal dominant disease, yielding estimates of lifetime risk of .503 +/- .70 and mean onset age of 47.7 +/- 3.1 years for offspring with a single affected parent. When conventional life-table techniques are employed, these estimates are .238 +/- .032 and 43.2 +/- 2.2. 
A human Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus casei sp strain GG) promotes recovery from acute diarrhea in children. To determine the effect of a human Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus casei sp strain GG, Gefilac) on recovery from acute diarrhea (82% rotavirus), 71 well-nourished children between 4 and 45 months of age were studied. After oral rehydration, the patients randomly received either Lactobacillus GG-fermented milk product, 125 g (10(10-11) colony-forming units) twice daily (group 1); Lactobacillus GG freeze-dried powder, one dose (10(10-11) colony-forming units) twice daily (group 2); or a placebo, a pasteurized yogurt (group 3) 125 g twice daily; each diet was given for 5 days, in addition to normal full diet otherwise free of fermented dairy products. The mean (SD) duration of diarrhea after commencing the therapy was significantly shorter in group 1 (1.4 [0.8] days) and in group 2 (1.4 [0.8] days) than in group 3 (2.4 [1.1] days); F = 8.70, P less than 0.001. After rehydration, each dietary group maintained a positive weight trend. The urinary lactulose-mannitol recovery ratios (means [95% confidence intervals]) on admission were 0.09 (0.03, 0.24) in group 1, 0.12 (0.07, 0.22) in group 2, and 0.08 (0.04, 0.18) in group 3; no significant alterations in intestinal permeability were observed at retesting after 2 days of realimentation. The result indicates that early nutritional repletion after rehydration causes no mucosal disruption and is beneficial for recovery from diarrhea. It is further suggested that Lactobacillus GG in the form of fermented milk or freeze-dried powder is effective in shortening the course of acute diarrhea. 
The influence of osteophytes and aortic calcification on spinal mineral density in postmenopausal women. The assessment of vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) in the anterio-posterior projection has become widely used in the management and prevention of osteoporosis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the presence of spinal osteophytes has a major impact on measured BMD in men, thus casting doubt on the value of these BMD measurements. We have assessed the impact of osteophytic and aortic calcification on spinal and femoral BMD measurements in 130 normal postmenopausal women, aged 45-71 yr. Lateral lumbar spine radiographs were obtained in all subjects and graded separately (0-3) for osteophytes and aortic calcification. Both forms of calcification increased with age, and BMD of all sites was correlated positively with body weight and negatively with age. The correlation coefficients between BMD and calcification scores were nonsignificant. Multiple regression analysis, including weight, age, and calcification scores, demonstrated a small but significant effect of osteophyte score on lumbar BMD (partial r2 = 0.04; P = 0.012) and a similar trend for Ward's triangle and the trochanteric region (partial r2 = 0.02; P less than 0.06). The aortic calcification score remained nonsignificant. It is concluded that the influence of spinal osteophytes on lumbar BMD in postmenopausal women is substantially less than that in men and is, therefore, unlikely to interfere with BMD estimation in most subjects. The relationship between proximal femoral BMD and osteophyte score suggests a real relationship between skeletal density and degenerative joint disease, as has been demonstrated by others. 
Organ-specific cardiac antibodies: serological markers for systemic hypertension in autoimmune polyendocrinopathy. Circulating organ-specific autoantibodies are serological markers of destruction or impairment of the relevant endocrine tissue cells and may be associated with abnormal hormone levels with or without clinical evidence of overt disease. We sought organ-specific cardiac antibodies in patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy because of increasing evidence that the heart has endocrine characteristics (secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP] and other peptide hormones). Serum samples from 166 patients with polyendocrinopathy, 80 with autoimmunity confined to one gland, and 200 healthy blood donors were tested for these antibodies by means of immunofluorescence on human heart. Skeletal muscle was used to identify cross-reacting antibodies. Organ-specific cardiac antibodies were detected in significantly more of the patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (28 [17%]) than of those with autoimmunity confined to one gland (1 [1%]) or of normal subjects (7 [3.5%]; p = 0.0001). Among the patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, the prevalence of systemic hypertension was higher in those with cardiac autoantibodies than in those without (5/28 [18%] vs 2/80 [3%]; p = 0.01); the same was true for a family history of hypertension (11 [42%] vs 5 [7%]; p = 0.0001). There were no significant differences in mean basal or stimulated ANP concentrations between patients with or without antibodies or between patients and controls. 5 of the 22 antibody-positive patients had ANP concentrations outside the normal range, but these disturbances were not associated with systemic hypertension or a family history of the disorder. Patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy can have organ-specific cardiac antibodies, which may represent novel serological markers for an autoimmune form of systemic hypertension in the absence of overt cardiac disease. 
Circadian blood pressure pattern in patients with treated hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensives is an important determinant of prognosis. In the present study 45 patients with treated essential hypertension were divided into two groups: 23 patients had normal left ventricular dimension and 22 patients had echocardiographic signs of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). All patients were adequately treated during daytime, but ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed a distinct abnormal pattern in the LVH group characterized by a lack of blood pressure reduction during the night; 16 of 22 patients with LVH had no blood pressure decline during the night, whereas 17 of 23 patients without hypertrophy showed this reduction (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, patients with hypertension and LVH often reveal a lack of blood pressure decline during the night, which may be the reason for the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (and thus should be managed by a different circadian blood pressure therapy) or which may be the consequence of progressive structural changes in the resistance vessels, along with the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. It is suggested that patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy should have ambulatory twenty-four hour blood pressure monitoring. 
A transformation-incompetent, nuclear antigen 2-deleted Epstein-Barr virus associated with replicative infection. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) obtained directly from the oropharynx was used to detect viral DNA deleted for the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2)-encoding gene that is essential for lymphocyte transformation. By polymerase chain reaction analysis, the deletion was found in virus from 5 of 33 healthy adult donors and 11 of 12 patients with concurrent human immunodeficiency virus infection. Lymphoblastoid cell lines that produce standard transforming EBV also harbored EBNA2-deleted virus in cells permissive of EBV replication. In vitro infectivity studies indicated that the DNA is packaged and transmissible, with biologic properties similar to those of a laboratory mutant, P3HR-1, which also lacks the EBNA2 gene. These findings, obtained from productively infected cell systems, provide evidence for the existence in nature of a transformation-incompetent EBV variant that may facilitate EBV persistence and the emergence of reactivation diseases. 
Dilated cardiomyopathy with mitral regurgitation: decreased survival despite a low frequency of left ventricular thrombus. Ninety-one patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were studied by two-dimensional, pulsed, and color Doppler echocardiography (1) to detect and quantify mitral regurgitation (MR), (2) to record apical flow velocities in systole and diastole, and (3) to detect the presence of left ventricular thrombi. MR was detected in 57% of the patients and thrombi were present in 40%, but the occurrence of both MR and thrombus was rare (8%). Apical flow velocity was significantly higher throughout the cardiac cycle in the group with MR (diastole 15 +/- 7 vs 9 +/- 7 cm/sec; systole 29 +/- 12 vs 16 +/- 13 cm/sec; p less than 0.001 for both), accounting for the rarity of thrombi in this group. Follow-up data on 89% of the patients showed markedly decreased survival in the group with MR (22% vs 60% at 32 +/- 6 months, p less than 0.005), and this was evident even in patients with mild MR. Thus although MR is a noninvasively obtainable marker of a large subgroup of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy "protected" from left ventricular thrombus formation, it is a sensitive marker of decreased survival. 
Increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor number in chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Production of the antiviral cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha is increased in chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and clinical studies of tumor necrosis factor-alpha have indicated a proviral effect at higher doses. To determine whether this might be related to abnormal cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor expression, binding characteristics of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor on peripheral blood mononuclear cells in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers were studied using radioiodinated recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The specific binding curves generated were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard to determine cell surface receptor numbers and dissociation constants. A single class of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor was demonstrated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mononuclear subsets. The median number (range) of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from controls (n = 11), chronic hepatitis B virus patients seropositive for hepatitis B virus DNA (n = 8) and seronegative for hepatitis B virus DNA (n = 8) were 2,329 (range = 1,538 to 3,133), 3,375 (range = 2,300 to 6,718) (p less than 0.01) and 3,113 (range = 2,229 to 5,246) (p less than 0.05) sites/cell, respectively. They all had similar dissociation constants of 8.4 x 10(-10) mol/L (range = 4.1 to 16.9), respectively. Further dissection of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that this increase in cell surface receptor number was confined to the monocyte fraction (p less than 0.01). Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in five patients with increased monocyte cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor numbers were also elevated. 
Enterococcal endocarditis: a comparison of prosthetic and native valve disease. Between 1973 and 1987, 36 patients with 41 episodes of enterococcal endocarditis were seen at our institution. There were 22 episodes of native valve endocarditis (NVE) and 19 episodes of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). The overall mortality before completion of therapy was 15% (18% due to NVE and 11% due to PVE). Among patients with NVE, involvement of the aortic valve was significantly associated with death or complicated illness (defined as the need for valve replacement before completion of antibiotic therapy or relapse of endocarditis after completion of therapy). Among patients who survived episodes of PVE, 69% were cured without surgical intervention. Gentamicin was administered in combination with a penicillin or vancomycin in the majority of episodes (mean duration of therapy with aminoglycosides: 5 weeks). Renal dysfunction occurred in 44% of patients who received gentamicin and occurred more frequently in patients with elevated serum creatinine levels before treatment. Our results suggest that enterococcal PVE can often be successfully treated with antibiotics alone, and they confirm the efficacy of gentamicin when it is administered in combination with cell wall-active agents for the treatment of endocarditis due to enterococci that lack high-level resistance to this agent. 
Gastric emptying in human disease states. The application of new radioisotope methods in external in vivo scanning has increased our knowledge of how disease and treatment can effect gastric emptying (GE). Solids leave the stomach more slowly than liquids, and conditions causing gastroparesis affect solids before liquids. Gastric mucosal abnormalities and their treatment can affect GE. Diseases of the gastric musculature, including the inflammatory and endocrine myopathies, muscular dystrophies, and infiltrative disorders, can result in significant gastroparesis. Acute and chronic neuropathy may both affect gastric emptying. The latter neuropathies are now the subject of intense investigation with new prokinetic drugs. Finally, abnormal GE may be a major clinical feature of certain severe psychiatric disorders. 
Prognosis after initial recurrence of cutaneous melanoma. We reviewed 231 patients who developed recurrent disease 1 to 218 months after surgical therapy for clinical stage I cutaneous melanoma. Metastatic lesions amenable to surgery, including visceral recurrences, were resected. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy/immunotherapy or regional hyperthermic perfusion was added in patients with unresected disease. Local irradiation was employed for nonresectable brain or other isolated symptomatic metastases. The overall 5-year survival rate after initial recurrence was 36%. In patients with soft tissue or nodal recurrence, the 5-year survival rates were 49% and 38%, respectively; six (11%) of 53 patients whose initial recurrence was in a visceral organ achieved prolonged remission. Primary lesion anatomic site, thickness, pathologic type, and interval from initial therapy to recurrence were unrelated to survival. Significant prognostic factors included the site of initial metastasis, stage of primary disease, and the successful complete eradication of gross disease by surgical excision or intensive chemotherapy. 
Paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma: results of therapy in 18 cases. The management of paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma has evolved more slowly than that for testicular germ cell tumors, mainly due to its lower incidence and the lack of standardized treatment protocols. With gradual refinements in staging and therapy the prognosis has improved. Between 1960 and 1988, 18 patients 2 to 18 years old were treated at the Children's Hospital. Management consisted of inguinal orchiectomy, staging evaluation and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy according to the stage of the disease. In 11 patients (61%) the disease was confined to the scrotum, while 7 presented with spread to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, including 3 children with more distant metastases. Histological study revealed predominantly embryonal characteristics except for 1 alveolar cell type. Chemotherapy consisted of actinomycin D in 2 patients, vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide in 2, pulse vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide in 10, and doxorubicin plus vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide in 4. A total of 17 patients remain free of disease (median followup 4 years) with 1 death. The actuarial survival without relapse and over-all survival rate are 89 and 94%, respectively. We conclude that paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma represents a favorable subgroup of rhabdomyosarcoma. 
Neurotoxicity of intraventricularly administered alpha-interferon for leptomeningeal disease. Nine patients with leptomeningeal disease are reported who were treated with intraventricular alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN). In seven of these patients, a progressive vegetative state developed during treatment. The patients became unresponsive to verbal commands but opened their eyes with auditory or tactile stimulation. It took an average of 3 weeks for these patients to become verbally responsive after treatment was discontinued. Electroencephalographic findings showed evidence of irritative involvement of the deep midline nuclei in 80% of patients. Periventricular white matter changes developed during treatment in three of six patients who underwent computed tomographic scans. All patients with this severe neurotoxicity received whole-brain irradiation before treatment. Possible mechanisms for the development of this neurotoxic syndrome are discussed. The neurotoxicity of alpha-IFN and brain irradiation may be additive, suggesting a cautious approach when using this combination for treatment. 
Acoustic-distortion products: separation of sensory from neural dysfunction in sensorineural hearing loss in human beings and rabbits. Because distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) provide a noninvasive measure of outer hair-cell (OHC) activity, they should provide a unique and sensitive indicator of the effects of agents that damage hearing. Using DPOAE methods, the present study was designed to assess the relative contributions of the cochlea's outer hair cells to some common sensorineural diseases, including Meniere's disease, acoustic neuroma, and noise-induced, hereditary, and sudden idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss. Parallel evaluations of DPOAEs were performed under essentially identical conditions in rabbit models of several of the human disorders, including noise-induced hearing loss, endolymphatic hydrops, and cochlear neurectomy. Animal studies were performed to assess the proficiency of DPOAEs to track a developing sensorineural deficit as well as to compare patterns of DPOAE dysfunction between clinical and experimental forms of peripheral hearing loss. Detailed measures of DPOAEs were collected in the stimulus-frequency and intensity domains as "audiograms" and response/growth or input/output functions, respectively. The outcome of analyses of both human beings and animals supported the notion that DPOAE testing is sensitive to sensory-cell disease. Thus, in combination with conventional audiometry, DPOAE measures permit a distinction between the relative contribution sensory and neural components of the cochlea make to hearing deficits. 
Usefulness of high-frequency analysis of signal-averaged surface electrocardiograms in acute myocardial infarction before and after coronary thrombolysis for assessing coronary reperfusion. The incidence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram before and after coronary thrombolysis was studied in 54 patients with an acute myocardial infarction of less than or equal to 5 hours' duration and with an angiographically documented total occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery on admission. A significant (p = 0.038) 50% relative reduction in the incidence of late potentials was observed in the group of 35 patients who underwent reperfusion: from 16 of 35 (46%) before to 8 of 35 (23%) at 120 minutes after the start of thrombolytic treatment. No significant reduction was seen in the 19 patients in whom thrombolysis was unsuccessful: from 8 of 19 (42%) before to 7 of 19 (37%) afterward. Despite successful recanalization, late potentials persisted or newly developed after thrombolytic therapy in 8 of 54 patients (15%). It is concluded that successful thrombolysis reduces the incidence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram but that the sensitivity and specificity of this finding are not high enough to allow reliable monitoring of coronary reperfusion at the bedside. 
Localized cytosolic domains of the erythropoietin receptor regulate growth signaling and down-modulate responsiveness to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Erythrocyte development in mammals depends in part upon the interaction of the glycopeptide hormone erythropoietin (EPO) with cell surface receptors on committed erythroid progenitor cells. Both this factor and an EPO receptor polypeptide previously have been cloned, yet little is presently understood concerning molecular mechanisms of receptor activation and signal transduction. To identify cytosolic receptor domains necessary for signaling, we have compared the activities of a series of deletionally mutated EPO receptor constructs by their expression in interleukin 3-dependent, myeloid FDC-P1 cells. EPO-induced growth was transduced efficiently in these cells by the full-length receptor (507 amino acids), and no measurable loss in activity resulted from the deletion of up to 111 carboxyl-terminal residues. In contrast, the deletion of 44 additional residues led to a dramatic loss (86.3% +/- 7.8%; mean +/- SD) in the ability of this receptor to mediate EPO-induced growth, thus indicating that residues between Gly-352 and Met-396 constitute a functionally critical cytosolic subdomain. Interestingly, the expression of full-length EPO receptors in FDC-P1 cells also led to a selective inhibition of normal proliferative responsiveness to the alternative hematopoietic factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Moreover, this inhibition was progressively reversed in forms of the EPO receptor in which distal cytosolic residues were sequentially deleted. These results suggest that EPO receptors normally may trans-modulate components in the pathway of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced proliferation and that this down-modulation, as exerted by intact EPO receptors, may play a role in promoting erythroid commitment during myeloid blood cell development. 
Parenteral drug products containing aluminum as an ingredient or a contaminant: response to Food and Drug Administration notice of intent and request for information. ASCN/A.S.P.E.N. Working Group on Standards for Aluminum Content of Parenteral Nutrition Solutions. Aluminum remains a significant contaminant of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions and may be elevated in bone, urine, and plasma of infants receiving TPN. Aluminum accumulation in tissues of uremic patients and adult TPN patients has been associated with low-turnover bone disease. Furthermore, aluminum has also been linked with encephalopathy and anemia in uremic patients and with hepatic cholestasis in experimental animals. Because of the toxic effects of aluminum, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently published a notice of intent to set an upper limit of 25 micrograms/L for aluminum in large-volume parenterals and to require manufacturers of small-volume parenterals, such as calcium and phosphate salts, to measure aluminum content and note this content on the package label. The ASCN/A.S.P.E.N. Working Group on Standards for Aluminum Content of Parenteral Nutrition Solutions supports these intentions and further urges the FDA to require that cumulative aluminum intake in terms of safe, unsafe, and toxic quantities of aluminum per kilogram be made known to physicians and pharmacists preparing the TPN solutions, to ensure that manufacturers use appropriate control procedures in aluminum measurements, and to employ a standard unit of aluminum measurement. 
Repair and replacement of deep vein valves in the treatment of venous insufficiency. Venous insufficiency is a widespread condition, the prevalence of venous ulceration being 0.5-1.0 per cent in Western populations. A principal abnormality causing venous insufficiency is deep venous reflux, usually resulting from post-thrombotic valve destruction. Patients undergoing treatment for venous insufficiency should have all venous abnormalities investigated, defined and corrected where possible. Although treatment for superficial and communicating vein incompetence is available, correction of deep vein reflux has been neglected until recently. Deep vein valve physiology, the selection of patients for deep vein valve surgery and methods of valve repair and replacement are reviewed. 
Gastric villous adenoma: radiologic features. The high incidence of malignant transformation of gastric villous adenoma requires prompt diagnosis of this rare tumor. We have reported the case of such a tumor in a 29-year-old man. The radiologic appearance of a gastric soft tissue mass with a reticular pattern is highly diagnostic. 
A case of granulomatous hepatitis after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration. A 61-year-old man received intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as treatment for superficial bladder carcinoma. High spiking relapsing fevers began 39 days after the initial treatment. A liver biopsy revealed noncaseating granuloma. Deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization of the bone marrow was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Pressure exerted to instill the BCG may have favored dissemination. 
A comparison between heparin and low-dose aspirin as adjunctive therapy with tissue plasminogen activator for acute myocardial infarction. Heparin-Aspirin Reperfusion Trial (HART) Investigators BACKGROUND. We report the results of the Heparin-Aspirin Reperfusion Trial, a collaborative study comparing early intravenous heparin with oral aspirin as adjunctive treatment when recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is used for coronary thrombolysis during acute myocardial infarction. METHODS. Two hundred five patients were randomly assigned to receive either immediate and then continuous intravenous heparin (starting with a 5000-unit bolus; n = 106) or immediate and then daily oral aspirin (80 mg; n = 99) together with rt-PA (100 mg intravenously over a six-hour period) initiated within six hours of the onset of symptoms. We evaluated the patency of the infarct-related artery by angiography 7 to 24 hours after beginning rt-PA infusion, the frequency of reocclusion of the artery by repeat angiography on day 7, and ischemic or hemorrhagic complications during the hospital stay. RESULTS. At the time of the first angiogram, 82 percent of the infarct-related arteries in the patients assigned to heparin were patent, as compared with only 52 percent in the aspirin group (P less than 0.0001). Of the initially patent vessels, 88 percent remained patent after seven days in the heparin group, as compared with 95 percent in the aspirin group (P not significant). The numbers of hemorrhagic events (18 in the heparin and 15 in the aspirin group) and recurrent ischemic events (8 in the heparin and 2 in the aspirin group) were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. Coronary patency rates associated with rt-PA are higher with early concomitant systemic heparin treatment than with concomitant low-dose oral aspirin. This observation has important implications for clinical practice and should be considered in the design and interpretation of clinical trials involving coronary thrombolytic therapy. 
Reproductive and menstrual factors and risk of peritoneal and ovarian endometriosis. OBJECTIVE: Between 1987 and 1989 data were collected to evaluate risk factors for pelvic endometriosis. DESIGN: A case-control study was conducted on 241 cases with laparoscopically or laparotomically confirmed peritoneal or ovarian endometriosis consecutively admitted to three teaching hospitals in Northern Italy. The control group consisted of 437 women admitted to hospitals for acute conditions covering similar catchment areas. RESULTS: Compared with nulliparous women, the risk of endometriosis decreased with increasing number of births: the point estimates were 0.4 and 0.3, respectively, for those with one and two or more births (X2(1) trend = 50.3, P less than 0.001). No relation emerged with age at first birth and spontaneous miscarriages. Relative to women whose menarche occurred at age 11 or younger, the risk of endometriosis was slightly lower in those who experienced later menarche, but the trend in risk was not significant. Women with irregular menstrual cycles showed a lower frequency of the disease (relative risk, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.5). The role of various factors was largely similar for different disease locations (ovary, peritoneum, and both) and indication for diagnostic surgery (sterility, pelvic pain, and other reasons). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that parity and irregular/long menses lower the risk of endometriosis. These findings were similar in different subgroups of disease location and indication for surgery, giving strong evidence of the consistency of the general results. 
Will Rogers and the results of radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer. Disease-free survival rates for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated by radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy are 75% to 80% in stage B disease, 60% in stage C disease, and approximately 50% in stage D disease. Vascular invasion is an important prognostic factor in meticulously staged patients. Powerful selection factors, including more accurate clinical and pathologic staging and improved surgery, as well as unspecified selection factors, may contribute to the improved results. In order to evaluate the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy, a randomized, controlled study is necessary. 
Glutathione peroxidase deficiency and childhood seizures. 4 children with intractable seizures, repeated infections, and intolerance to anticonvulsants had evidence of glutathione peroxidase deficiency. 2 had low intracellular enzyme activity but normal blood selenium and high plasma glutathione peroxidase concentrations. The other 2 had low intracellular glutathione peroxidase activity with low circulating glutathione peroxidase and selenium concentrations. The clinical state of the children improved after discontinuation of anticonvulsant medication and selenium substitution.
