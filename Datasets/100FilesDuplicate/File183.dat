Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy versus conservative treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and bleeding esophageal varices. We performed endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) in the treatment of 37 patients with bleeding esophageal varices due to unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results were compared with those in another 33 HCC patients treated only conservatively, without EIS, during the same period. A majority of both groups died within 3 weeks after treatment. Comparing the two groups, there was no significant difference in fatal bleeding (66% vs 75%), but significantly fewer of the EIS patients died of the index hemorrhage (43% vs. 83%; p less than 0.01). Also, in the absence of portal vein thrombosis, EIS significantly reduced the risk of fatal bleeding (31% vs. 73%; p less than 0.25). The mean days of survival were 32 +/- 15 (range, 2 to 320) in the EIS group and 10 +/- 14 (range, 2 to 270) in the compared group (p less than 0.001). We conclude that EIS provides temporary control of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with unresectable HCC. The major factors contributing to EIS failure are the lethal propensity of the underlying disease and portal vein thrombosis. 
Osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck. The UCLA experience. Eighteen cases of osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck were treated at our institution between 1955 and 1987. The patients' ages ranged from 5 to 73 years, with a median age of 28 years. The sex distribution was equal. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 276 months, with a median of 79 months. The primary site of the tumor was the mandible in nine cases, maxilla and paranasal sinuses in six, skull in two, and orbit in one. Six of 18 patients were free of disease with greater than 5 years of follow-up. Four of the six received combined surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy as their primary treatment. Of the five patients treated with surgery alone, four suffered recurrences, one of whom was salvaged with further surgery and chemotherapy. Five patients were treated initially without surgery. They received radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy; all five developed local recurrence. We conclude that osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck is an aggressive tumor, prone to both local and distant failure. Based on our series and from published experience involving the extremities, osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck should be managed with multimodality therapy. 
Acute basophilic leukemia. A clinical, morphologic, and cytogenetic study of eight cases. The authors describe eight cases of acute basophilic leukemia. In six of the eight cases, basophilic involvement was not apparent by light microscopic examination. The cases were identified on the basis of ultrastructural evidence for basophil/mast cell differentiation of the blasts with little or no differentiation into other lineages. Ultrastructural analysis revealed immature basophil granules in blasts in all eight cases and theta granules in blasts in four cases. In three cases, ultrastructural evidence of mast cell differentiation also was present, with rare cells showing evidence for both basophil and mast cell differentiation. No clinical features distinguished this group of patients from others with acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetically, the cases were heterogeneous. Three had a Philadelphia chromosome; none had a t(6;9). The authors conclude that ultrastructural analysis usually must be used to diagnose acute basophilic leukemia, that acute basophilic leukemia is associated frequently with the Philadelphia chromosome, and that the ultrastructural findings provide evidence for a common origin of basophils and mast cells. 
Zones of differential sensory block during extradural anaesthesia. We have measured spinal segmental levels of anaesthesia to light touch (LT), pinprick (PP) and cold temperature discrimination (TE) during 2% lignocaine extradural anaesthesia in 22 patients, to determine if zones of differential sensory block develop during extradural anaesthesia and, if so, the extent to which TE extends beyond PP or LT levels and how age affects differential block. The median thoracic dermatomal levels were 4.5 for LT, 2.0 for PP and 2.0 for TE. Zones of differential sensory block developed within 5 min of extradural injection of local anaesthetic, and persisted for the next 55 min. In all instances, PP extended more cephalad than LT, and TE extended above PP levels. There were no differences in the extent of zones between the two groups of patients with mean ages of 28 and 48 yr. Thus, during extradural anaesthesia, sympathetic denervation extended one to two spinal segments above the sensory levels of LT and PP anaesthesia, age (28 vs 48 yr) affected neither the cephalad extent nor the width of zones of differential block, and PP levels of anaesthesia were closer to presumed levels of sympathetic block than were LT levels. 
Late complications involving the ascending aorta after cardiac surgery: recognition and management. Pseudoaneurysms and dissecting aneurysms of the ascending aorta after cardiac surgery are uncommon but important complications. Pseudoaneurysms, which result from extravasation of blood into the mediastinum, most commonly occur at the site of aortotomy or aortic cannulation. Infection may play an important role. Dissecting aneurysms after cardiac surgery usually occur at the site of aortic incision or cross clamping, especially in atherosclerotic aortas. Both conditions may be clinically silent but more frequently are seen with significant symptoms. Noninvasive techniques including CT scan, MRI, and echocardiography are very useful in the diagnosis of both complications, with contrast aortography remaining the definitive method. Surgical repair is necessary for dissecting aneurysms and for enlarging and symptomatic pseudoaneurysms, with improving morbidity and mortality. 
Endourology of lower urinary tract. Two methods for obtaining percutaneous access to the bladder are described. Depending on whether or not urethral access is available an endoscopic or fluoroscopic technique may be applied. We have successfully performed suprapubic percutaneous cystolitholapaxy, antegrade fulguration of posterior urethral valves, antegrade cystourethroscopy as an adjunct for urethroplasty, and internal drainage of a bulbar urethral abscess. Endourologic techniques may be readily applied to the lower urinary tract and may be specifically indicated in certain situations. 
Time-motion reconstruction of mitral leaflet motion from two-dimensional echocardiography in mitral valve prolapse. To assess the contributions of mitral leaflet billowing and exaggerated systolic mitral anular expansion to posterior motion of mitral leaflets recognized as mitral valve prolapse (MVP) by M-mode echocardiography, time-motion reconstructions of the anteroposterior displacement of points equally spaced along the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets were derived by computer-assisted analysis of 2-dimensional echocardiograms. Late or holosystolic posterior displacement of mitral leaflets, greater than or equal to 2 mm, occurred in the reconstructions from 24 of 24 (100%) patients with MVP with leaflet billowing and in 20 of 24 (83%) patients with MVP without leaflet billowing compared with 4 of 35 (11%) age-sex matched normal adults (both p less than 0.0000002). Posterior motion of the posterior mitral leaflet in time-motion reconstruction was significantly less with respect to the posterior end of the mitral anulus than with respect to the chest wall in patients with nonbillowing MVP (1.6 +/- 1.9 vs 2.7 +/- 1.6, p less than 0.02), but not in those with leaflet billowing (3.6 +/- 1.8 vs 3.9 +/- 1.8, p = not significant), because anular expansion contributed importantly to MVP in the former but not in the latter group. Thus, M-mode echocardiographic patterns of MVP reflect the separate but interacting effects of distinct abnormalities of mitral anular and leaflet dynamics. 
Polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma of the palate in a child. We report a case of polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma involving the palate of a 12-year-old girl, the first example of this tumour occurring in the paediatric age group. The tumour displayed infiltrative growth, neural invasion, variegated histological patterns, and minimal cytological atypia. The patient remained disease-free four years after wide local excision of the tumour. The distinction of polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma from pleomorphic adenoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma is also discussed. 
Experimental pain thresholds and plasma beta-endorphin levels during exercise. Experimental pain thresholds (electrical intracutaneous finger and dental pulp stimulation) and plasma hormone levels (beta-endorphin, cortisol, and catecholamines) were measured in ten healthy sportive men before, during, and after progressively more strenuous physical exercise. In a double-blind study conducted on two different days, 20 mg of the opioid-antagonist naloxone or placebo was administered prior to exercise. A significant pain threshold elevation was found during exercise for finger (ANOVA, P less than 0.004) and dental pulp stimulation (P less than 0.01). Pain threshold elevation was most pronounced during maximal exertion, at which time the subjects reported the greatest subjective fatigue. Thresholds remained elevated 10-15 min after the end of exercise, and, 60 min after exercise, thresholds returned to baseline values. The subjective magnitude estimation of suprathreshold stimuli was significantly reduced (P less than 0.0001) 5-10 min after exercise. Plasma beta-endorphin, cortisol, and catecholamines increased significantly (P less than 0.0005, all values) during exercise. Plasma beta-endorphin levels did not correlate significantly with pain thresholds (r = -0.37, NS). Naloxone failed to affect pain thresholds, although beta-endorphin and cortisol increased significantly more (P less than 0.02) during exercise after naloxone. It is concluded that short-term, exhaustive physical exercise can evoke a transient elevation in pain thresholds. This exercise-induced elevation in pain threshold does not, however, appear to be directly related to plasma endorphin levels. 
Arteriopathy and coarctation of the abdominal aorta in children with mucopolysaccharidosis: imaging findings. Eight children with mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I), representing 33% of all children with MPS I seen at our institution during an 18-year period, developed hypertension. Five of these hypertensive children also exhibited symptoms of aortic coarctation. The radiographic evaluation of four of these children with MPS I (three with Hurler syndrome, MPS I H, and one with Scheie disease, MPS I S) and arteriopathy affecting the thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, and visceral and renal arteries is presented. Hypertension developed in all four children before they were 4 years old; three had differences between upper- and lower-extremity blood pressures. Irregular narrowing of the abdominal aorta with either multiple minor asymmetric wall lesions (n = 2) or abrupt concentric narrowing (n = 2) was present in all children as shown by aortography (n = 3), sonography (n = 3), MR imaging (n = 2), and/or autopsy (n = 1). A variety of other vessels also were involved, including the ascending aorta (n = 1) and vertebral (n = 1), axillary (n = 1), intercostal (n = 2), lumbar (n = 2), mesenteric (n = 3), renal (n = 2), and iliac arteries (n = 3). Autopsy in one child demonstrated thickened heart valves, narrowing of the coronary arteries, and irregularity of the aorta due to deposition of mucopolysaccharide material within the intima. Our series demonstrates various facets of the arteriopathy of MPS I as shown by sonography, MR imaging, and angiography. 
Congenital arteriovenous communications and the development of two types of leaking retinal macroaneurysms. We treated a patient with a rare combination of congenital arteriovenous communications and the development of leaking macroaneurysms of different types. Initially, leaking macroaneurysms developed in the shunt area of the arteriovenous communication; later, a preexistent fusiform macroaneurysm in the afferent arteriole of the congenital communication started leaking. Because exudates and fluid from the leaking macroaneurysms reached the fovea, laser treatment was performed to obliterate the macroaneurysms. We assume that after obliteration of the macroaneurysms with laser in the shunt area, the increase of hydrostatic pressure on the thin wall of the fusiform aneurysm of the afferent artery led to its leaking. We saw no signs of vascular occlusion after laser treatment. 
In vitro balloon dilatation of mitral valve stenosis: the importance of subvalvar involvement as a cause of mitral valve insufficiency. To investigate the mechanism that increases the orifice area of the mitral valve during balloon dilatation 43 surgically excised intact rheumatic mitral valves were studied. The main pathological features were (a) fibrosis of mitral valve leaflets and commissures (10 valves); (b) fibrosis with calcification of one commissure (eight anterolateral, seven posteromedial); (c) fibrosis with calcification of both commissures (seven valves); and (d) predominant involvement of the subvalvar apparatus (11 valves). The valves were assessed by photography and radiography before and after balloon dilatation (balloons up to 38 mm (bifoil 2 x 19 mm) and pressures up to 4 atmospheres). The valve was dilated in stages under direct visual control by balloons of increasing diameter. Splitting of the fused commissures was the most common mode of widening the orifice. However, the mitral valve leaflets were torn in two fibrotic valves and in six valves with extensive involvement of the subvalvar apparatus. In the fibrotic valves (group (a] the tear originated near the valve perimeter, at the thinnest part of the remaining valve leaflet. In the valves with subvalvar involvement splitting started at the apex of spaces between the fused chordal columns and proceeded upward. Where there is extensive involvement of the subvalvar apparatus in rheumatic mitral valve disease the risk of tearing of the valve leaflets by balloon dilatation is increased and this is likely to predispose to the development of acute valvar insufficiency. 
Diagnostic value of Lipiodol injection in focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. We encountered a case of small focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) of the liver. It was difficult to distinguish FNH from hepatocellular carcinoma by means of sonography, computed tomography (CT), and angiography. After the injection of Lipiodol, it accumulated densely on FNH, but was washed away after a short time, as observed on the follow-up CT. This progress was different from that in hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Systemic toxicity of ropivacaine during ovine pregnancy. Ropivacaine is a new amide local anesthetic structurally related to bupivacaine and mepivacaine. Its potency and duration of action are similar to those of bupivacaine but its therapeutic index may be greater. Since pregnancy enhances the cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine, the current study was devised to compare the toxicity of ropivacaine in chronically instrumented nonpregnant and pregnant ewes during continuous intravenous infusion of the drug at the rate of 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1. In all animals, symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity occurred in the usual order--convulsions, hypotension, apnea, and circulatory collapse. There were no significant differences between the two groups of animals in the doses and plasma concentrations of ropivacaine associated with each toxic manifestations. For example, circulatory collapse occurred at a mean dose of 11.3 +/- 1.1 mg.kg-1 in nonpregnant and 12.4 +/- 0.9 mg.kg-1 in pregnant animals, with corresponding plasma concentrations of 7.3 +/- 0.3 and 9.6 +/- 2.1 micrograms.ml-1 (P = not significant). Protein binding of ropivacaine in the concentration range associated with toxic manifestations was similar in sera obtained from nonpregnant and pregnant ewes. In conclusion, ovine pregnancy does not enhance the systemic toxicity of ropivacaine, possibly because of an absence of gestation-related increase in the availability of free drug. 
Claudication: an unusual side effect of DHE administration. DHE is effective in the treatment of acute and chronic migraine. The side effects most commonly observed are abdominal discomfort, muscle pain, diarrhea and anxiety. DHE is a dehydrogenated amino acid ergot alkaloid and, as such, causes only limited vasoconstriction; indeed, its overall effects include peripheral vasodilation. The literature is replete with reports of clinical vasospasm and claudication occurring with therapeutic doses of ergotamine. There has not been any previous description of claudication caused by DHE. This paper describes pulselessness in two patients during relatively short courses of DHE. Treatment consisted of calcium channel blockers and discontinuation of DHE. Recovery was complete. 
Fatal varicella-zoster virus meningoradiculitis without skin involvement. A 77-year-old man with T-cell lymphoma developed an acute fatal meningoradiculitis of cranial nerve roots and cauda equina, pathologically and virologically confirmed to be caused by varicella-zoster virus. This is the first report of fatal varicella-zoster virus-induced neurological disease in the absence of skin lesions. Varicella-zoster virus should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute radiculoneuropathy in the immunocompromised patient, particularly because antiviral treatment for varicella-zoster virus exists. 
Cerebral vasculopathy associated with collateralization resembling moya moya phenomenon and with anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies. We describe a 48-year-old, previously healthy, anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibody positive black woman with negative risk factors for atherosclerosis, who developed mental status and personality changes over a 6-12-month period, and progressive cortical blindness over a 2-week period. Angiographic and computed axial tomographic studies of the brain demonstrated multiple large areas of infarction correlating with stenosis and occlusions of the internal carotid and posterior cerebral arteries. Moya moya-like findings were prominent radiographically. Results of angiographic, computed tomographic, and magnetic resonance imaging studies were interpreted as being compatible with large, medium, and small vessel disease, most likely a vasculitis. 
Factors associated with poor visual outcome in acute retinal necrosis. We reviewed 22 consecutive patients (26 eyes) with acute retinal necrosis to elucidate whether there was any sign at an early stage to predict poor visual outcome. Final visual acuity of the patients fell into two groups, one worse than 20/600 (15 eyes) and the other better than 20/30 (11 eyes). The patients with poor visual outcome showed diffuse retinal arteritis or arterial obliteration which was associated with reduced amplitude of electroretinographic a and b waves and elevated levels of circulating immune complex, even at an early stage when retinal exudates were still localised to the peripheral fundus. The retinal exudates in these patients extended rapidly to the posterior pole. In contrast, the patients with good visual outcome showed retinal arteritis limited within retinal exudates throughout the course. These signs at an early stage can be used as prognostic factors to manage patients with acute retinal necrosis more constructively. 
Behavioral aspects of temperature-taking. Ear thermometry addresses two basic psychological aspects of fevers. The first one is obvious: the battle of the rectal temperature can be eliminated by ear thermometry. The second one addresses the overtreatment of tactile fevers. Tactile temperature taken by feeling the forehead occurs in 50% to 90% of homes. Half of warm foreheads occur in afebrile children who are warm because they're releasing heat generated by a recent activity or bath. If an actual temperature were measured, these children wouldn't be mislabeled as having fever and unnecessarily treated. 
Intrahepatic hematoma: a rare complication of exchange transfusion. A four-day-old male neonate who underwent three exchange transfusions for jaundice owing to ABO incompatibility on three consecutive days is presented. A large intrahepatic hematoma developed as a complication of the third exchange transfusion. The baby fully recovered. 
Hemodynamic effects of celiprolol in essential hypertension. The immediate and short-term (2 week) hemodynamic and humoral effects of the beta-1 antagonist, beta-2 agonist, celiprolol, were compared with those of more prolonged atenolol therapy in 12 patients with essential hypertension. Celiprolol produced an immediate dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial pressure (113 +/- 3 to 102 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) and total peripheral resistance (49 +/- 3 to 38 +/- 1 U/m2; p less than 0.005) that was associated with an increased heart rate (67 +/- 1 to 73 +/- 2 beats/min; p less than 0.01) and cardiac index (2,347 +/- 129 to 2,708 +/- 111 ml/min/m2; p less than 0.01). Both celiprolol and atenolol reduced mean arterial pressure with short-term treatment (p less than 0.01); this was associated with a reduced total peripheral resistance with celiprolol (from 24 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 1 U/m2; p less than 0.02) and was not observed with atenolol. Moreover, in contrast with atenolol, celiprolol did not change heart rate or stroke and cardiac indexes. Splanchnic and forearm vascular resistances decreased with celiprolol (p less than 0.05) but not with atenolol; neither beta-blocking drug altered renal blood flow. These results demonstrate that the hemodynamic effects of celiprolol were strikingly different from atenolol; celiprolol reduced arterial pressure and total peripheral and certain vascular resistances without altering heart rate, cardiac index or regional blood flows. These effects may be explained by celiprolol's cardiac beta-1 receptor inhibitory and peripheral beta-2 receptor agonistic effects. 
Ventricular arrhythmias during treatment with alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) in suspected acute myocardial infarction. Continuous electrocardiography during the first 24 hours of a stay in a coronary care unit was used to record ventricular arrhythmias during treatment with alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) or placebo. Recordings were made on 378 of the 436 patients admitted to a double blind trial of alteplase or placebo in one participating centre of the Anglo-Scandinavian study of early thrombosis (ASSET), patients being selected according to the availability of recorders. Of these, 309 (158 given alteplase and 151 placebo) had greater than 5 hours of analysable data. Most of the arrhythmias were recorded in patients with an in hospital diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Ventricular couplets and ventricular tachycardia were significantly more common in the patients treated with alteplase. Further, in patients with myocardial infarction who had ventricular extrasystoles, couplets, or ventricular tachycardia type a, the number of hours in which each arrhythmia was recorded was significantly higher in the alteplase group. The various ventricular arrhythmias in the alteplase group tended to cluster in the first 4-12 hours of the recordings. During the first 24 hours admission there were four episodes of ventricular fibrillation in the alteplase group and five in the placebo group of taped patients. By one month there had been 18 deaths in these 309 patients (alteplase four, placebo 14). These bore no relation to any recorded arrhythmia. Clinical records for the patients with no or minimal tape data yielded six further episodes of ventricular fibrillation during the first 24 hours (three in the alteplase group and three in the placebo group). 
Multivariate assessment of traditional risk factors for chronic lung disease in very low birth weight neonates. The Newborn Lung Project. All neonates (n = 581) with birth weights less than 1501 gm admitted to seven neonatal intensive care units in Wisconsin and Iowa were candidates for a study aimed at the multivariate assessment of risk factors for chronic lung disease while controlling for baseline severity of respiratory disease. Data from 361 neonates were analyzed for all risk factors except fluids; only neonates weighing less than 1200 gm were included (n = 220). Information on traditional risk factors for chronic lung disease was abstracted. A total of 110 (30%) of the analyzed neonates were oxygen dependent on day 30 of life. The following baseline factors were associated with increased risk of oxygen dependence in a joint multivariate model: lower birth weight (odds ratio 1.4/100 gm), higher baseline severity score (odds ratio 2.7/doubling at 32 weeks gestational age), lower gestational age (odds ratio 2.4/week at severity 0), Apgar score at 1 minute (odds ratio 1.6/2 points), male gender (odds ratio 1.9), and nonblack race (odds ratio 2.2). After adjustment for all baseline factors, patent ductus arteriosus, ventilator pressure at 96 hours, oxygen at 96 hours, and fluid intake were associated with oxygen dependence. Neonates with a low baseline severity score who remained oxygen dependent had a higher intake of fluid relative to output, whereas neonates with a higher baseline severity score had higher fluid intake and output. Lack of weight loss was associated with increased severity but not with oxygen dependence. The results of this study generally confirm the significance of previously reported risk factors for chronic lung disease in a multivariate setting but show that risk factors may not have the same impact in neonates with different baseline severity. 
MR imaging of the seminal vesicles. MR imaging (0.35 and 1.50 T) was used to assess the appearance of the seminal vesicles. The size and signal intensity of normal seminal vesicles vary with the age of the subject. In general, on T2-weighted images, the signal intensity of normal seminal vesicles is lower than that of fat in prepubertal children, similar to or higher than that of fat in adults, and similar to or lower than that of fat in patients older than 70 years of age. Endocrine and radiation therapy will influence the size and signal intensity of the seminal vesicles. The purpose of the essay is to illustrate the spectrum of seminal vesicle disease, including congenital anomalies, inflammation, and neoplastic disease. Although MR imaging is helpful in depicting seminal vesicle abnormalities, it does not allow differentiation of benign from malignant disease, distinction of hemorrhage due to tumor invasion from postbiopsy changes, or distinguishing between glandular obstruction due to tumor infiltration and mechanical compression. 
A comparative, randomized study of low-dose human menopausal gonadotropin and follicle-stimulating hormone in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Treatment with low-dose follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is associated with a high rate of ovulation in anovulatory women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), but it is not clear whether the success of treatment is because of the use of pure FSH or the low dose of gonadotropin. We undertook a randomized controlled study to compare the effects of urinary FSH and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) using a low-dose regimen in 30 women with PCOS. Each subject received a maximum of three cycles of either FSH or hMG. Ovulation occurred in 75% of subjects and in 77% of cycles induced with FSH and in 94% of women, 85% of cycles of those treated with hMG. A single dominant follicle developed in 70% (FSH) and 65% (hMG) of cycles, respectively. Five singleton pregnancies occurred in each group. This study shows that low-dose FSH and hMG are equally successful in inducing ovulation, suggesting that the success of treatment depends on the low dose of gonadotropin used rather than the presence or absence of luteinizing hormone in the preparation. 
Platelet aggregating activity in serum from patients with HLA-B27 associated rheumatic and cardiac disorders: a possible link to the proliferative vascular changes. OBJECTIVE--To search for possible serum factors (immunochemical abnormalities) that reflect HLA-B27 associated inflammatory process with the proliferative endarteritis, which is an important cause of severe bradycardia and aortic valve regurgitation. PATIENTS AND METHODS--Seventy four men with pacemakers were studied: 24 were HLA-B27 positive and had associated rheumatic and cardiac disorders, 13 were B27 positive but had no clinical or radiographic signs of a related rheumatic condition, and 37 were B27 negative controls. Randomly obtained serum samples were examined for a series of serum factors. RESULTS--Thirteen (57%) of the 23 patients with HLA-B27 and associated rheumatic and cardiac conditions had platelet aggregating activity in their serum. No such activity was found in sera from patients in the other groups. None the less, immunochemical abnormalities were common among patients of all groups; 30 (41%) had antinuclear antibodies or rheumatoid factor or both. CONCLUSION--The platelet aggregating activity found in patients with HLA-B27 and associated rheumatic and cardiac conditions may reflect serum factors that increase the stickiness of platelets and increase their adhesion to the vessel wall. This suggests a link via release of platelet derived growth factor(s) with the characteristic histopathological feature of proliferative endarteritis. Immunochemical abnormalities were common in serum from all men with pacemakers. 
Tertiary syphilis of the face. We report a case of noduloulcerative tertiary syphilis that had gone misdiagnosed as discoid lupus erythematosus for many years. This case is noteworthy for (1) a Jarisch-Herxheimer-like reaction, (2) a dramatic response to penicillin therapy despite the presence of long-standing disease, and (3) posttreatment granulomas of possible hypersensitivity origin. 
Detection of human papillomavirus in head and neck tumors with DNA hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis. The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in oral, sinus, pharynx, and larynx lesions of Japanese patients was studied by Southern blot hybridization under less stringent (25% formamide, 42 degrees C) and stringent (50% formamide, 42 degrees C) conditions. Three samples from 10 benign tumors, and 3 of 30 malignant tumors, contained HPV DNA or HPV-related sequences. The HPV DNAs harbored in three laryngeal papillomas were HPV-11, -6, and -6 or -11, respectively. The HPV DNA and viral capsid antigens were easily detected by in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining. However, neither the typical restriction pattern of HPV DNA nor viral antigen was identified in the malignant tumors, suggesting that subgenomic fragments remained integrated in the host cell DNA. 
Diagnostic relevance of trigeminal evoked potentials following infraorbital nerve stimulation. A new tool in neurophysiological exploration of the trigeminal nerve has recently been introduced. It has been demonstrated that stimulation of the infraorbital nerve trunk gives rise to very reliable scalp responses reflecting the activity of the afferent pathway between the maximally nerve and the brain stem. The authors demonstrate that alterations of such trigeminal evoked responses fit with documented pathological processes at various locations along the trigeminal pathway (maxillary sinus, parasellar region, and within the brain-stem parenchyma). They report the findings in 68 patients suffering from "idiopathic" trigeminal neuralgia. Alterations of the response were detected in 33 cases, suggesting that some damage of the nerve had taken place either at the root entry zone into the pons (23 cases) or slightly distal to it (10 cases). Such results support the hypothesis that trigeminal neuralgia may be due to a compression of the trigeminal root at the pons entry zone. 
Application of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA sequence polymorphisms to the study of HBV transmission. Short sequences in hypervariable regions of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome can be used to identify different strains, providing a novel approach to the study of HBV transmission. The nucleotide sequence in positions 2551-2650 (1:EcoRI site) was determined for serum HBV DNA from 96 Chinese children living in Hong Kong and from 38 of their parents. HBV DNA was extracted and sequenced after amplification with the polymerase chain reaction, using as primers oligonucleotides corresponding to two conserved sequences. Among 82 unrelated children, 32 HBV DNA variants were present. One sequence was present in 33 children and 31 variants were found among the other 49. Siblings within each of nine families had the same variant; in three families siblings had different variants. Six of the eight fathers and 28 of the 30 mothers had HBV DNA sequences identical to those of their offspring. A total of 34 variants were found among the 134 individuals. The hypothesis of random assortment of sequences in parents and children was rejected (P less than .00005). Thus, this new approach proves the occurrence of intrafamilial transmission of HBV among Chinese. 
Antiemetic efficacy of ondansetron after outpatient laparoscopy. The safety and efficacy of ondansetron were evaluated for the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic surgical procedures. Seventy-one healthy, consenting outpatients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. A standardized anesthetic technique consisting of alfentanil-thiopental-succinylcholine for induction and alfentanil-nitrous oxide-succinylcholine for maintenance of anesthesia was used. Patients in whom postoperative nausea and/or vomiting developed and persisted for greater than or equal to 10 min received equivolemic intravenous injections of either ondansetron (8 mg) or saline (placebo) over a 2-5 min period. Ondansetron significantly decreased the posttreatment nausea scores (vs placebo) without increasing sedation or producing changes in cardiorespiratory parameters. In the placebo-treated group, 92% of the patients experienced subsequent episodes of vomiting in the postanesthesia care unit compared with 51% of the patients in the ondansetron group. Finally, only 43% of the ondansetron-treated patients required a "rescue" antiemetic compared with 86% in the placebo group. Thus, ondansetron (8 mg IV) was associated with a decreased incidence of nausea and vomiting after outpatient laparoscopic procedures. 
The rhombotin family of cysteine-rich LIM-domain oncogenes: distinct members are involved in T-cell translocations to human chromosomes 11p15 and 11p13. A chromosomal translocation in a T-cell leukemia involving the short arm of human chromosome 11 at band 11p15 disrupts the rhombotin gene. This gene encodes a protein with duplicated cysteine-rich regions called LIM domains, which show homology to zinc-binding proteins and to iron-sulfur centers of ferredoxins. Two homologues of the rhombotin gene have now been isolated. One of these, designated Rhom-2, is located on human chromosome 11 at band 11p13, where a cluster of T-cell leukemia-specific translocations occur; all translocation breakpoints at 11p13 are upstream of the Rhom-2 gene. Human and mouse Rhom-2 are highly conserved and, like rhombotin, encode two tandem cysteine-rich LIM domains. Rhom-2 mRNA is expressed in early mouse development in central nervous system, lung, kidney, liver, and spleen but only very low levels occur in thymus. The other gene, designated Rhom-3, is not on chromosome 11 but also retains homology to the LIM domain of rhombotin. Since the Rhom-2 gene is such a common site of chromosomal damage in T-cell tumors, the consistency of translocations near the rhombotin gene was further examined. A second translocation adjacent to rhombotin was found and at the same position as in the previous example. Therefore, chromosome bands 11p15 (rhombotin) and 11p13 (Rhom-2) are consistent sites of chromosome translocation in T-cell leukemia, with the 11p15 target more rarely involved. The results define the rhombotin gene family as a class of T-cell oncogenes with duplicated cysteine-rich LIM domains. 
Racial differences in responses to thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. Increased fibrin(ogen)olysis in blacks. The Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction Study Group. To determine whether there are differences in responses to thrombolytic therapy in certain populations, the data for the Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (phase 1) study were analyzed for black and white patients. Baseline variables including risk factors and extent of coronary artery disease were similar in the 352 white and 24 black patients. The time from onset of chest pain to recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy and rt-PA dosing regimens were the same in the two groups. The patency rate of the infarct-related artery at 90 minutes was 91% for blacks and was 72% for whites (p = 0.051). Blacks displayed significantly lower nadir fibrinogen levels (0.57 +/- 0.62 versus 1.3 +/- 0.76 g/l, p less than 0.0001), greater delta fibrinogen (baseline-nadir) (2.7 +/- 1.1 versus 1.7 +/- 1.1 g/l, p less than 0.0001), and increased peak levels of fibrin(ogen) degradation products (837 +/- 865 versus 245 +/- 475 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.0001). rt-PA antigen levels tended to be higher in blacks than in whites (2.8 +/- 2.2 versus 2.2 +/- 3.2 micrograms/ml [p = 0.10] at the peak and 1.6 +/- 1.3 versus 0.99 +/- 1.4 micrograms/ml [p = 0.06] at the end of the maintenance infusion). Major clinical outcomes including survival until time of hospital discharge (92% black versus 93% white, p = 0.68) were not significantly different. However, despite undergoing fewer angioplasty procedures (25% versus 46.3%, p = 0.047), blacks received more transfusions (58.8% versus 19.5% were administered greater than or equal to 2 units packed erythrocytes, p = 0.001). 
Cutaneous silica granuloma. A rare entity or rarely diagnosed? Report of two cases with review of the literature. Cutaneous silica granuloma is a poorly understood, uncommon condition that may mimic cutaneous sarcoidosis. We describe two cases of this entity and their characteristic latency period (between the time of silica exposure to the time of clinical onset of granuloma). We also review the histologic and energy dispersive x-ray analysis data, which prove the diagnosis. This condition should be recognized as an occupational dermatosis as well as the result of past incidental cuts or abrasions, which result in the development of granulomas, many in old wound scars. Differentiation from cutaneous sarcoidosis is possible with polarized light microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis. 
Congenital keratinizing desquamative squamous epithelium of the entire urinary tract. We report the clinical and pathological findings of a case of congenital desquamative squamous epithelium of the entire urinary tract associated with body dysmorphism. This entity has not been described previously in the literature. 
High-dose epinephrine improves the return of spontaneous circulation rates in human victims of cardiac arrest. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the return of spontaneous circulation (RSC) rates in human victims of cardiac arrest treated with standard doses of epinephrine (SDE) or high-dose epinephrine (HDE). DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: A university hospital emergency department during 1987 through 1989. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine adult victims of nontraumatic cardiac arrest. INTERVENTIONS: At the discretion of the treating physician, patients received epinephrine in bolus doses ranging from 1 to 15 mg. HDE was defined as a dose of at least 0.2 mg/kg; smaller doses were defined as SDE. Patients were grouped as +RSC if they developed a sustained spontaneous palpable pulse or blood pressure and as -RSC if they did not develop a pulse or blood pressure. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were grouped as +RSC if they developed a sustained spontaneous palpable pulse or blood pressure and as -RSC if they did not develop a pulse or blood pressure. Patients were also grouped by their presenting rhythm. Potentially perfusing rhythm was electromechanical dissociation or ventricular tachycardia. Nonperfusing rhythm was asystole or ventricular fibrillation. Rates were analyzed using the Fisher exact test and the two-tailed unpaired t test. HDE improved the rate of initial resuscitation (P = .008). The effect was greatest in patients with nonperfusing rhythms (P = .014) and disappeared when evaluating patients with potentially perfusing rhythms. No patient survived to hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: High-dose epinephrine improves initial resuscitation rates in human victims of cardiac arrest. Its greatest effect is in patients with a nonperfusing rhythm. 
Comparison of needle aspiration cytologic diagnosis with excisional biopsy tissue diagnosis of palpable tumors of the breast in a community hospital. Fine needle aspiration cytologic examination has not extensively been used in our hospital in the work-up evaluation of solid tumors of the breast and its reliability as a basis on which to perform definitive treatment of carcinoma of the breast was in question. One hundred and five aspiration cytologic specimens were obtained from palpable solid tumors of the breast just prior to excisional biopsy. Specimens were numbered and submitted to three different staff pathologists for diagnosis in a single blind manner. Results were then compared with tissue diagnosis of the same tumors. Of 105 specimens taken at biopsy of the breast, 28 malignant lesions were diagnosed on the final tissue report. Of those, ten were diagnosed as malignant (Class V), two were highly suspicious (Class IV) and six were insufficient specimens (Class O). Of those diagnosed as class IV and V by the results of cytologic examination, all were malignant on permanent section for a specificity of 100 per cent and a sensitivity of 36 per cent. The cytologic diagnoses of Classes I, II and III did not correlate with any histologic report, benign or malignant. Malignant growths were misdiagnosed by cytologic examination in 36 per cent and missed because of inadequate specimens in 28 per cent. We believe that a Class V cytologic finding is sufficient basis on which to perform definitive treatment of carcinoma of the breast provided rigid criteria are used. There is a learning curve associated with this diagnostic modality. 
Diabetes-induced alterations in atrial natriuretic peptide gene expression in Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats. We investigated the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) synthesis, hemodynamic parameters, blood volume, and histopathology, as well as the reversibility of such effects with insulin therapy in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The biatrial ANP messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the diabetic WKY rats increased by 16-17% compared with those in the age-matched WKY rats at 12 weeks after the onset of diabetes, whereas their ventricular ANP mRNA levels showed increases of 190% in left ventricles and 160% in right ventricles at 8 weeks. In the diabetic SHRs, the left atrial ANP mRNA levels increased by 36% compared with those in the age-matched SHRs, as early as 4 weeks after diabetes onset. Their ventricular ANP mRNA levels also showed 80-82% increases in left and right ventricles at 4 weeks. In proportion to changes in cardiac ANP synthesis, the biventricular end-diastolic pressures were significantly elevated at 8 weeks in the diabetic WKY rats and at 4 weeks in the diabetic SHRs. The blood volume significantly increased at 8 weeks in the diabetic WKY rats and remained higher thereafter, whereas it did not change in the diabetic SHRs throughout the experimental period. The left ventricular peak dP/dt was depressed in the 8-week diabetic SHRs, whereas in the diabetic WKY rats, its depression was observed at 12 weeks after diabetes onset. Histopathological studies showed that diabetic changes in ANP synthesis and hemodynamic parameters described above occurred before the cardiomyopathic histological changes. Cardiac ANP synthesis in the diabetic rats completely reverted to control levels after insulin therapy, accompanied by normalization of hemodynamic parameters. The present study indicates that 1) ANP synthesis is significantly augmented in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat compared with that in the normal rat, and the combination of diabetes and hypertension produces an earlier and greater effect in stimulating cardiac ANP synthesis than does either disease alone; 2) an elevation in the intraventricular filling pressure that occurs before observable cardiomyopathic histopathological alterations might be involved partially in the augmented ANP synthesis; and 3) the reversibility with insulin therapy suggests that the streptozotocin-induced alterations observed in cardiac ANP synthesis and hemodynamics result from insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus, not from cardiac toxicity of streptozotocin. 
Lack of effect of peroral acyclovir for the treatment of acute infectious mononucleosis. Perorally administered acyclovir was evaluated in the therapy of acute infectious mononucleosis in a multicentered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 120 patients received 600 mg of acyclovir or placebo five times daily for 10 days. All patients were entered into the study within 7 days of symptom onset and had a positive Monospot test. Analysis of mean values and time to resolution of fever, lymphadenopathy, weight change, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, liver function tests, atypical lymphocytes, hours of bed rest, sense of well-being, and return to normal activities revealed no significant differences. There was a trend toward suppression of Epstein-Barr virus excretion in the oropharynx in acyclovir recipients. No toxicity was detected in patients treated with acyclovir. Under the conditions of the study, there was no evidence that treatment with perorally administered acyclovir affected the course of infectious mononucleosis. 
Eicosapentanoic acid suppresses intimal hyperplasia after expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafting in rabbits fed a high cholesterol diet. The effect of purified eicosapentanoic acid on intimal fibrous hyperplasia in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts was examined in 18 rabbits undergoing infrarenal aorta reconstruction. Six rabbits received commercial rabbit chow (control group), six a regular diet supplemented with 1% cholesterol (cholesterol group), and six the cholesterol diet with 91.1% pure eicosapentanoic acid 500 mg/day (eicosapentanoic acid group). Grafts were harvested 3 months after surgery for histologic examination. The platelet count and serum beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 concentrations were not significantly different between groups. Serum arachidonic acid level in the cholesterol group was significantly higher than in the control group, and serum eicosapentanoic acid levels in the eicosapentanoic acid group were significantly higher than in the remaining two groups. Intergroup differences in serum 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 concentrations were not significant. Intimal thickness at midgraft was 5.2 +/- 6.2 microns in the control group, 67.6 +/- 46.9 microns in the cholesterol group, and 19.2 +/- 18.4 microns in the eicosapntanoic acid group. intimal thickness in the cholesterol group was greater than in either the control or licosapentanoic acid group (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). These data suggest that eicosapentanoic acid reduces intimal fibrous proliferation in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafting as a result of hypercholesterolemia and that this effect is independent of the platelet count, activated platelet factors, and the prostacyclin/thromboxane A2 ratio. 
Transforming growth factor alpha expression helps to distinguish keratoacanthomas from squamous cell carcinomas. Keratoacanthomas may be difficult to distinguish histologically from squamous cell carcinomas. We studied 20 keratocanthomas and 22 squamous cell carcinomas immunohistochemically using an antibody directed against transforming growth factor alpha to determine if the pattern of transforming growth factor alpha expression would provide a useful method of differentiating these tumors. Ninety percent of the keratoacanthomas demonstrated a diffuse pattern within tumor lobules in which all but the most peripheral rim of cells were stained. A similar localization of transforming growth factor alpha was not identified in squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, 40% of the squamous cell carcinomas but none of the keratoacanthomas showed focal transforming growth factor alpha immunostaining. Our results suggest that transforming growth factor alpha expression may be a marker of epithelial differentiation and may help distinguish between these two tumors. 
Endocarditis prophylaxis in a primary care clinic. BACKGROUND. Primary care physicians often make decisions about the use of endocarditis prophylaxis (EP). Compliance with American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations has been found to be poor in hospitalized patients and in a dental school clinic. The purpose of this study was to examine the use of endocarditis prophylaxis in a primary care clinic. METHODS. The problem list of all adult patients seen in a primary care clinic in 1989 was reviewed for diagnoses that might require EP. Eighty-four charts were identified and reviewed. RESULTS. Sixty-five percent of the study patients had documentation in their charts about the need for EP. Mitral valve prolapse was the most frequent diagnosis. The physicians recommended EP for most patients with mitral valve prolapse regardless of whether there was documented mitral insufficiency. Endocarditis prophylaxis was most commonly prescribed for dental procedures. Six patients received prophylaxis for procedures for which the AHA does not recommend prophylaxis. Only 19% of the antibiotic regimens prescribed were entirely consistent with the AHA 1984 guidelines. The most common deviation from the AHA guidelines was continuing oral antibiotics too long. CONCLUSIONS. Compliance with the AHA 1984 recommendations, although better than reported in other settings, was less than optimal in this primary care clinic. Family physicians should consider whether EP is indicated in any patient with cardiac disease. If prophylaxis is indicated, then such a recommendation should be clearly documented in the chart. Family physicians need to be familiar with the 1990 AHA recommendations. 
A clinical and experimental study on all-trans retinoic acid-treated acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. Fifty patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) have been treated with all-trans retinoic acid (RA). In vitro induced differentiation of primarily cultured bone marrow cells from the patients, colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and L-CFU colony-forming assays, and karyotype analysis were performed over the treatment course. The very high bone marrow complete remission (CR) rate (94%) suggested that all-trans RA was superior to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of APL. The leukemic clone was reduced by RA-induced terminal differentiation and loss of proliferation capacity of leukemic cells. Relapse after CR in about 40% of patients was the major reason for the failure of the RA treatment. Patients who relapsed after a chemotherapy-maintained CR could be effectively reinduced to second CR by RA. However, if relapse occurred after a CR maintained by both RA and chemotherapy, the sensitivity of newly emerged leukemic clones to RA was greatly reduced. Therefore, it is suggested that RA should be replaced by conventional chemotherapy as soon as CR is achieved. Laboratory studies proved valuable in selecting cases for RA therapy and in predicting therapeutic effects and prognosis. 
Newer variants and simulants of basal cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has characteristic clinical and histopathologic findings that facilitate accurate diagnosis. There are, however, many variants and simulants of BCC that may cause clinical and/or histopathologic confusion. These entities often have features in common with BCC, with nodular or sclerosing basaloid islands, peripheral palisading, stromal retraction, (pseudo)-glandular formation, and/or prominent mucin. Recently described BCC variants, including signet-ring BCC and granular cell BCC, are discussed. Less commonly appreciated basaloid simulants, including ameloblastoma, cloacogenic carcinoma, and mucinous carcinoma, are described. Distinguishing among these variants and simulants of BCC is important because treatment and prognosis of each may vary. 
Serum testosterone:dihydrotestosterone ratio and CA 19-9 in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The testosterone:dihydrotestosterone ratio (T:DHT) and the antigenic marker CA 19-9 were studied in the serum of 21 male patients with pancreatic cancer and 62 controls with other gastrointestinal malignancies or benign pancreatobiliary disease. Specificity of the T:DHT ratio was 98%, significantly better than the specificity of CA 19-9 at both a 37 U/ml cutoff level (61%) and at 100 U/ml (79%). Sensitivity of the T:DHT ratio was 67%, and that of CA 19-9, 71% and 90% at the upper and lower cutoff levels, respectively. False-negative results of the T:DHT ratio were found predominantly in cases of advanced pancreatic cancer, whereas all four stage I patients had an abnormal (less than 5) T:DHT ratio. These results suggest that the T:DHT ratio is a useful marker for pancreatic cancer in males. It can be used alone or in combination with CA 19-9, and should be further evaluated in the differential diagnosis of patients with the early stages of this disease. 
Localization and needle aspiration of breast lesions: complications in 370 cases. A prospective study of the immediate complications of 370 consecutive breast-imaging procedures (203 wire localizations and 167 radiographically or sonographically guided fine-needle aspirations) is reported. Vasovagal reactions occurred in 27 (7%) of 370 cases, ranging in severity from syncope (four of 370, 1%) to mild light-headedness. These vasovagal reactions were independent of procedure type or use of local anesthesia, but were more common in younger patients. Other complications included prolonged (5 min or longer) bleeding (three of 370, 1%) and extreme pain (two of 370, 1%). One patient was found to have malignant hypertension. We conclude that wire localizations and imaging-guided aspirations are generally well tolerated procedures. However, vasovagal reactions are frequent enough to warrant close observation of patients. Radiologists and breast-imaging personnel should be able to recognize and treat vasovagal reactions. 
Isradipine for treatment of acute hypertension after myocardial revascularization. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and duration of action of iv isradipine in the control of postoperative hypertension immediately after myocardial revascularization. DESIGN: Prospective, phase 2 trial. SETTING: Surgical ICU, university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-one (15 male, six female) patients, ages 49 to 75 yr (mean 65 +/- 5), undergoing elective myocardial revascularization. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-one patients with postoperative hypertension after coronary artery bypass graft surgery received iv isradipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium-channel antagonist. Mean duration of the isradipine infusion was 96.9 +/- 29 min. Mean dose of isradipine, indexed to weight, was 16.63 +/- 6.66 micrograms/kg (n = 20). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty of the 21 patients achieved satisfactory BP control. The reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP), first noted at the 15-min point, was maximal at 1 hr when MAP decreased from 102 +/- 9 mm Hg baseline to 81 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than .01), accompanied by a significant (p less than .01) decrease in systemic vascular resistance from 1753 +/- 339 baseline to 1180 +/- 229 dyne.sec/cm5. The CVP, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure did not change significantly. Heart rate and cardiac index increased; however, stroke volume index did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Isradipine is an acceptable agent for the treatment of hypertension in this setting. 
Lipolytic response to metabolic stress in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To measure whole-body lipolysis and fatty acid re-esterification in critically ill patients. DESIGN: The rates of appearance of glycerol and palmitic acid in blood plasma were measured by infusing stable isotope tracers [2H5]glycerol and [1-13C]palmitic acid, respectively. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. SETTING: Medical ICU of The University of Texas Medical Branch Hospital, a university-based referral center. PATIENTS: Five uninjured critically ill patients. Four patients were hospitalized because of respiratory insufficiency and one because of myocardial infarction. Three patients died during their hospitalization. INTERVENTIONS: Metabolic studies were performed in each patient after an overnight (12-hr) fast. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean +/- SE glycerol and fatty acid rates of appearance were 4.5 +/- 1.0 and 11.5 +/- 0.8 mumol/kg.min, respectively. The ratio of fatty acid to glycerol rate of appearance was 2.9 +/- 0.5. Resting energy expenditure was 132 +/- 6% of predicted. CONCLUSIONS: An accelerated rate of lipolysis is part of the metabolic response to severe stress, regardless of its etiology. Because the rate of fatty acid release far exceeded energy requirements, fatty acids that were not oxidized as fuel were re-esterified to triglyceride, presumably in the liver. 
Prediction of uneventful cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm from direct-current electrical cardioversion of chronic atrial fibrillation and flutter. The present study was undertaken to reassess prospectively the immediate and long-term results of direct-current electrical cardioversion in chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and to determine factors predicting clinical outcome of the arrhythmia after direct-current cardioversion. Two-hundred forty-six patients underwent direct-current electrical cardioversion and were followed during a mean of 260 days. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors predicting short- and long-term arrhythmia outcome. Cardioversion was achieved in 70% of patients with atrial fibrillation and in 96% of patients with atrial flutter. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that arrhythmia duration (p less than 0.001), type of arrhythmia (fibrillation vs flutter, p less than 0.02) and age (p less than 0.05) independently influenced conversion rate. On an actuarial basis, 42 and 36% of patients remained in sinus rhythm during 1 and 2 years, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the type of arrhythmia (p = 0.0008), low precardioversion functional class (p = 0.002) and the presence of nonrheumatic mitral valve disease (p = 0.03) independently increased the length of the arrhythmia-free episode. Rheumatic heart disease shortened this period (p = 0.03). In conclusion, patients having a high probability of conversion together with a prolonged post-shock arrhythmia-free episode can be identified. This may improve the cost-benefit ratio of cardioversion. 
Serum sialic acid levels in patients with oral and maxillofacial malignancy. Serum sialic acid levels were measured using the thiobarbituric acid method in 80 healthy subjects and in 40 patients with benign and 61 with malignant tumors in the oral and maxillofacial region. It was shown that the cancer group had statistically higher sialic acid levels than control group and the group with benign disease (P less than .05), but no significant difference was noted between the normal control group and the patients with benign tumor (P greater than .05). Serum sialic acid levels were significantly higher in the patients with stages III and IV cancer than in those individuals with stage I and II cancer, but no differences were seen between stages I and II, and between stages III and IV cancer patients (P greater than .05). There was also no difference when considering the anatomic site of the malignant lesion. Furthermore, during the serial sialic acid determination in cancer patients before and following treatment, the sialic acid levels usually declined with remission of the disease and increased with recurrence, metastasis, or a poor prognosis. We conclude from this study that the sequential measurement of sialic acid level is particularly useful in monitoring patients with oral cancer, and sialic acid may prove to be a valuable tumor marker in oral and maxillofacial malignancy. 
Renoduodenal fistula in a patient with chronic nephrostomy drainage: a case report. We describe the occurrence of a renoduodenal fistula related to a nephrostomy tube in a patient with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis and renal calculi. The patient was successfully treated by nephrectomy. Etiological, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects are discussed. 
Gallstone formation after major abdominal surgery. 84 patients underwent multiple abdominal ultrasound examinations over a median of 36 months (range 6-140). 11 had gallstones at their first ultrasound examination, and were excluded from further analysis. Of the remaining 73 patients, 12 of 47 who underwent major abdominal surgery had gallstones within 14-36 months of operation, compared with 0 of 26 who did not undergo such surgery. The cumulative prevalence of new gallstones within 3 years of major surgery was 28%; no new gallstones were seen from 36 to up to 140 months postoperatively. By univariate and logistic regression analysis, age and major abdominal surgery were the only significant clinical determinants for the appearance of gallstones during follow-up. The findings of this retrospective study indicate that major abdominal surgery may accelerate the development of gallstones in some patients. If confirmed in a prospective study, it may be possible to define groups at high risk of gallstones after surgery and to institute prophylactic measures. 
Nonepileptic events in childhood. The medical records of 27 children admitted to the MINCEP Epilepsy Program for evaluation of intractable epilepsy but later shown to have nonepileptic events by EEG with simultaneous video monitoring were reviewed. Four groups were identified: pure psychogenic events (5 patients), psychogenic events plus epileptic seizures (3 patients), pure nonepileptic physiologic events (5 patients), and nonepileptic physiologic events plus seizures (14 patients). Historical data, physical examinations, and neurodiagnostic evaluations (including previous EEGs, neuroradiologic evaluations, and neuropsychologic testing) were reviewed. Children in all groups, except for those with pure psychogenic seizures, had a history of multiple seizure types identified by parents or caretakers. A history of status epilepticus was obtained in 64% (of 22 patients), including 11 of 14 patients with physiologic events plus seizures. Abnormal findings on neurologic examination were common, especially in children with nonepileptic physiologic events. All but two patients had a history of interictal epileptiform abnormalities on previous routine EEGs. Based on identification of nonepileptic events, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were discontinued completely in eight patients (30%) and the total number of AEDs was reduced in nine others (33%). A diagnosis of nonepileptic events should be considered in all children with refractory seizures or multiple seizure types. Abnormal findings on routine (interictal) EEG may actually confound the diagnosis. Intensive neurodiagnostic EEG-video recording is the preferred method for distinguishing nonepileptic from epileptic seizures. 
Metabolic consequences of (regional) total pancreatectomy. Little information has been reported on the metabolic characteristics of the totally pancreatectomized patient or the efficacy of medical management after radical pancreatic surgery. The prospective evaluation of 49 such patients, with 31% followed for 48 or more months, forms the basis of this report. The major immediate postoperative challenge is control of diarrhea and weight stabilization. Chronically patients have an increased daily caloric requirement (mean +/- SE, 56 +/- 1 kcal/kg), not wholly explained by moderate steatorrhea (fecal fat excretion, 16% +/- 2% of unrestricted fat intake). Despite persistent malabsorption, deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamin, magnesium, and trace element serum levels can be prevented in most patients. Pancreatogenic diabetes is characterized by (1) absence of the major glucoregulatory hormones insulin and glucagon, (2) instability, and (3) frequent hypoglycemia, with the latter parameters improving with rigorous home glucose monitoring. No patient has developed clinically overt diabetic micro- or macrovascular disease. Performance status in long-term survivors has been reasonable. However adverse chronic sequelae of the operation occur and include an unusual frequency of liver disease, characterized by accelerated fatty infiltration, and osteopenia, with an 18% reduction in radial bone mineral content noted in pancreatectomized patients studied more than 5 years after surgery. 
Ultrasonography of acute abdominal pain in children. OBJECTIVE.--To determine the ability of ultrasonography to detect appendicitis and to identify other conditions responsible for symptoms in children with acute abdominal pain. DESIGN.--Cohort study. The accuracy of ultrasonographic results was assessed in relation to final diagnoses established by surgery or by composite clinical data and follow-up. SETTING.--Metropolitan, pediatric hospital; ambulatory and hospitalized patients. PATIENTS.--Consecutive sample of 178 pediatric patients who were referred for ultrasonography because of suspected acute appendicitis, but in whom the diagnosis could not be definitively established by clinical criteria. RESULTS.--Appendicitis was proven at surgery in 38 patients. Ultrasonography demonstrated the findings of appendicitis (noncompressible appendix with or without concomitant periappendiceal fluid collection or appendicolith) in 31 (82%) of these patients. Among the 140 children without appendicitis, other specific diagnoses were established by clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings in 58 patients (including gynecologic diseases in 25, gastrointestinal tract abnormalities in 17, renal diseases in six, and extra-abdominal disease in 10). Ultrasonography aided in the diagnosis of other conditions in 34 (59%) of these 58 patients. No definitive clinical diagnosis was established in the remaining 82 patients. There were no false-positive results of ultrasonography. CONCLUSION.--Approximately half of children referred for suspected appendicitis will have a final diagnosis of abdominal pain of unknown origin. In the remainder, ultrasonography is useful, both to establish the diagnosis of appendicitis and to aid in diagnosing other causes of acute abdominal pain. 
Preneoplastic alterations in nuclear morphology that accompany loss of tumor suppressor phenotype. Alterations of nuclear shape are frequently observed in tumor cells, but the genes controlling these changes and the stage in the neoplastic process at which they occur are unknown. We have studied nuclear shape changes in chemically immortalized, nontumorigenic Syrian hamster embryo cell clones that had either retained (supB+) or lost (supB-) the ability to suppress the tumorigenic phenotype when they were hybridized with a tumor cell line (BP6T). Quantitative morphometric analysis of the nuclei of cells from each of two pairs of supB+/supB- variants indicated that the nuclei of supB- cells were significantly more out of round than those of their corresponding supB+ clones. These data indicate that modification of nuclear structure may represent an early, preneoplastic event in multistep chemical carcinogenesis and that loss of a tumor suppressor gene function may regulate alterations in nuclear morphology. 
Expanded clinical evaluation of lovastatin (EXCEL) study results: IV. Additional perspectives on the tolerability of lovastatin. This randomized, double-blind, multicenter, diet-and-placebo-controlled study was designed to clarify the dose-response relationship of lovastatin therapy to lipid-modifying efficacy and drug-related adverse events. Exclusion criteria were minimized so that study patients were representative of the majority of patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia seen in medical practice. After 6 weeks on the American Heart Association Step 1 Diet, a total of 8,245 patients were randomly assigned to 48 weeks of treatment with diet and placebo or lovastatin at dosages of 20 or 40 mg once a day or 20 or 40 mg twice a day. All adverse events were monitored, with particular attention to evaluation of liver and muscle. Liver transaminase elevations suggestive of possible hepatotoxicity, defined as successive elevations in either aspartate transaminase or alanine aminotransferase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, occurred in equal numbers of placebo and lovastatin 20 mg/day treated patients (0.1%). The frequencies were higher in lovastatin 40 mg/day and 80 mg/day patient groups (0.9 and 1.5%, respectively). No patient was diagnosed as having clinically symptomatic hepatic dysfunction. Creatinine kinase (CK) elevations above the upper limit of normal occurred frequently in placebo- (29%), as well as lovastatin-treated patients (29-35%), and muscle symptoms were reported with similar frequency in all groups (7-9%). The combination of muscle symptoms with marked CK elevations (greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal) was seen in only five patients: one in a 40 mg/day dose group and four in the 80 mg/day dose group. No patient developed rhabdomyolysis. The incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events requiring discontinuation was 6% for the placebo group and from 7% (20 mg/day) to 9% (80 mg/day) for lovastatin treatment groups. No new types of adverse experiences related to lovastatin treatment were reported. Lovastatin, as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated LDL cholesterol, was generally very well tolerated. 
Unusual diffuse pulmonary lymphatic proliferation in a young boy. We describe a 4-year-old boy who died of an unusual generalized pulmonary lymphatic proliferation. His condition cannot clearly be categorized with any of the previously described pulmonary lymphatic disorders. 
View from beneath: pathology in focus. ENT presentation of Ollier's disease. Cartilaginous tumours occurring in the head and neck are usually regarded and seen as solitary lesions. However, we present an unique case where the cartilaginous tumour in the ENT region was the presenting feature of Ollier's disease (multiple enchondromatosis). It is recommended that further investigations be carried out in patients with cartilaginous tumours presenting in the head and neck to exclude the possible presence of this unusual and interesting syndrome. 
Hypoxia-inducible nuclear factors bind to an enhancer element located 3' to the human erythropoietin gene. Human erythropoietin gene expression in liver and kidney is inducible by anemia or hypoxia. DNase I-hypersensitive sites were identified 3' to the human erythropoietin gene in liver nuclei. A 256-base-pair region of 3' flanking sequence was shown by DNase I protection and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays to bind four or more different nuclear factors, at least two of which are induced by anemia in both liver and kidney, and the region functioned as a hypoxia-inducible enhancer in transient expression assays. These results provide insight into the molecular basis for the regulation of gene expression by a fundamental physiologic stimulus, hypoxia. 
Primary pulmonary hypertension. Dyspnea is the most common symptom of primary pulmonary hypertension, an often fatal disease that has no apparent cause. Decreased cardiac output, congestive heart failure, and increased systemic venous pressure occur as the disease progresses. Use of oxygen therapy and vasodilators improves the prognosis in some patients. Those with little hope for long-term survival may benefit from heart and lung transplantation. 
Perceptual filling in of artificially induced scotomas in human vision. Patients with scotomas or blind-spots in their visual field resulting from damage to the visual pathways often report that the pattern from the rest of the visual field 'fills in' to occupy the scotoma. Here we describe a novel technique for generating an artificial perceptual scotoma which enabled us to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of this filling-in process. A homogeneous grey square subtending 1.5 degrees was displayed against a background of twinkling two-dimensional noise of equal mean luminance. On steady eccentric fixation for 10 s the square vanished and was filled in by the twinkling noise from the surround. Using this display we found that 'filling in' is an active visual process that probably involves creating an actual neural representation of the surround rather than merely ignoring the absence of information from the scotoma; filling in can occur separately for colour and texture, suggesting separate mechanisms; the filling-in process does not completely suppress information from the scotoma, even after an image has faded completely from consciousness it can nevertheless contribute to motion perception; and the process can be strongly influenced by illusory contours. 
Anal endosonography in the investigation of faecal incontinence. Forty-four consecutive patients with incontinence of solid stool of traumatic or idiopathic aetiology were examined by anal endosonography and standard anorectal physiology tests. Anal endosonography showed an external anal sphincter defect in four out of 11 (36 per cent) patients with idiopathic (neurogenic) incontinence. In the remaining seven patients both parts of the sphincter were intact and a linear relationship was found between the resting anal canal pressure and the endosonographic thickness of the internal anal sphincter. Twenty-eight out of 33 (85 per cent) patients with incontinence of traumatic origin had external sphincter defects, confirmed by concentric needle electromyogram mapping in the 19 patients in whom this was performed. Eleven of these 28 (39 per cent) patients also had disruption of the internal sphincter. Anal endosonography has revealed significant abnormalities in patients with faecal incontinence and has a complementary role to anorectal physiology in the routine investigation of these patients. 
Appendicitis. Improvements in diagnosis and treatment. The results of therapy in cases of suspected acute appendicitis were reviewed in 844 consecutive cases of appendicitis occurring over a 3-year period. A diagnostic accuracy of 87.4 per cent was found as well as a perforation rate of 18.4 per cent. Complication rates varied with the clinical state of the appendix: 16 per cent in perforated, 5.6 per cent in nonperforated, and 11.3 per cent in normal appendices. Excellent results were routinely obtainable employing early operative intervention, perioperative antibiotics, and a systematic surgical approach. 
Duodenocaval fistula in peptic ulceration. Duodenocaval fistula is usually caused by abdominal trauma. We report a patient in whom it was associated with peptic ulcer. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma, alcohol, and cirrhosis: facts and hypotheses. Despite the epidemiological evidence of a correlation between ethanol abuse and hepatocellular carcinoma, some of the results of experimental and clinical studies remain controversial. Apart from inducing cirrhosis, which may be viewed as a precancerous liver lesion, ethanol may act as a cocarcinogen. Most investigations on this topic have focused on two aspects: ethanol's capacity to induce the cytochrome P-450-dependent microsomal biotransformation system and its interference with at least one DNA repair mechanism. Ethanol exposure enhances the capacity of mixed function oxidases to activate many chemical carcinogens, such as dimethylnitrosamine (DMN). On the other hand, ethanol exposure fails to influence DMN-induced liver carcinogenesis. The capacity of alcohol to inhibit DMN-demethylase activity has not been clearly demonstrated in experiments carried out with human tissue. In conclusion, both the effects of ethanol and their underlying mechanisms as regards liver carcinogenesis are open to debate. The link between ethanol abuse and hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be mediated mainly by its capacity to induce cirrhosis. 
Gastric carcinoma in patients with Crohn disease: report of four cases. An association between Crohn disease and gastric carcinoma has not been described before. However, we report four patients with documented Crohn disease in whom gastric carcinoma developed later. In three of the four patients, onset of Crohn disease occurred after the age of 40. All of the patients had nonspecific constitutional symptoms and/or complaints referable to the upper gastrointestinal tract. No clinical evidence of active Crohn disease was present. In each patient, barium examination and CT showed either a mass (two cases) or other radiologic features of malignancy (two cases). Endoscopy with biopsy was performed in three patients and findings were misleading in two patients. The possibility of an increased risk of malignancy in sites remote from inflamed bowel segments has been reported. The findings in this study suggest that patients with Crohn disease, particularly disease of late onset, may be predisposed to the development of gastric carcinoma. 
Cardiovascular causes of syncope. Identifying and controlling trigger mechanisms. Syncope usually has a cardiovascular source, so neurologic evaluation has a low diagnostic yield in these patients. Cardiac arrhythmias in persons with or without structural heart disease can produce syncope. Neurocardiogenic dysfunction that results in diminished venous return and hypercontractility is another frequent cause. Postural hypotension or left ventricular outflow obstruction may also be to blame. Careful history taking and physical examination, head-up tilt testing, echocardiography or radionuclide isotope imaging, and electrophysiologic study are often diagnostic. However, syncope remains undiagnosed in some patients, and they may require periodic reassessment. Treatment options are available for most cardiovascular disorders, among them use of pharmacologic agents; catheter, surgical, or radio-frequency modification of certain tachycardias; and permanent pacing. 
Acute ethanol intoxication decreases the likelihood of resuscitation from cardiac arrest in rats. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Acute ethanol intoxication has been shown to depress myocardial performance in both laboratory and clinical studies. The present study was designed to examine the effect of acute ethanol intoxication on resuscitation of rats subjected to cardiac arrest. Rats were given 1.2 g ("moderately intoxicated") or 2.4 g ("highly intoxicated") of ethanol/kg, or distilled water ("nonintoxicated" rats). Using a standardized technique, we induced cardiac arrest. CPR was then attempted using chest compressions interposed with abdominal compressions. Resuscitation was said to be successful if BP returned spontaneously within 6 mins of institution of chest compressions interposed with abdominal compressions, and if systolic BP was 50% of its prearrest level within 10 mins of discontinuation of chest compressions interposed with abdominal compressions. Mean +/- SD serum ethanol levels were 121.3 +/- 12.9 mg/dL (26.3 +/- 2.8 mmol/L) (moderately intoxicated rats) and 254.4 +/- 34.6 mg/dL (55.2 +/- 7.5 mmol/L) (highly intoxicated rats). RESULTS: Resuscitation was successful in 75% (15/20) of nonintoxicated rats, 46.7% (7/15) of moderately intoxicated rats, and 33.3% (5/15) of highly intoxicated rats. The difference in resuscitation rates was significant for nonintoxicated rats compared with either intoxicated rats as a group (p = .021) or highly intoxicated rats (p = .019), but was not significant for nonintoxicated rats compared with moderately intoxicated rats. CONCLUSION: Acute ethanol intoxication appears to decrease the likelihood of successful resuscitation in a dose-dependent fashion. 
Composite tissue transfer in limb-salvage surgery. After extensive resection due to extremity sarcoma, the inability to cover the defect for satisfactory healing and limb function has been an indication for amputation rather than limb salvage. We report herein our experience with seven limb-salvage cases in which we closed difficult and complex defects with composite tissue transfers utilizing microvascular techniques. Free-flap transfers were used to cover soft-tissue defects after extensive resection of primary and locally recurrent tumor and to manage radiation-induced complications. The grafts healed well when infected irradiated tissue was covered, and the grafts tolerated postoperative irradiation. Composite tissue transfer also provided soft-tissue coverage around distal joints that would not have been adequately protected with a skin graft. Complications were minimal, and all patients maintained good extremity function. No patient who underwent composite tissue transfer has had a local recurrence. A free-flap composite tissue transfer can extend the indications for limb-salvage surgery and offers an alternative to amputation in selected patients. 
Clostridial mycotic aneurysm of the suprarenal abdominal aorta. Clostridial mycotic aneurysms are unusual. We therefore record a fatal case of a ruptured clostridial mycotic aneurysm of the suprarenal aorta which developed several weeks after the resection of a segment of gangrenous small bowel. 
Single-photon emission computed tomographic thallium imaging with adenosine, dipyridamole, and exercise. Stress thallium imaging is a sensitive technique for detecting coronary artery disease, particularly in those patients with multivessel disease. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is superior to planar imaging; because of improved image quality and lack of overlap between normal and abnormal segments, SPECT has greater ability to detect diseased arteries. The inherent three-dimensional nature of the data presentation suggests the feasibility of quantifying the extent of myocardium at risk. Pharmacologic stressors such as adenosine and dipyridamole allow imaging with thallium (and probably other perfusion agents) even in patients who are not candidates for exercise testing or who cannot achieve adequate levels of exercise. Studies suggest that adenosine has unique advantages for use with SPECT perfusion imaging with a high degree of accuracy. In our experience the sensitivity of detecting one-vessel disease is higher with adenosine-thallium imaging than in exercise SPECT thallium imaging. The degree of coronary hyperemia is greater and the duration of action is shorter with adenosine than with dipyridamole. 
Benign vascular sexual headache and exertional headache: interrelationships and long term prognosis. There is a definite relationship between the vascular type of benign sexual headache and benign exertional headache. Forty five patients with benign vascular sexual headache were reviewed. Twenty seven (60%) experienced benign vascular sexual headache alone and eighteen (40%) had experienced both benign vascular sexual headache and benign exertional headache on at least one occasion. The mean age was 34.3 years with a male:female ratio of 5.4:1. Thirty patients with a history of benign vascular sexual headache were followed for an average of 74 months. A personal history of migraine was found in 47% of cases and a family history of migraine in 30%. Forty one per cent of patients with benign vascular sexual headache alone had recurrences after diagnosis, and stress and fatigue were considered major contributing factors to the initial and recurrent headache. Nine patients had experienced benign vascular sexual headache and benign exertional headache within 72 hours of each other on at least one occasion, often with a residual headache between the two. Four patients experienced their benign vascular sexual headache and benign exertional headache separated by months to years. The prognosis of benign vascular sexual headache and the clinical and possible pathophysiological relationships between benign vascular sexual headache and benign exertional headache are discussed. Knowledge of the interrelationships of these varieties of headache is valuable in the counselling of patients. 
Effect of antihypertensive drugs on insulin, glucose, and lipid metabolism. The close relationship between diabetes and hypertension has been recognized for decades. New information indicates that resistance to insulin action on glucose uptake in peripheral tissues is a common underlying mechanism in hypertension and diabetes. In prospective trials, the effects of antihypertensive agents on insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein metabolism have been evaluated. Both beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics worsen insulin resistance and deteriorate lipoprotein metabolism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Ca2(+)-channel blockers, and alpha-blockers are neutral or improve these factors. These data may explain the unexpectedly high incidence of the development of diabetes among treated hypertensives and the poor effect on risk for coronary heart disease in intervention trials. 
Diagnostic imaging of osteosarcoma. The diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up evaluation of osteosarcoma rely heavily on a variety of imaging techniques. Plain roentgenography, radionuclide bone scanning, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging play important roles in defining local tumor extent, detecting metastatic disease, and monitoring for recurrent tumor. Invasive studies such as angiography are now rarely necessary. In the future, newer imaging modalities, including positron emission tomography, can be expected to become important tools for evaluation of these tumors. 
Stroke prevention in women: role of aspirin versus ticlopidine. Stroke is the third leading cause of death in North America. Most studies indicate that women are just as likely as men to have an initial stroke but less likely to have a recurrent stroke. Aspirin and ticlopidine are two antiplatelet drugs that reduce the risk of recurrent stroke by 25% to 30%. In some stroke prevention trials, aspirin has been shown to be more effective for men than for women. In contrast, major stroke prevention trials using ticlopidine have demonstrated equal benefit in women and in men. The overall incidence of adverse effects seen with ticlopidine is not significantly different from that observed with aspirin. There are now two effective agents useful in stroke prevention in both men and women. 
Analysis of adhesion molecules in the immunopathogenesis of giant cell arteritis. To explore the role of adhesion molecules in mediating mononuclear cell localisation, development of the granulomatous reaction, and cell mediated damage to the arterial wall in giant cell arteritis, 17 temporal artery biopsy specimens were examined. Eleven showed the histological features of giant cell arteritis and six showed no evidence of arteritis. All were examined for the expression of LFA-3, ICAM-1 and its receptor LFA-1, and HLA-DR. Temporal arteries with early features of arteritis, as well as histologically unaffected skip areas, showed a regional induction of ICAM-1 expression, but not HLA-DR, on smooth muscle cells of the media. ICAM-1 expression was detected in areas where a clinically important mononuclear cell infiltrate had not yet developed. In more florid cases of giant cell arteritis there was an additional widespread induction of ICAM-1 expression on intimal myofibroblasts. Strong expression of ICAM-1, HLA-DR, and LFA-3 was found on macrophages, epithelioid cells, and giant cells comprising the granulomatous lesion. The pattern of expression of these adhesion molecules suggests that they have a role in leucocyte traffic into the vascular lesion as well as in mediating the intercellular interactions which constitute the granulomatous response. 
Pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid treated by the Matti-Russe operation. A long-term review of 77 cases. We report the long-term results of the Matti-Russe operation for pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid in 100 cases, reported previously by Mulder in 1968. Clinical results for 77 patients and radiographic data for 74 were reviewed at 22 to 34.8 years after surgery. In general, there was satisfactory relief of pain and stiffness but some patients had limitation of motion and reduced grip-strength, with usually slight osteoarthritic changes. There was poor correlation between subjective, objective, and radiographic results but 88% of the patients were satisfied with their results. 
Axonal neuropathy with monoclonal IgG kappa that binds to a neurofilament protein. We report a 74-year-old woman with a slowly progressive sensory motor axonal neuropathy and a monoclonal IgG-kappa that bound to a 68-kd axonal protein identified as the low molecular weight neurofilament protein. The sera of control subjects and disease controls did not bind to neurofilament protein. 
Polycystic ovary syndrome and the androgen-insulin connection. The association of hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and polycystic ovarian disease is well established. The accompanying hyperinsulinemia results in acanthosis nigricans, an epiphenomenon of this syndrome. The knowledge that states of insulin resistance of diverse causes are associated with ovarian hyperandrogenism makes the argument for insulin-driven ovarian androgen secretion compelling. However, equally compelling evidence suggests that hyperandrogenism may contribute to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. The irreconcilable differences between these two hypotheses have resulted in an array of contradictory studies. In this article a unified concept of polycystic ovary syndrome and its androgen-insulin connection is proposed. The hypothesis incorporates the role of hyperinsulinemia in the androgen excess observed (and vice versa); the key to this connection is the androgen-dependent change in regional body fat distribution and its metabolic consequence. The pathophysiologic features of polycystic ovary syndrome, which has important clinical sequelae, deserve further consideration. 
Diastolic mechanical properties of the left ventricle after global ischemia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate left ventricular (LV) diastolic mechanical properties after induced global ischemia using reliable new methods. The diastolic function of nonoxygenated crystalloid solution (CC sO2) was compared with those of oxygenated crystalloid (CC cO2) and oxygenated fluorocarbon cardioplegic (FC cO2) solutions. Postischemic ventricular performance was studied in 3 equal (no. 7) groups of dogs subjected to 120 minutes of global ischemia induced at an average myocardial temperature of 18.5 +/- 1.4 degrees C. LV diastolic function (chamber and myocardial stiffness) and relaxation (the exponential fall in LV pressure) were evaluated by sonomicrometry and Millar micrometers before ischemia and at 45 and 60 minutes after ischemia. LV chamber and myocardial stiffness in the CC sO2 group was significantly (p less than 0.05) elevated after ischemia, while the CC cO2 and FC cO2 groups did not show increases in LV chamber and myocardial stiffness after ischemia. LV relaxation before and after ischemia was not changed in any group. The myocardial water content of the CC sO2 group was significantly higher than that of the CC cO2 and FC cO2 groups (p less than 0.05). We conclude that (1) the postischemic increase in LV chamber stiffness in the CC sO2 group was dependent not only on the increase in intrinsic myocardial stiffness but also due to an increase in myocardial edema, and (2) there was no correlation between the LV relaxation rate and the leftward shift of diastolic compliance curves in the CC sO2 group. 
Measurement of sound. The measurement of sound involves the analysis of frequency, intensity, and temporal dimensions of acoustic signals. Each dimension of sound can be related directly to clinically observed phenomena. Frequency information, measured in Hz, can be extracted from pure-tone and complex stimuli. Intensity represents the physical energy of a signal and is described by using the decibel scale--a logarithmic scale of ratios. Temporal characteristics of sound include duration, phase, and repetition rate. In the analysis of human hearing sensitivity, the middle ear system and its impedance characteristics also must be considered. In this article, we have reviewed some major principles of sound and have presented a series of practical clinical applications. Such principles as these help to predict and explain frequency of laryngeal tones, middle ear mechanics, ear canal resonance, real-ear measurements of hearing aids, the Articulation Index, hearing loss, understanding of speech in quiet and in noise, and the relation between hearing and speech. 
Local cerebral glucose utilization in rats with petit mal-like seizures. The quantitative 2-[14C]deoxyglucose autoradiographic method was applied to the measurement of local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in a model of genetic petit mal-like seizures in a strain of Wistar rats. During the experimental period, epileptic rats exhibited synchronous spike-and-wave discharges recorded from the cerebral cortex, whereas the electroencephalographic pattern of control animals was normal. An overall consistent increase in local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose was observed in epileptic rats as compared to nonepileptic control rats. This increase was statistically significant in 52 of the 59 cerebral structures studied and concerned all cerebral functional systems. These results are in accordance with positron emission tomography measurements in humans with typical childhood absence epilepsy. There is a lack of anatomical correlation between areas demonstrating hypermetabolism and areas where spike-and-wave discharges are recorded. Thus, the diffuse increase in cerebral energy metabolism in epileptic rats as compared to controls is not directly related to the occurrence of spike and wave discharges. 
Clinical predictors for buserelin acetate treatment of uterine fibroids: a prospective study of 40 women. Buserelin acetate, a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist, is known to be effective in the shrinkage of uterine fibroids. A prospective trial was undertaken (1) to compare the efficacy of intranasal (IN) and subcutaneous (SC) administration of buserelin acetate and (2) to assess if tumor regression correlated with fibroid size and/or patient age. Forty patients were randomly allocated to receive 6 months of either IN buserelin acetate (n = 21) or SC buserelin acetate (n = 19). Four patients did not complete the study and were excluded from statistical analysis. Fibroid regression occurred in all 36 patients. Overall regression to 66% or less of the initial fibroid volume occurred in 70% of subjects. There was no significant difference in fibroid shrinkage between the two administration routes. A significant positive correlation was found between initial fibroid size and subsequent fibroid regression, with larger tumors being more likely to shrink than smaller fibroids. No correlation was found between the patient's age and the extent of fibroid regression. 
Body image dissatisfaction in homosexual and heterosexual males. A nonclinical sample of 43 homosexual and 32 heterosexual men completed two self-report inventories regarding weight, body satisfaction, eating attitudes, and behaviors. Subjects were also asked to select their current and ideal figures, the weight they felt would be most attractive to a potential partner, and the weight to which they would be most attracted in a potential partner from figures representing very thin to very heavy physiques. Heterosexual men were significantly heavier than homosexual men and desired a significantly heavier ideal weight. Although the current and ideal physiques selected by the homosexual and heterosexual men were almost identical, homosexual men were more likely to desire an underweight ideal. A heightened pursuit of thinness may place homosexual men at an increased risk for developing eating disorders. 
Acute illness in maple syrup urine disease: dynamics of protein metabolism and implications for management. Acute metabolic decompensation in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) during otherwise minor illnesses has generally been presumed to result from massive release of leucine from protein catabolism. A stable isotope method based on the continuous infusion of (2H5)phenylalanine was used to measure protein metabolism in vivo in two children with MSUD during acute illness and when well. Net protein catabolism was greater in the unwell state (0.51 and 0.40 gm/kg per 24 hours in each child, respectively) than in the basal state (0.34 and 0.32). This rate of release of leucine from protein is compatible only with a slow (several days) rather than a dramatic rise in plasma leucine levels during acute illness in MSUD. Poor oral intake leading to a relative increase in time spent in the fasting state appears to be a more important determinant of increasing leucine levels than the catabolic effect of infection in itself. These factors suggested that branched-chain amino acid restriction should be commenced at the start of minor illness in children with MSUD, and that intake of other nutrients should be maintained or increased throughout the illness. A regimen based on these concepts was used during nine episodes of minor illness in two children with MSUD. Plasma branched-chain amino acid levels remained acceptable (less than 700 mumol/L) throughout each of these episodes. Dietary supplementation of this type may reduce the risk of metabolic decompensation during acute illnesses in children with MSUD. 
Blood transfusion and recurrent Crohn's disease. The effect of blood transfusion on the postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease has been investigated. Clinical and pathological data from 197 patients treated by right hemicolectomy between 1947 and 1988 have been analysed. Symptomatic recurrences confirmed radiologically or histologically have been recorded and cumulative recurrence rates calculated for transfused and non-transfused patients. Perioperative blood transfusion does not influence the development of recurrent disease (log rank test, chi 2 = 0.112). 
Acute promyelocytic leukemia in Crohn's disease. Case report and review of the literature. A 19-year-old man with a documented 2-year history of Crohn's disease abruptly developed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. A diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia was established by bone marrow cytology. Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow aspirate revealed aberrations of no. 8 trisomy and translocation between no. 15 and no. 17 [46,XY,t(15q+,17q-)/47,XY,+8,t(15q+,17q-)]. Nine cases of Crohn's disease complicated by leukemia have been reported, including the present one; once again, a relationship between Crohn's disease and leukemia is suggested. 
Radial artery hypoplasia: a further association with the VATER syndrome? A case of radial artery hypoplasia in a girl with the VATER syndrome is reported. This finding should alert surgeons dealing with vascular access for dialysis and suggests the possibility of intrauterine ischemia in the etiology of upper limb anomalies in these patients. 
A histopathological study of 643 cutaneous horns. A retrospective study of 643 cutaneous horns examined in our department between 1970 and 1989 revealed that 38.9% were derived from malignant or premalignant epidermal lesions, and 61.1% from benign lesions. Four main features were associated with premalignant or malignant histopathological change at the base of a cutaneous horn (base pathology). These were: (i) age--the mean age of the patients whose cutaneous horns showed premalignant or malignant base pathology was 8.9 years greater than the mean age of the patients where base pathology was benign (P less than 0.0005); (ii) sex--males were more likely to develop a cutaneous horn with (pre)malignant base pathology (P less than 0.001); (iii) site--over 70% of all (pre)malignant lesions were found on the nose, pinnae, backs of hands, scalp, forearms and the face; a cutaneous horn found at these sites was 2.1 times more likely to have derived from a (pre)malignant base than from any other part of the body (P less than 0.0001); (iv) geometry of the lesion--lesions with a wide base or a low height-to-base ratio were significantly more likely to show (pre)malignant base pathology. Of those solar keratoses giving rise to cutaneous horns, 8.9% also showed histological evidence of change to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); this figure was not significantly different from the 6.2% of solar keratoses without horns that showed SCC change during the same period (1970-89). 
Outcome after emergency surgery for cancer of the large intestine. The data for 77 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent emergency surgery for acute intestinal obstruction (57 patients) or perforation (20 patients) within 24 h of admission were evaluated. The patients were older and had more advanced disease than patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer. Emergency surgery for carcinoma of the right colon consisted of primary resection in 95 per cent of cases and was followed by a 28 per cent mortality rate. Perforated tumours of the left colon and rectum were managed by primary resection in 82 per cent of cases with a 22 per cent mortality rate. In contrast, obstructing tumours of the left colon and rectum were treated by primary resection in 38 per cent of cases with a 6 per cent mortality rate, and by primary decompression in 62 per cent of cases with a 25 per cent mortality rate. The overall postoperative mortality rate was 23 per cent and increased with advanced tumour disease, perforation and peritonitis. Cardiac decompensation and intraabdominal sepsis were the major causes of death. Although the long-term survival rate following emergency surgery was worse than after elective surgery, improvements in outcome should be achieved by better management of the initial emergency situation. 
Flow cytometric studies of human osteosarcoma. A number of recent studies have emphasized the potential value of flow cytometry as a "marker" to assess the malignity and therefore to help predict the biologic behavior of neoplasms, including bone tumors. Using propidium iodide and a home-built flow cytometer, the authors have studied the DNA distribution in 95 patients with osteosarcoma and determined the percentage of cells in diploidy, S-phase, tetraploidy, and aneuploidy. Using these values and a derived one, mean DNA concentration, it was possible to demonstrate the extent of the abnormalities observed in this group of neoplasms and show their severity as compared with the normal pattern. When the data are compared against disease-free survival and total survival, correlations were noted that, although weak, suggested that some patterns were predictive of increased risk of metastasis and death. The effect of treatment could also be assessed by evaluating the pattern before and after chemotherapy and correlating these with survival. It seems likely that with some improvement in technology, flow cytometry will be of value in the future in assessing the prognosis for osteosarcoma and predicting whether treatment has been effective. 
Endoscopic findings in carcinoid tumor of the duodenum. The endoscopic findings in six patients with carcinoid tumor of the duodenum were analyzed. Radiographic and endoscopic examinations revealed a smooth and round elevation (measuring 5-20 mm in diameter) in the duodenal bulb. In three patients, the lesion was accompanied by an irregularly shaped erythematous depression, a characteristic endoscopic finding of this tumor. Because the endoscopic forceps biopsy technique led to an accurate diagnosis, we wish to stress the clinical value of the endoscopic modalities. 
Heterotopic ossification and peripheral nerve entrapment: early diagnosis and excision. Heterotopic ossification can occur in neurologic disorders, burns, musculoskeletal trauma, and metabolic disorders. In addition to producing the complications of contracture, skin breakdown, and pain, it can cause peripheral nerve entrapment. Nerve entrapment due to heterotopic ossification may be misdiagnosed, and it is difficult to evaluate and treat without recurrence. Computed tomography is especially useful in localization before surgical release of the entrapped nerve. Resection of heterotopic ossification can be successful using disodium etidronate to decrease the risk of recurrence, and resection can improve range of motion and nerve function. Two case studies of nerve entrapment due to heterotopic ossification are presented with the results of computed tomography localization, successful resection, and long-term follow-up. Clinicians should be aware of this complication and the potential for rapid nerve injury. If heterotopic ossification is causing clinically significant peripheral nerve entrapment, early surgical treatment may be indicated, and may be successful. 
The role of exercise in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Over the past 30 years, mortality rates from coronary artery disease (CAD) have decreased by more than 30% in the United States. However, CAD remains the major public health problem in this country. There is now substantial evidence linking exercise training to a reduced risk for CAD and for mortality after myocardial infarction. The actual mechanism by which physical activity aids in reducing the risk for developing or dying from CAD has still to be elucidated. Several highly plausible mechanisms have been postulated, including decreased myocardial oxygen demand, increased myocardial oxygen supply, reduced propensity toward ventricular arrhythmias, reduced platelet aggregation, increased plasma fibrinolytic activity, and modification of multiple CAD risk factors. Irrespective of the precise mechanism, it now appears that lower levels of physical activity are needed to reduce the risk for CAD than are needed to optimize cardiorespiratory fitness. In this regard, we recommend that the type, frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise training be modulated to achieve a weekly energy expenditure of between 14 and 20 kilocalories per kilogram of body weight. Although aerobic activities should be emphasized, muscle strengthening and flexibility exercises should also be incorporated into the training program in order to promote musculoskeletal health. 
Impact of resident training on postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing single valve replacement. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study on Valvular Heart Disease. As one of the requirements of the Department of Veterans Affairs cooperative study on valvular heart disease, operative and postoperative data were prospectively collected in 964 patients undergoing single valve replacement. The procedure was performed either by a resident under the direct supervision of an attending surgeon (49.5%) or by an attending surgeon (50.5%). There was no difference in operative mortality between the two groups of surgeons when adjusted for patient-related and disease-related risk factors. The proportion of patients who had at least one postoperative complication was slightly but not significantly higher in the attending group (35.8% versus 30.4% for aortic valve replacement, 38% versus 28% for mitral valve replacement, and 36% versus 30% for all single valve replacement procedures). As the significance of each complication varies, we weighted each complication to the associated operative mortality to formulate the morbidity score. An expected complication rate for each group was derived from a multivariate logistic model, and the ratio of observed to expected morbidity was calculated to adjust observed morbidity according to the risk of patients. There was no difference in the observed/expected morbidity ratio between the two groups of surgeons. We conclude that currently used teaching techniques and philosophy to educate cardiac surgical residents, which allow them to take progressive responsibility for cardiac surgical procedures, are well justified, and patient care does not suffer when resident training is enhanced. 
Nosocomial pneumonia and the role of gastric pH. A meta-analysis. PURPOSE: To examine the differential effect of drugs used for stress ulcer prophylaxis on nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill patients. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Computerized bibliographic search of published and unpublished research. STUDY SELECTION: Independent review of 48 randomized controlled trials of prophylaxis identified eight relevant studies. DATA ABSTRACTION: The population, intervention, and outcomes were evaluated by duplicate independent review. RESULTS: The incidence of pneumonia was lower in critically ill patients receiving antacids and/or histamine-2-receptor antagonists as compared with patients receiving no stress ulcer prophylaxis (common odds ratio 0.42, 95 percent CI 0.17 to 1.11). When stress ulcer prophylactic therapy was titrated to achieve a gastric pH of 3.5 or greater, there was a trend favoring a decreased incidence of pneumonia (0.66, 95 percent CI 0.24 to 1.78). In trials comparing sucralfate with pH-altering drugs, the common odds ratio of 0.55 (0.28 to 1.06) suggests a 45 percent risk reduction with the use of sucralfate. CONCLUSION: Stress ulcer prophylaxis with drugs which raise gastric pH does not increase the incidence of pneumonia in comparison to placebo or control therapy. The use of sucralfate is associated with a lower incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in comparison to agents which raise gastric pH. However, methodologic deficiencies, small sample sizes, and the failure to examine the effects of antacids and histamine-2-receptor antagonists separately make a large prospective randomized trial necessary to confirm or refute these findings. 
Bilateral renal hemangiopericytoma. The first reported case of bilateral renal hemangiopericytoma is presented. The 19 previous renal hemangiopericytomas that have been reported in the world literature are reviewed. This lesion has afflicted patients ranging in age from sixteen to sixty-eight years (mean 41 years) with an equal sex distribution. Mortality from hemangiopericytoma of the kidney has been 50 percent, and the primary mode of therapy remains surgical. 
Excess mortality in giant cell arteritis. A 13-year departmental sample of 34 patients with definite (biopsy-verified) giant cell arteritis (GCA) was reviewed. The mortality of this material was compared to sex-, age- and time-specific death rates in the Danish population. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 1.8 (95% confidence limits, 1.1-2.8). During the same period 146 patients with probable (not biopsied, but clinically diagnosed in the department) GCA and 85 cases of possible (diagnosed and treated before admission) GCA had been admitted to the department. Those two groups did not differ from the biopsy-verified group with respect to SMR, sex distribution or age. In the group of patients with department-diagnosed GCA (definite + probable = 180 patients), the 95% confidence interval for the SMR of the women included 1.0. In all other subgroups there was a significant excess mortality. Excess mortality has been found in two of seven previous studies on survival in GCA. The prevailing opinion that steroid-treated GCA does not affect the life expectancy of patients is probably not correct. 
Misdiagnosed papillary renal adenocarcinoma. We present 3 patients with papillary renal adenocarcinoma who were initially misdiagnosed owing to unusual clinical presentation. We suggest that if these presentations are borne in mind, pre-operative detection of this uncommon condition should be possible more often than is now the case. 
Dietary Ca2+ prevents NaCl-sensitive hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats via sympatholytic and renal effects. NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) were used to test the hypotheses that dietary Ca2+ supplementation 1) prevents NaCl-sensitive hypertension via a sympatholytic mechanism, and 2) increases diuretic and natriuretic responses to acute volume loading. SHR-S and control WKY rats were begun on one of four diets at age 8 wk: control, high NaCl, high Ca2+, or high NaCl and high Ca2+. In SHR-S, dietary Ca2+ supplementation prevented the NaCl-induced increases in blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine concentrations, the reductions in anterior hypothalamic norepinephrine stores and turnover, and the secondary increases in alpha 2 adrenoceptor number. Thus, Ca2+ prevented NaCl-sensitive hypertension in SHR-S by increasing noradrenergic input to the anterior hypothalamus. High-NaCl-fed SHR-S had impaired diuretic and natriuretic responses to an isotonic volume load; Ca2+ enhanced the ability of these animals to adjust fluid volume rapidly via diuresis and natriuresis. This alteration in renal function may contribute to the hypotensive effect of a high Ca2+ diet in NaCl-sensitive hypertension. 
Quinapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, prevents cardiac hypertrophy during episodic hypertension. Six control dogs, six dogs treated with 1.5 mg/kg b.i.d. quinapril, and six dogs treated with 8 mg/kg q.d. minoxidil underwent 6 hours daily of hindquarter compression for 9 weeks. Minoxidil significantly decreased baseline blood pressure (-17 mm Hg; p less than or equal to 0.01), whereas quinapril decreased baseline blood pressure 11 mm Hg but not significantly (p = 0.15). Hindquarter compression elicited blood pressure increases in all three groups (control +18, quinapril +13, minoxidil +19 mm Hg). After 9 weeks, left ventricular mass in control dogs increased 22% (p less than 0.004); a similar increase was seen in minoxidil-treated dogs (+22%, p less than 0.0001) but not in the quinapril-treated group (+4%, p less than 0.15). The increase in left ventricular mass in control dogs was concentric (increased epicardial volume only), whereas in the minoxidil group, the hypertrophy was eccentric (both epicardial and endocardial volumes increased). The minimal hypertrophy in the quinapril group was concentric (no change in epicardial, but a decrease in endocardial volume). Quinapril had little hypotensive effect, but prevented the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas minoxidil did not prevent hypertrophy in spite of its hypotensive effect. The mechanism of this differential effect of direct vasodilation versus converting enzyme inhibition on left ventricular hypertrophy is not fully elucidated. The results with quinapril suggest that some antihypertensive agents may positively affect left ventricular hypertrophy in spite of the absence of a large effect on baseline blood pressure or on blood pressure reactivity. 
Relationship of HBsAg subtypes with HBeAg/anti-HBe status and chronic liver disease. Part I: Analysis of 1744 HBsAg carriers. A total of 1744 HBsAg carriers were investigated to determine whether there are clinical differences among HBsAg subtypes or not. Although adr was more predominant than adw in 1078 asymptomatic carriers as well as in 666 carriers with liver dysfunction, the adr carriers had liver dysfunction more frequently than the adw carriers (p = 0.005). In addition, the adr carriers were more often positive for HBeAg and less often positive for anti-HBe than the adw carriers (p less than 0.001). Multivariate analyses indicated that the HBsAg subtypes were associated with liver dysfunction not directly but through the relationship between the HBsAg subtypes and HBeAg/anti-HBe status. HBeAg/anti-HBe status of each age bracket in the adr carriers and in the adw carriers suggested that adr carriers are seroconverted later than adw carriers. In conclusion, HBsAg subtypes may affect the development of chronic liver disease, through their association with HBeAg/anti-HBe status. 
Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) produced by A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells and identification of VEGF membrane binding sites. A distinct family of endothelial cell mitogens that are homologous to platelet-derived growth factor has recently been identified. Unlike other known endothelial cell mitogens, these vascular endothelial cell growth factors (VEGFs) are secreted and appear to act specifically on endothelial cells. We have purified VEGF 2083-fold to apparent homogeneity from protein-free culture medium conditioned by A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. This A-431-derived VEGF was characterized as a homodimer composed of 22-kDa subunits with an N-terminal sequence that was similar to VEGFs produced by human HL-60 leukemic and U-937 histiocytic lymphoma cells. A-431 VEGF was used to identify specific and saturable binding sites for VEGF on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). By affinity cross-linking, VEGF-binding site complexes of 230, 170, and 125 kDa were detected on HUVEC. VEGF specifically induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 190-kDa polypeptide, which was similar in mass to the largest binding site detected by affinity cross-linking. 
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the treatment of neonatal respiratory failure. We report 18 consecutive neonates with severe respiratory failure due to pulmonary hypertension treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was begun at 52 +/- 36 hours of age with an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 36 +/- 14 mm Hg despite maximal pharmacologic and ventilator support (inspired fraction of oxygen [FiO2], 0.99 +/- 0.03; respiratory rate, 98 +/- 31/min; and positive inspiratory pressure, 54 +/- 11 cm of water). With initial flows of 130 +/- 17 mL/kg per minute, ventilator settings were reduced to the following: FiO2, 0.30; respiratory rates, 15/min; and positive inspiratory pressure, 24 cm of water. Support using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was gradually reduced to 22% of initial flows and arterial blood samples showed pH 7.48 +/- .05, PO2 of 106 +/- 27 mm Hg, and PCO2 of 36 +/- 5 mm Hg just prior to decannulation. After 107 +/- 45 hours, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was stopped and infants were extubated 61 +/- 53 hours (median, 46 hours) afterward. There was one death (94.4% survival rate); all survivors were discharged and underwent a follow-up examination at 1 to 27 months of age. Complications included two intracranial hemorrhages (one death and one asymptomatic), one patent ductus arteriosus requiring ligation on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and chronic lung disease in one patient. In selected neonates, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation allows for resolution of pulmonary hypertension, results in improved survival, and is associated with a low incidence of chronic lung disease. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be considered in the treatment of severe respiratory failure. 
Transesophageal echocardiography in renal cell carcinoma: an accurate diagnostic technique for intracaval neoplastic extension. Between 4 and 10% of patients with renal cell carcinoma have tumor involving the inferior vena cava and many of these patients have suprahepatic extension. In patients with intracaval neoplastic extension precise definition of the superior aspect of the tumor thrombus is critical. Transabdominal ultrasonography, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and inferior venacavography are all currently used to evaluate the inferior vena cava in these patients. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was used to image the inferior vena cava in 5 patients with renal cell carcinoma and intracaval neoplastic extension. In each patient transesophageal echocardiography correctly revealed the superior extent of tumor thrombus. In 3 patients tumor thrombus was found at a higher level by transesophageal echocardiography than by CT, MRI and inferior venacavography. In all patients tumor imaging by transesophageal echocardiography correlated well with the gross appearance and extent of tumor found at operation. Echocardiography also documented the absence of residual gross tumor after resection. Transesophageal echocardiography was also useful to assess left ventricular function. Although each of these patients had a pulmonary artery catheter as well transesophageal echocardiography can be useful in situations when right atrial tumor thrombus prevents right heart catheterization. This small series demonstrates that intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography can accurately evaluate the extent of tumor thrombus and provides a means to assess myocardial function complementary to the pulmonary artery catheter. 
Curative treatment of scalp arteriovenous fistulas by direct puncture and embolization with absolute alcohol. Report of three cases. Three cases of direct arteriovenous fistulas of the scalp (two involving cirsoid aneurysms) are presented. All three patients were treated with direct puncture of the venous pouch and injection of absolute ethyl alcohol during compression of the venous outflow of the fistula. Two of the three patients were cured with this treatment alone. The third patient, with a very high-flow giant fistula, required injection of glue to close the fistula and subsequent surgical extirpation of the resulting hard mass lesion. 
Parotid enlargement in children seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus: imaging findings. We investigated the clinical, immunologic, and imaging features of parotid enlargement in 10 children seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who were infected prenatally. In seven patients, sonography revealed many small hypoechoic areas suggestive of lymphoid infiltration. In three older children, large anechoic areas suggesting lymphoepithelial cysts were present. The lesions probably represent generalized lymphoid infiltration akin to pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia, although only two of our patients had radiologic evidence of pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia. Four of five of the children with parotid enlargement who had immunologic studies were phenotypically HLA-DR5, an immunophenotype associated with improved immune response, occurring in less than one in four in the normal population. This suggests that painless parotid enlargement may be a good prognostic sign in HIV-seropositive children. Parotid enlargement was found in 10 HIV-positive children from 6 months to 11 years old. All except one were infected prenatally. 
Kock pouch procedures: continuing experience and evolution in 135 cases. Between April 1985 and January 1989, 135 consecutive patients underwent construction of a Kock pouch (to the skin in 72 patients, a urethral pouch in 45, an ileorectal pouch in 10 and a hemi-Kock pouch augmentation cystoplasty in 8). The operative mortality (30 days) rate was 4.4%. There were 16 early complications (12.4%) leading to 14 reoperations (11%), with a followup of 6 to 60 months. After Kock pouch to the skin, the late complication rate was 26.1% in the Kock-Skinner technique group and 7.4% in the simplified technique group, and 94.2% of the patients were continent. After a urethral Kock pouch daytime continence was achieved in 93% of the patients within 2 months and nighttime dryness was noted in 65% within 3 months. After an ileorectal Kock pouch all patients were continent day and night, as were those after hemi-Kock pouch augmentation, although 5 of the latter patients required intermittent catheterization. 
Infection of human neural cell aggregate cultures with a clinical isolate of cytomegalovirus. Human neural cell aggregate cultures were prepared from dissociated fetal brain tissue and maintained in rotation culture. After 35 days in culture, aggregates had the histologic appearance of dense, immature, neural cells in a tightly packed neuropil. Electron microscopy revealed ultrastructural features suggestive of immature neurons and neuroglia. In addition, neuron-specific enolase and glial fibrillary acidic protein associated with radial glial cells were detected within the aggregates by immunoperoxidase staining. When infected with a laboratory-adapted strain of cytomegalovirus (CMV), [AD169], cells containing large, bizarre, nuclei and CMV-induced intranuclear inclusion bodies were dispersed throughout the aggregates at 16 days postinfection. In situ hybridization using a CMV-specific DNA probe and electron microscopy confirmed the presence of virus sequences as well as virus particles at histologic sites of cytopathology. In sharp contrast, aggregate cultures infected with a CMV strain recovered from the retina of an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient with CMV retinitis and encephalitis displayed distinct foci of cytopathology at 23 days postinfection, a pattern not observed in CMV [AD169]-infected aggregates. Our findings suggest that human neural cell aggregates represent a a promising multicellular non-neoplastic culture system in which to study the replication of human neurotropic viruses within neural tissue. 
Effects of variable dose milrinone in patients with low cardiac output after cardiac surgery. European Multicenter Trial Group. We studied 99 adult patients after elective cardiac surgery who had low cardiac output (cardiac index less than 2.5 L/min/m2) in spite of adequate cardiac filling pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure less than 8 mm Hg). Patients received milrinone by loading dose (50 micrograms/kg over a 10-minute period), followed by a continuous infusion of either 0.375, 0.5, or 0.75 micrograms/kg/min (low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) given for a minimum of 12 hours. Patients were allocated to each dosage group sequentially, not randomly. Hemodynamic measurements were made before the loading dose and at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, 3, 6, and 12 hours after the start of milrinone therapy. Further measurements were made at 2 and 4 hours after treatment was stopped. Milrinone therapy was associated with a rapid, well-sustained, and highly significant increase in cardiac index in all three dose groups (p less than 0.001), and a similar fall occurred in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in all groups (p less than 0.001). Significant increases occurred in heart rate in all three groups (p less than 0.001). Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance also fell significantly, although changes in this latter parameter were less predictable and more dose dependent. Few serious treatment-related adverse effects were seen. We conclude that intravenous milrinone is an effective and safe therapy for the treatment of low output states after cardiac surgery. 
Efficacy of fixed minidose warfarin prophylaxis in total hip replacement. OBJECTIVE--To determine whether a small fixed perioperative dose of warfarin would prevent deep vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. DESIGN--Prospective, randomised, double blind placebo controlled trial. SETTING--Winford Orthopaedic Hospital, Bristol. SUBJECTS--148 patients having primary total hip replacement. INTERVENTION--Warfarin 1 mg given daily for one week before and three weeks after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Deep vein thrombosis diagnosed by the iodine-125 labelled fibrinogen uptake method. RESULTS--Deep vein thrombosis occurred in 25 (34%) of the patients given warfarin and 19 (26%) of the controls (difference 8%; 95% confidence interval -6.8% to 22.8%). CONCLUSION--Fixed minidose warfarin does not prevent deep vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. 
Surgical versus medical treatment for epilepsy. I. Outcome related to survival, seizures, and neurologic deficit. We conducted a retrospective parallel longitudinal cohort study comparing surgical and medical treatment for epilepsy. The surgical group contained 201 patients treated with resective surgery for epilepsy in Norway since the first operation in 1949 until January 1988. The 185 control group patients treated medically only were closely matched for year of treatment, age at treatment, sex, seizure type, and neurologic deficit before treatment. There was no significant difference in survival between the two groups. The total monthly seizure frequency in the first and second year after operation and last year of registration (median 9 years) was significantly lower in the surgical group than in the control group (Mann-Whitney U test, two-tailed p less than 0.0001). The patterns were similar, with significant differences for subgroups with similar pretreatment status, such as seizure frequency, age, etiology and EEG-focality. Twenty-three and four-tenths percent (n = 40) of the surgically treated, and 2.9% of the controls had contracted neurologic deficits within 2 years after treatment. The difference was significant (chi square = 32.89, p less than 0.0001). Psychosis or permanent psychotic symptoms were reported in 6.7% (n = 11) of the surgically treated patients, and we suspect a higher proportion of psychotic development in the surgical group than in the control group. We conclude that surgical treatment for partial epilepsy is more successful than medical treatment in producing seizure reduction, provided the indications for operation exist. Surgical treatment produces more neurologic deficits than medical treatment (and possibly more psychiatric morbidity), and this factor must be weighed against the reduction in seizure frequency. The two treatments are equal for longterm survival. 
p53 mutations in human cancers. Mutations in the evolutionarily conserved codons of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are common in diverse types of human cancer. The p53 mutational spectrum differs among cancers of the colon, lung, esophagus, breast, liver, brain, reticuloendothelial tissues, and hemopoietic tissues. Analysis of these mutations can provide clues to the etiology of these diverse tumors and to the function of specific regions of p53. Transitions predominate in colon, brain, and lymphoid malignancies, whereas G:C to T:A transversions are the most frequent substitutions observed in cancers of the lung and liver. Mutations at A:T base pairs are seen more frequently in esophageal carcinomas than in other solid tumors. Most transitions in colorectal carcinomas, brain tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas are at CpG dinucleotide mutational hot spots. G to T transversions in lung, breast, and esophageal carcinomas are dispersed among numerous codons. In liver tumors in persons from geographic areas in which both aflatoxin B1 and hepatitis B virus are cancer risk factors, most mutations are at one nucleotide pair of codon 249. These differences may reflect the etiological contributions of both exogenous and endogenous factors to human carcinogenesis. 
In vitro cholesterol gallstone dissolution: comparison of methyl tert-butyl ether with three new ester solvents. The in vitro effectiveness of three new cholesterol gallstone solvents that have a potential for clinical use--ethyl propionate, isopropyl acetate, and n-propyl acetate--was compared with that of the well-known cholesterol solvent methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Ten sets of matched gallstones were initially weighed, imaged with radiography and computed tomography (CT), and analyzed for content. One stone from each set was incubated in one of the four solvents at 37 degrees C. Solvents were changed at 30-minute intervals. The study was stopped either when the stones were completely dissolved or at the end of 7 hours. Any residual fragments were weighed, reimaged, and reanalyzed for content. There were no statistical differences between dissolution times of the stones in MTBE compared with those in the three new solvents. Ethyl propionate and n-propyl acetate appear to be as efficacious as MTBE in dissolving cholesterol stones and could be attractive alternatives for gallstone chemolysis. 
The economic implications of high-risk abdominal aortic aneurysms. Financial data of 102 patients undergoing elective and emergent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair over a 3-year period were evaluated in terms of postoperative length of stay, net revenue, total standard cost, and net margin. Cost reimbursement was based on diagnosis related group payments. Aneurysm repairs were classified as emergent, high-risk elective, or low-risk elective. A net loss of $409,459 was noted for the entire series. Emergent repairs, although only 12% of the population, accounted for 73% of total losses, with a mean loss of $24,655/patient. The mean net loss in the high-risk elective group was $3590/patient, and a net gain of $1132/patient was noted in the low-risk elective group. Length of stay outliers, defined as length of stay greater than 28 days, contributed to the bulk of the losses in the elective series and were predominant in the high-risk group. No preoperative comorbidity, other than high-risk classification, predicted outlier status. Length of stay correlated with total standard costs in all categories of aneurysm repair. Third party payment for length of stay outliers was inadequate; the diagnosis related group system warrants revision so that outlier reimbursement will be based on a tiered system derived from length of stay. 
Hypertension profiling by total body water (TBW) determinations in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Hypertension is an important risk factor in hemodialysis patients. Fluid overload and increased peripheral resistance are considered the two main causes. We studied the relation between volume state and blood pressure in 18 hemodialysis patients. Actual total body water (aTBW) was measured as tritium space and "ideal" total body water (iTBW) by an anthropometric method. The difference between aTBW and iTBW was considered a measure of fluid excess or deficit. Twelve patients were overhydrated, 5%-23%. Their predialysis blood pressure was significantly correlated to their degree of fluid excess; systolic BP:r = 0.71, p = 0.03, diastolic BP:r = 0.73, p = 0.02, mean arterial BP:r = 0.76, p = 0.03. Five of these patients had multiple antihypertensive drugs instead of adequate ultrafiltration. Five patients had a fluid deficit of -3 to -13% and hypertension due to vasoconstriction. Four of these were adequately treated with antihypertensive drugs but had exaggerated ultrafiltration. TBW determination with tritium is simple to perform and gives information on the volume state and thereby on the cause of hypertension in hemodialysis patients. Based on this, appropriate treatment can be chosen. 
Coronary hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism in patients with syndrome X: response to pacing stress Coronary hemodynamics, myocardial metabolism and left ventricular function at rest and after incremental atrial pacing were evaluated in 12 patients with stress-induced angina and ST segment depression, angiographically normal coronary arteries and no evidence of spasm, generally labeled as syndrome X, and in 10 normal subjects. At baseline study, great cardiac vein flow was comparable in patients and control subjects. During pacing, an equivalent rate-pressure product was reached in the two groups, but the slope of the relation between rate-pressure product and great cardiac vein flow was significantly less steep in patients than in normal subjects (0.0027 vs. 0.0054 ml/mm Hg.beat, p less than 0.001). Nevertheless, the left ventricular ejection fraction was comparable in both groups at rest (66 +/- 6% vs. 71 +/- 7%, p = NS) and during pacing (71 +/- 7% vs. 66 +/- 5%, p = NS). At baseline study, myocardial glucose extraction was more efficient in patients with syndrome X (p less than 0.05), but net myocardial exchange of pyruvate and alanine was, respectively, smaller and greater than in control subjects. Lactate was extracted to a similar extent in the two groups and in no instance was net lactate release observed during pacing or recovery. During pacing and recovery, patients with syndrome X showed net pyruvate release, unlike the control subjects in whom net pyruvate exchange was positive. In addition, patients with syndrome X continued to show net myocardial extraction of alanine during spacing and recovery, whereas normal subjects produced alanine throughout the study. Myocardial carbohydrate oxidation increased significantly during maximal pacing in normal subjects but not in patients, in whom it always remained below (p less than 0.01) the concurrent rate of myocardial uptake of carbohydrate equivalents (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, alanine). Myocardial energy expenditure was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects at maximal rate-pressure product levels (p less than 0.01). The metabolic pattern in patients with syndrome X therefore is not consistent with classic ischemia, although differences in the net exchange of circulating substrates (glucose, pyruvate, alanine) can be demonstrated. Thus, in patients with syndrome X, the symptoms, electrocardiographic signs and impairment in the increase in great cardiac vein flow during pacing coexist with preserved global and regional left ventricular function and myocardial energy efficiency. 
Teicoplanin pharmacokinetics in intravenous drug abusers being treated for bacterial endocarditis. The pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin were determined after multiple 30-min intravenous infusions of 10 to 15 mg/kg every 12 to 24 h in 11 intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) patients being treated for bacterial endocarditis. Multiple serum samples were obtained over 7 to 14 days. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were obtained on days 1 and 5. Serum concentration-time data were analyzed by using multiple-dose pharmacokinetic analysis (NONLIN84). Results were compared with pharmacokinetic parameters derived from previous studies in normal healthy volunteers following multiple intravenous infusions of teicoplanin (3 to 6 mg/kg/day). Total and renal clearances of teicoplanin in IVDA patients were found to be significantly greater and more highly variable than those observed previously in normal healthy volunteers. As a result, predicted steady-state trough concentrations in serum may vary up to fivefold. The mechanism responsible for this variation appears to be related to the glomerular filtration rate. In IVDA patients, individualized teicoplanin dosage may be required in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. 
Nutritional model of hepatocarcinogenesis. Rats fed choline-devoid diet. Rats fed a choline-devoid diet as the sole treatment develop hepatocellular carcinomas, the pathogenesis of which appears to reside exclusively in effects of the diet on the liver. Among the latter, most prominent is the induction of repeating cycles of liver cell injury, death, and regeneration. Two other models have been described recently in the literature, in which development of hepatic neoplastic lesions occurs after protracted periods of liver cell injury, death, and regeneration, without exposure of the animals to chemical carcinogens. The possibility is considered that an abnormal increase in cell turnover may result in all of the genomic alterations that are required for initiation, promotion, and neoplastic transformation of liver cells in these models of hepatocarcinogenesis. The possible involvement, in the same models, of endogenously initiated liver cells also is discussed briefly. 
Clinical, laboratory, roentgenographic, and electrocardiographic findings in patients with acute pulmonary embolism and no pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. The history, physical examination, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram and blood gases were evaluated in patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and no history or evidence of pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. The investigation focused upon patients with no previous cardiac or pulmonary disease in order to evaluate the clinical characteristics that were due only to PE. Acute PE was present in 117 patients and PE was excluded in 248 patients. Among the patients with PE, dyspnea or tachypnea (greater than or equal to 20/min) was present in 105 of 117 (90 percent). Dyspnea, hemoptysis, or pleuritic pain was present in 107 of 117 (91 percent). The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood on room air was less than 80 mm Hg in 65 of 88 (74 percent). The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was greater than 20 mm Hg in 76 of 88 (86 percent). The chest radiograph was abnormal in 98 of 117 (84 percent). Atelectasis and/or pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities were most common, 79 of 117 (68 percent). Nonspecific ST segment or T wave change was the most common electrocardiographic abnormality, in 44 of 89 (49 percent). Dyspnea, tachypnea, or signs of deep venous thrombosis was present in 107 of 117 (91 percent). Dyspnea or tachypnea or pleuritic pain was present in 113 of 117 (97 percent). Dyspnea or tachypnea or pleuritic pain was present in 113 of 117 (97 percent). Dyspnea or tachypnea or pleuritic pain or atelectasis or a parenchymal abnormality on the chest radiograph was present in 115 of 117 (98 percent). In conclusion, among the patients with pulmonary embolism that were identified, only a small percentage did not have these important manifestations or combinations of manifestations. Clinical evaluation, though nonspecific, is of considerable value in the selection of patients in whom there is a need for further diagnostic studies. 
The limited potential of special ambulance services in the management of cardiac arrest For six months a survey was made of all the patients in the Nottingham District Health Authority who died or who were brought to hospital after a cardiac arrest outside hospital. During this period just under half of the emergency ambulance shifts were covered by specially trained crews with defibrillators. During the study period the ICD coding of death certificates indicated that 894 (25%) of the 3575 deaths were due to ischaemic heart disease. During this period the ambulance service received 17,749 emergency calls, which included 445 patients who had cardiac arrests outside hospital. One hundred and forty seven of these patients were carried by ambulances equipped with defibrillators and resuscitation was attempted in 83. Seven patients survived to leave hospital. The special ambulance service was cost effective--a simple calculation suggests that the cost per life saved was approximately 2600 pounds, but it seems unlikely that special ambulance services will materially affect community fatality rates from ischaemic heart disease. 
The influence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection on the development of the hepatitis B virus carrier state. To assess the influence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection on the natural history of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, a study was undertaken of the clinical records of all 77 homosexual men with documented seroconversion to anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) between visits to either of two Sydney clinics between 1985 and 1989. HIV-1-seropositive subjects developed chronic HBV infection (positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] greater than 6 months) more frequently (7/31, 23%) than HIV-1-seronegative ones (2/46, 4%; P = .026). HIV-positive subjects who cleared HBsAg had significantly more circulating CD4+ lymphocytes (mean, 547 x 10(6)/l) than those who did not (352 x 10(6)/l, P less than .005). A subset of subjects who acquired both viruses between visits had an even higher rate of chronic infection (4/10, 40%). Icteric illnesses were reported more frequently by HIV-1-seronegative (11/46, 24%) than -seropositive subjects (3/31, 10%; P = .20). These findings indicate a potential for an increased reservoir of HBV infection in the community as a consequence of the HIV-1 epidemic. 
Induction of speech arrest and counting errors with rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation. Six adult epileptic patients underwent rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at stimulation rates of up to 25 Hz with an 11-cm water-cooled round coil held flat on the scalp, centered over 15 different positions on each side of the scalp. The trains of stimuli were for 10 seconds while the patients counted aloud. rTMS centered over D5 or D7 induced reproducible speech arrest in all patients and counting errors in three when applied at lower intensities. There were no such speech disturbances by rTMS centered over the different positions on the right side. Intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) demonstrated left hemispheric language dominance in all patients. Lateralization of speech arrest induced by rTMS correlated with the IAT results and may be helpful for noninvasive determination of hemispheric language dominance. 
Comparison of morbidity and function after colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis or restorative proctocolectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis. Restorative proctocolectomy with an ileal reservoir (RPC) should prevent colorectal cancer in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Until this is confirmed its role compared with total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) will depend on the relative morbidity and postoperative bowel function after the two procedures. This was analysed in 99 patients (37 RPC, 62 IRA) operated on between 1977 and 1989. Morbidity was greater after RPC with subsequent ileostomy closure (median hospital stay, 24 versus 11 days; complications, 60 versus 21 per cent; reoperation, 29 versus 3 per cent; return to normal activity; 31 versus 14 weeks). There was little difference in bowel function; after IRA median frequency was 3/24 h and urgency (unable to wait 15 min) occurred in 50 per cent, compared with 4.5/24h and 17 per cent after RPC. Night evacuation occurred in 10 and 43 per cent respectively. IRA was performed in younger patients (median 19 versus 31 years) who had fewer bowel motions before operation (2 versus 5/24 h). The greater morbidity of RPC suggests that it should be restricted to patients at higher risk of developing later rectal cancer, including those unavailable for follow-up and those with large or confluent rectal polyps or with curable colon cancer at the initial colectomy. 
Evaluation of diagnostic methods for Helicobacter pylori gastritis. The authors evaluated the use of direct Gram-stained smears, 1- and 24-hour urease broth tests, histologic examination, and culture to detect Helicobacter pylori in 100 gastric biopsy specimens from 97 patients with epigastric symptoms. Twenty-six patients had positive cultures and 27 had H. pylori identifiable in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. The gastric biopsy specimens from the 29 patients with culture and/or histologic findings positive for H. pylori showed active gastritis in 27 cases (93%), compared with 26 cases (37%) without H. pylori (P less than 0.0001). Chronic gastritis was present in 25 cases (86%) with H. pylori and 40 cases (56%) without H. pylori (P less than 0.01). Twenty patients had positive Gram-stained smears. Fifteen patients had positive 1-hour urease tests, and 3 had delayed positive 24-hour urease tests. There were no false-positive Gram's stain results, three false-positive 24-hour urease tests, two false-negative histologic results, and three false-negative cultures (one inadvertently incubated anaerobically). The sensitivities of the methods were as follows: 62% for the 24-hour urease test, 69% for direct Gram's stain, 90% for culture, and 93% for histologic examination. The authors conclude that the urease test used in this study has low sensitivity and limited specificity; that the direct Gram-stained smear is a useful, highly specific, rapid screening test; and that the lengthier methods of culture and histologic examination have comparably high sensitivity for the definitive diagnosis of H. pylori gastritis. 
Restriction of regional blood flow and diaphragmatic contractility. We have tested the hypothesis that the diaphragmatic head-to-head arterial anastomosis system should maintain adequate diaphragmatic function even during occlusion of some of its arteries. In six anesthetized open-chest dogs, left phrenic vein blood flow (Qphv) was measured by pulsed Doppler flowmetry. Contractility was measured by sonomicrometry in the left costal and crural diaphragm. The diaphragm was paced for 15 min by continuous bilateral supramaximal phrenic nerve stimulation. In five separate runs the following arteries were occluded at minute 5: 1) left phrenic artery, 2) internal mammary artery (IMA), 3) left phrenic artery and IMA, 4) descending aorta, and 5) descending aorta and IMA. Occlusion was then released at minute 10 of the run. In runs 1-3 there were no changes in contractility in costal or crural diaphragm and no changes in Qphv. However, in runs 4 and 5, Qphv decreased to 55.2 +/- 7.4 and 24.0 +/- 6.5% of control values, respectively. In run 4, percent maximum shortening from functional residual capacity (%LFRC) of the crural diaphragm decreased by 39.1%, while %LFRC of the costal diaphragm increased by 41.4% and abdominal pressure decreased by 47.0%. In run 5, abdominal pressure decreased by 53.5% and %LFRC of the crural and costal diaphragm decreased by 45.5 and 5.8%, respectively. Also relative postocclusion hyperemia was greater in run 5 (64.8%) than in run 4 (40.2%). 
The decision to suggest screening lower gastrointestinal endoscopy: the effect of training. Primary care residency directors in the Southeastern US were surveyed to obtain information on training in lower gastrointestinal endoscopy (LGIE). All residents in a sample of programs were asked to complete a similar questionnaire. Response was 77% for family practice residencies and 60% for internal medicine residencies. Significantly fewer (43%) internal medicine residents reported receiving training in either 35 cm or 60 cm LGIE than family practice residents (77%). When asked if they would suggest LGIE to screen an asymptomatic patient, 67% of family practice and 84% of internal medicine residents replied affirmatively. Those residents who had received training were significantly more likely to suggest screening LGIE. The screening decision was not influenced by the specialty of the physician who supervised the resident training. Out-of-pocket cost to the patient was expected to be a major consideration in the screening decision, but this was not supported statistically. Greater availability of residency training in LGIE will likely increase its use in screening. 
Successful term delivery by cesarean section in a patient with a continent ileocecal urinary reservoir. Childbirth in a mother with a continent urinary reservoir to our knowledge has not been previously reported. The effects of the gravid uterus on the reservoir are presented, as well as management of the pregnancy and delivery. 
Base deficit as an indicator of significant abdominal injury. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative predictive value of the arterial base deficit (BD) as an indicator of intra-abdominal injury (AI) and to compare BD with other indicators (chest injuries, pelvic fractures) of AI. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control analysis. SETTING: University of California San Diego Medical Center. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between January 1985 and July 1988, 3,223 blunt trauma patients were admitted, with complete records available on 3,011. Using a "best fit" multiple logistic regression, BD less than or equal to -6 was the single most important indicator of AI (P less than or equal to .0001), and the odds ratio for AI increased with each category of increasing severity of BD. Admission hypotension, major chest injury, pelvic fracture, and field hypotension (in odds ratio order) also were significantly associated with AI. CONCLUSION: BD is a powerful indicator of AI. A normal BD does not exclude AI, but the presence of a BD less than or equal to -6 in a blunt trauma patient should be considered a strong indication for objective evaluation of the abdomen (ie, diagnostic peritoneal lavage). 
Effects of therapeutic doses of heparin on thrombolysis with tissue-type plasminogen activator in rabbits. The objective of the study was to evaluate the ability of heparin to enhance the thrombolytic effect of recombinant tissue type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and to prevent thrombus growth during and after thrombolysis with rt-PA. In the thrombolysis studies, three groups of rabbits were infused with rt-PA at a dose of 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2.5 mg over 3 hours, respectively. Rabbits in each group were randomized to receive, in addition to rt-PA, heparin, 20 or 60 antifactor Xa U/kg/h, or saline over 6 hours. The three doses of rt-PA produced the same extent of thrombolysis both in the two groups treated with heparin (34% +/- 6%, 52% +/- 7%, and 79% +/- 8% in the lower dose group; 39% +/- 6%, 49% +/- 4%, and 81% +/- 6% in the higher dose group) and in the group treated with saline (37% +/- 4%, 47% +/- 5%, and 84% +/- 7%). In the thrombus growth inhibition studies 0.5 mg of rt-PA was infused over 3 hours in each rabbit. In addition, the rt-PA-treated rabbits were randomized to receive heparin, 20 or 60 antifactor Xa U/kg/h over 6 hours, or saline. At the end of infusion, no statistically significant differences in thrombus growth were found in three groups of rabbits (54.8 +/- 7.4 micrograms and 52.4 +/- 12.1 micrograms in the low and high dose of heparin groups, respectively, and 59.4 +/- 10.4 micrograms in the saline group). In different experiments rabbits were randomized to receive heparin, 60 antifactor Xa U/kg/h, or saline at the end of the rt-PA infusion. In these experiments heparin inhibited thrombus growth more efficiently than saline (41.1 +/- 6.5 micrograms and 58.7 +/- 12.9 micrograms, respectively, P less than .05). In vitro experiments confirmed that heparin is unable to prevent fibrin accretion on the clots during lysis with rt-PA while both D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2-Cl (PPACK) and hirudin are able to prevent the accretion of fibrin. We conclude that the data obtained in these animal models do not support the concomitant use of heparin and rt-PA. However, heparin could be used successfully after rt-PA to inhibit thrombus growth. 
Flow cytometric studies of human osteosarcoma. A number of recent studies have emphasized the potential value of flow cytometry as a "marker" to assess the malignity and therefore to help predict the biologic behavior of neoplasms, including bone tumors. Using propidium iodide and a home-built flow cytometer, the authors have studied the DNA distribution in 95 patients with osteosarcoma and determined the percentage of cells in diploidy, S-phase, tetraploidy, and aneuploidy. Using these values and a derived one, mean DNA concentration, it was possible to demonstrate the extent of the abnormalities observed in this group of neoplasms and show their severity as compared with the normal pattern. When the data are compared against disease-free survival and total survival, correlations were noted that, although weak, suggested that some patterns were predictive of increased risk of metastasis and death. The effect of treatment could also be assessed by evaluating the pattern before and after chemotherapy and correlating these with survival. It seems likely that with some improvement in technology, flow cytometry will be of value in the future in assessing the prognosis for osteosarcoma and predicting whether treatment has been effective. 
Diarrhea associated with tube feeding: the importance of using objective criteria. Since the published incidence of tube feeding-associated diarrhea varies widely between 2.3 and 68%, and because commonly used definitions of diarrhea are subjective and imprecise, we determined the actual fecal output of malnourished patients during the first 6 days of tube feeding. Nine patients on the same isoosmolar formula were evaluated for diarrhea. Patients were interviewed daily as to whether they thought diarrhea was present or absent. Frequency of defecation was recorded, and stool was collected daily for weight. When assessed subjectively, the incidence of diarrhea rose from 11% on day 1, to 25% on day 4, and to 43% by day 6. The group (n = 4) complaining of diarrhea averaged 3.0 bowel movements per day, whereas those denying diarrhea (n = 5) averaged fewer than 0.2 bowel movements per day (p less than 0.01). Stool weight, however, plateaued for all patients by day 6 at 52.7 +/- 35.7 g of stool per day. No patient produced in excess of 250 g of stool per day. We suggest that traditional subjective measures for assessing diarrhea may be flawed and should not be relied upon when evaluating and treating tube feeding-associated diarrhea. 
Orbital fractures: surface coil MR imaging. Twenty-six patients with orbital fractures diagnosed with plain radiography and computed tomography were examined with surface coil magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Fifteen patients had blow-out fractures, and 11 had maxillofacial complex fractures. In all patients with blow-out fractures, the location of the fracture was precisely indicated by the presence of prolapsed orbital fat. Incarceration of the extraocular muscle or orbital fat was correctly diagnosed with MR imaging, which was less sensitive in depicting maxillofacial fractures but was useful in assessment of soft-tissue involvement. Postoperative follow-up MR studies provided valuable information about the cause of motility impairment. While T1-weighted images are useful for the detection of the fracture site, both T1- and T2-weighted images are usually necessary for evaluating soft-tissue lesions. The results of this study indicate that surface coil MR imaging is an important adjunct procedure in the diagnosis and treatment of orbital fractures. 
Physiologic measurement of exercise and fatigue with special reference to chronic fatigue syndrome. Oxidative metabolism is the major source of energy for muscle activity, and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), the product of maximal cardiac output and maximal arteriovenous oxygen difference, indicates individual capacity for oxidative metabolism and performance of exercise by the large muscles. Strength, a function of muscle cross-sectional area, motor-unit recruitment, and neuromuscular coordination, is the ability to develop force in a single, brief, maximal-effort voluntary contraction of rested muscle. Weakness is a diminished ability of rested muscle to exert maximal force. Fatigue is a loss of maximal force-generating capacity that develops during muscular activity, likely originates within muscle itself, and persists until muscle is fully recovered. Individual perception of motor effort can be determined with standardized rating scales. These concepts are discussed in detail, their relevance to the pathophysiology of exercise in chronic fatigue syndrome is analyzed, and a general strategy of exercise evaluation pertinent to chronic fatigue syndrome is presented. 
Intestinal and renal calcium-binding protein in rats with experimental short bowel syndrome. Intestinal calcium-binding protein (calbindin-D9K) and renal calcium-binding protein (calbindin-D28K) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays in rats with short bowel syndrome induced by resection of about 85% of the small intestine. Rats with short bowel syndrome had significantly lower mucosal concentrations of calbindin-D9K (P less than 0.001) and a parallel reduction of both intestinal calcium absorption (P less than 0.001) and p-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (P less than 0.01) in spite of a general hypertrophy of the duodenal mucosa. Interestingly, the renal concentration of calbindin-D28K was significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) in rats with short bowel syndrome, a change apparently related to factors independent of vitamin D. 
Total acromionectomy. A twenty-year review. Thirty-five patients (thirty-eight shoulders) were treated consecutively with a total acromionectomy between 1969 and 1989. At a minimum of two years (average, five years and eight months) after the operation, thirty-one patients (thirty-four shoulders) were available for review. The results, which were rated on the basis of pain, function, range of motion, strength, and the satisfaction of the patient, were excellent for twenty-five shoulders, good for four, fair for three, and poor for one. Four of the five least satisfactory results were in patients who had had a long-standing massive tear of the rotator cuff. This study was done to separate the criticism of the operative procedure of total acromionectomy from an avoidable complication of that procedure, retraction of the deltoid, and to describe the specific advantages and satisfactory results that occur when that complication is avoided. It is my opinion that failure to repair the deltoid adequately results in retraction of that muscle, and that this avoidable complication is responsible for the unfavorable reputation of total acromionectomy. 
Visual recognition memory. Neurophysiological evidence for the role of temporal white matter in man. A novel event-related potential (ERP) elicited by a visuospatial recognition memory task was recorded in 20 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy using depth electrodes sited in the temporal lobes. The ERPs comprised two components, an N400 and a P600, and were similar in morphology to the previously reported ERP to verbal recognition memory tasks. The two ERP components in both verbal and visuospatial tasks were dependent on stimulus type and our data suggest that they do not simply represent delayed P300 ERP responses. In 17/20 patients robust, reliable bilaterally present ERPs were elicited by both verbal and visuospatial memory tasks. N400 amplitude was larger in response to novel stimuli, whereas P600 amplitude was larger to repeated stimuli. P600 amplitude was larger in the right temporal lobe to both visuospatial and verbal stimulus material. N400 and P600 latencies did not vary with task, stimulus type or side of recording. In 3/20 patients, no ERPs were elicited by either memory task. In all 3 cases, unilateral temporal white matter abnormalities were demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioural measures, expressed in the form of standardized accuracy scores, did not differ from those of a normal control group, and hence are unlikely to account for the abnormalities in ERPs. These results are discussed with reference to the primate visual recognition memory pathway and suggest that ERPs to recognition memory tasks are generated by an interaction between the two homologous inferotemporal recognition memory pathways. 
Portal venous system after portosystemic shunts or endoscopic sclerotherapy: evaluation with Doppler sonography. We sought to determine the usefulness of duplex Doppler sonography in the assessment of blood flow and clot formation in the portal vein in 44 patients with portal hypertension and bleeding esophageal varices who had undergone either endoscopic sclerotherapy (28 cases) or portosystemic shunt procedures (16 cases). The main, left, and right portal veins (collectively referred to as intrahepatic portal veins), superior mesenteric vein, splenic vein, and shunt were assessed for flow direction, presence of thrombi, and collaterals. Patent shunts were visualized in 12 (75%) of the 16 cases. Clot was detected in 27 (69%) of 39 intrahepatic portal veins in patients with end-to-side shunts, in six (67%) of nine intrahepatic portal veins in patients with distal splenorenal shunts, and in five (5%) of 92 intrahepatic portal veins in patients who had had endoscopic sclerotherapy. Flow in the main portal vein was hepatopetal in two (15%) of 13 patients with patent shunts (one end-to-side portacaval shunt and one distal splenorenal shunt). Flow in the main portal vein was hepatopetal in 26 (93%) of 28 patients who had had endoscopic sclerotherapy. Our data suggest endoscopic sclerotherapy preserves antegrade portal flow and results in fewer portal vein clots than surgical portosystemic shunts do. Patterns of thrombosis and flow direction vary unpredictably from patient to patient. Shunt patency should not be inferred without direct visualization of the shunt. 
Colonic volvulus. The Army Medical Center experience 1983-1987. Colonic volvulus was first described in 1836 by von Rokitansky. The condition has been a formidable one, fraught with innumerable complications responsible for many deaths. Even with advances in surgical technology, mortalities have remained high. Often the diagnosis is delayed for hours or even days after presentation, and serious concomitant systemic diseases are often present. Treatment has been controversial, particularly the role of elective resection following successful nonoperative reduction. The Army Medical Center experience with colonic volvulus from 1983 through 1987 is reviewed. Fifty-four patients at the eight medical centers carried this diagnosis. Their presenting signs and symptoms are discussed. The Army patients are compared and contrasted with reviews presented in the surgical literature, and conclusions are made to give guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. 
Cardiovascular pharmacology of adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors: therapeutic significance in congestive heart failure. This review discusses the localization of adrenergic- and dopaminergic-adrenoceptors within the cardiovascular system and describes the cardiovascular and renal changes produced following the activation of these receptors by appropriate agonists. Whereas the role of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agents in the treatment of heart failure is well recognized, recent studies with dopamine (DA)-receptor agonists indicate that they offer a novel approach in the therapy of congestive heart failure. DA-adrenoceptor agonists reduce afterload by causing vasodilation and promote sodium excretion via direct activation of DA1-adrenoceptors located on renal tubules. Fenoldopam is a selective DA1-adrenoceptor agonist found to be effective in heart failure. It reduces afterload by causing peripheral vasodilation and produces natriuresis and diuresis. Dopexamine is a DA1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, and its efficacy in heart failure is due to its ability to provide mild inotropic support and cause a reduction in afterload. Ibopamine is a prodrug that is converted into its active metabolite, epinine. This compound activates primarily DA1- and DA2-adrenoceptors. It is effective in heart failure, and the mechanism progresses via DA1- and DA2-adrenoceptor-mediated reduction in afterload. Agonists of DA2-adrenoceptors reduce afterload by decreasing the release of norepinephrine and by reducing the levels of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Since both of these systems are active in heart failure, ibopamine offers a rational approach for therapy. The present review addresses the concept of pharmacologic intervention in adrenergic and dopaminergic influence in the cardiovascular and renal systems to produce changes that are desirable for the pharmacotherapy of congestive heart failure. 
Antihypertensive dose-response relationships: studies with the selective alpha 1-blocking agent terazosin. Terazosin is a selective alpha 1-adrenergic-blocking agent indicated for the treatment of hypertension. The aim of this multicenter study, performed in 256 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, was to define the dosing characteristics of terazosin (in the range of 1 to 80 mg) administered once daily. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or active treatment groups; each group received 3 months of treatment, which comprised three ascending doses of terazosin, each administered for a 1-month period. As determined by conventional office measurements of supine diastolic blood pressure and by automated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, there was a clear antihypertensive dose-response relationship for terazosin in the range of 1 to 5 mg daily. Except for the 80 mg dose, none of the doses above 5 mg (10 to 40 mg) appeared to provide additional efficacy. Both the office measurements and the monitoring data indicated that the ratio of trough (effect at the end of the dosing interval) to peak (maximum effect during the dosing interval) was at least 50% or greater during treatment with the 5 mg dose. Thus the 5 mg dose appeared to provide meaningful clinical antihypertensive efficacy and to sustain its effects throughout the full 24-hour period. 
Diuretic agents versus beta-blockers. Comparison of effects on mortality, stroke, and coronary events. Three recently concluded large randomized clinical trials have compared the preventive effects of diuretic agents and beta-blockers in the treatment of approximately 22,000 subjects with hypertension. In the Medical Research Council trial, bendrofluazide (10 mg daily) was compared with a dose of propranolol (as much as 240 mg daily), a nonselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Two selective beta-blockers, atenolol (100 mg daily) and metoprolol (200 mg daily), were compared with bendrofluazide (5-10 mg daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (50-100 mg daily) in the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension trial. In the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, 160 mg of slow-release oxprenolol, a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was compared with a diuretic-based regimen not containing beta-blockers. In each trial, similar reductions in mean diastolic blood pressure were achieved with diuretic and beta-blocker treatment that lasted for several years. All-cause mortality and fatal and nonfatal stroke and coronary event rates were also similar in the treatment groups. Thus, it appears that beta-blockers are as effective as diuretic agents in improving survival and in preventing major morbid events. Regarding cigarette smoking and stroke incidence, observations based on post hoc subgroup analyses of the Medical Research Council trial were not supported by subgroup findings in the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension and the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension trials, and these observations should not form the basis for any treatment recommendations. 
Visceral fat accumulation: the missing link between psychosocial factors and cardiovascular disease? Neuroendocrine responses to psychosocial pressures have been well characterized. The defence reaction is followed by increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Essential hypertension might be induced by such mechanisms. The defeat reaction is characterized by increased activity along the corticotropin releasing factor-adrenocorticotropin hormone-cortisol axis, resulting in the inhibition of gonadotropin secretion. Such endocrine disturbances are followed by metabolic aberrations, and probably also by the accumulation of visceral fat. Subjects with abdominal fat accumulation (high waist/hip circumference ratio, WHR) have recently been found to exhibit a number of psychosocial handicaps, together with endocrine aberrations characteristic of the defence and, in particular, the defeat reaction, as well as the associated circulatory and metabolic aberrations. Such abnormalities, including the WHR itself, are established risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It is postulated that increased WHR is a symptom of chronic hypothalamic arousal as a result of a defeat reaction to psychosocial pressures. This might lead to the development of disease via circulatory and metabolic derangements. 
Dynamic F waves in neurogenic claudication. Serial F waves were elicited before and after ambulation in 2 patients with neurogenic claudication. In both patients dynamic changes in F wave parameters consisting of either unelicitability or increased latencies occurred postexercise. The time course of these changes and their subsequent rapid reversibility over 15 minutes suggest ischemic-induced conduction block and slowing in proximal motor axons. These physiological changes may account for some of the dynamic neurological symptoms of this disorder. Moreover, F wave exercise testing may provide corroborative information for the diagnosis of neurogenic claudication. 
Thromboembolism in patients with advanced mitral valve prolapse Thromboembolism in mitral valve prolapse (MVP) has been suggested to occur in relation to valvular cul-de-sac recesses and endothelial wear-and-tear denudations. Such pathology would be suspected to be prominent in advanced cases of MVP necessitating open-heart operation. We therefore analysed the prevalence of perivalvular thrombi and episodes of systemic arterial embolism (SE) prior to operation in 21 consecutive patients with MVP and severe valve regurgitation. No perivalvular or left atrial thrombi were found during open-heart surgery, but three of the patients (14%, 3-36% with 95% confidence limits) experienced SE, in one case despite long-term anticoagulation. All cases of SE took place less than 3 months before operation. The results indicate that persistent thrombi are rare in MVP and severe valve regurgitation. However, such patients run a substantial risk of SE when they reach a clinical and haemodynamic stage that makes valve surgery mandatory. 
Comparison of serial quantitative evaluation of calcified coronary artery plaque by ultrafast computed tomography in persons with and without obstructive coronary artery disease. Coronary artery calcium indicates atherosclerosis. Ultrafast computed tomography (CT) can noninvasively visualize and quantify coronary calcium, permitting the natural history of calcified plaque to be studied. This pilot study evaluates the ability of ultrafast CT to follow the progression of calcified plaque within the coronary arteries in patients with and without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Twenty-five subjects had serial ultrafast CT scans of the coronary arteries a mean of 406 days apart. Changes in the number of calcific deposits, calcified plaque area and volume, calcium density and total calcium score were measured. In the 20 patients with calcium on the first study, there were statistically significant increases in mean peak CT number, total calcified plaque volume, total calcified plaque area and total calcium score (p less than 0.0001 for all). Subjects with proved obstructive CAD (n = 10) on angiography had a 48% increase in calcified plaque volume compared with 22% in asymptomatic subjects (n = 10). Comparison of serial studies showed that smaller calcific deposits often coalesced into single larger calcific deposits. Ninety-eight percent (235 of 241) of deposits identified on the first study were accounted for on the second study. Patients with obstructive CAD had a higher number of new calcific deposits than did those in the asymptomatic group (55 vs 18, p = 0.058). Serial ultrafast CT accurately tracks the progression of coronary artery calcium. It is a useful technique for assessing changes in calcified plaque formation in both asymptomatic subjects and in patients with obstructive CAD. It may be useful for studying the natural history of CAD and the effects of intervention on the course of CAD. 
Arthritis and nephritis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Previous publications suggest that in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid factor (RF) may be "protective" against nephritis. In our study of 662 patients with SLE, we found that persistent, rheumatoid-like arthritis showed a much stronger inverse correlation with nephritis than RF. Of 186 such patients, 59 developed clinically evident nephritis (32%) compared to 263 of the other 476 patients (55%) (p less than 10(-7). RF showed only a weak inverse relationship to nephritis (p = 0.064). We conclude that the presence of persistent rheumatoid-like arthritis in patients with SLE identifies a clinical subset of patients who are less likely to develop nephritis than those with no arthralgia, no objective arthritis or only episodic arthritis. We hypothesize that such patients represent a genetically determined subset among patients with SLE and that perhaps they are more likely to bear the HLA-DR4 allele. 
Repair of inferior iridodialysis using a partial-thickness scleral flap. We present a technique of inferior iridodialysis repair using a partial-thickness scleral flap, which, in turn, employs a modification of the technique currently used to suture posterior chamber intraocular lenses under scleral flaps. 
Innominate artery occlusive disease: surgical approach and long-term results. We reviewed our experience with 54 patients who underwent innominate artery revascularization during a 10-year period. Their age range was from 16 to 75 years (mean, 49.8 years). The innominate artery alone was involved in 21 patients (39%); the remaining patients had additional arch vessel obstructions. Before operation, neurologic symptoms occurred in 25 patients (46%), arm ischemia related to claudication and microembolization occurred in 8 patients (14%), a combination of symptoms occurred in 17 patients (32%), and no symptoms were noted in 4 patients (8%). The extrathoracic approach to surgery was used in 16 patients (30%). Eleven of the 38 patients in whom the intrathoracic approach was used had endarterectomy of the innominate artery; in three of those, the procedure was combined with left common carotid endarterectomy. Bypass grafts were used in the other 27 patients undergoing procedures with an intrathoracic approach; in six of those, bypass was combined with carotid endarterectomy. No operative deaths occurred. Perioperative revascularization failure occurred in four cases; all of those patients underwent a second revascularization procedure, with a secondary patency rate of 100%. In four patients, late occlusion was noted at 6 months and at 1, 1.5, and 10 years. One patient had a permanent perioperative neurologic deficit in the distribution of the left carotid artery after a combined common carotid endarterectomy/innominate endarterectomy procedure. No neurologic deficits were directly related to the innominate artery territory. Long-term actuarial survival was 83% at 10 years. Early and late graft failures were related to inadequate inflow in bypass grafts, progression of distal disease in arteritis, and primary closure in endarterectomy. 
Fluconazole therapy for chronic disseminated candidiasis in patients with leukemia and prior amphotericin B therapy. OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of fluconazole against chronic disseminated candidiasis (hepatosplenic candidiasis) in patients with leukemia in whom amphotericin B treatment had failed. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis treated with fluconazole on a compassionate investigational new drug protocol. SETTING: Multi-institutional. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients received 100 to 400 mg of fluconazole per day for a median of 30 weeks. All had either failed to respond to treatment with more than 2 g of amphotericin B or had serious amphotericin B-related toxicities. RESULTS: Fourteen of 16 evaluable patients (88%) responded. Responses were observed in seven of nine patients in whom adequate doses of amphotericin B had failed and in all seven patients who had amphotericin B-related toxicities. In 12 patients, cytotoxic chemotherapy was continued without flare of the infection. Fluconazole was well tolerated with rare side effects. Aspergillus superinfection developed in three patients and contributed to the death of two of them. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole is a safe and effective agent with significant activity against chronic disseminated candidiasis. 
Respiratory muscle deoxygenation during exercise in patients with heart failure demonstrated with near-infrared spectroscopy. Exertional dyspnea in patients with heart failure may be due, in part, to respiratory muscle underperfusion. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a new technique that permits noninvasive assessment of skeletal muscle oxygenation by monitoring changes in near-infrared light absorption. With use of near-infrared spectroscopy, serratus anterior muscle oxygenation during maximal bicycle exercise was compared in 10 patients with heart failure (ejection fraction 16 +/- 5%) and 7 age-matched normal subjects. Oxygen consumption (VO2), minute ventilation (VE) and arterial saturation were also measured. Changes in difference in absorption between 760 and 800 nm, expressed in arbitrary units, were used to detect muscle deoxygenation. Minimal change in this difference in absorption occurred in normal subjects during exercise, whereas patients with heart failure exhibited progressive changes throughout exercise consistent with respiratory muscle deoxygenation (peak exercise: normal 3 +/- 6, heart failure 12 +/- 4 near-infrared arbitrary units, p less than 0.001). At comparable work loads patients with heart failure had significantly greater minute ventilation and respiratory rate but similar tidal volume when contrasted with normal subjects. However, at peak exercise normal subjects achieved significantly greater minute ventilation and tidal volume with a comparable respiratory rate. No significant arterial desaturation occurred during exercise in either group. These findings indicate that respiratory muscle deoxygenation occurs in patients with heart failure during exercise. This deoxygenation may contribute to the exertional dyspnea experienced by such patients. 
The role of second-look surgery in the management of advanced germ cell malignancies. The need for second-look surgery after chemotherapy in children with advanced germ cell tumors is controversial, particularly when levels of the tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta HCG) are elevated at diagnosis. The authors evaluated the outcome of second-look surgery in relationship to tumor marker status in 27 patients with Stage III to IV disease who had completed four courses of chemotherapy. Markers were elevated at diagnosis in 19 patients. After chemotherapy, markers normalized in 12 of these patients. Second-look surgery confirmed complete response (CR) in these 12 patients, two of whom had residual masses on computed tomography (CT) scan (mature teratoma and necrotic tumor). The AFP decreased but did not normalize in seven patients; five had residual disease at second look and the other two later developed measurable disease. Of the eight patients with normal AFP at diagnosis, second look confirmed clinical CR in four. The other four patients had CT evidence of residual masses: surgery showed necrotic tissue in two cases, mature glial elements in one, and mature teratoma with glial elements in one. Thus second-look surgery added no information for treatment planning in children with elevated tumor markers at diagnosis and might best be reserved for patients without tumor markers at diagnosis and residual masses on CT scan, and those with persistent elevation of tumor markers and potentially resectable residual disease. Because of the possibility of small amount of residual tumor, second-look surgery may also be useful in patients whose markers normalize but who have residual masses on CT scans. 
The skier's nose: a model of cold-induced rhinorrhea. Cold-induced rhinorrhea (CIR) is a commonly experienced discomfort not previously addressed in the medical literature. In a 2-part study, we assessed the prevalence and described the characteristics of CIR and evaluated the efficacy of an anticholinergic nasal spray in its treatment. In Part 1, 90 general medical patients at a ski resort clinic were asked to describe their symptoms associated with cold exposure. Ninety-six percent reported some degree of CIR; 48% reported moderate to severe CIR. Fifty percent had some degree of nasal congestion and 33% reported sneezing. Allergic and nonallergic patients described similar degrees of rhinorrhea. In Part 2, 14 ski patrollers were given atropine sulfate in saline (AS/S) nasal spray before cold exposure in double-blinded placebo (P) controlled crossover fashion. Ninety-two percent noted improvement of CIR with AS/S and 8% experienced no change. None of the subjects noted worsening of symptoms, however, one subject reported excessive dryness at the AS/S concentration used. All 14 subjects receiving P experienced no change in CIR. We conclude that CIR is a distinct clinical syndrome frequently seen with cold temperature exposure, presenting primarily as rhinorrhea and sometimes involving nasal congestion and sneezing. Pretreatment with a 0.005% solution AS/S can effectively block CIR with only minimal short-term side effects. 
Inhibitors of hepatic DNA synthesis in fulminant hepatic failure. In certain etiological groups of patients with fulminant hepatic failure, poor survival may be due to lack of liver regeneration. In vitro experiments have shown that fulminant hepatic failure serum is cytotoxic to rabbit hepatocytes and inhibits DNA synthesis on short-term incubation with isolated regenerating rat hepatocytes. When fulminant hepatic failure serum is injected into partially hepatectomized rats at the time of maximal DNA synthesis, [3H]thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA is reduced significantly. The effect is greater with sera obtained from patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to non-A, non-B hepatitis or an adverse drug reaction and is associated with a less than 10,000-dalton fraction. No stimulation of DNA synthesis is observed with injection of the greater than 10,000-dalton serum fraction into normal rats. In preliminary experiments, no increase in epidermal growth factor production has been found in liver failure. Overall, the substances present in fulminant hepatic failure serum appear to be inhibitory rather than stimulatory for liver cell regeneration. 
p53 in chronic myelogenous leukemia in acute phase. All patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) undergo clinical transition from chronic to acute phase. This transition is often associated with deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 in the form of the i(17q) aberration. Since the p53 gene is a suppressor gene and is located on 17p13, we examined the possibility that it is inactivated during progression of CML. Therefore, we studied the structure and expression of p53 in the leukemic cells of a large number of CML patients in acute phase. We found that although the gene is rarely rearranged, one p53 allele is completely deleted in patients with the i(17q) aberration as well as in some patients who do not show karyotypic changes. In all of these patients the remaining allele is inactivated through loss of expression, rearrangement, or point mutation. Detailed analysis of some patients who carry both p53 alleles indicated neither loss of expression nor structural alterations. It appears that p53 loss of function is associated with progression of around 25% of CML patients. 
The motor control assessment: an instrument to measure motor control in physically disabled children. The Motor Control Assessment has been developed as a research tool for the assessment of motor skills in physically disabled children. In tests of concurrent validity it was found to be highly correlated with the results of the Physical Abilities Chart (Pearson coefficient = .96), and satisfactorily correlated with ranking of motor ability assigned using the clinical judgment of physiotherapists (Spearman rank coefficients = .63 to .97 in diagnostic subgroups). Estimates of both interrater and intrarater reliability were also high, with intraclass coefficients above .95. 
Diurnal fluctuations of arterial ketone body ratio in normal subjects and patients with liver dysfunction. To explore the metabolic aspects of chronic liver disease, diurnal changes of arterial ketone body ratio (acetoacetate/3-hydroxybutyrate), reflecting hepatic mitochondrial redox potential, were investigated in normal subjects, patients with chronic liver disease (Child's class A or B), and patients with hepatic failure (Child's class C). Ketone body ratio in normal subjects increased after breakfast from 0.96 to 2.00, after lunch from 2.17 to 2.38, and after dinner from 1.23 to 2.55 with blood glucose level ranging from 103 to 141 mg/dL (5.7 to 7.8 mmol/L). By contrast, the ketone body ratio in the Child A or B group changed little and remained within a range of 0.70-1.35 despite a large change in blood glucose level from 102 to 176 mg/dL (5.7 to 9.8 mmol/L). Ketone body ratio in Child's class C remained near or below 0.4 with no response to glucose administration, despite a marked elevation in blood glucose level. These results indicate that hepatic mitochondrial redox potential undergoes diurnal changes in sharp response to meals in normal liver function but that these fluctuations are absent in patients with liver damage (Child's class A, B, and C). Furthermore, it remains at low levels in severe liver failure (Child's class C). It is also suggested that hepatic mitochondrial redox potential plays an important role in the regulation of blood glucose levels. 
Pathological hypertrophy and cardiac interstitium. Fibrosis and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is the major risk factor associated with myocardial failure. An explanation for why a presumptive adaptation such as LVH would prove pathological has been elusive. Insights into the impairment in contractility of the hypertrophied myocardium have been sought in the biochemistry of cardiac myocyte contraction. Equally compelling is a consideration of abnormalities in myocardial structure that impair organ contractile function while preserving myocyte contractility. For example, in the LVH that accompanies hypertension, the extracellular space is frequently the site of an abnormal accumulation of fibrillar collagen. This reactive and progressive interstitial and perivascular fibrosis accounts for abnormal myocardial stiffness and ultimately ventricular dysfunction and is likely a result of cardiac fibroblast growth and enhanced collagen synthesis. The disproportionate involvement of this nonmyocyte cell, however, is not a uniform accompaniment to myocyte hypertrophy and LVH, suggesting that the growth of myocyte and nonmyocyte cells is independent of each other. This has now been demonstrated in in vivo studies of experimental hypertension in which the abnormal fibrous tissue response was found in the hypertensive, hypertrophied left ventricle as well as in the normotensive, nonhypertrophied right ventricle. These findings further suggest that a circulating substance that gained access to the common coronary circulation of the ventricles was involved. This hypothesis has been tested in various animal models in which plasma concentrations of angiotensin II and aldosterone were varied. Based on morphometric and morphological findings, it can be concluded that arterial hypertension (i.e., an elevation in coronary perfusion pressure) together with elevated circulating aldosterone are associated with cardiac fibroblast involvement and the resultant heterogeneity in tissue structure. Nonmyocyte cells of the cardiac interstitium represent an important determinant of pathological LVH. The mechanisms that invoke short- (e.g., collagen metabolism) and long-term (e.g., mitosis) responses of cardiac fibroblasts require further investigation and integration of in vitro with in vivo studies. The stage is set, however, to prevent pathological LVH resulting from myocardial fibrosis as well as to reverse it. 
Prospective evaluation of epidural and intravenous administration of fentanyl for pain control and restoration of ventilatory function following multiple rib fractures. To evaluate the efficacy of opiate administration regimens, 32 patients with multiple rib fractures were prospectively randomized to receive either continuous epidural (ED) or continuous intravenous (IV) infusions of fentanyl. Dosage was titrated to individual subjective pain relief. Ventilatory function tests (VFTs), arterial blood gases (ABGs), and visual analog scores were obtained before and after the institution of analgesia. Post-analgesia values were compared with pre-analgesia values using a two-tailed paired t-test looking for significant changes produced by the analgesic method. Both methods significantly improved analog pain scores. The ED method produced improvement in both maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and vital capacity (VC), whereas IV analgesia only produced improvement in VC. Intravenous fentanyl produced increases in PaCO2 and decreases in PaO2, whereas no significant changes in ABGs were observed with ED fentanyl administration. Side effects were similar between the groups, with pruritus being more pronounced with ED fentanyl administration. The data demonstrate that the continuous ED fentanyl method offers excellent relief of pain and improvement in ventilatory function and has distinct advantages over IV fentanyl administration with respect to changes in ABGs and MIP. The continuous infusion of epidural opiates should be the preferred analgesic method for patients at high risk of developing pulmonary complications following multiple rib fractures. 
The value of immunological approaches to the diagnosis of schistosomal myelopathy. Myelopathy due to schistosome infection is a rare, yet probably frequently unrecognized, form of schistosomiasis. This condition is clinically difficult to diagnose, and without specific biopsy evidence final confirmation relies largely on circumstantial evidence. We describe here immunological attempts to diagnose schistosomal myelopathy. ELISA performed on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was the most successful, detecting 12/12 cases tested prior to or within one month of treatment. This is based on a "normal" value established on neurological patients without myelopathy. Only 13/149 non-schistosomal myelopathy patients from an endemic area gave positive results in this test. Oligoclonal bands were detected in the CSF of 5/9 schistosomal myelopathy patients and 11/18 cases of myelopathy of other known causes, but in 0/7 cases of myelopathy where the cause was not established. Western blotting was unable to distinguish between myelopathy due to schistosomiasis and other causes. It is recommended that the ELISA be performed on CSF and the results be compared with a "normal" level for neurological patients. In our laboratory this system gives a high sensitivity and a negative result can be confidently used to exclude schistosomal myelopathy. 
Topical tretinoin for treatment of photodamaged skin. A multicenter study. The clinical and histologic effects of a new emollient cream formulation of topical tretinoin at concentrations of 0.05% and 0.01% were examined in 251 subjects with mild to moderate photodamaged facial skin in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter study. Seventy-nine percent of the subjects who received 0.05% tretinoin for 24 weeks showed overall improvement in photodamaged skin compared with improvement in 48% of the vehicle-treated control subjects. Significant reductions were found in fine wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, roughness, and laxity after 0.05% tretinoin therapy when compared with controls. In addition, histologic changes of increased epidermal thickness, decreased melanin content, and stratum corneum compaction provide independent evidence supporting clinical improvement. Side effects of erythema, peeling, and stinging were usually mild and well tolerated. 
Prognostic value of VEPs in young children with acute onset of cortical blindness. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded in 32 children (ages 4 months to 5 years) who were clinically diagnosed as being cortically blind. None of the children had visual or neurologic abnormalities prior to the precipitating insult which included surgery (N = 15), trauma (N = 3), infectious disease (N = 5), hypoxia (N = 3), and other causes (N = 6). VEPs were recorded during the acute stage of cortical blindness in all children and were repeated in 24 of them. Either flash or pattern stimulation was used, depending upon the age and visual status of the child. All but one of the children who had normal flash VEPs while cortically blind, recovered normal visual function. All patients with abnormal VEPs had permanent visual impairment or blindness and all but one of those with absent VEPs remained blind. The recovery period was highly variable, ranging from 5 days to 3 years. Thus, flash VEPs recorded during the period of blindness were useful in predicting visual outcome, regardless of etiology. Repeat studies using pattern VEPs were valuable in monitoring recovery in many of these patients. 
Oral mesalamine (Asacol) for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. A multicenter study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a pH-sensitive, polymer-coated oral preparation of mesalamine in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. DESIGN: A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial. SETTING: Five university-based medical centers, one inflammatory bowel disease center, and three private practice sites. PATIENTS: A total of 158 patients with newly or previously diagnosed active ulcerative colitis. INTERVENTION: A pH-sensitive, polymer-coated oral preparation of mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid) was used at 1.6 and 2.4 g/d for 6 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy was measured by scores for stool frequency, rectal bleeding, patient's functional assessment, sigmoidoscopic findings, and physician's global assessment. Stringent criteria for disease activity were established prospectively. RESULTS: The analysis of protocol-compliant patients showed a significant improvement at 3 weeks in patients taking 2.4 g/d of mesalamine compared with patients taking placebo (32% versus 9%; P = 0.003). At 6 weeks, both the 1.6 g/d (43%) and 2.4 g/d (49%) doses were significantly superior to placebo (23%) (P = 0.03 and P = 0.003, respectively). In addition, more patients worsened in the placebo group compared with the 2.4 g/d group (50% versus 19%; P = 0.003); however, there was no statistically significant difference in worsening between the 1.6 g/d mesalamine group and the placebo group. The oral mesalamine tablet was well tolerated, and no clinically significant changes were observed in hematologic, hepatic, or renal laboratory profiles. CONCLUSION: Colon-targeted oral mesalamine at 2.4 g/d is effective therapy for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. It is well tolerated and should provide a viable therapeutic alternative to sulfasalazine. 
Protective effect of electrical stimulation in the deafened guinea pig cochlea. The effect of chronic intrascalar electrical stimulation on the spiral ganglion cell survival of the ototoxically deafened guinea pig was investigated. Immediately after ototoxic drug administration, unilateral sinusoidal (1 kHz) charge-balanced electrical stimulation on a 50% duty cycle was administered for 2 hours per day, 5 days per week, at intensities from 0 (control) to 400 microAmp via an implanted scala tympani electrode. The relationship of electrically evoked middle latency response (EMLR) to stimulation protocol and cell survival was studied. At 9 weeks post-drug treatment, the animals were killed and temporal bones were prepared for morphometric analysis of spiral ganglion cell density. The subjects showed essentially complete elimination of outer hair sensory cells, with minimal remaining inner hair cells confined to apical turns. Variable loss of spiral ganglion cell populations was observed, which related to electrical stimulation. In animals that received daily unilaterally electrical stimulation, statistically significant increases in survival of spiral ganglion cells were observed in the stimulated ear, compared to the nonstimulated ear-particularly in basal cochlear regions near the electrode. Spiral ganglion cell density was a function of stimulation current intensity level. Moreover, the slope of the amplitude input/output (I/O) function of the EMLR was found to be dependent on stimulating current level. The effect of stimulation on induced survival may be dependent on a number of mechanisms, including metabolic effects of direct activation of "deafferented" spiral ganglion cells. These data support the suggestion that implantation may provide optimal benefits when performed shortly after deafness. 
Left ventricular hypertrophy: impact of calcium channel blocker therapy. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of the concentric type is the classic cardiac adaptation to sustained arterial hypertension. Data from the Framingham cohort have shown that patients with LVH have a severalfold higher risk of sudden death, acute myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular morbidity than those with normal hearts. Common sequelae of LVH are ventricular ectopy, impaired ventricular contractility, myocardial ischemia, and decreased left ventricular filling. The benefits of antihypertensive therapy should not be limited to lowering arterial pressure, but should extend to preventing or reducing target organ damage. A variety of antihypertensive agents, such as calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antiadrenergic drugs, and, to a lesser extent, beta blockers, have been shown to reduce LVH and to improve left ventricular filling. We have shown that calcium channel blockers diminish ventricular ectopy in parallel with the reduction of LVH, whereas antihypertensive therapy with diuretics neither reduced LVH nor suppressed ventricular ectopy, although it lowered arterial pressure to a similar extent. Whether or not these cardiac changes with antihypertensive therapies will improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with LVH remains to be documented. 
The acute effects of flecainide in the swine heart failing from incessant supraventricular tachycardia. The acute hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects of flecainide in tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction were investigated using an animal model. Seven swine were initially (CON) evaluated by echocardiography and then by right heart catheterization and provocative electrical ventricular stimulation both before and after treatment with intravenous flecainide. Rapid atrial pacing at 210 to 240 beats/min (SVT) was then employed for 2 to 4 weeks until echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction developed. Immediately upon termination of pacing, the above studies were repeated both before and after treatment with flecainide. Significant (p less than 0.0001) pacing-related hemodynamic effects on the cardiac output (CON:3.0 L/min versus SVT:1.6 L/min), right ventricular ejection fraction (CON:55% versus SVT:17%), and pulmonary wedge pressure (CON:8 mm Hg versus SVT:22 mm Hg) were observed. Pacing-related electrophysiologic effects included increases in the PR interval (CON:94 msec versus SVT:119 msec, p less than 0.001) and QTc interval (CON:418 msec versus SVT:450 msec, p = 0.016). With serum flecainide concentrations in the human therapeutic range, no significant effect on hemodynamic or electrophysiologic parameters in either the normal or failing heart were detected. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia induced prior to pacing in one animal and after pacing in another animal was seen before but not following use of flecainide. No acute proarrhythmic effects were observed. In summary, intravenous flecainide had no significant acute adverse hemodynamic, electrophysiologic, or proarrhythmic effects in an animal model of tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction. 
Coronary thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Intracoronary vs intravenous administration. We employed a canine model of coronary thrombosis, induced by injection of radioactive blood clot, via a catheter placed in the left anterior descending coronary artery, to compare effects of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) administered intravenously and administered directly into the coronary circulation. A control group did not receive rtPA. Compared with controls, both rtPA regimens induced coronary thrombolysis. However, compared with intravenous administration, rate and extent of coronary thrombolysis were increased with intracoronary administration. Most likely, the enhanced thrombolysis with intracoronary administration is explained by an increase in delivery of the drug to the thrombus. 
Aztreonam plus clindamycin versus tobramycin plus clindamycin in the treatment of intraabdominal infections. In a multicenter, randomized clinical trial, aztreonam and tobramycin were compared for efficacy and safety in the treatment of intraabdominal infections. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the drug regimens, and all but two patients were treated concomitantly with clindamycin. Efficacy of treatment could not be evaluated for 107 of the 316 patients enrolled in the study. Among the 209 patients who could be evaluated (104 treated with aztreonam and 105 with tobramycin), microbiologic cure was achieved in 93% and 86%, respectively, and a favorable clinical response was noted in 85% of the patients in both groups. The frequency of adverse drug reactions in the two groups was similar. In this study, the efficacy and safety profiles of aztreonam plus clindamycin were comparable to those of tobramycin plus clindamycin. 
Lumbar facet fracture as a possible source of pain after lumbar laminectomy. This study compared 50 patients with lumbar facet fractures and continued pain after lumbar laminectomy with a postlaminectomy control group without facet fractures. Computed tomographic analysis compared variables including direct measurements of bone resection. Average follow-up between surgery and postsurgical computed tomographic examination was 3.2 years. In the fracture group, more than one half of the bone immediately above the flare of the inferior articular process at the level of the laminectomy, measured in a medial to lateral direction, had been resected. No one in the control group had more than one quarter of this bone removed (P = .0001). Lumbar facet fractures may be one cause of late postlaminectomy pain. Caution in resection of a particular area of bone may avoid this problem. 
Cardiac manifestations of acquired immune deficiency syndrome: a 1991 update. Cardiac involvement is being identified more often clinically and at autopsy in patients with AIDS. Recent estimates suggest that in the United States as many as 5000 patients per year may have cardiac complications resulting from HIV infection. Patients with AIDS may have pericardial, myocardial, and/or endocardial disease. Pericardial tamponade and/or constriction may be related to neoplasms, infections, or nonspecific effusions. Myocardial dysfunction may result from specific neoplastic infiltration or myocarditis. Particularly intriguing is the role of HIV-1 in the nonspecific myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy that occurs in patients with AIDS. As in other debilitating conditions patients with AIDS can have nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. Infective endocarditis may be a complication, especially in AIDS associated with intravenous drug abuse. Most patients with AIDS have no overt clinical evidence of cardiac disease. When cardiac dysfunction does develop, the signs and symptoms are often misinterpreted to be the result of noncardiac causes (pulmonary failure or infection) which can mimic heart failure. This review is intended to alert the reader to the cardiac manifestations of AIDS, which present a number of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. 
Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants do not change the prevalence of necrosis and regeneration in mdx skeletal muscles. Therapeutic doses of methylprednisolone, azathioprine, cyclosporin A, and cyclophosphamide administered to mdx mice between 15 and 45 days of age failed to significantly influence the time course and prevalence of necrosis and regeneration or serum creatine kinase activity. This finding contrasts with previously reported findings of beneficial effects of glucocorticoids in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This may indicate that, mechanisms upon which beneficial effects of glucocorticoids depend in DMD, do not operate (sufficiently) in mdx mice. 
Barrier function regulates epidermal DNA synthesis. We examined the possibility that the cutaneous permeability barrier regulates epidermal DNA synthesis in two acute and two chronic models of barrier perturbation. In animals treated topically with acetone, DNA synthesis is increased 102%, in tape-stripped animals 127%, in essential fatty acid deficient animals 50%, and in animals chronically treated with topical lovastatin 64%. This linkage between disturbances in barrier function and increased DNA synthesis is further supported by specific and correlative observations: (a) in these disparate models, artificial replacement of the barrier with a water-impermeable membrane inhibits the expected increase in DNA synthesis; (b) the extent of the burst in DNA synthesis is proportional to the degree of barrier abrogation; (c) the inhibition of DNA synthesis by membranes is directly related to the degree of permeability of these occlusive membranes, i.e., the more impermeable the greater the degree of inhibition; (d) topical treatment with lipids that restore barrier function corrects the increase in DNA synthesis; and (e) barrier abrogation with acetone produces an increase in epidermal DNA synthesis without altering bulk protein synthetic rates in contrast to events known to follow injury or cell replacement. Autoradiographic studies show that the increase in DNA synthesis after acetone treatment is limited to the epidermal basal layer. This constellation of findings strongly suggests that cutaneous barrier function is one factor that regulates epidermal DNA synthesis. 
Alcohol ablation of atrioventricular conduction Transcoronary ablation of atrioventricular conduction by dehydrated alcohol was attempted in 14 patients with refractory atrial arrhythmias. Alcohol (0.5 or 1.0 ml) was delivered after selective catheterisation of the atrioventricular nodal artery in the 10 patients in whom the artery could be identified by cineangiography. The other four patients underwent electrical ablation when the nodal artery could not be catheterised. Temporary atrioventricular block induced by dilute contrast and cold saline (0.9%) confirmed that the catheter was in the correct position before the alcohol was delivered. In all 10 patients complete atrioventricular block developed after alcohol ablation. The block persisted in all four patients given 1.0 ml alcohol but not in four of the six given 0.5 ml. The mean (SD) creatine kinase (MB fraction) at four to six hours after ablation was 76.5 (49.5) IU after 1.0 ml and 75.5 (43.1) IU after 0.5 ml alcohol (normal less than 20 IU). The overall success rate of alcohol ablation in the whole group on an "intention to treat" basis was 43%. The procedure was a technical success in six of the 10 patients in whom the nodal artery was identified. Transcoronary alcohol ablation of atrioventricular conduction should be considered in patients in whom electrical techniques have been unsuccessful. 
Absence of the medial malleolus. A case report with a 20-year follow-up study. This may be the second case report of the absence of the medial malleolus in the orthopedic literature. A six-year-old girl had an open fracture with a loss of the medial malleolus. During the 20-year follow-up study, she had no instability of the ankle, as in the first report, but after time she developed degenerative arthritis in the tibiotalar articulation. 
Portal venous barium intravasation complicating barium enema examination. Venous intravasation of contrast is a potentially life-threatening complication of the barium enema examination. A patient in whom portal venous contrast intravasation was nearly fatal is presented, and the significant morbidity and mortality from this unusual event is reviewed. Since barium infiltration into the venous system almost always occurs in the setting of altered mucosal integrity, this examination should be used cautiously in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulitis. Prompt recognition and rapid resuscitation are critical to the survival of patients with contrast intravasation. 
Breast reconstruction utilizing subcutaneous tissue expansion followed by polyurethane-covered silicone implants: a 6-year experience. Reconstruction of the breast after modified radical mastectomy can be safely and adequately performed in the subcutaneous plane. Placement of a subcutaneous tissue expander (as either an immediate or a delayed procedure), rapid expansion over a 3- to 4-month period, capsulotomy, and placement of a polyurethane-coated implant have led to satisfactory results over a 6-year period. Breast reconstruction methods are well documented; however, the utilization of expanded subcutaneous chest wall skin has not been reported heretofore. 
Invasive cutaneous melanoma in elderly patients. Clinical and pathologic variables were compared between "older" (greater than or equal to 70 years) and "younger" (30 to 39 years) patients with primary invasive cutaneous melanoma. Older patients had more nodular melanomas and acral lentiginous melanomas (58%); superficial spreading melanomas predominated in younger patients (74%). Mean tumor thickness was greater in the older patients (3.95 vs 2.02 mm). Invasive levels 2 and 3 occurred more often in younger patients (41.1% vs 13%); level 5 occurred more often in older patients (30.4% vs 5.3%). Microscopic ulceration occurred more often in older (46.4%) than in younger patients (19.4%). Older patients classified as clinical stage I at presentation or with primary lesions 1.50- to 3.00-mm thick had poorer survival. Younger women survived longer than younger men; this was not true of older patients. The elderly patients with cutaneous melanoma were more likely to have poor prognostic features and thus more likely to die from melanoma than the younger patients. 
Malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis. Malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis is an extremely rare tumor. Appropriate treatment consists of inquinal orchiectomy with close followup. Treatment of locally recurrent malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis has not been standardized. We recommend radical resection for the initial presentation of locally recurrent disease rather than saving surgical resection as salvage therapy after other treatment modalities have failed. We report case 37 of malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis and review the literature. 
Sciatic nerve entrapment in a child. Case report. A child was brought for evaluation of signs of unilateral chronic progressive sciatic nerve dysfunction found to be due to nerve entrapment in the thigh by a fibrovascular band. Sectioning of the band was followed by marked improvement in the nerve function. Compression by a band is a rare but treatable cause of sciatic neuropathy. 
Collagen vascular diseases of childhood. This article is devoted to collagen vascular diseases of childhood. The connective tissue diseases that are discussed are lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and dermatomyositis. Of the vasculitic syndromes, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy, and polyarteritis nodosa are discussed. Although the collagen vascular diseases are rare in the pediatric age group, when they occur they can be very serious. 
Outpatient dacryocystorhinostomy. We report 105 dacryocystorhinostomy procedures in 87 patients performed on an outpatient basis. Seventy-six patients received local, and 29 received general, anesthesia. The patients left the hospital an average of 2.6 hours after surgery, but 14 were admitted after surgery--9 immediately, and 5 after some delay, primarily for epistaxis. There were no serious complications related to the outpatient nature of the surgery. The success rate was 94%. We conclude that outpatient dacryocystorhinostomy is successful, well accepted by patients, and safe, provided that inpatient care facilities are readily available should they be needed. 
Blood pressure as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The Framingham Study--30 years of follow-up Data from 30 years of follow-up of the original Framingham Study cohort of 5,070 men and women aged 30-62 years who were first examined during the period 1948-1952 and who were free of cardiovascular disease reveal that blood pressure is a strong and consistent predictor of the development of coronary heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and congestive heart failure. Other factors related to blood pressure like obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy as demonstrated on electrocardiograms, and heart enlargement as shown by x-ray radiography made several selective additional independent contributions to risk; heart enlargement by x-ray radiography was the best predictor of congestive heart failure. 
Binding sites for P and/or type 1-piliated Escherichia coli in human ureter. Adherence sites for uropathogenic Escherichia coli in the excised human ureter were studied by using scanning electron microscopy. P-piliated E. coli adhered to younger epithelial cells which had microvilli on their surfaces, but did not to mature epithelial cells which had microfolds on their surfaces. This adherence was D-mannose resistant and alpha-D-Galactopyranosyl-(1----4)- beta-D-Galactopyranoside sensitive. Type-1 piliated E. coli adhered to both types of epithelial cells, but it was prevented by D-mannose. Entrapment of adherent type 1-piliated E. coli was observed only on the epithelial cells with microfolds. This model system allowed quantitative estimates of bacterial adherence to the luminal surface of the human ureteral mucosa in vitro, and demonstrated different manners of adherence of P and type 1-piliated E. coli. 
Importance of antithrombin therapy during coronary angioplasty. Angioplasty procedures with balloons, cutters or lasers all may greatly enlarge the arterial lumen, but luminal diameter may decrease because of mural thrombus in 70% to 80%, smooth muscle proliferation, vasoconstriction or recoil. Thrombin binds to arterial wall matrix and fibrin within a thrombus. Heparin dose-dependently decreases platelet and thrombus deposition but does not eliminate these even at high doses. Specific thrombin inhibition started before angioplasty experimentally prevents mural thrombus and limits platelet deposition to a single layer or less. Experimentally, anticoagulant and antifibrin effects occur at lower antithrombin blood levels and lower activated partial thromboplastin times (1.7 times control). Because platelets are so sensitive to thrombin, the higher level of thrombin inhibition required may occur at a specific level (activated partial thromboplastin time greater than or equal to 2 times control); this is not defined in humans. The duration of therapy is not defined in animals or humans. Thrombus and thrombin may be related to cellular proliferation. 
Analysis of the colonoscopic findings in patients with rectal bleeding according to the pattern of their presenting symptoms. Patients presenting with rectal bleeding were prospectively categorized according to the pattern of their presentation into those with outlet bleeding (n = 115), suspicious bleeding (n = 59), hemorrhage (n = 27), and occult bleeding (n = 68). All patients underwent colonoscopy and this was complete in 94 percent. There were 34 patients with carcinoma and 69 with adenomas greater than 1 cm diameter. The percentage of neoplasms proximal to the splenic flexure was 1 percent in outlet bleeding, 24 percent with suspicious bleeding, 75 percent with hemorrhage, and 73 percent with occult bleeding. Barium enema was available in 78 patients and was falsely positive for neoplasms in 21 percent and falsely negative in 45 percent. Colonoscopy is the investigation of choice in patients with suspicious, occult, or severe rectal bleeding. Bleeding of a typical outlet pattern may be investigated by flexible sigmoidoscopy. 
Antibodies against dengue viral proteins in primary and secondary dengue hemorrhagic fever. Antibodies against dengue viral proteins were demonstrated in sera from dengue-infected patients by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and enzyme immunoassay. Primary dengue cases showed low titers of IgG class antibodies to envelope (E) proteins and two non-structural proteins, NS3 and NS5, in sera collected during the convalescent phase. Secondary dengue- infected patients always demonstrated IgG antibodies to E proteins in sera collected during the acute phase, and high titers of IgG antibodies to many other proteins, including NS1, NS3, NS5, and C proteins in sera collected during the convalescent phase. Appearance of antibodies to E, NS3, and NS5 could be detected within five days after the onset of fever. These three dengue viral proteins and their corresponding antibodies may be involved in the immunopathologic mechanism underlying this disease. For diagnostic purposes, identifying the non-structural proteins such as NS3 and NS5 may be the best means for early confirmation of the disease. 
The spectrum of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Report of six pediatric cases and review of the literature. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract with eosinophilic leukocytes, accompanied by varying abdominal symptoms and usually by peripheral blood eosinophilia. We report our experience with six pediatric cases presenting to the Cleveland Clinic Foundation over the past eight years. Unusual findings in our patients included ascitic fluid without eosinophilia and eosinophilic pericarditis (one patient), and eosinophilic cholecystitis (one patient). Endoscopic examination and biopsy helped to establish the diagnosis in all patients. Bone marrow aspiration supported the diagnosis by demonstrating eosinophilia and identifying reactivation of the disease, even in cases without peripheral eosinophilia. All six patients responded promptly to prednisone. Diagnosis is challenging and eosinophilic gastroenteritis may be more common than is recognized. This series of cases significantly expands the spectrum of the disease in children, and documents the usefulness of diagnostic endoscopy in this condition. 
Ca2(+)-sensitive binding of thrombospondin to U937 cells is due to the formation of calcium precipitate in the binding medium. Thrombospondin (TSP) binds to U937 monocytic cells in a Ca2(+)-enhancible and EDTA-inhibitable manner (Silverstein, R. L., and R. L. Nachman. 1987. J. Clin. Invest. 79:867-874; Silverstein, R. L., A. S. Asch, and R. L. Nachman. 1989. J. Clin. Invest. 84:546-552). We reproduced the results when RPMI cell culture medium, but not when HBSS was used as binding medium. Addition of 1 mM Ca2+ to RPMI medium increased the binding of TSP to suspended U937 cells more than eightfold; the increase was blocked by EDTA but not by heparin. Further studies showed that addition of 1 mM Ca2+ to RPMI medium resulted in an insoluble precipitate, which did not form when EDTA was present or when 1 mM extra Ca2+ was added to HBSS. TSP bound to the precipitate in a saturable and specific manner. The precipitate enhanced binding of TSP to MG63 osteosarcoma cells in a monolayer binding assay. Enhancement of binding in the monolayer assay was observed for fibronectin and vitronectin as well. Our data indicate that there is not a specific Ca2(+)-dependent TSP receptor on U937 cell surface. Instead, the extra binding enhanced by Ca2+ is due to the formation of insoluble salts in the medium. 
Postural change in blood pressure associated with age and systolic blood pressure. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II. The prevalence of postural change in blood pressure and its association with age and systolic blood pressure were examined in data from 8,574 White nondiabetic persons aged 25-74 who participated in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1976-1980). Postural change in blood pressure was defined as a drop of 20 mm Hg or more on change from supine to seated position. In subjects on no antihypertensive medications (n = 7,316), the prevalence of postural change in blood pressure increased with older age and with higher blood pressure levels, regardless of age. However, systolic blood pressure levels also increased with age. In logistic regression models, level of supine systolic blood pressure was strongly related to postural change in blood pressure (Relative odds (RO) = 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.49, 1.70 for a 10 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure) whereas age was not related to postural change in blood pressure (RO for age = 1.07, Cl = .89, 1.19 for a 10-year increase in age). Results were similar for those medicated for hypertension. All results were unchanged by addition of health status indicators, including reports of hospitalization and number of medical conditions, to the model. These data suggest that the age-related increase in the prevalence of postural hypotension previously reported may be partially explained by age-associated increases in systolic blood pressure. 
Salmonella enteritidis gastroenteritis transmitted by intact chicken eggs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the source and to describe the clinical importance of a large outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis gastroenteritis in Tennessee, which is outside the geographic focus of the S. enteritidis pandemic. DESIGN: A case-control study and tracing of the source eggs. SETTING: A Tennessee community and a large layer farm in Indiana. PATIENTS: Case patients ate at the implicated restaurant and subsequently developed S. enteritidis gastroenteritis; controls ate with the case patients, but did not develop gastroenteritis. MEASUREMENTS: Eighty-one case patients were identified; 73 (90%) had eaten egg-containing sauces at a local restaurant on a given evening. The eggs were traced to their farm of origin in Indiana. The farm was inspected 5 weeks after the outbreak. MAIN RESULTS: Of 24 patients with culture-proved cases, 11 were hospitalized. Hollandaise and bernaise sauces prepared with intact, extra-large, grade-A eggs were strongly associated with illness (P less than 0.001). Salmonella enteritidis was isolated from specimens collected from chickens and the farm. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, phage typing, and plasmid profiles of isolates from the farm and from patients were indistinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: Salmonella enteritidis infection is a large and growing public health problem that is spreading beyond the northeastern United States. This study shows a direct link between infected poultry flocks and an outbreak of human illness. 
Vasodilatory capacity of the skin in venous disease and its relationship to transcutaneous oxygen tension. Low transcutaneous oxygen tension (Ptc,O2) values in the supramalleolar skin of patients with venous disease are often reported. This measurement involves heating the skin to 43 degrees C to cause maximum vasodilatation and is valid only if liposclerotic and normal skin can vasodilate to the same degree. Forty-four limbs were studied, 15 with lipodermatosclerosis (LDS), 14 with uncomplicated varicose veins, and 15 controls. A Ptc,O2 electrode was modified to incorporate a laser Doppler probe. Laser Doppler flux was measured in the supramalleolar skin before and after local heating to 43 degrees C and the relative increase in flux was measured. The Ptc,O2 was then measured at the same site and on the chest. Vasodilatory capacity was expressed as the ratio of peak:basal laser Doppler flow, and the Ptc,O2 was expressed as a leg:chest ratio. Median laser Doppler flow was higher in limbs with LDS (median 67 mV) than in normal limbs (median 40 mV) (P less than 0.03). Ptc,O2 was higher in control limbs (median ratio 0.94) than in limbs with LDS (median 0.53) (P less than 0.006). The microcirculation in LDS had less capacity to vasodilate after heating (median factor of increase 5.4) than normal skin (median factor of increase 12.3) (P less than 0.001). A simple regression analysis was performed on all pairs of data, and revealed a correlation between Ptc,O2 and vasodilatory capacity (r = 0.524, P less than 0.001). The results indicate that low Ptc,O2 levels in venous disease reflect an inability of the microcirculation to increase its flow in response to local heating; inferences about the oxygen content of liposclerotic skin at normal temperatures cannot be drawn using this technique. 
Epicardial mapping in patients with "nodoventricular" accessory pathways. Some patients with electrophysiologic features suggesting nodoventricular fibers have been shown to have right parietal atrioventricular (AV) accessory pathways with decremental conduction properties intraoperatively. The experience with 11 patients (7 women and 4 men, mean age +/- standard deviation 25 +/- 5 years) who had electrophysiologic features consistent with a nodoventricular pathway and who underwent operative correction was reviewed. At electrophysiologic study, all patients had absent or minimal preexcitation in sinus rhythm. During atrial pacing and extrastimulus testing, maximal preexcitation with left bundle branch block morphology developed and the AH and AV intervals progressively prolonged. Preexcited tachycardia was initiated in all patients (AV reentrant tachycardia in 10 patients and AV node reentrant tachycardia in 1 patient). At operation all patients had a right parietal accessory pathway demonstrated. Intraoperative mapping demonstrated the earliest site of ventricular activation during anterograde preexcitation to be at the midanterior right ventricle, consistent with insertion of these pathways into the right bundle branch system, in 7 patients. The ventricular insertion was at the AV groove in 4 patients, in keeping with the typical Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Retrograde conduction over the pathway was not demonstrated in any patient. Two patients had evidence of a second accessory AV pathway in the left paraseptal region. Operative AV node ablation was electively performed in 2 patients without affecting preexcitation in either case. In 1 of these patients, accessory pathway conduction was temporarily abolished by ice mapping in the right anterolateral AV groove. 
A population-based perspective of the hospital incidence and case-fatality rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The Worcester DVT Study. A community-wide study was conducted in 16 short-stay hospitals in metropolitan Worcester, Mass, to examine the incidence and case-fatality rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients hospitalized between July 1, 1985, and December 31, 1986. The average annual incidence of deep vein thrombosis alone was 48 per 100,000, while the incidence of pulmonary embolism with or without deep vein thrombosis was 23 per 100,000. The incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism increased exponentially with age. The in-hospital case-fatality rate of venous thromboembolism was 12%. Among patients discharged from the hospital, the long-term case-fatality rates were 19%, 25%, and 30% at 1, 2, and 3 years after hospital discharge. Extrapolation of the data from this population-based study suggests that there are approximately 170,000 new cases of clinically recognized venous thromboembolism in patients treated in short-stay hospitals in the United States each year, and 99,000 hospitalizations for recurrent disease. Because of the silent nature of this disease and the low rate of autopsy in the United States, the total incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of venous thromboembolism remain elusive. 
Heart rate patterns in fetuses exposed to cocaine. Heart rate patterns of 42 fetuses exposed to cocaine near the time of delivery were compared with patterns in 42 controls. Decreased long-term variability and an increased frequency of contractions were observed more often in the cocaine group (P = .046 and P = .0306, respectively). There were no significant differences in the frequency of fetal tachycardia or decelerations. Although accelerations were less frequent in cocaine-exposed fetuses, the difference compared with controls was not statistically significant. We found no characteristic heart rate pattern in fetuses exposed to cocaine near delivery. The heart rate patterns likely represent the underlying state of fetal oxygenation. Frequent contractions in an unstimulated labor should raise suspicions of maternal cocaine use. 
Prevention of cisplatin-induced emesis: a double-blind multicenter randomized crossover study comparing ondansetron and ondansetron plus dexamethasone. Ondansetron (OND) is a new 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that give complete protection from emesis/nausea in approximately 50% of cisplatin (CDDP)-treated patients. To evaluate if dexamethasone (DEX) added to OND increases antiemetic efficacy, we carried out a double-blind randomized crossover study to compare the antiemetic activity of OND with OND plus DEX. One hundred two chemotherapy-naive patients (44 women and 58 men) scheduled to receive CDDP chemotherapy at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2 entered the study. Eighty-nine patients completed both cycles with the following results: complete protection from emesis/nausea was obtained in 57/59 patients (64.0%/66.3%) with OND and in 81/79 (91.0%/88.8%) with OND plus DEX (P = .0005/P = .0021). At the end of the study, 53% of the patients expressed a treatment preference, and of these, 74% chose OND plus DEX compared with 26% who preferred OND alone, a statistically significant difference (P less than .003). Side effects were very mild and not significantly different between the two treatments. We conclude that OND plus DEX is more efficacious than OND in protecting patients from CDDP-induced emesis and nausea. 
Transinguinal dissection of the femoral artery for aorto-bifemoral bypass. The authors report a surgical technique for high approach to the common femoral artery, just below the inguinal ligament, which can be useful in cases of difficult dissection of the femoral region or those with diffuse fibrosis or multiple scars. It is also useful when there is a concomitant inguinal hernia to repair. 
A phase I/II study of trichosanthin treatment of HIV disease Trichosanthin, a ribosomal inhibitor protein, blocks HIV replication in lymphocytes and macrophages. This agent was used to treat 51 patients with advanced HIV disease in a dose-escalation study in which three injections were administered over a 9-21-day period in a dose range of 10-30 micrograms/kg per injection. The maximum tolerated dose was estimated to be 30 micrograms/kg. Reversible but severe fatigue and myalgias were the major dose-limiting side-effects; mild leucocytosis and elevations in serum transaminases were noted and were reversible. Non-dose-related reversible mental status changes were seen in six patients and were considered to be associated with the drug. This was usually manifest as dementia, but progressed to coma in two patients. This reversed, but the sequelae resulted in death in one patient. Decreases in serum p24 antigen levels were noted 1 month after the first infusion in 10 of 18 patients who entered the study with elevated levels; one converted to negative. Values usually remained low to the end of the study period (2 months). In those patients with CD4+ cell levels greater than 50 x 10(6) cells/l significant decreases in sedimentation rate and increases in CD4+ cell numbers were also noted. These changes were found at all dose levels but only in patients receiving three infusions. 
Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy during maximal coronary artery vasodilation with adenosine. Pharmacologic coronary vasodilation as an adjunct to thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy provides an important alternative form of stress that has been increasingly used in patients unable to perform an exercise stress test. Although dipyridamole has traditionally been used for this purpose, there are several compelling reasons why adenosine may be a preferable agent. First, dipyridamole acts by blocking the reuptake and transport of adenosine, which is the effective substance responsible for coronary vasodilation. Second, exogenous adenosine has a very short half-life (less than 2 seconds), which explains its very short duration of action as well as the brief, self-limiting duration of its side effects. Third, the adenosine infusion is controllable and may be increased or decreased as desired. Fourth, the coronary vasodilation induced by the doses of adenosine we recommend (140 micrograms/kg/min) may be more profound than that induced by the standard dipyridamole dose. Our experience to date, with nearly 1,000 patients studied, shows the adenosine thallium-201 test to be practical and well tolerated, with high sensitivity (87%) and specificity (94%) for detecting coronary artery disease. 
Multiple keratoacanthomas: a case report with evidence of regression with thymic hormone. A case of multiple keratoacanthomas (KAs) arising on sun-damaged skin in a 63-year-old male is reported. The patient showed a moderate elevation of the T-helper/T-suppressor ratio. Therapy with thymic hormone appeared to improve the condition. 
Malignant colorectal strictures in Crohn's disease. One hundred thirty-two of 980 patients (13.5%) with Crohn's disease (CD) involving the colon, admitted to The Mount Sinai Hospital between 1959 and 1985, developed 175 colonic strictures. Thirty-three patients developed more than one stricture. The frequency was twice as great in colitis (19%) as in ileocolitis (11%). Ten malignant strictures were identified in nine patients (three ileocolitis, six colitis). One of these patients had three strictures (two malignant, and one benign), and two had two strictures (one malignant and one benign). The frequency of cancer in patients with stricture (6.8%) was higher than in those without stricture (0.7%, six of 848, p less than 0.001). There were no differences in clinical symptoms between patients with benign and malignant stricture. Seventeen of 165 benign strictures (10.3%) were long, extending over more than one anatomical segment of colon, but all 10 malignant strictures were short (p less than 0.0001). The age at the diagnosis of stricture was higher in the nine patients with malignant stricture than in the 123 patients with benign stricture (mean age 57.2 vs. 41.4 yr, respectively, p less than 0.01). The proportion of strictures that were malignant increased with duration of disease from 3.3% with less than 20 yr of CD, to 11% with CD of 20 yr or more. All nine patients with malignant stricture were treated surgically, and four of the nine died of colon cancer during a mean follow-up of 4.3 yr. Prognosis was worse in six other nonstricture cancers in this series, with five colon cancer deaths during mean follow-up of 1.6 yr. In view of the high rate of malignancy, 6.8% in this series, colonoscopy with biopsy is essential in Crohn's disease patients with colonic strictures, and surgery must be considered when a stricture cannot be fully assessed during colonoscopy. 
Congenital malignant melanoma. A case is reported of congenital malignant melanoma that occurred in the absence of maternal melanoma or a congenital giant naevus. The patient had the melanoma on the left thigh excised 54 days after birth, but later died at the age of 18 months with multiple metastases. 
Effect of aspirin on heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty in men who have osteoarthrosis. The severity of heterotopic ossification was determined from the radiographs of eighty-three men in whom osteoarthrosis had been treated with a primary total hip arthroplasty with cement. The medical records of these patients were then reviewed, with the reviewer having no knowledge of the radiographic findings. A similar operative approach and technique had been used in all patients. There was no association between the amount of intraoperative loss of blood or the duration of the operation and the severity of formation of heterotopic bone. The over-all rate of occurrence of heterotopic ossification was 72 per cent. Of the fifty-eight patients who had received aspirin throughout their course in the hospital, two (3 per cent) had severe ectopic ossification (grade III or IV8). In contrast, twelve (48 per cent) of the twenty-five patients who had received no aspirin or in whom aspirin had been discontinued so that anticoagulation could be begun had severe heterotopic ossification. The difference in the severity of the ossification between the two groups is significant (p less than 0.0001). 
Clinical aspects of 100 patients with Kawasaki disease. We report 101 episodes of Kawasaki disease in 100 patients seen over a 12 year period. A total of 35 patients had cardiac involvement ranging from pericardial effusion to coronary artery aneurysms with ischaemic complications, which resulted in death in one patient. Laboratory investigations showed leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, and a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate to be common features and the first two variables were significantly associated with cardiac involvement. Treatment regimens changed over the study period. Aspirin was used in most patients often in conjunction with dipyridamole and from 1986 intravenous immunoglobulin was given routinely to those patients seen early in the illness. Additional therapeutic measures in individual patients included prostacyclin, heparin, streptokinase, and plasma exchange/exchange transfusion. Attention is drawn to the uncertainity of the long term cardiovascular consequences in the light of adults reported with premature atherosclerotic lesions of similar appearance to those seen in Kawasaki disease. 
Colorectal smooth-muscle tumors. A pathobiologic study with immunohistochemistry and histomorphometry. Smooth-muscle tumors are an interesting group of tumors that show considerable site specificity in their pathobiology. Recent work has also shown that some previously so-called smooth-muscle tumors were not, in fact, truly leiomyogenic, hence the origin of the more embracing term stromal tumors. The purpose of this retrospective study was to delineate the tumor subsets constituting colorectal stromal tumors, and to determine the histopathologic correlates for biologic aggressiveness for these tumors. The cohort was constituted of 12 patients; the mean follow-up was 6.6 years with a median of 5.0 years. Immunohistochemical evaluations showed tumoral positivity for muscle-specific actin (12 of 12), vimentin (11 of 12), desmin (two of 12), and S100 protein (zero of 12). Electron microscopic examinations corroborated this leiomyogenicity profile (five of five). Semiquantitative histomorphometric analysis showed that tumor size, cellularity, mitoses, and necrosis, in that order, correlated with biologic aggressiveness. The immunohistochemistry results for this cohort of colorectal stromal tumors vindicated the traditional histochemical evaluations in that all tumors showed features of leiomyogenicity. For colorectal smooth-muscle tumors, tumor size appears to be the best predictor for biologic aggressiveness. This study reinforces the concept of site-specificity for smooth-muscle tumors. 
Myocardial fibrosis in aging germ-free and conventional Lobund-Wistar rats: the protective effect of diet restriction. The influences of diet restriction and germ-free environment on aging were studied in 127 male Lobund-Wistar rats ranging in age from 7 to 48 months. There was an age-related increase in collagen deposition of the heart, particularly involving the left ventricle. The degree of fibrosis was significantly less extensive in middle and old age rats (18 mo, 30 mo, 32+ mo) maintained on a restricted diet. No clear-cut influence of germ-free environment was apparent. No amyloid was detected in 175 tissue sections examined from hearts, lungs, and livers. 
Comparison of allografts and prosthetic valves when used for emergency aortic valve replacement for active infective endocarditis. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) using allografts is an established method of treating aortic valve disease. It is uncertain, however, whether the increased technical demands of allograft AVR can be justified in emergency operations. This study reports 15 patients treated between 1987 and 1990 for acute bacterial or fungal endocarditis involving the aortic valve. Patients underwent emergency AVR because of severe congestive failure, overwhelming sepsis or cerebral emboli. Eight patients received prosthetic valves (group I: 4 mechanical, 4 porcine) and 7 received human allografts (group II: 5 aortic and 2 pulmonary). The groups were comparable in age (group I, 55 years; group II, 51 years), intravenous drug abuse (group I, 1; group II, 3), and previous AVR (group I, 3; group II, 2). One group I and 4 group II patients had septal abscesses. Additional procedures in group I included mitral valve replacement (2), tricuspid valve replacement (1) and aortic root replacement (1). Additional procedures in group II were mitral valve repair (1), root replacement (1), atrial septal defect closure (1) and aortocoronary bypass (1). Mean bypass times (group I, 189 minutes; group II, 204 minutes) and cross-clamp times (group I; 108 minutes; group II, 121 minutes) were similar. Operative deaths occurred in 4 of 8 group I and 1 of 7 group II patients. All surviving patients have been successfully followed (group I, 28 months; group II, 18 months). No group I patient has required reoperation. One group II patients required reoperation for recurrent infection affecting the allograft, and another group II patient died 10 months postoperatively from noncardiac causes. 
Atrial regulation of intravascular volume: observations on the tachycardia-polyuria syndrome. The atria, strategically located at the junction of the venous and arterial circulation, contain a network of neural and humoral structures by which they sense and regulate intravascular volume. Atrial receptors, most commonly consisting of complex unencapsulated nerve endings discharging into myelinated vagal fibers, are located in the intrapericardial portions of the caval and pulmonary veins and the adjacent atrial walls. Receptor activation by atrial distension results in increased afferent vagal fiber discharge, which in turn leads to tachycardia (Bainbridge's reflex) and decreased renal sympathetic nerve activity, renal vasomotor tone, and antidiuretic hormone activity. In addition, atrial distension also releases ANF, a peptide with potent diuretic, natriuretic, and vasorelaxant actions. The combined effect of these neurohumoral changes is the production of a large hypotonic diuresis. In the clinical setting the volume-regulating role of the atria is demonstrated by the tachycardia-polyuria syndrome. Laboratory and clinical evidence points to the activation of atrial neurohumoral mechanisms in response to atrial distension as the mediators of the polyuria that often accompanies paroxysmal tachycardias. The involvement of these mechanisms in other forms of cardiac congestion and the capability to easily measure in the blood an index of atrial distension, namely ANF, provide the opportunity to elucidate the pathophysiology and hence to open new therapeutic avenues in many cardiac disorders. 
Swallowing disorders and nutritional support. Evaluation of nutritional needs in patients with swallowing disorders should include a global assessment. This includes a nutritional assessment, a determination of the metabolic state, and a separation of the causes of nutrient deficits due to the patient's underlying disease(s) from diminished nutrient intake related to the dysphagia. Techniques for intense nutritional support are surveyed, and the complications of each are discussed. 
Promoting cancer prevention activities by primary care physicians. Results of a randomized, controlled trial. BACKGROUND. Previous interventions to promote performance of cancer prevention activities have largely targeted physicians in university-based practices. METHODS. We randomly assigned 40 primary care physicians in community-based practices to either (1) Cancer Prevention Reminders, computer-generated lists of overdue screening tests, and smoking and dietary assessment and counseling, supplemented by cancer education materials; or (2) controls. For each physician, we reviewed a random sample of 60 medical records for data about screening test, assessment, and counseling performance during 12-month preintervention and intervention periods. We calculated performance scores as percentage compliance with American Cancer Society and/or National Cancer Institute recommendations. Multiple regression analyses provided estimates of incremental differences in performance scores between intervention and control groups. RESULTS. Controlling for preintervention performance levels, significant incremental differences in performance scores between intervention and control groups (P less than .05) were achieved for nine maneuvers: stool occult-blood test, +14.5; rectal examination, +10.5; pelvic examination, +11.8; Papanicolaou's smear, +30.7; breast examination, +8.7; smoking assessment, +10.2; smoking counseling, +17.3; dietary assessment, +12.3; and dietary counseling, +13.9. Increments for sigmoidoscopy and mammography were not significant. CONCLUSION. Computerized reminders can significantly increase physicians' performance of cancer prevention activities in community-based practices. 
Prognostic parameters in spontaneous intracerebral hematomas with special reference to anticoagulant treatment. We examined a series of 200 consecutive patients with spontaneous intracerebral hematoma clinically and by computed tomography, excluding patients with trauma, aneurysm, or tumor. Hematoma volume varied from 1 to 230 (average 35) ml, and overall mortality was 30% (60 patients). Of the 200 patients, 14% (28) were receiving anticoagulants; among these 28 patients hematoma volume averaged 72 ml and mortality 57% (16 patients). The 140 survivors were followed for 2-24 months. Our findings indicate that anticoagulation therapy after previous cerebral infarction or embolism of cardiogenic origin did not predispose to intracerebral hemorrhage. Prognosis was poor when the initial level of consciousness was low and the hematoma volume exceeded 50 ml in combination with dilatation of the contralateral ventricle. An intracerebral hematoma of greater than 80 ml volume was always fatal, regardless of therapy. With volumes of 40-80 ml, early surgical evacuation of the lobar hematoma may improve outcome. 
Association of sustained oxyhemoglobin desaturation and onset of cluster headache attacks. Ten episodic cluster headache patients in their active cluster period, ten patients in remission and five control subjects were monitored for minute to minute changes in oxygen saturation (SaO2) and pulse rate before and after nitroglycerin (NTG) administration. A transient but significant decrease in SaO2 and increase in pulse rate of 25 minutes duration occurred following NTG in all groups. These changes may reflect physiologic hemodynamic effects of NTG as a smooth muscle relaxant. Subsequently, SaO2 levels and pulse rate recovered to baseline values in remission and control groups. In contrast, SaO2 values in the active cluster group decreased further and after an extended period culminated in cluster headache attacks in 10/10 patients. Three major changes, therefore, distinguished active cluster patients from remission and control groups. First, the magnitude of oxygen desaturation increased after the physiological effects of NTG ceased. Second, oxygen desaturation was sustained for an additional 9 to 30 minutes duration. Third, the hypoxemic state culminated in attacks in all cases. Our findings suggest that the active cluster period may be characterized by an impaired mechanism to autoregulate, and thus compensate, for hypoxemia. It is further proposed that persistence of hypoxemia and the cluster attack onset may share a common mechanism, coupling the two events. We suggest that abnormal central and/or peripheral chemoreceptor activity may be responsible for these events. 
Comparison of breast carcinomas diagnosed in the 1980s with those diagnosed in the 1940s to 1960s. OBJECTIVE--To find out if breast carcinomas diagnosed in the 1980s differ from those diagnosed a few decades ago. DESIGN--Retrospective comparative cohort study. SETTING--City of Turku, south western Finland. PATIENTS--439 patients with breast carcinoma diagnosed in 1945-65 with a median follow up of 27 years (95% of all those histologically diagnosed in Turku); and 370 patients with breast carcinoma diagnosed in 1980-4 with a median follow up of 6 years (94% of all those histologically diagnosed in Turku). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Breast cancer incidence, mortality from breast cancer, age at diagnosis, stage of cancer, seven histological factors, DNA ploidy. RESULTS--Age adjusted incidence of breast cancer increased from 30.8/100,000 person years in 1953-7 to 62.2/100,000 in 1983-7; mortality in breast cancer increased from 16.7 to 17.2/100,000 person years. Survival of patients with stages II to IV (but not with stage I) improved. The mean age at diagnosis increased from 55.5 years in 1945-55 to 62.5 years in 1980-4 (p less than 0.0001); the proportion of patients with T0-1 carcinomas increased from 13% to 41% (p less than 0.0001) and with pN0 carcinomas from 43% to 55% (p = 0.003) from 1945-65 to 1980-4. There was no change in histological type or DNA ploidy of breast cancer, but in the 1980-4 cohort carcinomas were more often well differentiated, had lower mitotic counts and less nuclear pleomorphism, more often had a well defined tumour margin, and had less tumour necrosis. There was, however, no difference between the two cohorts in these histological characteristics except for tumour necrosis when they were compared in a multivariate log linear model at a given size of primary tumour. CONCLUSION--Improved survival with breast cancer can at least partially be explained by detection of increased numbers of small carcinomas with favourable histological characteristics. 
Usefulness of the nude mouse model in mesothelioma based on a direct patient-xenograft comparison. A patient with malignant mesothelioma experienced tumor recurrence 3 months after pleuropneumonectomy. Samples of the tumor were transplanted into nude mice to assess chemosensitivity. There was close concordance between the results in xenografts and the clinical outcome in this patient. Both mitomycin and to a lesser extent cisplatin were effective as single agents against the nude mouse xenografts, and the combination of these two drugs produced a complete response both in the patient and in the xenografts. The patient survived 18 months from onset of chemotherapy and 24 months from diagnosis. The duration of clinical complete response to chemotherapy was 14 months, despite the fact that mitomycin, the most effective agent against the xenografts, was discontinued after only two cycles because the patient developed pulmonary toxicity. This direct patient-xenograft correlation further validates the usefulness of the nude mouse model in the search for effective therapies for malignant mesothelioma, a tumor characterized by frequent refractoriness to most available agents. 
Chromosome translocation and c-MYC activation by Epstein-Barr virus and Euphorbia tirucalli in B lymphocytes. Dual exposure to Epstein-Barr virus and purified 4-deoxyphorbol ester derived from the plant Euphorbia tirucalli induced a high frequency of chromosomal rearrangements in human B lymphocytes in vitro. Rearrangements most commonly affected chromosome 8, the chromosome most often showing structural changes in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells. E tirucalli is indigenous in parts of Africa where BL is endemic and may be an important risk factor for the disease. 
Relation between ST segment shifts during ischemia and thrombin activity in patients with unstable angina. This study was designed to determine in patients with unstable angina whether specific electrocardiographic abnormalities associated with ischemia, the presence of coronary lesions consistent with thrombosis on angiography or the presence of recurrent ischemia reflects increases in thrombin activity as manifested by increased plasma concentrations of fibrinopeptide A. The concentration of fibrinopeptide A in plasma was increased to 6.7 +/- 3.1 nM for the group as a whole (n = 29). Increases were greater in the 17 patients who exhibited reversible ST segment shifts (10.2 +/- 5.2 nM) than in the 12 patients exhibiting reversible T wave abnormalities alone (1.6 +/- 0.2 nM) (p less than 0.01). Nine of the 17 patients with reversible ST segment shifts who underwent coronary angiography had lesions with morphologic characteristics consistent with atherosclerotic plaque complicated by thrombosis compared with only 2 of 9 patients with T wave changes only (p less than 0.05). Plasma concentrations of fibrinopeptide A were markedly elevated in 7 of the 11 patients in whom complex lesions were noted on angiographic examination. Thus, the occurrence of reversible ST segment shifts identifies a group of patients with unstable angina in whom ongoing thrombosis is likely and who may be particularly likely to benefit from antithrombotic therapy. 
Leiomyosarcoma of the larynx: emergency laryngectomy. Leiomyosarcoma of the larynx is extremely rare. A patient with respiratory obstruction due to such a tumour is presented. This was originally misdiagnosed as hysteria. The treatment of choice was an emergency laryngectomy. 
A randomized trial of levamisole versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in malignant melanoma. We conducted a long-term follow-up (median, 10.5 years) of patients included in a randomized trial of levamisole versus placebo as surgical adjuvant therapy in 203 patients with malignant melanoma. Of the patients randomized, 104 received levamisole, and 99 received placebo. The results show that there is no difference between the treatment and control groups with regard to any of the three end points analyzed. These included disease-free interval, time to appearance of visceral metastasis, and survival. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups after adjusting for age, sex, or stage of disease. 
Vitamin A levels in premenstrual syndrome. To determine whether changes in peripheral vitamin A levels are associated with symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), 10 PMS patients and 10 controls were studied. They gave blood at 2- or 3-day intervals through three menstrual cycles. The vitamin A was measured by fluorometry after cyclohexane extraction. In the controls, vitamin A values were 68.0 +/- 3.2 micrograms/dL (mean +/- SE) during the luteal phase and 69.8 +/- 4.2 micrograms/dL during the follicular phase. No significant changes were noted between the two values. In the patients, the values were 73.9 +/- 4.2 micrograms/dL during the luteal phase, which was not significantly different from 72.7 +/- 1.8 micrograms/dL during the follicular phase. No significant changes were noted between the controls and the patients in either the luteal or the follicular phase. Vitamin A deficiency in PMS patients was not demonstrated in our study. 
Observations and current operative management of congenital lumbar hernias during infancy. Congenital hernias in the lumbar region are very uncommon. Approximately 10 per cent of all lumbar hernias are congenital and the vast majority are unilateral. We report our experience with seven congenital lumbar hernias in six infants treated during a five year period. All patients presented in the first year of life with abnormal protrusions in the lumbar region. In addition to the lumbar hernia, major associated malformations, including caudal regression anomalies, diaphragmatic hernia, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, cloacal exstrophy and lipomeningocele, were observed in 66 per cent of the infants and were consistent with lumbocostovertebral syndrome. In five patients, unilateral defects were repaired primarily. One patient with bilateral lumbar hernia underwent staged repair. The larger right-sided defect was repaired using a polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis. At a second operation two months later, the small left-sided hernia was closed primarily. All patients have done well without recurrence with a follow-up period ranging from four to 48 months. Early repair of congenital lumbar hernias in infants after correction of other life-threatening conditions is advocated. Unlike the acquired variety, congenital lumbar hernia may include a more extensive deficiency of the entire lateral abdominal wall extending to the rectus sheath and inguinal ligament and satisfactory closure of the defect without prosthetic material may be difficult or impossible. 
Left ventricular pressure-volume and Frank-Starling relations in endurance athletes. Implications for orthostatic tolerance and exercise performance. BACKGROUND. Endurance athletes have a high incidence of orthostatic intolerance. We hypothesized that this is related to an abnormally large decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and stroke volume (SV) for any given decrease in filling pressure. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured pulmonary capillary wedge (PCW) pressure (Swan-Ganz catheter), LVEDV (two-dimensional echocardiography), and cardiac output (C2H2 rebreathing) during lower body negative pressure (LBNP, -15 and -30 mm Hg) and rapid saline infusion (15 and 30 ml/kg) in seven athletes and six controls (VO2max, 68 +/- 7 and 41 +/- 4 ml/kg/min). Orthostatic tolerance was determined by progressive LBNP to presyncope. Athletes had steeper slopes of their SV/PCW pressure curves than nonathletes (5.5 +/- 2.7 versus 2.7 +/- 1.5 ml/mm Hg, p less than 0.05). The slope of the steep, linear portion of this curve correlated significantly with the duration of LBNP tolerance (r = 0.58, p = 0.04). The athletes also had reduced chamber stiffness (increased chamber compliance) expressed as the slope (k) of the dP/dV versus P relation (chamber stiffness, k = 0.008 +/- 0.004 versus 0.031 +/- 0.004, p less than 0.005; chamber compliance, 1/k = 449.8 +/- 283.8 versus 35.3 +/- 4.3). This resulted in larger absolute and relative changes in end-diastolic volume over an equivalent range of filling pressures. CONCLUSIONS. Endurance athletes have greater ventricular diastolic chamber compliance and distensibility than nonathletes and thus operate on the steep portion of their Starling curve. This may be a mechanical, nonautonomic cause of orthostatic intolerance. 
Organization and stability of a polytopic membrane protein: deletion analysis of the lactose permease of Escherichia coli. The overall topology of polytopic membrane proteins is thought to result from either the oriented insertion of the N-terminal alpha-helical domain followed by passive insertion of subsequent helices or from the function of independent topogenic determinants dispersed throughout the molecules. By using the lactose permease of Escherichia coli, a well-characterized membrane protein with 12 transmembrane domains and the N and C termini on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane, we have studied the insertion and stability of in-frame deletion mutants. So long as the first N-terminal and the last four C-terminal putative alpha-helical domains are retained, stable polypeptides are inserted into the membrane, even when an odd number of helical domains is deleted. Moreover, even when an odd number of helices is deleted, the C terminus remains on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane, as judged by lacY-phoA fusion analysis. In addition, permease molecules devoid of even or odd numbers of putative transmembrane helices retain a specific pathway for downhill lactose translocation. The findings imply that relatively short C-terminal domains of the permease contain topological information sufficient for insertion in the native orientation regardless of the orientation of the N terminus. 
Use of the ultrathin choledochoscope in cholecystectomy. Use of the ultrathin choledochoscope (2mm) was evaluated in 80 patients undergoing routine cholecystectomy. It was used successfully in 67 (84 per cent) patients. There were eight (12 per cent) explorations of the common bile duct and no negative explorations. The instrument was helpful in determining the nature of an equivocal on-table cholangiogram. The ultrathin choledochoscope may be useful in reducing the rate of negative common bile duct exploration. 
Induction of delayed hypersensitivity to human tumor cells with a human monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody. There is considerable interest in the development of anti-idiotypic antibodies as vaccines in a number of diseases, including cancer. We have developed a human anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody (105AD7) which binds at or very near to the binding site of mouse antitumor monoclonal antibody 791T/36. The 791T/36 antibody binds to a tumor-associated antigen (gp72) expressed on a number of human tumors, including colorectal and ovarian carcinomas and osteogenic sarcoma. This study shows that, in rats and mice, 105AD7 induces delayed-type hypersensitivity to human tumor cells bearing the gp72 antigen. Local transfer of delayed hypersensitivity was also demonstrated using lymphocytes from mice primed with 105AD7. These findings show that the human monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody 105AD7 is likely to induce cellular immune responses to tumors in cancer patients. 
Histamine concentration of gastric mucosa in Helicobacter pylori positive and negative children. The histamine concentration was determined by enzymatic isotopic method in biopsy specimens of oxyntic mucosa from 37 children. Nineteen of the 37 had Helicobacter pylori associated gastritis (9 with duodenal ulcer). The histamine concentration in the H pylori negative group was mean (SD) 54.1 (23.1) micrograms/g fresh weight, and that in the H pylori positive group was 26.3 (14.2) micrograms/g (p less than 0.01). There was also a significant difference between H pylori positive patients with duodenal ulcer (19.8 (6.3) micrograms/g) and those without ulcer (31.4 (17.9) micrograms/g) (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that H pylori positive patients, especially those with duodenal ulcer, have reduced 'stored' histamine, perhaps because of increased histamine liberation. 
Intrathecal phenol rhizotomy for management of pain in recurrent unresectable carcinoma of the rectum. The medical records of 11 patients with recurrent unresectable adenocarcinoma of the rectum who had intrathecal phenol block for the management of intractable pain were reviewed. There were seven patients with pelvic and four with combined pelvic and perineal recurrences. Five patients had sacral involvement by tumor. Six patients had received prior irradiation. Three patients had good, three had fair and five patients had poor results after phenol rhizotomy. Patients with good results had relief for a median of three months. The over-all survival rate after phenol injection was three months. Phenol rhizotomy is indicated for the relief of intractable pain secondary to recurrent unresectable carcinoma of the rectum in carefully selected patients. 
Photodynamic therapy of oncogene-transformed cells. Photodynamic therapy with dihematoporphyrin ether sensitizes malignant cells to damage by 630 nm light. The in vitro, in vivo photodynamic therapy sensitivity of a cell line transformed by the Kirsten ras oncogene (45342) was studied to establish a new photodynamic therapy model. With the colony formation assay, neither light alone nor dihematoporphyrin ether alone affected 45342 survival. Energy-dependent photodynamic therapy effects were seen in vitro in dihematoporphyrin ether-incubated and light-exposed cells (90% cytotoxicity = 950 joules/m2; 99% cytotoxicity = 1575 joules/m2; p2 less than 0.05). Subcutaneous allografts of 45342 were established in nu/nu mice, and ideal route (intravenous or intraperitoneal) of dihematoporphyrin ether delivery, dihematoporphyrin ether tissue kinetics, and in vivo photodynamic therapy effects were examined. Intravenous administration not only gave higher levels of the sensitizer in various tissues, but also was associated with less variation than the intraperitoneal route. Selective dihematoporphyrin ether retention was documented in the tumors at 24 hours after injection compared with other tissues, and photodynamic therapy with 0.3 W/cm2 to a total dose of 150 joules/cm2 led to progressive coagulative tumor necrosis and tumor regression. These studies confirm that transformed, malignant cells are sensitive to photodynamic therapy, and this model may prove in future studies to increase efficacy to photodynamic therapy (i.e., with dihematoporphyrin ether delivery by monoclonal antibodies). 
Habitual leisure-time physical activity is associated with differences in various risk factors for coronary artery disease. Various risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) were compared in 100 healthy, male factory workers, divided into two groups of 50 each on the basis of their leisure-time activity. The two groups, designated as sedentary and physically active, were similar in terms of age and body mass index, but the physically active group had a significantly slower pulse rate. In addition, the plasma glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose load were significantly lower in physically active individuals. Furthermore, fasting plasma triglyceride concentration was significantly lower and the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration was higher in the physically active individuals. Thus, substantial benefits in terms of CAD risk were associated with increased leisure-time physical activity. 
Echocardiographic assessment of atherosclerotic coronary lesions. Echocardiographic techniques to visualize normal and atherosclerotic coronary arteries include transthoracic, transesophageal, epicardial (intraoperative), and intravascular approaches. All are capable of visualizing portions of the coronary arteries, especially proximal, and demonstrating atherosclerotic lesions. However, none of these methods are able, at present, to completely examine the coronary tree, and therefore none are ready to be used as a standard clinical technique for the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease. Technological advances will enhance the future clinical value and applicability of these techniques. 
Costs and health consequences of cholesterol screening for asymptomatic older Americans. To predict the consequences of cholesterol screening among elderly Americans who do not have symptoms of heart disease, we explore the cost implications of a cholesterol screening program, evaluate evidence linking hypercholesterolemia to coronary heart disease and mortality in the elderly, and describe the likely effects of therapy of hypercholesterolemia. According to our calculations, if all Americans 65 years of age and older adhered to a cholesterol screening program similar to the one proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program, minimum annual expenditures for screening and treatment would be between $1.6 billion and $16.8 billion, depending on the effectiveness of diet and the cost of the medications used to treat hypercholesterolemia. There is no direct evidence that this program would lessen overall morbidity or extend the lives of elderly Americans. 
St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution. Beneficial effect of glucose and multidose reinfusions of cardioplegic solution. The intention of this study was to determine whether glucose is beneficial in a cardioplegic solution when the end products of metabolism produced during the ischemic period are intermittently removed. The experimental model used was the isolated working rat heart, with a 3-hour hypothermic 10 degrees C cardioplegic arrest period. Cardioplegic solutions tested were the St. Thomas' Hospital No. 2 and a modified Krebs-Henseleit cardioplegic solution. Glucose (11 mmol/L) was beneficial when multidose cardioplegia was administered every 30 minutes. Including glucose in Krebs-Henseleit cardioplegic solution improved postischemic recovery of aortic output from 57.0% +/- 1.8% to 65.8% +/- 2.2%; p less than 0.025. The addition of glucose to St. Thomas' Hospital No. 2 cardioplegic solution improved aortic output from 74.6% +/- 1.9% to 87.4% +/- 1.9%; p less than 0.005. Furthermore, a dose-response curve showed that a glucose concentration of 20 mmol/L gave no better recovery than 0 mmol/L, and glucose in St. Thomas Hospital No. 2 cardioplegic solution was beneficial only in the range of 7 to 11 mmol/L. In addition, we showed that multidose cardioplegia was beneficial independent of glucose. Multidose St. Thomas' Hospital No. 2 cardioplegia, as opposed to single-dose cardioplegia, improved aortic output recovery from 57.4% +/- 5.2% to 74.6% +/- 1.9%; p less than 0.025, and with St. Thomas' Hospital No. 2 cardioplegic solution plus glucose (11 mmol/L) aortic output recovery improved from 65.9% +/- 2.9% to 87.4% +/- 1.9%; p less than 0.005. Hence, at least in this screening model, the St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution should contain glucose in the range of 7 mmol/L to 11 mmol/L, provided multidose cardioplegia is given. We cautiously suggest extrapolation to the human heart, on the basis of supporting clinical arguments that appear general enough to apply to both rat and human metabolisms. 
Nimodipine and bradycardia in acute stroke--drug or disease? A patient who had suffered an acute ischemic stroke experienced bradycardia while being treated with nimodipine 80 mg tid. This became evident after the initiation of nimodipine and progressed, leading to the drug being discontinued after three days of therapy. The bradycardia resolved shortly after the treatment was terminated and normal heart rate was maintained throughout 23 days of hospitalization and in subsequent outpatient follow-up. Although nimodipine-induced bradycardia is possible, hemispheric cerebral infarction may also cause transient bradyarrhythmias in the acute stroke period. There is a need to monitor the heart rate and rhythm of all acute stroke patients, especially those receiving nimodipine. 
Prolonged reversible quadriparesis in mechanically ventilated patients who received long-term infusions of vecuronium. The use of neuromuscular blocking agents, particularly pancuronium, in patients receiving mechanical ventilation has been reported to cause prolonged paralysis and atrophy. We describe two mechanically ventilated patients with asthma who developed prolonged muscular weakness and atrophy after receiving the shorter-acting agent vecuronium. These cases illustrate the potential of any neuromuscular blocking agent to cause these complications, especially in patients who are immobile, have decreased renal or liver function, or receive concomitant myotoxic agents. 
Direct derivation of conditionally immortal cell lines from an H-2Kb-tsA58 transgenic mouse. Studies on cell lines have greatly improved our understanding of many important biological questions. Generation of cell lines is facilitated by the introduction of immortalizing oncogenes into cell types of interest. One gene known to immortalize many different cell types in vitro encodes the simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor (T) antigen (TAg). To circumvent the need for gene insertion in vitro to generate cell lines, we created transgenic mice harboring the SV40 TAg gene. Since previous studies have shown that TAg expression in transgenic mice is associated with tumorigenesis and aberrant development, we utilized a thermolabile TAg [from a SV40 strain, tsA58, temperature sensitive (ts) for transformation] to reduce the levels of functional TAg present in vivo. To direct expression to a broad range of tissues, we used the mouse major histocompatibility complex H-2Kb promoter, which is both widely active and can be further induced by interferons. tsA58 TAg mRNA was expressed in tissues of all animals harboring the hybrid construct. Development of all tissues was macroscopically normal except for thymus, which consistently showed hyperplasia. Fibroblast and cytokeratin+ thymic epithelial cultures from these mice were readily established without undergoing crisis and were conditionally immortal in their growth; the degree of conditionality was correlated with the levels of tsA58 TAg detected. One strain of H-2Kb-tsA58 mice has been bred through several generations to homozygosity and transmits a functional copy of the transgene. 
Comparison of four laser types for experimental pain stimulation on oral mucosa and hairy skin. The use of different lasers for stimulation in human experimental pain research has provided a sensitive method for evaluation of thin nerve fiber functions. In this study, sensory and pain thresholds were compared to argon-, copper vapour-, Nd:YAG-, and CO2 laser stimulation on hairy skin and on oral mucosa. The influence on thresholds with respect to laser type, stimulation site, surface colour, and stimulus parameters (laser beam diameter and pulse duration) was investigated. Significant differences in thresholds between the four lasers were found on both surfaces; however, no significant differences existed between thresholds on the skin and on the tongue when the same laser was used. The observations imply that wavelength-dependent optical properties of the stimulated tissue influence on threshold determinations. Furthermore, the results indicate that temporal and spatial summation mechanisms may exist for laser induced warmth and pain perceptions. Laser stimulation may be a new tool for the investigation of origin and genesis of various orofacial pain syndromes. 
Role of partial laryngectomy after irradiation in the treatment of laryngeal cancer: a view from the United Kingdom. This retrospective study evaluates the use of conservation surgical salvage techniques in cases of early (T1 and T2) laryngeal cancer after full-dose external irradiation. Fifty patients in one London hospital and 68 patients in another were studied for the period 1963 to 1988. Treatment policy directed that the majority of limited glottic and supraglottic tumors should be treated initially by external irradiation. The small number of glottic treatment failures had a good chance of salvage by vertical partial laryngectomy if recurrence or a new primary was detected early. Recurrence of supraglottic cancer was salvaged occasionally by horizontal partial laryngectomy if strict indications were observed. Total laryngectomy remained the final minority salvage option. 
Radiofrequency current catheter ablation of accessory atrioventricular pathways. Tachyarrhythmias mediated by an accessory atrioventricular pathway and which are refractory to drug therapy have been treated surgically with variable success. Early results of direct-current catheter ablation were encouraging but were associated with complications such as barotrauma and the need for a general anaesthetic. We have investigated the endocardial application of radiofrequency current which is a potentially safer technique. Of 105 patients with an accessory atrioventricular pathway, 79 were located on the left side of the heart and 32 on the right side. Accessory pathway conduction was permanently abolished in 93 (89%) patients. Complications developed in 3 patients: thrombotic occlusion of a femoral artery, arteriovenous fistula formation at the site of groin puncture, and left ventricular rupture with cardiac tamponade after direct-current shocks. There were no deaths from the procedure. We conclude that radiofrequency current catheter ablation is both effective and safe for patients with symptomatic tachyarrhythmias mediated by accessory atrioventricular pathways. 
The five-year cure rate achieved by cryosurgery for skin cancer. Cryosurgery was used to treat 3540 new basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin from 1971 to 1989; a cure rate of 98.4% was achieved. To determine the 5-year cure rate in more recent years, the results of treatment of 684 nonmelanotic skin cancers from 1980 to 1984 were reviewed. In the group of 628 basal cell carcinomas, the 5-year cure rate was 99.0%. In the group of 52 squamous cell carcinomas, the 5-year cure rate was 96.1%. In the series were also four patients with basosquamous cell carcinomas, all of whom were recurrence free for 5 years or more. The overall 5-year cure rate in the 684 cases was 98.8%. On the basis of these data and our cosmetic results, we conclude that cryosurgery is an effective treatment that compares favorably with other established methods of therapy. 
Anterior transpetrosal-transtentorial approach for sphenopetroclival meningiomas: surgical method and results in 10 patients. This report presents a new surgical method and the results in 10 patients with petroclival meningiomas extending into the parasellar region (sphenopetroclival meningiomas). Minimal but effective extradural resection of the anterior petrous bone via a middle fossa craniotomy offered a direct view of the clival area with preservation of the temporal bridging veins and cochlear organs. The dural incision was extended anteriorly to Meckel's cave, and in cases with invasion of the cavernous sinus, Parkinson's triangle was enlarged by mobilization of the trigeminal nerve. This approach offered an excellent view from the mid-clivus to the cavernous sinus. Extra-as well as intradural tumor masses and dural attachments could be cleared under direct view of the pontine surface. The risk of injury to the lower cranial nerve and of retraction damage to the temporal lobe and brain stem were kept minimal by this approach. Total tumor resection was achieved in 7 patients, with no resultant mortality. Eight patients had a satisfactory postsurgical course, extraocular paresis being their main complaint. The extent of tumor resection depended on the degree of tumor adhesion to the carotid artery, and operative morbidity on the degree of tumor invasion of the brain stem. Of the 3 patients in whom subtotal tumor removal was achieved, only one experienced regrowth of the tumor and underwent a second operation during the follow-up period (6 months-6 years). 
Treatment of fetal supraventricular tachycardia with flecainide acetate after digoxin failure. Transplacentally administered digoxin is the drug of choice for the treatment of fetal supraventricular tachycardia. We describe a case of fetal supraventricular tachycardia associated with fetal hydrops that did not respond to digoxin treatment because of a lack of transplacental passage. In contrast, flecainide acetate crossed the placenta and cured the fetus. The clinical implications of this new treatment are discussed. 
Use of trabeculectomy with postoperative 5-fluorouracil in patients requiring extremely low intraocular pressure levels to limit further glaucoma progression. The authors conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial to quantify the effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on filtration surgery. Both eyes of 17 patients with either bilateral low-tension glaucoma or advanced chronic open-angle glaucoma that would be expected to progress at intraocular pressures in the normal range were included. One eye received a full-thickness filtering procedure with a modified shell tamponade technique, and the other received a trabeculectomy with postoperative 5-FU. Follow-up was equal for both eyes and averaged 9.2 months. In eyes in the shell group, the average postoperative pressure was 10.94 mmHg, and in the 5-FU group it was 6.94 mmHg, (P = 0.0001). However, the postoperative visual acuity decrease was significantly greater in the 5-FU group (P less than 0.05). Choroidal detachments also were more frequent in the 5-FU group, but this was not statistically significant. 
Transient myocardial ischemia during Holter registration before and after coronary angioplasty. PURPOSE: Revascularizing procedures like percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) aim at reducing the incidence and severity of myocardial ischemia. To evaluate this, continuous Holter ST analysis is a possible method. DESIGN: 41 patients (35 men, 6 women) with stable angina pectoris had continuous twenty-four-hour two-channel Holter registration (V5/aVF-analogous leads) recorded before and after PTCA. Transient myocardial ischemia (TM) was defined as 0.1 mV ST depression or more 80 msec after the J point for one minute or more. FINDINGS: PTCA was successful for 37 patients (90%). Eleven of these had a total of 53 episodes of TM, 36 (68%) before and 17 (32%) after PTCA (p less than 0.05). Fifteen episodes (28%) were symptomatic, and 38 (72%) were asymptomatic. Six patients had TM after successful PTCA, 5 of whom had one-vessel disease and a clinically uncomplicated course. One patient had multivessel disease, with only one vessel dilated. Follow-up angiograms for 9 of the 11 patients with TM revealed 5 restenoses. There was no significant correlation between TM after PTCA and subsequent restenosis (p greater than 0.05). IMPLICATIONS: TM is common in patients with stable angina pectoris. The incidence significantly decreases after successful PTCA, but TM is seen also with a clinically uncomplicated course. In multivessel disease this is consistent with incomplete revascularization, whereas in single-vessel disease the most likely cause is intermittent spasm or thrombosis. TM after successful PTCA does not seem to be a predictor of restenosis. 
Primary resection and anastomosis in obstructed descending colon due to cancer. Intraoperative colonic irrigation followed by one-stage resection is gaining popularity as the optimal surgical treatment for left-sided colonic obstruction. However, its efficacy and potential hazards have not been adequately tested in obstruction due to colonic cancer. We analyzed the early results of 23 consecutive patients with obstructive left-sided colonic carcinoma treated by primary resection and anastomosis following intraoperative antegrade colonic lavage. Two patients (8.6%) died, one from complication of anastomotic leakage. The significant postoperative complications were chest infection in three (13%) and wound infection in seven (30.4%). The average hospital stay was 16.5 days. The results of this study suggest that intraoperative bowel irrigation permits one-stage resection and anastomosis to be conducted with reasonable safety provided care is taken in operative techniques. 
Determination of serum acetaminophen in emergency toxicology: evaluation of newer methods: Abbott TDx and second derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Newer methods for the determination of serum acetaminophen in emergency toxicology, the Abbott TDx immunoassay and second derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometry, were evaluated and compared to a high pressure liquid chromatographic procedure. The Abbott TDx immunoassay within-run and day to day precision yielded coefficients of variance below 2.7% and 7.2% respectively: Abbott TDx immunoassay results correlated well with those of high pressure liquid chromatographic in patient serums 15.0 to 333 mg/L acetaminophen; r2 = 0.954, n = 40. The Abbott TDx immunoassay assay was rapid, easy to perform, free of interferences from other drugs and exhibited no carryover from previous samples. The within run precision of the second derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometry method yielded coefficients of variance of less than 7.0%. Second derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometry results demonstrated good correlation with high pressure liquid chromatographic results in patient sera; r2 = 0.923, n = 40; however, performance deteriorated below 50.0 mg/L acetaminophen. Spectral interferences were noted at high concentrations of some drugs. 
Evidence for major gene transmission of developmental dyslexia. OBJECTIVE.--There is strong evidence that developmental dyslexia is both familial and heritable, but the mode of genetic transmission has remained unclear. In this article, we examine specific genetic hypotheses about the mode of transmission of developmental dyslexia by performing complex segregation analyses. DESIGN.--A family study method was applied, whereby the relatives of dyslexic probands were examined for dyslexia. The families studied represent four independently ascertained samples. SETTING.--The four samples of families were primarily from rural and suburban communities of Colorado, Washington State, and Iowa. PARTICIPANTS.--A total of 204 families and 1698 individuals in the four samples combined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--The complex segregation program, POINTER, was used to test competing genetic hypotheses of how a categorical trait (dyslexia) is transmitted in families. RESULTS.--The results were consistent with major locus transmission in three of four samples and with polygenic transmission in the fourth. In these three samples, the estimates of penetrance for the AA, Aa, and aa genotypes (where A is the abnormal allele) were, respectively, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.001 to 0.039 in males, and 0.560 to 1.000, 0.550 to 0.897, and 0.000 in females. The estimated gene frequency of the major locus was between 3% and 5%. CONCLUSIONS.--Sex-influenced, additive, or dominant transmission occurs in a significant proportion of dyslexic families. Other evidence indicates, however, that dyslexia is etiologically heterogeneous and that there is genetic heterogeneity even among families selected for apparent dominant transmission. Thus, while no single major locus may account for all of dyslexia, it is important to pursue potential major loci for dyslexia using linkage techniques. 
Hepatocellular carcinomas with excessive copper accumulation: CT and MR findings. Results of orcein staining and findings obtained with non-contrast-medium-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (T1- and T2-weighted images) were compared for 53 histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). HCCs were 5 cm in the largest diameter. Three lesions with diffuse and strong orcein staining were highly attenuating on nonenhanced CT images. Electron x-ray microanalysis of one of them revealed copper. The high attenuation value at nonenhanced CT may have been due to the abundant copper-binding protein in the cancer cells. The difference between orcein staining results and attenuation patterns at CT was statistically significant (chi 2, P less than .001). It could not be concluded that the paramagnetic effects of copper in HCC had an influence on signal intensity on MR images. The difference between orcein staining results and signal-intensity patterns on T1- and T2-weighted images was not statistically significant. 
Review of duodenal diverticula. Duodenal diverticula occur in 2-5% of patients undergoing barium studies of the upper intestinal tract. Duodenal diverticula are classified into two types: extraluminal or intraluminal. Usually of little clinical significance, they can cause obstruction, cholelithiasis, ascending cholangitis, ulcers, and hemorrhage, and may perforate. Associated intestinal tract malformations have been reported in 40% of patients with intraluminal duodenal diverticula. Diagnosis is made by endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal series. In symptomatic cases, extraluminal diverticula are amenable to surgery, whereas intraluminal diverticula may be either surgically or endoscopically resected. Imaging of the biliary tree should be performed prior to any intervention. 
T1-weighted snapshot gradient-echo MR imaging of the abdomen. Magnetization-prepared ultrashort-repetition-time (snapshot) gradient-echo imaging is a technique of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with many potential applications. In the application of this technique to abdominal imaging, the effects on contrast of phase-encoding order, resolution, preparation-phase inversion time, and data-acquisition flip angle were predicted and then demonstrated with images obtained in examinations of 22 patients. In the analysis of 36 liver lesions, snapshot images were compared with corresponding T1-weighted spin-echo images on the basis of signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of liver and contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N) between liver and lesion. Snapshot MR imaging produced abdominal images with 192 (or 256) x 256 resolution, negligible motion artifact, and C/N 1.29 times (+/- 0.48) higher than that in T1-weighted spin-echo imaging. Acquisition times were 13 seconds or less, short enough for imaging during suspended respiration. Also, use of a phased-array multicoil further improves the S/N in snapshot images without acquisition-time penalty. 
Selection bias in the use of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. The SAVE Investigators. OBJECTIVE. To determine whether clinical selection for thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction results in a skewed population for subsequent adverse cardiovascular events. DESIGN. A comparison of the clinical features of the patients in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement Study who either had or had not received thrombolytic therapy was conducted in both univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. SETTING. Hospitalized patients experiencing acute myocardial infarction from 112 broadly representative, private, academic, and government hospitals in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS. All patients in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement Study had had a recent myocardial infarction (less than 16 days) and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less. INTERVENTION. Thrombolytic therapy was administered to 733 patients and was not given to 1498. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. The comparisons with respect to use of thrombolytic therapy were formulated after the completion of enrollment and indicated that the majority of patients did not receive thrombolytic therapy. RESULTS. The 1498 (67.1%) patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy were at higher risk (older age, lower functional capacity, greater likelihood of a history of prior myocardial infarction, angina, diabetes, and hypertension) for subsequent cardiovascular events and, as anticipated, were more likely to have concomitant gastrointestinal and neurological diseases. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that older age, prior myocardial infarction, impaired functional status, employment status, diabetes, and neurological diseases were predictors of use of thrombolytic therapy. CONCLUSION. Although the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement Study population was selected for left ventricular dysfunction, the majority of patients who currently are judged clinically as unsuitable for thrombolytic therapy have a higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events. 
Use of amiodarone for short-term and adjuvant therapy in young patients. Limited data are available defining the safety of amiodarone for short-term use or as part of combination antiarrhythmic therapy in pediatric patients. Results of amiodarone in 47 young patients for an average treatment duration of 12 months were examined. There were 21 male and 26 female patients (age range of 23 weeks gestation to 29 years). Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1--electrocardiographic documented ventricular tachycardia (n = 7); group 2--syncope of unknown cause (n = 16); group 3--primary atrial tachycardia (n = 11); and group 4--supraventricular tachycardia (n = 13). Amiodarone was clinically useful in 32 (68%) patients. Amiodarone was considered effective as a sole antiarrhythmic agent in 21 (45%) patients. Treatment was ineffective but was continued in 11 (23%) patients; in 10 of these 11 patients amiodarone was adjuvant to other antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone was considered ineffective and was withdrawn in 15 (32%) patients. No patient required cardiac pacemaker implant during therapy. Torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest occurred in 1 patient each after 9 and 14 days of therapy, respectively. Two patients underwent successful cardiac transplant after 2 and 14 months of amiodarone administration, respectively. Amiodarone was used as short-term treatment (less than 18 months) in 7 infants (age less than 18 months), and after cessation of treatment there was no recurrence of tachycardia for 4 to 24 months. Results of this study confirm reports of successful amiodarone use in pediatric patients with a variety of rhythm disturbances. 
Needle biopsy associated tumor tracking of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. We reviewed 350 previously biopsied completely submitted clinical stage B radical prostatectomy specimens resected between January 1, 1987 and December 31, 1988 in an attempt to identify the incidence of needle biopsy associated tumor tracking into periprostatic soft tissue. We identified 7 cases (2.0%) of needle biopsy associated tumor tracking, 3 in which the only tumor penetration in the gland was limited to the needle track. The maximal soft tissue extension from the biopsy site ranged from 0.1 to 1.2 cm. and approached the nearest soft tissue margin to within 0.5 mm. in 4 cases. In contrast to prior reports showing clinically evident tracking only with transperineal biopsies from high grade tumors, 6 of our 7 cases were of intermediate grade (in the glandular and tracking components) and 6 had transrectal biopsies. Needle biopsy associated tumor tracking occurred with core (14 gauge) and biopsy gun needles (18 gauge). An additional 13 cases (3.7%) showed some features of needle biopsy associated tumor tracking but they were equivocal. These findings have significant implications in light of recent proposals advocating serial mapping of prostate cancer using the biopsy gun with potential conservative observation of smaller tumors. 
Hemorrhagic subcutaneous bursitis. Hemarthrosis is a well recognized complication of a number of conditions. Hemorrhagic subcutaneous bursitis is less understood. We encountered a patient with a myeloproliferative disease who developed hemorrhagic olecranon bursitis. Upon reviewing other patients with subcutaneous bursitis, we found that hemorrhagic bursitis also occurs in the setting of traumatic or idiopathic bursitis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and septic bursitis. 
Differential activation of ornithine decarboxylase and tyrosine kinase in the rectal mucosa of patients with hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps. Hyperplastic polyps are considered to be benign colonic lesions with almost no potential for malignant transformation. Recent reports have shown an increased association of hyperplastic polyps with adenomatous polyps and have advocated a full colonoscopy in patients who harbor hyperplastic polyps. Hyperproliferative mucosa is known to be associated with adenomatous polyps, but its relationship to hyperplastic polyps is unknown. In the present pilot study, it is determined whether a change in mucosal proliferative patterns is observed in patients who harbor only hyperplastic polyps or a history of hyperplastic polyps relative to those who harbor both hyperplastic polyps and adenomatous polyps by measuring ornithine decarboxylase and tyrosine kinase activity in macroscopically normal rectal mucosa. Fifteen patients had either adenomatous polyps proximally or harbored adenomatous polyps and hyperplastic polyps. Seven patients had hyperplastic polyps and 15 patients had a prior history of hyperplastic polyps with no polyps found during the current examination. The ornithine decarboxylase activity of the rectal mucosa with proximal adenomatous polyps or both polyp types was significantly higher than that of hyperplastic polyps, the history of hyperplastic polyps, or controls, and values for hyperplastic polyps and the history of hyperplastic polyps were similar to controls. On the other hand, tyrosine kinase activity in the rectal mucosa of patients with both or either polyp type was elevated without any significant difference between hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps. Thus, it is concluded that although increased ornithine decarboxylase activity in rectal mucosa suggests the presence of adenomatous polyps or a combination of adenomatous with hyperplastic polyps, increased tyrosine kinase activity suggests the presence of any type of polyp. 
Neurofilament distribution is altered in the Mnd (motor neuron degeneration) mouse. Motor neuron degeneration (Mnd) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease of the mouse that is characterized by a progressive increase in motor dysfunction, moving from hind to fore limbs, leading to paralysis. An immunocytochemical analysis of the neurofilament distribution in spinal motor neurons in Mnd mice from all stages of the disease, including the presymptomatic, was performed using antibodies to different neurofilament subunits with different degrees of phosphorylation. Perikarya that stained with antibodies to phosphorylated neurofilaments were present in Mnd and control spinal cords, but the number of stained perikarya in Mnd was not significantly different from controls. There was a marked redistribution of neurofilaments within the cytoplasm of some motor neurons in Mnd cords. In Mnd but not controls, the immunoreaction product appeared marginated, leaving areas in the cytoplasm absent of immunostaining. These areas were observed in all stages of the disease, but less predictably in presymptomatics. Both the size of the areas and the number of motoneurons containing these areas appeared to increase with the severity of the disease. The number of anterior horn neurons in the hind limb region of lamina IX in spinal segment L4 of Mnd was lower than in controls, suggesting there is a loss of neurons in Mnd. 
Delayed hearing loss after surgery for acoustic neurinomas: clinical and electrophysiological observations. In a series of 26 patients with medium-sized and large acoustic neurinomas and documented hearing before surgery, 7 patients had preservation of hearing initially after the procedure but then developed delayed hearing loss. The most prominent intraoperative electrophysiological finding in these cases was a gradual deterioration of brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), especially of Wave V. Four additional patients with a similar gradual intraoperative loss of BAEP and severe postoperative hearing deterioration received vasoactive treatment after surgery (low-molecular weight dextran). In all 4 patients, including 1 patient with documented total deafness after surgery, hearing was preserved. Initial preservation of cochlear nerve function after the removal of an acoustic neurinoma does not guarantee postoperative hearing. Intraoperative BAEP help to identify patients at risk for delayed postoperative hearing loss. The pathophysiological mechanism can be attributed to disturbances of the microcirculation in endoneurial vasa nervorum caused by the mechanical manipulation of the cochlear nerve. 
Influence of left ventricular diastolic filling on symptoms and survival in patients with decreased left ventricular systolic function. The relation between left ventricular (LV) filling variables measured by gated blood pool radionuclide ventriculography and clinical symptoms and survival was examined in 93 patients who had decreased LV systolic function. The diastolic data were not significantly associated with clinical symptoms. Time to peak filling rate, peak filling rate and ejection fraction were associated independently with survival free of cardiac death (chi-square = 7.74, 5.91 and 3.92, respectively, by stepwise Cox regression analysis). A short time to peak filling rate or increased peak filling rate was associated with decreased survival, whereas the opposite indicated a good prognosis. One-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 73 and 98% when time to peak filling rate was below or above the median value of 167 ms, respectively, 82 and 90% when peak filling rate was above or below the median value of 1.67 end-diastolic volumes per second, respectively, and 76 and 95% when LV ejection fraction was below or above the median value of 0.35, respectively. Thus, filling variables (time to peak filling rate and peak filling rate) measured by radionuclide ventriculography may be valuable in predicting survival in patients with decreased LV systolic function. 
Exercise training in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure have guided efforts in formulating effective treatment strategies. The epidemiology, etiology, and medical management of congestive failure are reviewed. The changing approaches to exercise and exercise training in patients with heart failure are discussed. Recent studies of the impact of exercise training in this important patient group are presented. 
Intestinal lymphonodular hyperplasia of childhood: patterns of presentation. In this retrospective analysis we searched for a constellation of signs or symptoms attributable to childhood lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH). Of 147 children with documented LNH reviewed, 43% had lesions in the small bowel, and 57% in the large bowel. Children in this study presented with complaints of abdominal pain (58%) and bright red blood per rectum (32%). Physical examination revealed little except right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal tenderness and "fullness" in 35%. The pain was periumbilical, dull-cramping, rarely acute, and nonradiating. The hematochezia was most commonly streaky red in mucoid strands adhering to the stools, with no associated tenesmus. Three clinical patterns emerged: (a) Under 1 year of age most patients were male, with painless bleeding and pancolonic LNH. (b) Between 2 and 6 years, although the LNH was predominantly colonic, pain and bleeding occurred equally. (c) From 7 years old on, the main symptom was abdominal pain, but LNH distribution was nearly equal between the small bowel and the colon. To date, our long-term follow-up of the children with isolated LNH has revealed no sequelae. 
Interferon alpha-2b injections used as an adjuvant therapy to carbon dioxide laser vaporization of recalcitrant ano-genital condylomata acuminata. We retrospectively analyzed our treatment of men with anogenital condylomata acuminata (CA) at Hennepin County Medical Center and the University of Minnesota. Between October 1985 and August 1989, 48 patients with CA were treated with laser vaporization, and 27 were treated with laser vaporization followed by a series of intralesional interferon (IFN) alpha-2b injections. The patients in the IFN group were more likely to have perianal CA (44% vs 24%), had larger numbers of CA, and were more likely to have had previous treatment, including previous laser vaporization. The CA in the laser group were more likely to be on the penis alone (67% vs 45%) and had a longer mean duration. The laser-treated group experienced a 38.2% rate of recurrence or reinfection with a mean follow-up period of 13 weeks. The laser and IFN group had an 18.5% rate of recurrence or reinfection with the same follow-up. We conclude that intralesional injections of alpha-2b interferon following carbon dioxide laser vaporization of recalcitrant ano-genital condylomata substantially reduce the risk of recurrence or reinfection. 
Dysphagia after Nissen fundoplication. Nissen fundoplication is a commonly used antireflux operation. After this operation symptoms such as dysphagia, inability to belch and vomit, and gas bloating are frequently reported in the literature. In 32 patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication 3.5-18 years ago, postprocedure dysphagia was studied using conventional manometry and 24 h ambulatory pressure and pH recording. Our study indicates that dysphagia tends to decrease after surgery. Neither conventional nor ambulatory pressure recording revealed motor abnormalities that could be held responsible for the dysphagia. Therefore, the data do not support the concept that dysphagia is a major complication of Nissen fundoplication. 
Office dermatologic surgery and laser therapy. As the result of a dramatic increase in the incidence of skin cancer and the need for effective outpatient surgical treatment, dermatology is now a surgical as well as a medical specialty, and many procedures are commonly performed on an outpatient basis. Mohs micrographic surgery is used to remove basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, and the resulting cure rates are high. Excisional biopsy can facilitate the early diagnosis of melanoma, while it is still in clinical stage I. Carbon dioxide lasers are commonly used to destroy epidermal lesions and yellow light lasers to destroy hemangiomas or other vascular malformations. Facial chemical peel (chemexfoliation) with trichloroacetic acid can improve the appearance of photoaged skin. 
Arterial T and Y grafts. Presented is the use of an autogenous arterial T graft for the salvage of a thrombosed arterial end-to-side anastomosis. The T-graft concept also offers the possibility of replacing a segment of artery in patients with arterial vessel wall defects, stenosis, obliteration, or disease during free latissimus dorsi or scapular flap transfer. The arterial T graft is harvested from the axilla and consists of segments of the subscapular, circumflex scapular, and thoracodorsal arteries. The large diameter of these vessels offers a good match with the arteries of the lower leg and forearm. The arterial Y graft consists of the same arteries and is used as an interpositional graft to revascularize two distal vessels from one proximal vessel. 
Operations for subaortic stenosis in univentricular hearts Optimal prevention and treatment of subaortic stenosis (SAS) in the univentricular heart with subaortic outlet chamber and high pulmonary blood flow remains controversial, especially when complicated by aortic arch obstruction. Herein we analyze our surgical results. Group 1 consisted of 11 infants (mean age, 10 days) with univentricular heart and SAS. Ten required repair of interrupted aortic arch (n = 7) or coarctation with hypoplastic arch (n = 7). Four patients had relief of SAS by either Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection (n = 2) or aortopulmonary window (n = 2), with three operative deaths and one late death. Six had one-stage arterial switch and atrial septectomy with arch repair (5/6) with one operative death and one late death. Two survivors have progressed to bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt, a third has had a Fontan operation, and a fourth awaits Fontan. In group 2, 11 children required operation for acquired SAS after pulmonary artery banding. Nine have progressed to Fontan operation with either staged (n = 3) or concurrent (n = 6) relief of SAS by Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection or subaortic resection. Fontan mortality was 11% (70% confidence limits, 2% to 32%). Group 3 consisted of 3 patients without pulmonary artery banding who had SAS diagnosed at Fontan evaluation. All 3 survived Fontan operation and relief of SAS by Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection or subaortic resection. Group 4 consisted of 1 patient with previous pulmonary artery banding (no SAS) who underwent Fontan operation but required Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection 30 months later for SAS. 
The risk of seizure recurrence following a first unprovoked seizure: a quantitative review. Knowledge of the recurrence risk following a first unprovoked seizure and the predictors of that risk are necessary for rational treatment decisions. Published estimates of recurrence risk range from 23% to 71%. In a meta-analysis of 16 reports, three methodologic factors explained much of the reported variation: (1) study inclusion criteria, ie, whether patients were enrolled at the time of their first seizure or if patients with prior seizures were included; (2) retrospective versus prospective ascertainment of patients; (3) the interval between the first seizure and the time at which risk was assessed. The average recurrence risk across the 16 studies was 51%. The risk was 40% and 52% in prospective and retrospective studies that employed first-seizure methods and 67% in non-first seizure studies. At or near 2 years following the first seizure, the recurrence risk was 36% and 47% in prospective and retrospective first-seizure studies. The distribution of prognostic factors was also important. Seizure etiology and the EEG were the strongest predictors of recurrence distinguishing between patient subgroups, with recurrence risks as low as 24% and as high as 65%. Partial seizures were associated with an increased recurrence risk, but not consistently. There is considerable agreement among studies concerning the recurrence risk following a first seizure, and much of the discrepancies among studies can be explained by differences in study methods and distributions of important prognostic factors. 
Does alcohol protect against the formation of gallstones? A demonstration of protopathic bias. Previous studies have found an inverse relation between alcohol use and clinical gallstone disease, suggestive of a protective effect of alcohol use. However, such an inverse relation may (at least partly) be explained by a reduction of alcohol use because of symptoms related to clinical gallstone disease (protopathic bias). We empirically evaluated the consequences of different designs for the avoidance of such bias in a series of case-control studies. A first study deliberately used a design that is commonly seen in the literature. Cases of clinical gallstone disease, referred to hospital because of symptoms, were contrasted with general population controls. The results suggested an inverse relation between alcohol use and gallstones. Next, three alternative case-control studies were performed using designs that safeguard against protopathic bias. In none of these studies was an association between alcohol use and gallstones found. This demonstrates the probable existence of protopathic bias in case-control studies on alcohol use and gallstones. It is argued that earlier non-experimental studies on this topic were susceptible to such bias. This has most likely led to an overestimation of the protective effect. 
The significance of portal vein thrombosis after distal splenorenal shunt. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of portal vein thrombosis after the distal splenorenal shunt, to identify any predictive factors, and to assess the clinical significance of this complication. Preoperative and postoperative angiograms and clinical evaluation were reviewed in 124 patients who underwent distal splenorenal shunts. Total and partial portal vein thrombosis were seen on 13 (10.5%) and 22 (17.7%) postoperative angiograms, respectively. The only preoperative variable correlating with development of portal vein thrombosis was portal venous perfusion, which was significantly lower in patients with than in those without portal vein thrombosis. In six of 10 patients with postoperative pancreatitis, portal vein thrombosis developed. The frequency of early postoperative complications was significantly greater in patients with total portal vein thrombosis than in those with partial or no thrombosis. Long-term follow-up has shown no significant effects of portal vein thrombosis on late ascites, encephalopathy, or survival. 
Malignant and nonmalignant T cell lines from human T cell lymphotropic virus type I-negative patients with Sezary syndrome. The establishment of an in vitro model for cutaneous T cell lymphomas and Sezary syndrome has been difficult since T cells from individuals with these diseases do not proliferate in response to T cell mitogens. We found that conditioned media, collected from mitogen-activated PBMC from Sezary patients, contain an IL-2 receptor inducing factor. Despite their ostensible proliferative disorder, using a combination Sezary cell-conditioned media and rIL-2, we established IL-2 responsive, human T cell lymphotropic virus type I negative T cell lines from 23 patients, nine of which contain cells with the structural and/or genetic characteristics of neoplastic Sezary T cells. 
Penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcer with dissecting hematoma: control of bleeding with percutaneous embolization. A case is presented in which left subpleural hematoma and hemothorax resulted from a penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcer with an aortic pseudoaneurysm and intramedial hematoma. Percutaneous transfemoral embolization of the ulcer with use of coils and thrombin resulted in stabilization of the patient's hemodynamic status. The patient died 6 days later of pneumonia. In certain clinical situations, treatment of bleeding from penetrating aortic ulcers with percutaneous embolization may stabilize the patient's condition, allowing elective surgical intervention. 
Cysts of the neuraxis of endodermal origin. Five colloid cysts of the third ventricle were compared with two spinal enterogenous cysts to examine the hypothesis that these entities have the same origin from primitive endodermal tissue. All the lesions showed cuboidal and columnar epithelium with mucus containing goblet cells and cilia. Immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin, EMA and CEA was positive in all the colloid cyst and enterogenous cyst epithelium. S-100 was focally positive in three of the colloid and one of the enterogenous cysts while vimentin and GFAP were negative in both. The anatomical distribution of both colloid and enterogenous cysts is reviewed. An illustrative case of an identical cyst within the fourth ventricle is presented. This suggests that the similarities between colloid and enterogenous cysts and the presence of identical lesions along the neuroaxis indicate that these structures are derived from primitive foregut endoderm. 
Morphine-augmented cholescintigraphy: its efficacy in detecting acute cholecystitis Cholescintigrams were performed in 158 patients suspected of having acute cholecystitis after administration of 185 Mbq (5 mCi) of 99mTc-mebrofenin or disofenin. Morphine sulfate, 0.04 mg/kg was given intravenously if there was nonvisualization of the gallbladder at 40-60 min provided that radiotracer was seen within the small bowel. Acute cholecystitis was deemed present if there was nonvisualization of the gallbladder 30 min post-morphine administration; no cystic duct obstruction was present if the gallbladder was demonstrated pre- or post-morphine administration. A final diagnosis was estimated in 51 postoperative patients histologically, the remainder having their final diagnosis gleaned from their medical records. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of morphine-augmented cholescintigraphy in detecting acute cholecystitis was 94.6, 99.1, 97.2, and 98.3%, respectively. These findings indicate that morphine-augmented cholescintigraphy detects acute cholecystitis with as high a degree of accuracy as conventional hepatobiliary scintigraphy, yet requires only 1.5 hr to establish the diagnosis. 
Depression in spouses of chronic pain patients: the role of patient pain and anger, and marital satisfaction. Although several studies have shown that spouses of chronic pain patients may experience clinically significant depressive symptoms few studies have comprehensively examined the role of both patient and spouse-related factors in the development and maintenance of this emotional distress. Twenty-nine married male chronic benign low back pain patients and their spouses were recruited in order to examine the role of patient, spouse, and marital factors in spouse depressive symptomatology. The results indicated that 28% percent of the spouses in the sample reported significantly depressed mood. A 2-stage regression analysis was employed that revealed 3 significant predictors of spouse's depressed mood, namely patient's average pain; patient's reported levels of anger and hostility, and the spouse's level of marital satisfaction. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for clinical interventions for pain patients and their families. 
Human interleukin-7 induces proliferation of neoplastic cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute leukemias. The biologic effects of interleukin-7 (IL-7) and the expression of specific IL-7 membrane receptors on isolated neoplastic cells from previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as acute leukemias were investigated in vitro. Leukemic cells were incubated for up to 6 days with various concentrations of IL-7 (0.01 to 2,000 U/mL). Neoplastic cells of the T- or B-phenotype from chronic as well as from acute leukemias proliferated in a dose-dependent manner. Cells from acute myeloid leukemias also proliferated in response to IL-7. An optimal proliferative effect was achieved between 96 and 120 hours with 200 U/mL IL-7. Combinations of IL-7 with IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha showed an additive effect on [3H]TdR incorporation. IL-7 binding assays gave a value of approximately 33 to 180 high-affinity (kd approximately 20 pmol/L) binding sites/cell and approximately 241 to 3,280 low-affinity (kd approximately 600 pmol/L) binding sites/cell. Receptor expression correlated with the proliferation in response to IL-7. These data indicate that IL-7 can induce proliferation of relatively mature tumor cells, and that this effect is not restricted to the lymphoid lineage. 
Smell and taste disorders, a study of 750 patients from the University of Pennsylvania Smell and Taste Center. Smell and taste disorders are common in the general population, yet little is known about their nature or cause. This article describes a study of 750 patients with complaints of abnormal smell or taste perception from the University of Pennsylvania Smell and Taste Center, Philadelphia. Major findings suggest that: chemosensory dysfunction influences quality of life; complaints of taste loss usually reflect loss of smell function; upper respiratory infection, head trauma, and chronic nasal and paranasal sinus disease are the most common causes of the diminution of the sense of smell, with head trauma having the greatest loss; depression frequently accompanies chemosensory distortion; low body weight accompanies burning mouth syndrome; estrogens protect against loss of the sense of smell in postmenopausal women; zinc therapy may provide no benefit to patients with chemosensory dysfunction; and thyroid hormone function is associated with oral sensory distortion. The findings are discussed in relation to management of patients with chemosensory disturbances. 
Host factors and early therapeutic response in acute otitis media. To evaluate the relationship between eradication of bacterial infection and clinical improvement in children with otitis media, we reviewed the clinical outcome of bacterial otitis media in patients enrolled in double-blind trials of antibacterial therapy from 1979 to 1988. Cultures of middle ear exudates showed the distribution of bacterial pathogens to be similar to that observed in other geographic areas. Two hundred ninety-three patients had otitis media caused by bacterial pathogens and underwent repeat tympanocentesis after 3 to 6 days of therapy. Bacteriologic success was demonstrated in 253 patients (86%); 40 patients (14%) had bacteriologic failure. Children who had bacteriologic failure were younger than those with bacteriologic success (median age 10.6 vs 18.5 months; p = 0.001); 38% of patients who had bacteriologic failure were black, compared with 18% of patients with bacteriologic success (p = 0.007). Gender, history of frequent otitis media, and presence of bilateral otitis media were not risk factors for bacteriologic failure. Clinical success was demonstrated in 261 patients (89%); 32 patients (11%) had clinical failure. Agreement between clinical and bacteriologic response was 86% (95% confidence interval: 81.6% to 89.6%). Ninety-three percent (236/253) of subjects whose infection was eliminated had clinical resolution, whereas 37% (15/40) of those with bacteriologic failure had persisting symptoms or signs of clinical failure. We conclude that failure to eliminate bacteria from the middle ear is often associated with persistent signs and symptoms. Bacteriologic failure affects children less than 18 months of age almost exclusively. Bacteriologic and clinical failure are frequently discordant; mechanisms unrelated to the bacterial infection may explain some of the persisting clinical signs. 
Vascular trauma as a result of therapeutic procedures for the treatment of malignancy. Twenty-two iatrogenic vascular injuries caused by resection of tumors with local recurrences or adjuvant chemotherapy were treated over a 42-month period in 11 female and 8 male patients with cancer (58% had documented metastases). Sixteen of 22 vascular injuries were caused by intraarterial administration of chemotherapy (8 emboli; 8 direct catheter trauma), and six were caused by resection of tumors with local invasion. The injuries were extremity ischemia (15 extremities in 13 patients), pseudoaneurysm (4), expanding hematoma (3 injuries in 2 patients). Twenty-two surgical repairs included bypass of severely damaged arteries in five, embolectomy in five, interposition grafts in three, pseudoaneurysm resection and primary repair in three, primary repair of three vascular injuries, and one patch angioplasty. Leg amputation was required in two patients. Seventeen of 19 patients had successful vascular repairs with resolution of preoperative indications for vascular repair without intraoperative or postoperative deaths. Long term follow-up (mean, 17 months) showed no recurrence of vascular problems; however, two patients died of metastatic cancer at 6 and 24 weeks after vascular repair. This study supports an aggressive approach to the management of vascular injuries caused by therapeutic interventions for malignancy despite the presence of metastatic disease. 
Combined study to assess the role of calcium alginate swabs and ligation of the inferior tonsillar pole in the control of intra-operative blood loss during tonsillectomy. Bleeding is the major source of morbidity and mortality of tonsillectomy and most operative time is spent securing haemostasis. Calcium alginate reduces experimental wound blood loss. This study assessed the efficacy of alginate swabs during tonsillectomy and inferior tonsillar pole ligation in the control of blood loss during tonsillectomy. Ninety-nine tonsillectomy patients were randomized to gauze or alginate swab use. A haemoglobinometer measured blood losses collected by suction during dissection and by swab until haemostasis was secured. Operative time, complications and healing were also assessed. Mean total blood losses and operative times were similar for the two groups. Swab blood loss was significantly lower for surgeons who ligated the lower tonsillar pole, compared with surgeons who used a snare. This finding was independent of swab type. Independent assessment showed no difference in the healing rate. Alginate swabs offer no advantage over gauze in terms of blood loss, operative time or complications of tonsillectomy. The results show that routine lower pole ligation significantly reduces post-dissection blood loss. We suggest that this technique should be more widely adopted. 
Clinical issues relating to the diagnosis of mild dementia in a British community survey. Many epidemiologists base their diagnoses of dementia on scores on brief cognitive tests, but the border between normal aging and mild dementia is so poorly understood that simple demarcations cannot adequately encapsulate the wealth of clinical material that needs to be taken into account in assigning diagnostic labels. Data from a British study of the prevalence and natural history of dementia, in which diagnoses of dementia were made by clinicians using a new, standardized interview schedule, are presented to demonstrate the effects of physical disability, psychiatric illness, and other factors on memory impairment and performance in everyday life. Our purpose is not to insist that clinicians are always correct but rather to highlight the complexities involved and the need for investigators to be more open about the way in which they distinguish between physical, psychiatric, and cognitive infirmities. 
Cause-specific mortality among physicians with differing life-styles. We compare the mortality experience of medical school graduates from Loma Linda University (LLU [n = 4342]) and the University of Southern California (USC [n = 2832]) with each other and with that of contemporaneous, white, American men. When compared with US white men from the general population, both USC and LLU graduates had below expected deaths for all causes (USC, standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 76; LLU, SMR = 56), although deaths due to cerebrovascular disease, airplane accidents, and suicides were elevated for USC (SMRs = 132, 360, and 218, respectively). The LLU graduates had a risk similar to that of the USC graduates for fatal cancer, with a mortality ratio (MR) of 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.67 to 1.26); but half the risk of fatal atherosclerotic disease, with MRs of 0.58 (0.46 to 0.73) and 0.66 (0.43 to 0.99) for coronary and cerebrovascular disease, respectively; and three times the risk of fatal airplane accidents. The overall mortality rate of LLU physicians was only 75% as high as that of the USC physicians and only 56% as high as that of the US male population at large. We attribute this reduced mortality mainly to the low cardiovascular mortality rates, which may be accounted for by the life-style of the substantial proportion of Seventh-day Adventists among LLU graduates. 
Inadequacy of saphenous vein grafts for cross-femoral venous bypass. A mathematic model of unilateral iliac vein obstruction was used to establish the theoretic basis for selecting saphenous vein or a larger diameter prosthetic cross-femoral venous bypass graft for relief of obstructive venous hypertension. Common femoral vein resting and postexercise peak flows, and common femoral vein and saphenous vein diameters were measured in 18 healthy individuals and used to estimate the pressure gradient (dP) across 20 cm long cross-femoral venous bypass grafts of saphenous vein or 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mm prosthetic conduits, in the presence of a transpelvic venous collateral network of varied cross section. The upper limits of normal for the gradients in our model (dPstd) were set at 4 mm Hg for resting flows and 6 mm Hg after exercise. Mean saphenous vein diameter was 4.3 +/- 0.22 mm, which was 36.5% +/- 1.73% of common femoral vein diameter. When the saphenous veins of two thirds of the individuals in our study were used as theoretic cross-femoral venous bypass conduits, greater than 80% of postobstruction peak cross-femoral venous bypass graft flow had to be carried by collaterals to maintain a gradient less than or equal to dPstd. We demonstrated that 4.5 to 6.0 mm diameter saphenous cross-femoral venous bypass grafts would be hemodynamically efficacious in relieving venous hypertension, but only when implanted in parallel with an existing venous collateral network that limited the preoperative dP to 4.5 to 7.5 mm Hg at resting flows and 7.0 to 11.5 mm Hg after exercise; only 44% of saphenous veins were adequate for cross-femoral venous bypass grafts by these criteria. 
Value of a programmed investigation unit: an audit study. A programmed investigation unit (PIU) was set up in a regional neuroscience centre. Its effects were assessed by measuring the savings associated with one particular investigation, myelography, which accounted for 50% of admissions to the PIU. Substantial savings appear to be possible, but accounting techniques allow wide variations in the estimated amounts. These benefits have to be measured against improvements which occurred simultaneously on the other wards. 
Comprehensive primary health care antiepileptic drug treatment programme in rural and semi-urban Kenya. ICBERG (International Community-based Epilepsy Research Group) A programme of antiepileptic treatment in a rural and semi-urban region in Kenya was assessed. Patients with generalised tonic-clonic seizures were treated according to one of two simple drug protocols. Health workers screened cases reported by key informants in the community. From the 529 patients identified by health workers as having active seizures 302 patients aged 6-65 years were recruited by a psychiatrist for therapy with carbamazepine or phenobarbitone. Treatment was supervised largely by primary health workers, and the programme was monitored by a research team, which assessed the effectiveness of treatment. Of the 249 patients who completed the study, 53% became seizure-free in the second 6 months of therapy, and another 26% had substantially (50% or more reduction) fewer seizures than in the 6 months before therapy. The similarity of these findings to those obtained in newly diagnosed patients in the developed world, the low drop-out rate, the low rate of withdrawal due to adverse effects, and the acceptable compliance with therapy indicate that health workers can monitor therapy adequately. Most patients had had several years of delay before starting therapy for their epilepsy, yet they responded well--a finding that does not support the suggestion that the disorder becomes intractable if not treated early. 
Maffucci's syndrome associated with intracranial enchondroma and aneurysm: case report. Maffucci's syndrome is a rare, congenital mesodermal dysplasia combined with dyschondroplasia and hemangiomatosis. Enchondromatous involvement of the skull bones is rare in this syndrome. A rare case of Maffucci's syndrome associated with enchondroma at the skull base, left internal carotid artery aneurysm, and goiter is reported. Two other previously reported cases of Maffucci's syndrome with associated aneurysms and the present case suggest that Maffucci's syndrome may be associated with aneurysm. 
Impact of local tumor relapse on patient survival after cobalt 60 plaque radiotherapy. The authors investigated the impact of local intraocular tumor relapse on survival in a matched-group comparison study of patients with primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma managed with cobalt 60 plaque radiotherapy. Sixty-two patients with local relapse were matched with an equal number of relapse-free patients in terms of known clinical prognostic factors for both melanoma-specific mortality (largest linear tumor dimension, location of anterior tumor margin, age) and local tumor relapse (location of posterior tumor margin). The follow-up of every relapse-free patient equaled or exceeded the interval to relapse for each matched patient with local relapse. The estimated 5-year survival (Kaplan-Meier) in the relapse-free patients was 87% (standard error = 4%), while that in the local relapse group was 58% (standard error = 6%). This difference is statistically significant (P less than 0.0001, log rank test). These results support the hypothesis that local tumor relapse after cobalt 60 plaque radiotherapy is an important post-treatment clinical indicator of the tumor's greater malignant potential and the patient's increased risk of melanoma-specific mortality. 
The results of surgical repair of acute tears of the posterior cruciate ligament. In 20 patients, the torn posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was repaired without reinforcement within two weeks after injury. Fourteen patients had a midsubstance tear, and in six the ligament was avulsed from the femur without bone. There were 11 isolated and nine combined injuries. The follow-up period ranged from two to 10.5 years. Postoperatively, all had posterior instability graded from 1+ to 2+. Nevertheless, the subjective results were good in 15 patients, fair in five, and poor in none. Posterior instability did not produce significant functional impairment of the knee for a considerable number of years. Suture alone cannot restore the PCL and is not strong enough to withstand the applied forces on the knee. 
Ratio of polyclonal-monoclonal prostate-specific antigen levels. Discrimination of nodal status in prostate tumors that produce low marker levels. The preliminary data we present in this report suggest that the ratio of polyclonal-monoclonal serum prostate-specific antigen levels may add clinically useful information to that obtained using serum prostate-specific antigen levels alone. We hypothesize that the diversity of prostate-specific antigen ratios observed in our data reflects a diversity in the antigenic and structural attributes of prostate-specific antigen molecules found in the sera of patients with prostate cancer. Further, this heterogeneity of molecules is a reflection of the diverse and altered metabolic state of human prostate cancer and appears to be related to biologic behavior in individual patients. 
Effects of hydralazine on cardiac performance in infants receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. To determine the effects of afterload reduction on cardiac performance during partial cardiopulmonary bypass, we administered hydralazine to infants who were either normotensive (n = 11) or hypertensive (n = 12) 1 hour after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was begun. Load-dependent and load-independent measures of cardiac performance and indexes of cerebral blood flow were measured. Infants in both groups had similar weight, heart rate, blood pressure, and inotropic support before ECMO. Shortening fraction was normal in both groups before ECMO (47 +/- 11% vs 49 +/- 10%; p greater than or equal to 0.05), decreased during ECMO (31 +/- 18% vs 39 +/- 12%; p greater than or equal to 0.05), and did not change after administration of hydralazine (31 +/- 12% vs 37 +/- 8%; p greater than or equal to 0.05). Cardiac output was normal in both groups before ECMO (176 +/- 71 vs 157 +/- 72 ml/kg per minute; p greater than or equal to 0.05), decreased during ECMO (120 +/- 80 vs 105 +/- 64 ml/kg per minute; p greater than or equal to 0.05), and did not change after hydralazine administration. Velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, an index of contractility (circumference per second), was normal in both groups before ECMO (1.96 +/- 0.57 vs 1.90 +/- 0.43 circ/sec; p greater than or equal to 0.05), decreased during ECMO (1.18 +/- 0.83 vs 1.56 +/- 0.58 circ/sec; p greater than or equal to 0.05), and did not change after hydralazine administration. The relationship between velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and wall stress was similar in both groups before ECMO, during ECMO, and after hydralazine administration. The cerebral blood flow resistance index was similar in both groups before ECMO (0.70 +/- 0.16 vs 0.70 +/- 0.20; p greater than or equal to 0.05), decreased during ECMO (0.45 +/- 0.13 vs 0.43 +/- 0.09; p greater than or equal to 0.05), and did not change after administration of hydralazine. We conclude that hydralazine does not improve cardiac performance during ECMO. 
Optimization of replacement of the ureter by ileum. Fifty patients for whom an ileal replacement of the ureter was indicated were prospectively randomized among 2 treatment groups according to the surgical technique used. In group 1 the standard operation was performed. In group 2 a tailored and valved (modified) ileal ureter was used. Patients were followed every 3 to 6 months for 12 to 28 months. Kidney functions were evaluated by 99m technetium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid scans and by determination of the 24-hour creatinine clearance. Urine cultures were obtained, and urine viscosity and flow rates were measured. A urographic study, including ascending cystography, was done every 6 months. Results indicated that the modified operation is functionally superior to the standard procedure. It provides efficient unidirectional flow of urine from the kidney to the bladder with less mucus secretion. This was ultimately reflected as better renal function when it was quantitated by renography and/or chemical clearance. 
Laser trabeculoplasty. Over a decade, laser trabeculoplasty has evolved from being a novel new treatment to one that is a commonly accepted intervention in the management of open-angle glaucoma. Despite its widespread use, however, there are still many unanswered questions about laser trabeculoplasty, including its mechanism of action and the ideal treatment parameters. In this review, we will discuss the history of the technique, the clinical experience, and some of the experimental studies that have been conducted to answer the questions regarding its mechanism of action.
