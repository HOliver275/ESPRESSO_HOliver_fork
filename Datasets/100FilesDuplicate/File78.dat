Literary neurologic syndromes. Alice in Wonderland. Many neurologic syndromes are named for literary characters. For example, the "Alice in Wonderland" syndrome of altered body perceptions, usually caused by migrainous ischemia, is so called because of the resemblance of its symptoms to the fluctuations in size and shape that plague the main character in Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice in Wonderland. The medical symptoms of distorted body images match the literary description so precisely that illustrations from the original book depict them very accurately. Because Lewis Carroll suffered from classic migraine headaches, scholars have speculated that he may have experienced this syndrome himself. 
Systemic adjuvant therapy in women with resected node-negative breast cancer. Currently, the role of adjuvant systemic therapy in women with node-negative breast cancer is being determined. Several studies of adjuvant hormonal therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy have demonstrated a moderate reduction in the risk of recurrence in the treated patients. With relatively limited follow-up, however, overall survival has not improved with use of adjuvant therapy. The use of prognostic factors to select those patients at highest risk for relapse is an active area of oncologic research. The decision to recommend adjuvant therapy necessitates assessment of the probability of recurrence, the expected reduction of risk with adjuvant therapy, the toxic effects of therapy, and the influence of treatment on the patient's overall quality of life. 
False-negative dipyridamole-thallium-201 myocardial imaging after caffeine infusion. The vasodilator effect of intravenously administered dipyridamole may be caused by an increase in endogenous plasma adenosine levels. We evaluated the effect of caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, on the diagnostic results of dipyridamole-201Tl myocardial imaging in eight patients with coronary artery disease. Caffeine infusion significantly attenuated the dipyridamole-induced fall in blood pressure and the accompanied increase in heart rate. The infusion of dipyridamole alone resulted in chest pain and ST-segment depressions on the electrocardiogram in four patients, whereas none of these problems occurred when the tests were repeated after caffeine. In six of eight patients, caffeine was responsible for false-negative dipyridamole-201Tl tests. Semiquantitive scores of the dipyridamole-induced 201Tl perfusion defects were decreased by caffeine from 9.0 +/- 0.9 to 2.0 +/- 1.1 points (p less than 0.05). Computerized analysis revealed a caffeine-mediated reduction in the percent reversibility of the images from 46% +/- 16% to 6% +/- 10% (p less than 0.05). We conclude that the use of caffeinated products prior to dipyridamole-201Tl testing may be responsible for false-negative findings. 
Investigation of varicella-zoster virus infection by polymerase chain reaction in the immunocompetent host with acute varicella. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method developed to detect varicella zoster virus (VZV) in clinical samples is based on amplifying sequences of viral gene 31, the coding region for glycoprotein II. Its sensitivity was evaluated by amplification from plasmid VZV DNA containing VZV gene 31; 45 copies were detected in 1 microgram of human DNA. In testing within 24 h after the onset of varicella exanthem, 21 (75%) of 28 lesion samples were positive by VZV PCR, whereas VZV was isolated from only 21% by a standard tissue culture method. Only 1 (3.3%) of 30 samples of oropharyngeal secretions but peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 8 (67%) of 12 patients were positive. The sensitivity and specificity of the VZV PCR method indicates its usefulness for investigating the pathogenesis of VZV infection. Direct contact with cutaneous lesions rather than respiratory secretions may be the most important route of VZV transmission from healthy individuals with acute varicella. 
Carcinoma (malignant mixed mullerian [mesodermal] tumor) of the uterus and ovary. Correlation of clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical features in 29 cases. We examined the histologic, immunohistochemical, and clinical features of a series of 23 endometrial, five cervical, and one ovarian carcinosarcomas (malignant mixed mullerian [mesodermal] tumors) and nine associated distant peritoneal metastases. The primary tumors all showed epithelial differentiation (cytokeratin and/or epithelial membrane antigen expression) of the carcinomatous component, while sarcomatous areas showed epithelial differentiation in all but one case. The metastases showed uniform staining for cytokeratin (eight of eight cases) and epithelial membrane antigen (eight of eight cases), including the spindle cell component that was present in four of nine cases. Desmin significantly changed the interpretation of rhabdomyosarcoma differentiation by refuting putative rhabdomyoblasts in two cases and identifying rhabdomyoblasts in two other cases where they were unrecognized on hematoxylineosin staining. S100 protein was positive in all five cases with chondrosarcoma differentiation. Muscle-specific actin and vimentin were positive in the sarcomatous component of all cases and in the carcinomatous component of seven and 10 cases, respectively. After immunostaining, heterologous elements were present in 18 of 29 cases (11 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, three cases of chondrosarcoma, three cases of mixed rhabdomyosarcoma and chondrosarcoma, and one case of liposarcoma). Only six of 27 patients with follow-up were disease free for 12 months or longer (associated with stage I or II disease, smaller size, no lymphatic invasion in the resection specimen, and no invasion of the outer two thirds of myometrium). Presence and type of heterologous elements, grade of sarcomatous or carcinomatous components, histologic type of carcinomatous component, gross appearance, presence of necrosis, or use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy did not affect outcome. Carcinosarcomas are clinically aggressive distinctive mixed epithelial-stromal neoplasms with histologic and immunohistochemical features that overlap with metaplastic carcinoma in many cases. 
Lack of association between neutropenia and the incidence of bacteremia associated with indwelling central venous catheters in febrile pediatric cancer patients. To assess the incidence of bacteremia in pediatric cancer patients with indwelling central venous catheters with fever, we reviewed the records of all 67 such patients sequentially admitted during a 10-month period at our institution. There were a total of 140 episodes of fever in these 67 patients. In 55 of the episodes (39%) patients were nonneutropenic (absolute neutrophil count, greater than 500/mm3); 85 episodes (61%) were associated with neutropenia. Twenty-four percent of all episodes of fever in nonneutropenic patients were related to bacteremia vs. 9.5% of episodes of fever in the presence of neutropenia (P less than 0.05). When clinical evidence of an exit site infection was absent, the incidence of bacteremia in the neutropenic and nonneutropenic groups was similar (11% in the neutropenic group; 10% in the nonneutropenic group). We conclude that bacteremia is frequently observed in febrile pediatric cancer patients with indwelling venous catheters who are not neutropenic, particularly if there is clinical evidence of an exit site infection. Thus empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted in all pediatric oncology patients with indwelling catheters who develop fever. 
High recovery of Haemophilus influenzae and group A streptococci in recurrent tonsillar infection or hypertrophy as compared with normal tonsils. One hundred and twenty-six patients who underwent tonsillectomy because of recurrent acute tonsillitis, tonsillar hypertrophy or sleep apnoea were evaluated by tonsillar core culturing. The sleep apnoea patients served as controls, since none of them had tonsillar hypertrophy at ENT examination or any history of recurrent acute tonsillitis, and thus their tonsillar core flora could be regarded as normal. The isolation rate of H. influenzae was much lower among sleep apnoea controls (2.7 per cent) than among either the patients with recurrent acute tonsillitis (20.3 per cent) or those with tonsillar hypertrophy (36.7 per cent) (p less than 0.05), as was that of group A streptococci, 5.4 per cent versus 16.9 and 20 per cent, respectively (though the latter differences were not statistically significant). The isolation frequencies of B. catarrhalis, pneumococci, group C and G streptococci did not differ between the three groups. The high tonsillar core recovery rates of H. influenzae and group A streptococci both in patients with recurrent acute tonsillitis and in those with tonsillar hypertrophy, as compared with normal controls, suggests the possible involvement of these bacteria in both conditions. 
Autoerotic death. A definition. A definition of autoerotic death is suggested that restricts the use of this term to accidental deaths that occur during individual, usually solitary, sexual activity in which a device, apparatus, or prop that was employed to enhance the sexual stimulation of the deceased in some way caused unintended death. The case of the autoerotic asphyxial death of a 48-year-old man is reported in order to demonstrate the application of this definition. 
A comparison of sucralfate with placebo in the treatment of esophageal ulcers following therapeutic endoscopic sclerotherapy of esophageal varices--a prospective controlled randomized trial. In 1984 Roark published the first report of a sucralfate treatment of esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy. Because this was an uncontrolled trial we planned a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study with 60 patients. After therapeutic paravariceal injection-sclerotherapy of esophageal varices, patients were randomly treated with sucralfate suspension or placebo. Time of treatment was limited to a maximum of 3 weeks and the dosage of sucralfate was 1 g q.i.d. (Ulcogant-Suspension). Healing was assessed by endoscopy at weekly intervals. Fifty-three patients (25 sucralfate, 28 placebo) were evaluable according to the protocol. No patient left the study because of side effects. At the start of the trial, the patients in the sucralfate group showed a larger ulcer area than the placebo group. There was a tendency to faster healing in the sucralfate group, especially in patients with deeper ulcerations. However, there was no significant difference in global healing between both treatment groups after 3 weeks. Sucralfate suspension may be of value in accelerating the healing process in esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy, especially in patients with deep ulcers. These results should be confirmed in further trials, in which patients should be stratified with respect to their ulcer volume and severity of liver disease. 
Cholestasis in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome: comparison between ultrasonographic and cholangiographic findings. Cholestasis in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome was systematically investigated by ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The two procedures were found to be complementary, and showed similar results in 56.2% of the cases. Ultrasonography was superior in detecting common bile duct wall thickening, whereas endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was superior in demonstrating intrahepatic narrowing of the biliary tract. 
Inaccuracy of pulse oximetry in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation. The accuracy of pulse oximetry was studied in a group of patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation. Measurements of arterial oxygen saturation from a finger and an ear probe were compared with those from a radial arterial blood sample analysed in vitro. Lower values were obtained using the pulse oximeter; the difference ranged from +2% to -11%. The discrepancies between pulse oximeter and laboratory oximeter readings were greater in this group of patients than in a control group who did not have tricuspid regurgitation. There was, however, no correlation between the magnitude of this discrepancy and either the peak central venous pressure or the venous pulse pressure. 
Subpopulations of B cells in germinal centers. III. HJ6, a monoclonal antibody, binds globoside and a subpopulation of germinal center B cells. To identify surface Ag uniquely expressed on human germinal center B cells, we produced a mouse mAb, HJ6. When tonsillar lymphocytes were examined, HJ6 did not label T cells and labeled only about half of PNA+ B cells that were HK23-. HJ6 did not label mononuclear cells from peripheral blood, splenocytes, and any of 29 cell lines including 23 B cell lines. This binding pattern of HJ6 was very similar to that of a mAb named 5B5. It was shown previously that 5B5 bound a glycolipid named CTH (CD77) and its Ag was expressed on HK23- PNA+ tonsillar lymphocytes and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Despite the similarity, HJ6 differed from 5B5: HJ6 did not stain Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and stained PNA+ tonsillar lymphocytes in the presence of a large concentration of galactose. When its binding to isolated glycolipids was studied, HJ6 was found to bind globoside and Forssman Ag and not to other glycolipids including CTH. When its binding to neutral glycolipids extracted from tonsillar lymphocytes was studied, HJ6 bound only globoside; Forssman Ag was not detected in tonsillar lymphocytes. Taken together, we conclude that globoside is a B cell Ag expressed on a subpopulation of germinal center B cells. 
Techniques for application of tissue adhesive for corneal perforations. We describe a modified technique of using cyanoacrylate adhesive to seal corneal perforations. Easily performed at the slit lamp, its advantages over previously described methods include a smooth, contoured collagen surface overlying the adhesive, which is easily wet by the tear film. Even greater comfort and protection are provided by the addition of a hydrophilic bandage lens or collagen shield. 
Inhibitory effects of procainamide on sympathetic nerve activity in humans. In experimental animals, procainamide causes hypotension and reductions in efferent vasoconstrictor sympathetic outflow that may result from ganglionic blockade or central nervous system sympathetic inhibition. To test the hypothesis that procainamide decreases sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in humans, we recorded postganglionic SNA in seven normal subjects in the baseline state and during infusions of procainamide HCl at 50 mg/min (loading) and 8 mg/min (maintenance). At the end of the loading infusion, mean arterial pressure (MAP) had decreased from 88.5 +/- 2.4 (mean +/- SEM) to 81.5 +/- 3.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), central venous pressure from 6.7 +/- 0.7 to 5.4 +/- 0.9 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), forearm vascular resistance (FVR) from 28 +/- 4.8 to 22.3 +/- 5.1 resistance units (p less than 0.05), and SNA from 259 +/- 47 to 94 +/- 26 units/min (p less than 0.05). These changes persisted during the maintenance infusion. Increased levels of SNA, FVR, and MAP provoked by the cold pressor test were reduced significantly by intravenous procainamide. In eight other subjects, intravenous procainamide HCl (15 mg/kg at 50 mg/min) caused dose-dependent inhibition of SNA that reversed as blood concentrations fell during drug washout. To determine if procainamide causes direct vasodilation, in nine subjects, graded infusions were delivered into the brachial artery at doses that produced no systemic effect. Ipsilateral FVR tended to increase during local intra-arterial infusion of procainamide. These data show that intravenous procainamide causes hypotension, vasodilation, and sympathetic withdrawal. Vasodilation does not result from a direct vasorelaxant effect of the drug. 
Sepsis after coronary bypass grafting: evidence for loss of the gut mucosal barrier. Postoperative infections may originate from a patient's gastrointestinal tract. We studied infections after coronary artery revascularization. Three hundred twenty-nine patients underwent coronary artery revascularization from January 1987 to March 1990. Eight of the 329 (2.4%) died; none of the deaths were infection related. Fifty-five culture-proven infections were identified in 22 of 321 survivors (6.8%); 9 infections (16%) were gram-positive, 5 (9%) were fungal, and 41 (75%) were gram-negative. Site of infections were respiratory tract, 58%; urinary tract, 18%; blood, 13%; and mediastinum, 11%. Ninety-six percent of respiratory tract and all urinary tract infections were gram-negative or fungal. There was no significant difference between infected and noninfected groups in sex, age, smoking history, preoperative hematocrit or leukocyte count, serum albumin level, or time on extracorporeal bypass. The infected group required intubation and nasogastric suction for a significantly longer time than the noninfected group (p less than 0.001). Time to enteral alimentation was significantly longer in the infected group (p less than 0.02). We were unable to correlate the number of infections with the lengths of intubation, nasogastric suction, or time to enteral alimentation. This study supports the concept of postoperative infections arising from bacterial translocation across the patient's gastrointestinal tract. The most significant risk factor is the length of the gastrointestinal tract disuse. 
Percutaneous transjugular portosystemic shunt. OBJECTIVE.--To determine the effectiveness of the Palmaz balloon expandable stent for the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. The device is designed to achieve portal decompression in patients with variceal hemorrhage secondary to portal hypertension. DESIGN.--Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting was performed in eight patients during a 9-month period. Mean follow-up was 5 months. PATIENTS.--All patients had cirrhosis with portal hypertension and varices. Bleeding occurred in seven patients from esophageal varices and in one patient from hemorrhoids. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Shunt patency and recurrent variceal hemorrhage. RESULTS.--Shunts created from a transjugular approach between a hepatic and a portal vein (diameters of 8 to 12 mm) lowered the average portosystemic pressure gradient from 36 to 11 mm Hg. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.7 days. Complete variceal decompression after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement was identified endoscopically in all eight patients. The patient treated for hemorrhoids rebled and was treated successfully by transfemoral balloon expansion of the shunt diameter from 8 to 12 mm. All shunts were patent at 1 to 9 months (mean, 5 months) of follow-up. CONCLUSION.--Initial results suggest that transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is a safe and effective method of portal decompression for the treatment of variceal hemorrhage. 
Phase I and pharmacokinetic trial of intraperitoneal etoposide in combination with the multidrug-resistance-modulating agent dipyridamole. Dipyridamole synergistically enhances the sensitivity of human ovarian carcinoma cells to etoposide in vitro. We conducted a phase I trial to investigate the feasibility of using dipyridamole to selectively increase the sensitivity to etoposide of tumors confined to the peritoneal cavity. Etoposide and dipyridamole were administered as a continuous 72-hour intraperitoneal infusion to 16 patients. The maximum tolerated dose of etoposide was 175 mg/m2 per day when administered with dipyridamole at a fixed dose of 24 mg/m2 per day. Dose-limiting toxic effects were leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. No other major toxic effects were observed. The free peritoneal etoposide and dipyridamole concentrations varied with the etoposide dose rate, reaching 218.9 and 25.3 microM, respectively, at an etoposide dose rate of 175 mg/m2 per day. The free etoposide and dipyridamole concentrations attained were well within the range needed for synergistic interaction. 
Identification of 17 independent mutations responsible for human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency. Complete hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency causes the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, an X-linked, purine metabolism disorder manifested by hyperuricemia, hyperuricaciduria, and neurologic dysfunction. Partial HPRT deficiency causes hyperuricemia and gout. One requirement for understanding the molecular basis of HPRT deficiency is the determination of which amino acids in this salvage enzyme are necessary for structural or catalytic competence. In this study we have used the PCR coupled with direct sequencing to determine the nucleotide and subsequent amino acid changes in 22 subjects representing 17 unrelated kindreds from the United Kingdom. These mutations were confirmed by using either RNase mapping or Southern analyses. In addition, experiments were done to determine enzyme activity and electrophoretic mobility, and predictive paradigms were used to study the impact of these amino acid substitutions on secondary structure. 
Involvement of neutrophils in postischaemic damage to the small intestine. Haemorrhagic mucosal lesions are produced during intestinal ischaemia and after reperfusion probably mediated by oxygen radicals. Oxygen radicals react with cell membrane lipids and induce cell damage by peroxidation and induce accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the tissue. The aim of the study was to elucidate the involvement of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in post-ischaemic intestinal damage. Intestinal ischaemia was induced in cats by partial occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. Samples from the small intestine were excised before and at the end of the two hour hypotensive period as well as 10 minutes and 60 minutes after reperfusion. Conjugated dienes, myeloperoxidase, and the purine metabolites were determined in the samples. The tissue was also examined histologically. Seven cats were treated before reperfusion with a monoclonal antibody (IB4) which inhibits leucocyte adherence to endothelial cells and its subsequent activation. After reperfusion myeloperoxidase activity increased and the ischaemic mucosal lesions worsened significantly. IB4 treatment prevented an increase in post-hypotensive myeloperoxidase activity and attenuated the normally observed severe mucosal lesions. We conclude that the severe post-ischaemic lesions are induced by polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Such mucosal injury may be appreciably reduced by blocking leucocyte adherence with IB4. 
Significance of atherosclerotic changes of the ascending aorta during coronary bypass surgery with intraoperative detection by echography. Intraoperative echographic studies of the ascending aorta were carried out on 100 of 222 patients having primary coronary bypass surgeries between May 1987 and December 1988. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of echographic study in evaluating the nature of atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta and its incidence and relationship to perioperative cerebrovascular complications in coronary bypass surgery. It was possible to obtain clear echographic images of the aortic wall in these 100 patients which were divided into two groups according to the degree of the degenerative process. Three of 13 patients (23%) (Group II) with severe atherosclerotic changes, suffered perioperative cerebrovascular complications, and early surgical mortality in 2 patients (15%) was caused by cerebrovascular complications. These complications were not seen in 87 patients with less than moderate atherosclerotic changes (Group I). 
Genetic dissection of susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in inbred mice. Mice of some inbred strains, such as 21-day-old DBA/2J mice, have generalized convulsions when exposed to intense auditory stimulation. Analysis of susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in BXD recombinant inbred strains has demonstrated the influence of at least three loci. One locus, Asp-1, is located on chromosome 12 between Ah and D12Nyu1; another locus, Asp-2, is on chromosome 4, tightly linked to b. Here we report evidence that Asp-2 is located within an 8-centimorgan segment distal to b and that Asp-3 is linked to Mtv-1 on chromosome 7. We also present evidence that these three loci account for most of the heritable variation in susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in crosses of DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice and that susceptibility to audiogenic seizures is influenced by genomic imprinting. Thus, genomic imprinting may complicate linkage and mapping studies and should be considered in analyses of complex modes of inheritance. 
Genetic analysis of microtubule motor proteins in Drosophila: a mutation at the ncd locus is a dominant enhancer of nod. The nod (no distributive disjunction) and the ncd (non-claret disjunctional) mutations are both female-specific, recessive meiotic mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations at either locus show high frequencies of nondisjunction at meiosis I and both have been shown to encode kinesin-like proteins. Unlike the ncd mutation, which affects all chromosome pairs, the nod mutation affects only the disjunction of nonexchange chromosomes. Although both the nod and ncd mutations are fully recessive, females doubly heterozygous for nod and ncd mutations show levels of X and fourth chromosome nondisjunction that are 6- to 35-fold above those observed in control females. Exchange between chromosomes can suppress this effect; thus, only nonexchange chromosomes segregating via the distributive system are sensitive in double heterozygotes. Since the phenotype of double heterozygotes mimics that of the nod mutation, we infer that ncd is a dominant enhancer of nod. Failure of ncd to fully complement nod reveals the chromosome segregation machinery to be dosage sensitive. The probability that the distributive system will fail is enhanced in females simultaneously haploinsufficient at the nod and ncd loci. 
Force-velocity and 30-s Wingate tests in boys at high and low altitudes. The effects of high altitude (HA, 3,700 m) on performance during a force-velocity test (maximal anaerobic power, MAnP) and a 30-s Wingate test (mean power, P) were studied in boys 7-15 yr of age. Forty-seven children acclimatized to HA were compared with 101 living at low altitude (LA, 330 m). They had the same good nutritional status and the same level of physical activities [average 5.4 +/- 1.1 (SD) and 5.2 +/- 1.9 h/wk at HA and LA, respectively]. They performed the two tests using the same calibrated cycle ergometer. For the Wingate test, O2 uptake (VO2) during the 30 s and the peak of blood lactate concentration ([L]p) during the recovery were also measured. No difference in MAnP was observed between HA and LA. P, [L]p, and VO2 were lower at HA. This suggests that the altitude of 3,700 m did not affect the performance of the force-velocity test but reduced that of the Wingate test. This decrease in P was linked to a lower participation of glycolysis and aerobic metabolism. The latter is related to a reduced aerobic performance at HA. In addition, the slopes of the relationships between age and MAnP, P, and [L]p were the same at HA and LA, indicating that chronic hypoxia did not alter the development of the anaerobic metabolism during puberty. 
Importance of ulceration of carotid plaque in determining symptoms of cerebral ischemia. In order to investigate the relationship between carotid plaque morphology and symptoms of cerebral ischemia, a prospective clinicopathological study was performed. Ninety consecutive intact carotid plaques obtained from surgery and 43 carotid plaques from cadavers without symptoms of cerebral ischemia were evaluated. Ulceration and mural thrombus were the only morphologic findings statistically correlated to the presence of hemispheric symptoms (p less than 0.02). Intramural hemorrhage was more common in patients with hemispheric symptoms but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31). Plaque causing high degree stenosis had a higher incidence of intramural hemorrhage (p = 0.04) and ulceration (p less than 0.02). Ulceration of plaque plays a major role in the onset of hemispheric symptoms. The results of our study support the hypothesis that in the majority of the cases, hemispheric symptoms are embolic in nature. 
Role of a soy-based lactose-free formula in the outpatient management of diarrhea. The introduction of a soy-based, lactose-free formula during the acute phase of diarrheal illness in infants has been shown to reduce stool output and duration of diarrhea in hospitalized patients. In the United States, most infants with acute diarrhea are treated as outpatients. In the present study, infants with diarrhea who were treated as outpatients were randomly assigned to receive either a soy-based, lactose-free formula alternating with oral rehydration solution from the beginning of therapy ("early feeding") or oral rehydration solution alone for the first 24 hours of therapy, followed by a soy-based, lactose-free formula alternating with oral rehydration solution (control group). Twenty-nine infants were randomly assigned to the early-feeding group and 27 to the control group. Twenty-one (72%) of 29 in the early-feeding group resolved their diarrhea at the end of 48 hours of therapy compared with 12 (44%) of 27 in the group fed oral rehydration solution only (P = .02). It is concluded that the introduction of a soy-based, lactose-free formula from the beginning of therapy for acute diarrhea in children treated as outpatients is safe and may shorten duration of diarrhea while maintaining adequate caloric intake. 
Identification of spirochetes related to Treponema pallidum in necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and chronic periodontitis. BACKGROUND. Spirochetes are commonly associated with periodontal disease, but it is not known whether these treponemes are pathogenic or merely opportunistic. We sought to determine whether spirochetes present in periodontal disease share antigens thought to be unique to spirochetes that are known pathogens. METHODS. We examined dental plaque from 24 healthy subjects, from ulcerative sites in 17 patients with ulcerative gingivitis, and from areas of involvement in 19 patients with chronic periodontitis, using an immunocyto-chemical technique with monoclonal antibodies against pathogen-specific determinants on 47-kd and 37-kd molecules from Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. Serum was tested against T. pallidum by immunoblotting and by serologic assays for syphilis. RESULTS. Spirochetes with a pathogen-specific epitope on a 47-kd molecule were not found in plaque samples from any of the 24 healthy subjects, but they were identified in plaque samples from 11 of 17 patients with ulcerative gingivitis (P less than 0.001) and from 10 of 19 patients with periodontitis (P less than 0.01). Monoclonal antibodies directed against a 37-kd molecule reacted with spirochetes in plaque samples from 1 of 14 controls, from all 11 patients with gingivitis from whom samples could be obtained (P less than 0.001), and from 14 of 19 patients with periodontitis (P less than 0.001). Five of 18 normal subjects had IgG against 47-kd and 37-kd molecules, but none had IgG against 14-kd or 12-kd molecules from T. pallidum subspecies pallidum. Among 19 patients with ulcerative gingivitis, IgG was identified against 47-kd molecules in 15, against 37-kd molecules in 12, against 14-kd molecules in 4, and against 12-kd molecules in 15. CONCLUSIONS. The spirochetes found in dental plaque from patients with ulcerative gingivitis or chronic periodontitis have antigens that are thought to be unique to pathogenic treponemes. This close antigenic relation suggests that T. pallidum or a closely related organism may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. 
Tissue injury caused by deposition of immune complexes is L-arginine dependent. Nitric oxide (NO.), a free radical that is generated from L-arginine by stimulated endothelial cells, neutrophils, activated macrophages, and other cell types, reacts with superoxide anion (O2.-) to form peroxynitrite, which itself may be tissue toxic or can then react further to form the highly reactive and toxic hydroxyl radical (HO.). Because vascular injury produced by tissue deposition of immune complexes is linked to formation of toxic products derived from activated neutrophils, we have assessed whether immune complex-induced injury of rat lung and dermal vasculature is arginine dependent. The arginine analogue, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (N-MeArg), which blocks NO. formation, protects against immune complex-induced vascular injury in rats. The protective effects of N-MeArg are reversed by the presence of L-arginine but not D-arginine. Additionally, in the absence of N-MeArg, injury is enhanced by the presence of L-arginine but not by D-arginine. Protection by N-MeArg is not associated with diminished recruitment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from animals undergoing immune complex deposition in lung contain the decomposition products of NO.--namely, nitrite and nitrate. In the presence of N-MeArg these products are greatly diminished. These data suggest that immune complex-induced injury of rat lung and skin is L-arginine dependent. These data also suggest that in vivo metabolic products of L-arginine, such as NO(.), are directly or indirectly linked to immune complex-induced tissue injury. 
Plasma postheparin diamine oxidase in patients with small intestinal lymphoma. Diamine oxidase (DAO) is an enzyme located almost exclusively in villus tip enterocytes. Its plasma activity is enhanced by intravenous heparin which releases the enzymes from small bowel enterocytes into the blood. Plasma postheparin DAO (PHD) values have been shown to be significantly lower in patients with malabsorption and villous atrophy, thus suggesting that PHD reflects the mature enterocytic mass. In this study we have assayed PHD in five patients with small bowel lymphoma (two with immunoproliferative small intestinal disease [IPSID] and three with non-IPSID lymphoma) associated with malabsorption syndrome and small bowel mucosa atrophy. The PHD test was performed at diagnosis, after partial or complete remission induced by chemotherapy, and during the follow-up. The PHD values, very low at diagnosis (0.66 +/- 0.12 U/ml), increased during chemotherapy and reached the normal range (greater than 3.7 U/ml) when complete remission occurred. The PHD values rapidly and consistently decreased whenever the disease relapsed. Our data indicate that in patients with small bowel lymphoma PHD test is a sensitive marker of small bowel mucosa damage and suggest that it could be useful in monitoring the recovery of mucosal lesions induced by chemotherapy. 
Comparison of acute and chronic protein-energy malnutrition on host antitumor immune mechanisms. Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) is prevalent in cancer patients. However, the effect of PCM on anti-tumor immunity is unclear and critically important in an era of improving results with adoptive immunotherapy. This study examined the effect of short- and long-term PCM on tumor-specific and natural immune effector mechanisms in a murine neuroblastoma (C1300 NRB) model. A/J mice received an isocaloric 2.5% or 24% casein diet for 3 or 8 weeks before inoculation with tumor. Three weeks later lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested for determination of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. Both 3 and 8 weeks of PCM significantly reduced mean total body weight by 25% (p less than 0.001) and 41% (p less than 0.001), respectively, compared with regularly nourished mice. Short-term PCM did not inhibit CTL or NK cytotoxicity, whereas long-term PCM significantly diminished CTL generation (p less than 0.001) but preserved NK cytotoxic function. These results indicate that CTL development against autologous tumor, in contrast to basal NK function, is dependent on host nutritional status. Mean tumor growth, determined by tumor-weight to carcass-weight ratio, was unchanged for both short- and long-term protein-energy deprived groups compared with results in regularly nourished mice. These findings suggest that NK function is the predominant effector mechanism inhibiting C1300 NRB growth and that NK tumoricidal capacity is preserved during PCM. 
Single vs. double stapling technique in colorectal surgery. A prospective randomized trial. Seventy patients after rectosigmoid resection were randomized to a rectal anastomosis either in the single or double stapling technique. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. A trend in favor of the double stapling technique was noted: 2.8 percent clinical leaks vs. 8.6 percent in the single stapling technique. 
Follicular mucinosis: histopathologic review of 33 cases. Among 33 patients with the histologic diagnosis of follicular mucinosis (alopecia mucinosa) made at our institution between 1982 and 1989, 9 had mycosis fungoides diagnosed concomitantly. Three other patients had lymphoproliferative disorders, and two had Kaposi's sarcoma. Analysis of biopsy features such as epidermal lymphocytic exocytosis, periappendageal infiltrate, and deposition of mucin revealed no predominant finding that distinguished a benign course from mycosis fungoides. A predominance of eosinophils in the infiltrate was suggestive of benign follicular mucinosis rather than mycosis fungoides. Gene rearrangement studies detected three clones in three patients with follicular mucinosis; two were in patients with mycosis fungoides, and one was in a patient with dermatitis. The outcome of these three patients is pending further follow-up. No histopathologic or clinical features distinguished these patients from the others. 
CSF changes in a longitudinal study of 124 neurologically normal HIV-1-infected U.S. Air Force personnel. Over a 2 year period, 124 neurologically normal HIV-1-infected patients had three successive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations approximately 1 year apart. Immunological status as measured by absolute CD4 counts in the blood identified two groups of patients over time: (a) a group with progressive CD4 decline (66 patients), and (b) a group with stable CD4 counts (58 patients). These two study groups provided us the opportunity to compare CSF changes (cells, protein, albumin index, IgG, IgG index, and IgG synthesis rate) in neurologically normal individuals with respect to immunological status over time. We found significantly increased intrathecal cellular response and IgG production over time independent of CD4 group. We conclude that any clinical study comparing CSF findings in neurologically symptomatic HIV-infected individuals must recognize and control for these CSF changes in neurologically asymptomatic patients. 
Tolerance of the carotid-sheath contents to brachytherapy: an experimental study. Tumor invasion of the carotid artery is a potential indication for brachytherapy, which delivers a high dose of irradiation to residual tumor while limiting the dose to adjacent healthy tissues. The tolerance of carotid-sheath contents to varying doses of brachytherapy, however, has not been clearly established. In order to evaluate brachytherapy effects on carotid-sheath contents, after-loading catheters were implanted bilaterally in 3 groups of 6 rabbits each (18 rabbits). Iridium 192 brachytherapy doses of either 5000 cGy (rad), 9000 cGy, or 13,000 cGy were delivered unilaterally, with the contralateral neck serving as a nonirradiated control in each animal. There were no carotid ruptures and wound healing was normal. Two animals from each group were killed at 6, 20, and 48 weeks. Even at the highest dose (13,000 cGy), nerve conduction studies performed on the vagus nerve prior to sacrifice revealed no increased latency, histologic changes were minimal, and carotid arteries were patent. These observations suggest that the carotid-sheath contents in healthy rabbits could tolerate high doses (up to 13,000 cGy) of low-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy without complications. 
Synovial fluid immunocytology in the diagnosis of leukemic synovitis. We describe a patient with leukemic synovitis complicating acute lymphoplastic leukemia. Leukemic cells were identified in the synovial fluid by an indirect immunofluorescent technique using monoclonal antibodies against early B cell antigens. Since focal leukemic lesions may be missed in synovial biopsy specimens, immunocytological analysis of joint fluids may facilitate early diagnosis of leukemic arthritis. 
Echinococcosis (Hydatid disease): lessons from experience with 59 patients. The records of 59 patients with echinococcal hydatid disease were reviewed. Ultrasonic and computed tomographic imaging were found to be the most reliable diagnostic procedures. Thirty-seven patients with large symptomatic cysts underwent surgery. Most often, conservative extraction of the inner embryonic membranes proved effective, but cysts not extensively involving vital structures were totally excised. Cetrimide became the local scolecidal agent of choice; a role for albendazole in systemic chemotherapy is anticipated. Elective surgery in 30 patients was safe, but urgent surgery in seven patients with acute complications from cyst rupture was followed by substantial morbidity and mortality. 
Abnormal automatic rhythms in ischemic Purkinje fibers are modulated by a specific alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype. BACKGROUND. Recent advances in adrenergic pharmacology have made possible the identification of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes using the specific blockers chloroethylclonidine and WB 4101. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the present study, we used these two blockers to determine the mechanisms responsible for automatic rhythms occurring during simulated ischemia and reperfusion of isolated canine Purkinje fibers. Experiments were done in the presence of propranolol to minimize beta-adrenergic contributions to the rhythms studied. In the control situation, all fibers showed membrane potentials greater than -90 mV and normal automatic rhythms. During simulated ischemia, membrane potential depolarized to the -60 mV range. Abnormal automaticity was seen in 20% of fibers not treated with phenylephrine and in 50% of those superfused with 1 x 10(-7) M phenylephrine. The incidence of abnormal automaticity was reduced to 0% by WB 4101 (which blocks phosphoinositide metabolic effects of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in the heart) and was increased to 90% by chloroethylclonidine (which blocks Na-K pump-stimulating effects of alpha-agonists). Moreover, the ischemic fibers were significantly more hyperpolarized during superfusion with WB 4101 than with chloroethylclonidine. Triggered activity induced by delayed or early after depolarizations was not seen in any experiment. CONCLUSIONS. Automatic arrhythmias induced by alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation during simulated ischemia may be attributed to a specific alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtype that is blocked by WB 4101. These results have important implications with respect to the induction of arrhythmias in the setting of ischemia and the means for their prevention or treatment. 
Continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil plus weekly cisplatin for pancreatic carcinoma. A Mid-Atlantic Oncology Program study. Fifty-six previously untreated patients with biopsy-proven, locally advanced or metastatic and measurable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with the combination of a protracted intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and low dose weekly bolus cisplatin administered continuously for 10 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period. The objective response rate was 16% with two patients (4%) achieving a complete response (confidence intervals, 8% to 29%). The median survival time for all treated patients was 5.8 months; however, 26% of all patients were alive at 1 year. Both median survival time and the proportion alive at 1 year exceed that of prior reports involving large patient groups, possibly due to better patient selection. 
Mycotic aneurysm of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery in a case of infective endocarditis. Mycotic aneurysms of the celiac artery are extremely rare, and in our review of the literature we found that in only one case was it due to infective endocarditis. In our case a 19-year-old female patient with culture-negative infective endocarditis presented with pain in the epigastric area. A celiac artery aneurysm was diagnosed by ultrasonography and confirmed on CT scan and angiography, which also demonstrated an associated aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery. Since excellent collateral circulation was present, simple ligation of the two aneurysms was performed. The patient presented no major complications in the postoperative course. 
Impaired phonological reading in primary degenerative dementia. This case study reports the profile of preserved and impaired capacities in a left-handed patient suffering from primary degenerative dementia of unknown aetiology. She was remarkable because her relatively preserved object naming and semantic categorization abilities contrasted with severe deficits in speech fluency, oral reading, inability to execute spoken and written commands, and severely impaired auditory-verbal short-term memory. Her reading disorder could be characterized as a disturbance of assembled phonology. She had great difficulty reading pronounceable nonwords, but she could correctly read irregular words. She showed effects of word imageability or concreteness (more than word frequency). She also showed effects of part-of-speech, where nouns and adjectives were read more easily than inflected verbs. She had difficulty reading function words. The syntactic category effects could be proven (by hierarchical log-linear analysis) not to be an artefact of imageability differences between verbs, adjectives and nouns. In reading aloud she made visual and morphological errors, but no semantic errors. This interesting pattern of preserved semantic information and disrupted phonological processing is unusual in dementia and contrasts with the severe dysnomia of patients with surface dyslexia who are able to read by the indirect, assembly-of-phonology route and show better reading of nonwords than irregular words. Her reading by a direct visual-semantic route appeared to be associated with relatively intact object naming, concrete word reading, and irregular word reading. This selective impairment of phonological reading in the context of partly preserved semantic abilities was interpreted as confirmation of the dissociability of language functions in primary degenerative dementia. 
Acanthosis nigricans and a rectal carcinoid. Malignant acanthosis nigricans is often related to adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract, but it has also been found to coexist with tumors of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation system. It can precede, accompany, or follow the appearance of the underlying tumor. Evaluation of our patient's new-onset acanthosis nigricans led to the discovery of an asymptomatic rectal carcinoid tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first report of acanthosis nigricans associated with a carcinoid tumor of the rectum. It emphasizes the importance of considering underlying malignancy in the evaluation of patients with acanthosis nigricans. 
Piezoelectric lithotripsy for gallstones: analysis of results in patients with extended selection. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is successful in fragmenting gallstones, but less than 28 per cent of patients with gallstone disease fulfil the conventional criteria for treatment. However, no data exist to substantiate these selection criteria. In this study, the selection criteria were broadened to include patients with radiolucent stones of any size and number, and radio-opaque stones less than 3 cm in diameter. To date; 108 symptomatic patients with gallstones have received treatment. All patients received up to six outpatient sessions of ESWL (6000 shock waves per session) without sedation or analgesia. The dissolution therapy consisted of combined bile salt and terpene administration. The clearance rates were 9 per cent within 2 months, 21 per cent at 2-4 months, 38 per cent at 4-8 months, 60 per cent at 8-12 months, and 78 per cent at 12-18 months. Of patients with a successful outcome only 19 (18 per cent) would have satisfied traditional selection criteria. There have been no significant complications except in one patient who developed mild acute pancreatitis, which settled on conservative treatment, and two patients who developed acute cholecystitis. This study would suggest that the previously accepted selection criteria underestimate the number of patients suitable for gallstone ESWL and dissolution therapy. 
Expression of Her-2/neu oncogene protein product and epidermal growth factor receptors in surgical specimens of human breast cancers. Her-2/neu protein product was immunocytochemically analyzed in 139 breast cancers. Epidermal growth factor receptors were similarly analyzed in 74 breast cancers from the same patient pool. These results were also separated on the basis of estrogen receptor proteins and of combined aneuploidy with elevated S-phase from flow cytometry. Invasive breast cancer yielded a positive label for Her-2/neu protein (26%) and for epidermal growth factor receptor (25%), with no significant difference. Correlations with estrogen receptor labeling yielded differences significant inversely for both Her-2/neu protein (p less than 0.02) and epidermal growth factor receptor (p less than 0.01). Positive Her-2/neu protein labels correlated with a positive combination of aneuploidy and elevated S-phase (37%) and a negative combination of aneuploidy and elevated S-phase (21%), with a statistically nonsignificant difference. Positive epidermal growth factor receptor cases with aneuploidy and an elevated S-phase (75%) and without aneuploidy and elevated S-phase (42%) did differ with significance at p less than 0.05. There were eight cases positive for both Her-2/neu protein and epidermal growth factor receptor, four of six cases with negative estrogen receptor, four of six cases with negative estrogen receptor, six of six cases aneuploid, and five of six cases with an elevated S-phase. All eight cases had threatening disease--either stage III or stage IV, with one case of extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (comedo). Correlation of negative Her-2/neu protein with negative epidermal growth factor receptor was significant (p less than 0.05) in 74 cases. However, positive Her-2/neu protein did not correlate with positive epidermal growth factor receptor; there was a trend toward inverse correlation. We conclude that epidermal growth factor receptor labeling results show similarities to Her-2/neu protein results, but epidermal growth factor receptor tended to correlate with unfavorable ploidy and S-phase. Epidermal growth factor receptor labeling might be useful in breast cancers with macrocysts reported to show high epidermal growth factor activity. 
Delirium in an elderly woman possibly associated with administration of misoprostol. Misoprostol has been associated with adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal symptoms, gynecologic problems, and headache. Changes in mental status, however, have not been reported. We present a case in which an 89-year-old woman in a long-term care facility became confused after the initiation of misoprostol therapy. The patient's change in mental status was first reported nine days after the initiation of therapy. Her delirium significantly improved after misoprostol was discontinued and her mental status returned to normal within a week. Because no other factors related to this patient changed significantly, the delirium experienced by this patient possibly resulted from misoprostol therapy. 
Recurrence rates of treated basal cell carcinomas. Part 1: Overview. This is the first article in a series reviewing the extensive experience of the Oncology Section of the Skin and Cancer Unit, from 1955 through 1982, with 5755 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) treated by curettage-electrodesiccation, surgical excision, or x-ray therapy. Recurrence rates were calculated by three methods for each of the treatment modalities: 1) by the raw recurrence rate method; 2) by the "strict" 5-year recurrence rate method; and 3) by modification of the life-table method. Our analyses show that the last method best approximates the true recurrence rate. Primary (previously untreated) BCCs had a 5-year recurrence rate of 10.6% (standard error 0.6%), and previously treated BCCs had a rate of 15.4% (standard error 1.3%) (P = .0002). The greatest risk for recurrence of treated primary BCCs occurred 1 to 4 years after therapy. It is concluded that recurrence rates of primary BCCs should be reported separately from those of previously treated BCCs and that the modified life-table method is best suited to calculate 5-year recurrence rates. 
Specific detection of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis by DNA hybridisation with a fragment of the insertion element IS900. This paper describes the evaluation of a newly developed DNA probe for Mycobacterium paratuberculosis. DNA probe PCR278 is a 278 bp fragment obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 5'-region of IS900, an insertion element contained in the genome of M paratuberculosis. This DNA probe can specifically distinguish M paratuberculosis from a wide range of other organisms, including members of the M avium-M intracellulare complex. When used in conjunction with the PCR amplification technique DNA probe PCR278 could detect as little as 10 fg (equivalent to two genomes) starting material of M paratuberculosis genomic DNA. Use of PCR amplification assays based on IS900, for the detection of M paratuberculosis, and homologous IS elements found in disease isolates of M avium should greatly help our understanding of the role of these organisms in Crohn's disease and other chronic inflammatory disorders. 
Angiosarcoma at the site of a Dacron vascular prosthesis: a case report and literature review. Four of 32 reported sarcomas related to the aorta have arisen around previously placed aortic vascular prostheses suggesting that the graft may have been an etiologic factor. Our recent experience with such an angiosarcoma arising around a Dacron aortic graft prompted a review of the lesion to identify risk factors, diagnostic approaches, and treatment options. The diagnosis of these sarcomas is seldom made before operation. Animal studies have implicated plastic polymers including Dacron as carcinogenic materials capable of inducing sarcoma in 7% to 50% of exposures. Because of the rarity of these tumors and the thousands of vascular implants used over the past 30 years, it is unlikely that this degree of risk can be extrapolated to humans. However, a tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis of any mass or thromboembolic event associated with a vascular prosthesis. 
The use of bone allografts for limb salvage in high-grade extremity osteosarcoma. Limb preservation is increasingly being employed in the local treatment of high-grade extremity osteosarcoma. Bone allografts used to reconstruct the bony defects following tumor resection offer many advantages, including joint reconstruction and incorporation of the graft to the host bone in these relatively young patients. The results of 53 patients 30 years of age or younger were assessed to determine functional outcome. Fresh-frozen allografts were employed as osteoarticular grafts, allograft-arthrodeses, allograft-prosthesis composites, or intercalary grafts. Follow-up intervals averaged 25 months (range, two to 63 months). Life-table analysis showed that the probability of a satisfactory functional result was 73% if local tumor recurrences were excluded. Complications included 16 infections, six fractures, 12 nonunions, and six unstable joints. There were five local recurrences. Eighteen grafts ultimately failed, and in six patients, this resulted in an above-knee amputation. An additional five received a second graft. The functional "end results" of the 38 patients with two or more years of follow-up examinations were 70% satisfactory in those without a local recurrence. There was no statistically significant difference in functional outcome or local or distant relapse in those patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy. The authors conclude that allografts can be used for limb reconstruction in patients with high-grade osteosarcoma who receive aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy. The functional results are comparable to other methods of reconstruction, and once incorporated by the host, offer the advantage of longevity, compared with metallic implants. 
Thoracic manifestations after esophageal variceal sclerotherapy. Endoscopic esophageal variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) is often used in the treatment of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to esophageal varices. We retrospectively reviewed the Mayo Clinic experience with EVS between 1980 and 1989 to determine the incidence of thoracic manifestations and chest roentgenographic abnormalities associated with this procedure. The study population consisted of 223 patients who underwent 390 EVS procedures. In all patients, chest roentgenography was done before and after EVS. Ethanolamine oleate or tetradecyl sulfate was used as the sclerosant. Fever, chest pain, and odynophagia were frequent findings after EVS and tended to be short-lived. Local complications at the site of injection, such as esophageal perforation (in 1% of EVS procedures) and abscess (in 0.3%), were infrequent but associated with substantial mortality. Esophageal stricture was noted as a late complication in less than 10% of patients, and clinically recognized aspiration pneumonitis was rare. Respiratory insufficiency developed after 14 EVS procedures. Chest roentgenographic abnormalities, which were commonly detected (after 85% of EVS procedures) but were rarely of clinical significance, included retrocardiac or mediastinal widening or densities (in 35%), pleural effusions (in 27%), atelectasis (in 12%), and pulmonary infiltrates (in 9%). Most thoracic manifestations after EVS are likely due to a local inflammatory response to the sclerosant. 
Primary and metastatic breast carcinoma: initial clinical evaluation with PET with the radiolabeled glucose analogue 2-[F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose. The authors assessed whether breast cancers can be detected by means of positron emission tomography (PET) with the positron-emitter-labeled glucose analogue 2-[fluorine-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). In 12 patients with primary and/or metastatic breast cancer, PET images of F-18 distribution in vivo were obtained approximately 1 hour after intravenous injection of 10 mCi of FDG. Scan findings were correlated with other imaging data and physical examination and biopsy results. Ten of 10 primary breast cancers were imaged by means of FDG PET with a tumor:background FDG uptake ratio of 8.1 (median). Ten of 10 bone metastases were imaged with a tumor:normal bone uptake ratio of 6.05 (median). Five of five known soft-tissue metastases and four previously unsuspected nodal lesions were found with PET. No false-positive foci of FDG uptake were demonstrated. In two cases with negative mammograms due to dense breast parenchyma, FDG PET clearly delineated the primary tumors. These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility and substantial potential of PET scanning with FDG to detect and localize both primary and metastatic breast cancers. 
Cell population depletion associated with fetal alcohol brain damage: mechanisms of BAC-dependent cell loss. Neuronal death is one of the most serious consequences of alcohol exposure during development. Studies described in this paper used a neonatal rat model to address factors affecting neuronal death following alcohol exposure during the period of rapid brain growth, and relate them to possible mechanisms of damage. The profile of blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) is an important variable influencing both brain growth deficits and neuronal death--a smaller daily dose of alcohol can be more damaging than a larger daily dose, if it is consumed in a binge-like pattern that produces relatively higher BACs. Alcohol exposure for a single day also can be damaging, producing both brain growth deficits and neuron loss, if high BACs are obtained. Various brain regions and different neuronal populations within a given brain area exhibit different degrees of vulnerability. Some neuronal loss clearly is a function of cell death due to direct effects of alcohol, while other deficits may be due to either primary or secondary effects of the alcohol insult. In the cerebellum, a maturational or metabolic factor also appears to be involved with alcohol-induced neuronal death. Immunocytochemical studies using a monoclonal antibody against microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) indicated that cerebellar lobules containing Purkinje cells that are in the process of extending dendrites are ones that are more vulnerable to alcohol than lobules containing Purkinje cells that mature later. Alcohol exposure during brain development may be producing neuron attrition in multiple ways, including disruption of membrane integrity, inhibition of protein synthesis or other alterations such as lipid solubility, or by disruption of cytoskeletal elements. 
CD63/Pltgp40: a platelet activation antigen identical to the stage-specific, melanoma-associated antigen ME491. CD63 is a 53-Kd lysosomal membrane glycoprotein that has been identified as a platelet activation molecule. The current study presents evidence that CD63 and Pltgp40, a platelet membrane glycoprotein identified in this laboratory, are the same molecule and that CD63/Pltgp40 is identical to the well-characterized, stage-specific melanoma-associated antigen ME491. Identity of CD63 and Pltgp40 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and sequential immunodepletion studies, which showed that the anti-Pltgp40 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) H5C6 and an anti-CD63 MoAb CLB/Gran 12 recognized the same 40- to 55-Kd platelet glycoprotein. In addition, the anti-CD63 MoAb specifically recognized immunoaffinity-purified Pltgp40. Amino acid sequences obtained from NH2-terminal and tryptic fragment peptides of Pltgp40 were used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) probes using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. A 386-bp cDNA probe partially encoding CD63/Pltgp40 and a full length cDNA probe were 100% identical to the corresponding sequence of ME491. Antibodies H5C6 and CLB/Gran12 immunoprecipitated a 30- to 60-Kd heterodisperse glycoprotein from G361 melanoma cells, as had previously been reported for antibodies recognizing ME491. These data, taken together with the extensive homology recently reported between ME491, the Schistosoma mansoni membrane antigen SM23, CD37, the tumor-associated antigen CO-029, and the target of an antiproliferative antibody-1, suggest that CD63 is a member of a new family of related molecules. 
Questionnaire versus clinical interview in the diagnosis of headache. A self-administered questionnaire based on the operational diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society (IHS) was evaluated in a cross-sectional epidemiological survey of headache disorders. A clinical interview was used as index of validity. Seven hundred and thirteen subjects were included. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and chance-corrected agreement rate for the diagnosis of migraine was 51%, 92%, 50% (PVpos), 93% (PVneg), and 0.43 respectively. Corresponding values for episodic tension-type headache were 43%, 96%, 95% (PVpos), 46% (PVneg), and 0.30; and for chronic tension-type headache 14%, 100%, 100% (PVpos), 97% (PVneg), and 0.24. It is concluded that a questionnaire is not a satisfactory tool in diagnosing headache disorders according to the IHS criteria. The methods of data collection seem to have significant influence on the results. Caution in handling data obtained by means of subjective statements is advocated. 
Vascular infection: another hazard of listeriosis. Two case reports are presented of Listeria monocytogenes infection complicating vascular reconstructions. The importance of this problem lies in the resistance of the organism to some of the prophylactic antibiotics recommended for vascular surgery. Patients with prosthetic vascular grafts, particularly if immunocompromised, may be at risk from Listeria infection and may be advised to avoid potentially affected food. 
Enterobius egg granuloma of the vulva and peritoneum: review of the literature. Two cases of Enterobius granuloma containing eggs only are reported. The first case involved the vulva, where no such granuloma has been reported previously. The coexistence of peritoneal granuloma and rectal adenocarcinoma in the second case suggests the possibility of direct penetration of the damaged colonic wall by the parasite, as emphasized by several previous reports of neoplastic involvement and perforation of the intestinal wall in cases of ectopic infections. The diagnostic criteria of Enterobius eggs granuloma, which might be a diagnostic dilemma for pathologists who are not familiar with such criteria, are described herein. 
Cardiac function in aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage: a study of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities. Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes are reported frequently after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The aim of this study was to investigate the functional significance of ECG changes by echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function. Forty-five patients with intracranial aneurysms were studied. All patients had a 12-lead ECG and a two-dimensional echocardiogram. After patients with an history of chronic cardiac disease (n = 4) were excluded, only four patients were found to have wall motion abnormalities. These patients had only minor ECG abnormalities, but severe neurological dysfunction. Conversely, patients with other ECG abnormalities including the deep inverted T waves associated usually with SAH, had normal echocardiograms. We conclude that the ECG is not an accurate predictor of myocardial function after SAH and that myocardial dysfunction is related more closely to severity of neurological condition. 
Thrombolytic therapy: then and now. Although thrombolytic agents were discovered nearly 60 years ago, it is only within the past decade that the clinical use of these agents has revolutionized the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. There are four currently available agents approved for use in treatment of myocardial infarction: streptokinase, urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, and anistreplase. Although each of these agents works in a unique fashion, the common end point of therapy is the dissolution of a fibrin clot by the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. A number of clinically measurable end points have been used to determine the effectiveness of these agents in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, including mortality, reperfusion, patency, left ventricular function, left ventricular volumes, and quantitative creatine kinase isoenzyme analysis. Secondary end points have included bleeding and stroke, as well as recurrent ischemic events. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of all of these agents in achieving the desired end points and comparative studies, including several large-scale trials, have failed to differentiate among these agents with regard to efficacy. Newer dosing regimens for currently available thrombolytic agents, as well as new thrombolytic agents, are currently under active investigation and will be the subject of intense research over the next few years. Despite the lack of consensus as to which agent is superior, it is clear that thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction is the treatment of choice. 
Cytomegalovirus infection causes delayed platelet recovery after bone marrow transplantation. The pathogenic effect of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on the hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was retrospectively studied in 87 recipients of (nonpurged) autologous BMT and in 56 recipients of allogeneic BMT from HLA-identical siblings. Indications for autologous BMT were lymphomas or acute leukemias and for allogeneic BMT various malignancies or aplastic anemia. Patients were divided for the study in two groups, CMV-positive and CMV-negative on the basis of the CMV status pretransplant, and CMV-negative patients were kept CMV-negative by the local transfusion policy. In allogeneic BMT recipients, platelet recovery was significantly slower in CMV-positive patients than in CMV-negative patients (platelets greater than 50,000 cells/microL after 41 days v 27 days, P = .007). This difference held true when patients with acute graft-versus-host disease above grade I were excluded (platelets greater than 50,000 cells/microL after 42 days v 24 days, P = .01). In autologous BMT, the negative effect on platelet recovery was present in patients with lymphomas, but absent in patients with acute leukemias. Patients with acute leukemias had a very delayed recovery of platelets and granulocytes after autologous BMT, irrespective of the CMV status, probably due to the original stem cell disorder. Platelet recovery was significantly slower in CMV-positive autologous BMT recipients with lymphomas than in those not infected (platelets greater than 50,000 cells/microL after 36 days v 24 days, P = .0002). The presence of CMV infection had no effect on the recovery of granulocytes in autologous or allogeneic BMT. These data show that CMV infection causes delayed platelet recovery after BMT; however, in autologous BMT, the underlying disease (ie, acute leukemia) is more determinant for hematopoiesis after BMT. 
Diagnostic tests for choreoacanthocytosis. Two patients with striatal atrophy and a clinical syndrome consistent with choreoacanthocytosis had normal dried blood smears but their red cells demonstrated an abnormal sensitivity to various conditions known to promote discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Dilution in normal saline, in vitro aging, and contact with glass caused a great proportion of these patients' red cells to develop multiple spiny or rounded projections. Under identical conditions, such shape changes did not occur in normal patients or in those with Huntington's disease. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the age-induced increase in acanthocytic-appearing cells could be reversed with chlorpromazine. These data suggest that the red cells from these patients with striatal degeneration are deficient in their ability to preserve normal shape in the face of echinocytic stress and that this observation has diagnostic and, possibly, pathophysiologic significance. 
Ulnar tunnel syndrome. The ulnar tunnel syndrome is a relatively uncommon condition resulting from compression of the ulnar nerve as it passes through the loge de Guyon, or ulnar tunnel, in the wrist. The syndrome may cause weakness and atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles and loss of sensation in the ulnar nerve distribution of the hand. The most common cause of ulnar tunnel syndrome is chronic occupational trauma, either from pressure exerted over the hypothenar eminence by a tool or from the use of the heel of the hand as a hammer. Nonoccupational etiologies include congenital, inflammatory, neoplastic, vascular, metabolic, degenerative and traumatic disorders. Diagnosis often requires neurophysiologic evaluation, in addition to a careful history and physical examination. Conservative treatment aimed at protecting the ulnar tunnel from trauma frequently is effective. Occasionally, surgical decompression of the ulnar tunnel is required. 
Acute catastrophic complications of balloon aortic valvuloplasty. The Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry Investigators. Among the initial 492 patients who underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty as part of the Mansfield Investigational Device Exemption Protocol, 31 (6.3%) had acute catastrophic complications. These included ventricular perforation in nine (1.8%), seven women and two men; six cases (67%) involved serial balloon inflations and seven (78%) also involved dual balloon inflations. In six (67%) of the nine patients perforation was fatal. In four patients studied at necropsy, the perforation involved the base of the lateral left ventricular free wall. Pericardiocentesis was performed in five patients, three of whom survived with (one patient) or without (two patients) operative repair. Acute, severe aortic regurgitation developed in four patients (0.8%), all women. None had significant regurgitation before valvuloplasty; dual balloons were used in two of the four. All three patients who underwent emergency valve replacement survived. A fourth patient died 2 days after valvuloplasty without operative intervention. Fatal cardiac arrest complicated balloon aortic valvuloplasty in 13 patients (2.6%), including 7 with cardiogenic shock and 4 with refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Of the seven with shock, four had been treated with serial balloon inflations; dual balloons were used in three. In two of three patients studied at necropsy, the aortic valve was observed to be congenitally bicuspid. A fatal cerebrovascular accident occurred in two patients (0.4%); it was hemorrhagic in one, embolic in another. Both patients were treated with serial (including one dual) balloon inflations. Limb amputation was required in three patients (0.6%), two women and one man; in two patients amputation was above the knee, in the third patient it was limited to two toes. 
Endocrine and immunohistochemical studies on thyrotropin (TSH)-secreting pituitary adenomas: responses of TSH, alpha-subunit, and growth hormone to hypothalamic releasing hormones and their distribution in adenoma cells. Endocrine and immunohistochemical studies were performed in two cases of TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas. The patients had elevated serum TSH and alpha-subunit concentrations despite high serum thyroid hormone levels. In addition, one patient (no. 1) had elevated serum GH levels with clinical evidence of acromegaly. GH-releasing hormone infusion increased serum levels of TSH, alpha-subunit and GH in the two patients. TRH injection increased serum TSH levels in both patients and, concomitantly, serum alpha-subunit and GH levels in patient 1. Basal TSH levels and their responses to TRH changed reciprocally to changes in serum thyroid hormone levels, although TRH-induced GH release did not. The administration of GnRH also increased serum TSH, alpha-subunit, and GH levels in patient 1. In accordance with these in vivo results, pituitary adenoma cells in culture obtained from patient 1 responded to GH-releasing hormone, TRH, or GnRH to secrete TSH, alpha-subunit, and GH. Incubation of cells with dexamethasone resulted in inhibition of TSH and stimulation of GH secretion without a significant change in alpha-subunit secretion. On the basis of light microscopic and electron microscopic double gold immunohistochemistry, the tumor from patient 1 was a bimorphous adenoma composed of two separate cell types: cells with TSH beta-subunit (TSH beta) and alpha-subunit, and those with GH and alpha-subunit. The remainder consisted mainly of cells with TSH beta and alpha-subunit. The coproduction of the unusual combination of two hormones such as GH and alpha-subunit in a single-type of adenoma cell and the coexistence of thyrotrophs and somatotrophs in one pituitary adenoma along with the aberrant responses of TSH beta, alpha-subunit, and GH to multiple hypothalamic hormones suggest the dedifferentiation of pituitary cells to multipotential progenitor cells by neoplastic transformation. 
Long-term roentgenographic and functional changes in patients who were treated with wide fenestration for central lumbar stenosis. Thirty-four patients who had central stenosis of the lumbar spine were treated with wide fenestration, a procedure in which only the medial parts of the inferior facets and the adjoining ligamentum flavum were removed. The patients were followed for an average of five and one-half years (range, four and one-half years to seven years and ten months). Wide fenestration successfully relieved the symptoms. The new bone that was laid down in the operatively treated segments did not reproduce the symptoms of spinal stenosis; instead, it appeared to stabilize those segments. 
Temporal thresholds for neocortical infarction in rats subjected to reversible focal cerebral ischemia. We investigated the temporal threshold for focal cerebral infarction in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. The right middle cerebral artery and common carotid artery were occluded for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 24 hours, and all the animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the onset of ischemia. Cortical infarct volumes and edema volumes were quantified in serial frozen sections of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue using image analysis. Upon occlusion, blood flow in the core of the ischemic zone, measured with laser-Doppler flowmetry, fell to a mean +/- standard deviation of 21 +/- 7% of the preocclusion baseline value (n = 26). During the first hour of ischemia, blood flow in the densely ischemic zone rose to 27 +/- 8% of baseline (n = 25). Release of the middle cerebral artery and common carotid artery occlusions rapidly restored cortical blood flow to 213 +/- 83% of baseline (n = 21). Focal ischemia of 1 hour's duration caused little or no infarction, while ischemic intervals of 2 and 3 hours produced successively larger volumes of infarcted cortex. Ischemic intervals of 3-4 hours' duration followed by approximately 20 hours of recirculation yielded infarct volumes that were not significantly different from those after 24 hours of permanent focal ischemia. The results indicate that 3-4 hours of focal cerebral ischemia in this rat model is sufficient to attain maximal infarction and suggest that recirculation or pharmacological interventions after this time will provide little benefit. 
Long-term follow-up after partial removal of a solitary kidney BACKGROUND. The removal of more than one kidney in animals leads to proteinuria and progressive renal failure due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. This injury may be the result of chronic glomerular hyperfiltration. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a reduction in renal mass of more than 50 percent on residual renal function and morphology in humans. METHODS. We evaluated long-term renal function in 14 patients with a solitary kidney who had undergone partial nephrectomy for renal-cell or transitional-cell carcinoma. In 12, the first kidney had been removed 2 months to 21 years previously for the same type of cancer; in 2, the other kidney was congenitally atrophic. Before surgery, no patient had clinical or histopathological evidence of primary renal disease. All 14 patients underwent partial nephrectomy to remove a localized tumor, with 25 to 75 percent of the solitary kidney being excised. They were evaluated 5 to 17 years after surgery (mean, 7.7). RESULTS. Twelve patients had stable postoperative renal function, and end-stage renal failure developed in two. There were no changes in blood pressure in any patient during follow-up. Nine patients had proteinuria, which was mild (0.15 to 0.8 g of urinary protein per day) in five. The extent of proteinuria was inversely correlated with the amount of remaining renal tissue (P = 0.0065) and directly correlated with the duration of follow-up (P = 0.0005). Four patients with moderate-to-severe proteinuria had renal biopsies, which revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in three patients and global glomerulosclerosis in one. CONCLUSIONS. Long-term renal function remains stable in most patients with a reduction in renal mass of more than 50 percent. These patients are, however, at increased risk for proteinuria, glomerulopathy, and progressive renal failure. 
Comparison of speed of onset of analgesic effect of diamorphine and morphine. In a random, double-blind crossover trial using an ischaemic limb pain model we have assessed the speed of onset of analgesia after an i.v. bolus of equipotent doses of diamorphine and morphine in 12 healthy male volunteers. Pain and its subsequent relief were assessed by means of a visual analogue scale. Two of the subjects found diamorphine acted quicker than morphine, one found no difference and nine found that morphine was quicker than diamorphine. The mean time to diamorphine effect was 53% greater than for morphine (P less than 0.005, Wilcoxon rank sum test). These findings suggest that, for rapid relief of pain, morphine is more suitable than diamorphine. 
Management of malignant air leak in a child with a neonatal high-frequency oscillatory ventilator. A 10-year-old, 36-kg child with a malignant air leak who failed conventional mechanical ventilation and high-frequency jet ventilation was successfully treated with a neonatal high-frequency oscillatory ventilator for 31 days. Since the air leak resolved with minimal hemodynamic compromise, this technique may have application in the management of respiratory failure and air leak in the older and larger child for prolonged periods of time. 
Continuous intratumoral infusion of methotrexate for recurrent glioblastoma: a pilot study. Five patients with documented recurrences of glioblastoma multiforme were given continuous infusions of methotrexate delivered intratumorally using implantable catheters and subcutaneous refillable pumps. A continuous infusion of methotrexate (1 mg/d) was begun with concomitant oral administration of folinic acid. The methotrexate dose was increased every 2 weeks to 3, 10, 30, and, ultimately, 75 mg/d in two patients. Samples of serum and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were obtained to determine the levels of methotrexate and total bioactive folates, and brain tissue was obtained from two patients for determination of methotrexate concentration. The patients survived from 7 to 49 weeks after the implantation of the infusion device. Neither the clinical examination nor sequential radiological studies gave clear evidence of reduction in tumor size. Pneumonia developed in one patient, and mild hepatitis and increased seizure frequency in another. Methotrexate was stable in the delivery system over 12 days, and ventricular CSF reached steady-state levels by 5 days. Steady-state ventricular CSF levels of methotrexate were higher than serum levels in some patients, while the reverse was true in others. Levels of total bioactive folates in the CSF did not increase above the normal range. Methotrexate concentrations were highest at the center of the tumor, but measurable amounts of methotrexate were detectable in all areas of the brain. At autopsy in four patients, variable liquefactive necrosis of the brain tumors was seen, and viable tumor was found at the periphery of the tumor bed. These preliminary results suggest that it is technically feasible to infuse methotrexate into brain tumor cavities, and show that little central nervous system or systemic toxicity was encountered in five patients. Better delineation of the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic approach will require further clinical trials. 
Benign spinal nerve sheath tumors: their occurrence sporadically and in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. Benign spinal nerve sheath tumors (neurofibromas and schwannomas) often occur on dorsal nerve roots sporadically or in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. These are histologically benign tumors, and distinction between them is frequently not made by clinicians. To determine if there is a correlation between the histological pattern of benign spinal nerve sheath tumors and the type of neurofibromatosis, the clinical and pathological features of these tumors (86 surgical specimens and five autopsies) in 68 patients were reviewed. The patients were classified into one of four categories: neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, uncertain, or sporadic. The diagnostic criteria used for neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2 were established by the National Institutes of Health. Patients who did not fulfill criteria for either neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2 but who had multiple nervous system tumors or other stigmata of neurofibromatosis were designated "uncertain." Spinal nerve sheath tumors were considered sporadic in 42 cases (40 schwannomas and two neurofibromas). In the 14 patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, all spinal nerve sheath tumors were neurofibromas. In six of the seven patients with neurofibromatosis type 2, all spinal nerve sheath tumors were schwannomas. One patient with neurofibromatosis type 2 had a spinal nerve sheath schwannoma and a tumor with features of both tumor types. The authors conclude that spinal nerve sheath tumors in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 are neurofibromas. In contrast, spinal nerve sheath tumors occurring in neurofibromatosis type 2 or sporadically are most frequently schwannomas. The distinct histological features of these tumors may reflect different pathogenetic mechanisms even though they arise at identical sites in neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2. 
Demonstration of myocardial reperfusion injury in humans: results of a pilot study utilizing acute coronary angioplasty with perfluorochemical in anterior myocardial infarction. Reperfusion may limit the amount of potentially salvageable myocardium through the introduction of cellular elements into previously ischemic but viable myocardium (reperfusion injury). It has been demonstrated that intracoronary infusion of a 20% intravascular perfluorochemical emulsion (Fluosol) significantly reduces infarct size and results in improved left ventricular function in the canine model. This pilot study was performed to explore the existence of myocardial reperfusion injury in humans. Utilizing Fluosol as a probe in conjunction with emergency coronary angioplasty, 26 patients presenting within 4 h with a first anterior myocardial infarction were randomized to emergency angioplasty or angioplasty followed by a 30-min intracoronary infusion of Fluosol at 40 ml/min. Global and regional ventricular function were assessed immediately and a mean of 12 days after successful angioplasty with contrast ventriculography. Infarct size was semiquantitated with thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images before discharge. Twelve patients (six undergoing angioplasty alone, six treated with angioplasty and Fluosol) had an occluded infarct-related vessel (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 0 to 1) at the time of emergency catheterization and were included in the final analysis. At 12 days after successful angioplasty, the improvement in regional ventricular function was greater in patients receiving adjunctive therapy with intracoronary Fluosol versus those undergoing angioplasty alone utilizing both the radial shortening and centerline method, respectively (23 +/- 3.1% vs. 8 +/- 2.3%, p less than 0.02; and -1.6 +/- 0.4 vs. -2.9 +/- 0.2 SD/chord, p less than 0.05). 
The effect of diazepam enema on the rectal mucosa of rats. The use of undiluted intravenous diazepam solution administered as an enema has been recommended for the acute management of seizures when intravenous access cannot be obtained. It is well absorbed, rapidly effective, and generally accepted as being safe when used in this manner. The effect of intravenous diazepam solution on the rectal mucosa has not been studied. This study demonstrates that there are no acute changes in the rectal mucosa of adult rats after administration of 10 to 20 times the recommended human dose. 
Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging following cranial base surgery. The computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging films of 57 patients who underwent anterior or anterolateral cranial base surgery from January 1987 to August 1989 were retrospectively reviewed to ascertain the significance of early and late postoperative intracranial imaging changes. Extra-axial changes (air, blood, cerebrospinal fluid collection) were found in 96% of patients; axial changes (brain edema, contusion) were seen in 30% of patients in the first postoperative period (72 hours). Subsequently, extra-axial changes began to resolve but axial changes became more prevalent. After 6 months, only axial changes persisted (encephalomalacia). It was encouraging to find a low correlation of imaging abnormalities with clinically significant findings. 
Circadian variation of transient myocardial ischemia in the early out-of-hospital period after first acute myocardial infarction. Circadian rhythms have been demonstrated in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and in other clinical cardiac dysfunctions. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether a circadian pattern of transient myocardial ischemia exists after first AMI. Prospectively, 24-hour ambulatory ST-segment monitoring was initiated at discharge on day 11 +/- 5 in 123 consecutive survivors of first AMI. A total of 93 ischemic episodes (91 asymptomatic) occurred in 21 of the 123 patients (17%) (mean duration of 30 minutes, range 4 to 292). A significant circadian rhythm of transient myocardial ischemia was found with a peak activity occurring in the evening hours (p less than 0.01). Thus, 43% of ischemic episodes and 42% of ischemic time occurred between 6 P.M. and 12 midnight. The characteristics of morning and evening episodes were similar, except for the heart rate at maximal ST-segment depression, which was significantly higher during morning episodes (p less than 0.02). Patients with transient myocardial ischemia had a diurnal distribution similar to the circadian variation displayed during ischemic activity. Thus, 16 of the 21 patients had ischemic episodes from 6 P.M. to 12 midnight versus 10 patients from 6 A.M. to 12 noon (p less than 0.01). The 24-hour mean minimal heart rate was significantly higher in patients with than without ischemic episodes (p less than 0.02). In conclusion, this study has established a significant circadian peak of transient myocardial ischemia in the evening hours in survivors of first AMI. Whether the pattern displayed is due to endogenous biologic functions or cyclic variations, or both, in the external environment needs to be clarified. 
Nd:YAG iliac and femoropopliteal laser angioplasty: results with large probes as "sole therapy". Laser assisted balloon angioplasty with a laser heated metallic capped fiberoptic catheter may be effective in the treatment of femoral and iliac artery occlusive disease. In order to avoid the inherent trauma of balloon angioplasty, yet at the same time "debulk" atheroma, 75 patients underwent laser angioplasty of the superficial femoral and iliac arteries as "sole therapy". Laser angioplasty was performed using an Nd:YAG laser coupled to a 600 micron fiber and a 3.5 mm probe (22-28 watts), 4.2 mm or 5.0 probe (32-40 watts). Fifty-nine patients had laser angioplasty for claudication and 16 for limb salvage. The initial angiographic success rate was 84% (41/49) (lesion length 2-14 cm) for the superficial femoral and 69% (18/26) (lesion length 2-14 cm) for the iliac arteries. In follow-up extending to 21 months (mean 14.4 months) 73% (30/41) of the superficial femoral artery and 76% (14/18) of the initially recanalized iliac arteries remain patent. When initial failures are included, this represents an overall intermediate-term patency rate of 52% (32/49) for superficial femoral and 49% (14/26) for iliac arteries respectively. By avoiding the disruptive effect on the arterial wall architecture caused by balloon angioplasty, while at the same time ablating and vaporizing more atheromatous material with larger laser probes, the long-term patency rates of laser angioplasty as "sole therapy" may prove to be superior to those of laser assisted balloon angioplasty. 
Traumatic anterior fossa cerebrospinal fluid fistulae and craniofacial considerations. Traumatic cerebrospinal fluid fistulae may present a diagnostic and treatment challenge to the head and neck surgeon. The clinical presentation may be obscured by associated injuries. This article serves as a guide in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of patients with dural fistulae of the anterior cranial fossa. 
Left ventricular thrombus in anterior acute myocardial infarction after thrombolysis. A GISSI-2 connected study. BACKGROUND. Streptokinase reduces the incidence of left ventricular thrombosis after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is unknown whether a similar effect can be obtained with different thrombolytic agents and whether subcutaneous calcium heparin can have an additional efficacy. METHODS AND RESULTS. To compare the effects of two different thrombolytic agents combined or not with heparin on the incidence and features of left ventricular thrombi and their related embolic events, we performed a GISSI-2 ancillary echocardiographic study (the first echocardiogram obtained within 48 hours of symptoms onset and the second before hospital discharge) that enrolled 180 consecutive patients (mean age, 63 +/- 11 years, 142 men) with a first anterior acute myocardial infarction. Patients were randomized into four groups of treatment: recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (n = 47), rt-PA plus heparin (n = 45), streptokinase (n = 39), and streptokinase plus heparin (n = 49). Left ventricular thrombosis was observed in 51 of 180 patients (28%). No significant differences were found concerning the incidence of thrombi in the four treatment groups. Mural shape of left ventricular thrombi was found more frequently than the protruding shape (71% versus 29% at the first examination, 64% versus 36% at the second), particularly in heparin-treated patients (93% versus 7% at first examination, 70% versus 30% at the second). Only one embolic event (0.5%) occurred during the hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that 1) the rate of left ventricular thrombi does not differ in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated either with streptokinase or rt-PA, 2) subcutaneous heparin, when begun 12 hours after intravenous thrombolysis, does not appear to further reduce the occurrence of thrombi but seems to influence the shape of left ventricular thrombi, and 3) during the predischarge period, embolic events are rare in patients treated by thrombolysis. 
Enhanced interstitial fluid adenosine attenuates myocardial stunning. Reversible myocardial dysfunction associated with transient ischemia has been termed the stunned myocardium. Because exogenous adenosine has been shown to protect the ischemic myocardium, we hypothesized that augmentation of endogenous adenosine levels would attenuate myocardial stunning. To induce stunning, anesthetized dogs were subjected to 15 minutes of ischemia (left anterior descending artery occlusion) followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA; 5 mg/kg/hr), an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, was used to augment adenosine levels. The effect of EHNA on interstitial fluid (ISF) adenosine levels, coronary blood flow, and regional systolic wall thickening was compared with that of an untreated group (n = 8). EHNA increased preischemia ISF adenosine levels threefold and was associated with a corresponding increase in coronary blood flow. EHNA administration did not alter preischemia systolic wall thickening. Although ISF adenosine increased fourfold during ischemia in the untreated group, ISF adenosine increased nearly sixtyfold above preischemia values in the EHNA-treated group and remained elevated throughout reperfusion. Postischemic regional function was enhanced significantly in the group treated with EHNA. These data show that adenosine deaminase inhibition increased ISF adenosine levels and attenuated myocardial stunning. Metabolic manipulation of myocardial ISF nucleoside levels may be beneficial in limiting postischemic myocardial dysfunction. 
Misdiagnosed papillary renal adenocarcinoma. We present 3 patients with papillary renal adenocarcinoma who were initially misdiagnosed owing to unusual clinical presentation. We suggest that if these presentations are borne in mind, pre-operative detection of this uncommon condition should be possible more often than is now the case. 
E1A oncogene induction of cytolytic susceptibility eliminates sarcoma cell tumorigenicity. The manner in which oncogenes influence tumorigenicity beyond their ability to immortalize cells is uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that, in addition to subverting cellular growth controls, oncogenes can actively determine tumor-inducing capacity by affecting neoplastic cell susceptibility to destruction by the host cellular immune response. The adenovirus type 5 E1A oncogene, which induces susceptibility to lysis by natural killer cells and encodes epitopes recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, was transfected into highly tumorigenic sarcoma cells. E1A expression in these sarcoma cells eliminated their tumorigenicity in recipients with natural killer cell activity that was competent to lyse these E1A-positive targets. Thymus-dependent responses were not required for tumor rejection. These results indicate that oncogene-regulated cellular pathways that affect neoplastic cell susceptibility to natural killer cell lytic mechanisms may influence tumor development in the immunocompetent host. 
Antiperistaltic and isoperistaltic intussusception associated with abnormal motility after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a case report. Antiperistaltic and recurrent intussusceptions are extremely rare in the adult. We report a patient with both. The patient developed an antiperistaltic intussusception distal to her Roux enteroenterostomy years after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity. The diagnosis was made preoperatively with gastrointestinal contrast radiography and ultrasonography. At surgery, the intussusception was reduced, and 12 inches of nonviable bowel was resected, with a functional end-to-end anastomosis. An isoperistaltic intussusception occurred in the early postoperative period just distal to the anastomosis. Manometric evaluation of the Roux limb after the second operation showed altered gastrointestinal motility, consisting of orad-propagated and aboard-propagated migrating motor complexes, minimal phase 2 activity, and lack of conversion to the fed pattern with a liquid meal. Although manometry was not performed before the development of the intussusception, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that altered intestinal motility may contribute to the development of intussusception. 
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left coronary artery in patients with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery: clinical and functional results. The safety and therapeutic benefits of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery, the left circumflex coronary artery or both were assessed in 61 patients with chronic (greater than 3 months) occlusion of the right coronary artery. Recanalization of the right coronary artery was not performed before dilatation of left coronary artery lesions. All lesions could be dilated without an acute ischemic event in the catheterization laboratory. However, three patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery within the first 8 days after coronary angioplasty. There were no in-hospital deaths. Of the remaining 58 patients, 51 (88%) had repeat angiography at a mean of 5.2 +/- 2.5 months. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (n = 17) or absence (n = 34) of restenosis defined as greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis at the dilated site. Baseline characteristics were comparable. The mean value for angina functional class at follow-up was significantly better in the group without than in the group with restenosis (0.4 +/- 0.6 vs 2.1 +/- 1.1, respectively; p less than 0.001). Sixty-five percent of the patients without restenosis were asymptomatic at follow-up. Seventy-five percent of the predicted maximal physical capacity was reached by 76% of the patients without restenosis compared with 33% in the group with restenosis (p less than 0.05). 
Chronic xerostomia increases esophageal acid exposure and is associated with esophageal injury. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of chronic xerostomia on parameters of gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis. DESIGN: Observational study of a cohort of male patients with xerostomia and age-matched control subjects. SETTING: Tertiary-care Veterans Affairs Medical Center. SUBJECTS: Sixteen male patients with chronic xerostomia secondary to radiation for head and neck cancers or medications. Nineteen age-matched male control subjects with comparable alcohol and smoking histories. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Esophageal motility was similar in patients with xerostomia and controls. Clearance of acid from the esophagus and 24-hour intraesophageal pH were markedly abnormal in patients with xerostomia. Symptoms and signs of esophagitis were significantly more frequent in subjects with xerostomia. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic xerostomia may predispose to esophageal injury, at least in part, by decreasing the clearance of acid from the esophagus and altering 24-hour intraesophageal pH. Esophageal injury is a previously unreported complication of long-term salivary deficiency. 
Echo/Doppler and hemodynamic correlates of vasodilator responsiveness in primary pulmonary hypertension. To determine correlates of acute vasodilator responsiveness in primary pulmonary hypertension, we retrospectively studied 25 patients, comparing 41 resting echo/Doppler and nine resting catheterization variables with the maximal reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance achieved during vasodilator trials. Twelve vasodilators were tested (mean, 5.6 drugs per patient; range, three to eight). Eight patients were vasodilator responsive, as defined by a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance greater than or equal to 30 percent in response to at least one agent. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed only Doppler pulmonic peak flow velocity to be an independent correlate of responsiveness (p less than 0.05). Responders differed from nonresponders in having a higher Doppler pulmonic peak flow velocity (PV) (SD 81 +/- 24 vs 64 +/- 15 cm/s; p = 0.05), lower mean right atrial pressure (RAP) (6 +/- 4 vs 13 +/- 7 mm Hg; p = 0.04), and longer median survival (37 vs 5 months; p = 0.03). Seven of eight responders had RAP less than or equal to 10 mm Hg, and all responders had PV greater than 60 cm/s. Seven of ten patients with both RAP less than or equal to 10 and PV greater than 60 and one of the 15 remaining patients were vasodilator responsive (p less than 0.001). Thus, echo/Doppler and invasive hemodynamic parameters correlate with acute vasodilator responsiveness in primary pulmonary hypertension. Patients with low PV and high RAP values were almost never vasodilator responsive. Doppler pulmonic peak velocity and mean RAP may be useful in identifying patients most likely to respond to acute vasodilator trials and those in whom testing is unlikely to yield positive results. 
Transesophageal echocardiography in renal cell carcinoma: an accurate diagnostic technique for intracaval neoplastic extension. Between 4 and 10% of patients with renal cell carcinoma have tumor involving the inferior vena cava and many of these patients have suprahepatic extension. In patients with intracaval neoplastic extension precise definition of the superior aspect of the tumor thrombus is critical. Transabdominal ultrasonography, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and inferior venacavography are all currently used to evaluate the inferior vena cava in these patients. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was used to image the inferior vena cava in 5 patients with renal cell carcinoma and intracaval neoplastic extension. In each patient transesophageal echocardiography correctly revealed the superior extent of tumor thrombus. In 3 patients tumor thrombus was found at a higher level by transesophageal echocardiography than by CT, MRI and inferior venacavography. In all patients tumor imaging by transesophageal echocardiography correlated well with the gross appearance and extent of tumor found at operation. Echocardiography also documented the absence of residual gross tumor after resection. Transesophageal echocardiography was also useful to assess left ventricular function. Although each of these patients had a pulmonary artery catheter as well transesophageal echocardiography can be useful in situations when right atrial tumor thrombus prevents right heart catheterization. This small series demonstrates that intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography can accurately evaluate the extent of tumor thrombus and provides a means to assess myocardial function complementary to the pulmonary artery catheter. 
A randomized clinical trial of feeder vessel photocoagulation of sickle cell retinopathy. A long-term follow-up. Long-term follow-up of patients enrolled in a randomized prospective trial of feeder vessel photocoagulation for proliferative sickle retinopathy has been completed. Of the 44 patients enrolled in Chicago, nearly a decade follow-up has been achieved on 29 patients (45 eyes). There were 20 control untreated eyes and 25 argon laser-treated eyes. Prolonged loss of visual acuity was rare in both groups. Argon laser photocoagulation has had a sustained effect on reducing the incidence of vitreous hemorrhage and visual loss from vitreous hemorrhage. Nine (45%) of 20 control eyes had vitreous hemorrhage, and it was recurrent in six (66%) of these nine eyes. A single episode was the only hemorrhagic event in the treated eyes. The laser-induced complications of choroidal neovascularization or retinal detachment were not associated with long-term visual sequelae. New sea fan evolution in 47% of study eyes suggests that these patients require long-term surveillance. 
Left ventricular function changes after cardiomyoplasty in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Dynamic cardiomyoplasty has been reported in the treatment of severe myocardial failure. In this investigation significant improvement of left ventricular function with dynamic cardiomyoplasty was demonstrated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or Chagas' disease for more than 1 year of follow-up. Thirteen patients with advanced heart failure who were in New York Heart Association class III or IV were operated on. There were no operative deaths. Patients were followed up for a mean of 11.5 months, and two patients died during the late follow-up period. Five of nine patients observed long term are in New York Heart Association class I, three in class II, and one in class III. At 3 months of follow-up, Doppler echocardiography demonstrated that left ventricular segmental wall shortening increased from 11.4% +/- 2.3% to 16.4% +/- 3.9% (p less than 0.01), and left ventricular stroke volume from 23.9 +/- 5.7 to 34.4 +/- 10 ml (p less than 0.01). Radioisotopic left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 20.9% +/- 3.3% to 25.4% +/- 7.7% (p = 0.06), and its better increases occurred in patients with lesser left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions. Cardiac catheterization showed that left ventricular stroke work index increased from 14.6 +/- 3.8 to 23.7 +/- 6.7 gm.m/m2 (p less than 0.01), whereas pulmonary wedge pressure decreased from 24.8 +/- 3.7 to 17.2 +/- 5.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). At 6 and 12 months of follow-up, all the preceding values remained essentially unchanged. Thus cardiomyoplasty improves left ventricular function and may halt the steady evolution of severe cardiomyopathies. 
Retinal manifestations of neurofibromatosis. Diagnosis and management. Five patients presented with vision-threatening retinal tumors and systemic signs of neurofibromatosis, including neurofibromatosis type 1 (four patients) and familial cafe-au-lait spots (one patient). These tumors included large retinal astrocytic hamartomas, multiple retinal capillary hemangiomas, and combined hamartomas of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium, which resulted in rubeotic glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment. Surgical therapy included retinal cryopexy, xenon and argon photocoagulation, scleral buckling, and pars plana vitrectomy with excisional retinal biopsy. Retinal tumors may result in marked visual loss in patients with neurofibromatosis, and vitreoretinal surgery may restore useful vision in some of these patients. 
A randomized controlled trial of the effects of three antihypertensive agents on blood pressure control and quality of life in older women. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial to compare the impact of titrated doses of atenolol (50 to 100 mg once a day), enalapril (5 to 20 mg once a day), and diltiazem (sustained release) (60 to 180 mg twice a day) on blood pressure and quality of life in older hypertensive women. Two hundred forty-two patients were randomized. Dose titration was completed by week 4 after randomization, and the maintenance phase was completed at week 16. Diltiazem (sustained release) demonstrated greater diastolic blood pressure lowering at both weeks 8 and 16 by an intent-to-treat analysis. At week 16, diltiazem changed diastolic blood pressure -13.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg compared with -10.8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg for atenolol, and -10.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg for enalapril. Diltiazem also demonstrated greater lowering of systolic blood pressure at week 3, but these differences in systolic blood pressure had decreased by week 16. More patients were classified as treatment failures during the 16 weeks of the trial for atenolol (15%) than for diltiazem (2.5%), while the treatment failure rate was intermediate with enalapril (8%). Total rates of adverse events were equivalent across the three treatment arms. There were few significant differences in the impact of the three treatments on mean scores of quality-of-life measures at week 16. There was a trend for atenolol to have somewhat worse quality-of-life scores, but none of these differences were statistically significant. In conclusion, all three treatment regimens were effective in lowering diastolic blood pressure without significant differences in rates of adverse events or deleterious effects on quality of life. 
Radiation-induced meningiomas: experience at the Mount Sinai Hospital and review of the literature. From the records of The Mount Sinai Hospital, seven cases which met established criteria for radiation-induced meningiomas were identified. This represents the largest series of radiogenic meningiomas documented in North America and includes both intracranial and intraspinal tumors. The records and pathological specimens were reviewed and these data analyzed with other cases retrieved from the world literature. This study reveals that radiation-induced meningiomas can be categorized into three groups based on the amount of radiation administered: 1) low dose; 2) moderate dose and miscellaneous; and 3) high dose. The overwhelming majority of cases had received low-dose irradiation (800 rad) to the scalp for tinea capitis and the second largest group resulted from high-dose irradiation for primary brain tumors (greater than 2000 rad). The unique features distinguishing radiation-induced meningiomas from other meningiomas are reviewed. Although histologically atypical tumors were common in this series, overt malignancy was not encountered. The preoperative management of these lesions should include angiography to evaluate for large-vessel occlusive vasculopathy, a known association of meningiomas induced by high-dose irradiation. Given the propensity these tumors possess for recurrence, a wide bony and dural margin is recommended at surgical resection. 
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in ulcerative colitis. Comparison with other colitides/diarrheal illnesses. Previous studies from this laboratory showed that serum anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, distinct from those associated with active Wegener's granulomatosis, are present in the majority of patients with ulcerative colitis. In this study, the specificity of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies for ulcerative colitis as compared with other colitides and diarrheal illness was determined. In a blinded study, test samples of serum were screened for anti-neutrophil immunoglobulin G in a fixed neutrophil enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of neutrophil binding by immunoglobulin G and titers of anti-neutrophil immunoglobulin G in sera from patients with ulcerative colitis and patients with ulcerative colitis post colectomy were each significantly greater than the levels and titers for normal controls and patients with a variety of other colitides and diarrheal illnesses. Levels of neutrophil binding for colonic Crohn's disease, bacterial/amoebic colitis, the irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, and other miscellaneous diarrheal illnesses were not significantly different than the levels for normal controls. Although the levels of binding for collagenous colitis were significantly less than the levels for ulcerative colitis, they were significantly greater than the levels for normal controls. Patterns of neutrophil binding by serum samples that were positive in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Perinuclear staining was the predominant pattern shown by sera from patients with ulcerative colitis. The combination of a positive value in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a perinuclear immunofluorescence pattern was 60% sensitive and 94% specific for ulcerative colitis. It is concluded that anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in ulcerative colitis are not simply an epiphenomenon related to inflammation of the colon. Identification of the antigen(s) to which these autoantibodies are directed may facilitate understanding of the underlying immune response and may allow development of an assay that is more sensitive and specific for ulcerative colitis. 
A rare cause of parastomal hernia: stomach herniation. Our case of a parastomal hernia is rare because the stomach became incarcerated in the hernial sac. The diagnosis of parastomal hernia is not a difficult one, but one must be aware of the possible complications of the colostomy and the rare occurrence of the parastomal hernia containing the stomach. 
Effect of valproate on human cerebral glucose metabolism. We studied the effects of valproate (VPA) on local cerebral glucose metabolism (LCMRglc) in eight patients with partial seizure disorders and two with primary generalized epilepsy. Each patient had two positron-emission tomography (PET) scans with 18F-2-deoxyglucose (FDG), with, and without, VPA (mean level 52 mg/dl, range 30-127 mg/dl). Patients continued carbamazepine (CBZ) for both scans: serum concentrations were not significantly changed by VPA (CBZ range 5.4-12 mg/dl). Seven patients had the "without-VPA" scan first. Mean interval between PET scans was 75 days. Global CMRglc was decreased by 22% by addition of VPA (7.2 +/- 1.8 mg/100 g/min without VPA, 5.6 +/- 1.1 g/min with VPA, p less than 0.05, corrected). Thirteen regions of interest (ROIs) were analyzed in each hemisphere in each PET scan. Metabolic rates were significantly lower in 15 of 26 ROIs with VPA (p less than 0.05, corrected). VPA depresses cerebral metabolism to a greater degree than do CBZ and phenytoin (PHT) but less than does phenobarbital (PB). The metabolic effect may be related to the mechanism of action and have neuropsychological implications. 
Sudden death in a child following jellyfish envenomation by Chiropsalmus quadrumanus. Case report and autopsy findings. Sudden death following coelenterate envenomation is not uncommon in Australia where the Pacific box jellyfish is indigenous. However, few cases of sudden fatal reactions have been reported in the Northern Hemisphere, and those that have occurred have all been attributed to the Portuguese man-of-war, Physalia physalis. We report the case of a child who died within 40 minutes of accidental envenomation with tentacles of a jellyfish, Chiropsalmus quadrumanus, and describe the findings at autopsy. This coelenterate may be of special danger to small children. 
Relationship between acute myelomonoblastic leukemia and infection due to human immunodeficiency virus. Infection due to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been complicated by the development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in five patients whose cases have previously been reported; other manifestations, including preleukemia, myelofibrosis, and myeloid hyperplasia, have also been reported in patients infected with HIV. We report the sixth case of an HIV-infected patient who developed acute myelomonocytic leukemia; HIV infection was documented by tests for serum antibodies (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting), by a markedly elevated p24 antigen level in plasma, and by cultures of CSF and peripheral blood that were positive for HIV. Furthermore, myelomonoblasts that were cultured without the addition of growth factors displayed evidence of HIV replication through the presence of p24 antigen and reverse transcriptase activity, both of which lasted for 4 weeks in the supernatant fluid of the cell cultures. This case report provides the first data indicating that HIV may infect myelomonoblasts in vivo and represents the sixth reported case of an association between HIV infection and pure acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. 
Enhanced unscheduled DNA synthesis in UV-irradiated human skin explants treated with T4N5 liposomes. Epidermal keratinocytes cultured from explants of skin cancer patients, including biopsies from xeroderma pigmentosum patients, were ultraviolet light-irradiated and DNA repair synthesis was measured. Repair capacity was much lower in xeroderma pigmentosum patients than in normal patients. The extent of DNA repair replication did not decline with the age of the normal patient. Treatment with T4N5 liposomes containing a DNA repair enzyme enhanced repair synthesis in both normal and xeroderma pigmentosum keratinocytes in an irradiation- and liposome-dose dependent manner. These results provide no evidence that aging people or skin cancer patients are predisposed to cutaneous malignancy by a DNA repair deficiency, but do demonstrate that T4N5 liposomes enhance DNA repair in the keratinocytes of the susceptible xeroderma pigmentosum and skin cancer population. 
Solitary dorsal intramedullary schwannoma. Case report. A case of solitary dorsal intramedullary schwannoma diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging and treated surgically is reported. The authors review the previously published cases. The possible etiology of the tumor as well as some difficulties encountered in the diagnostic procedure and treatment are discussed. 
Bilateral chylothorax. A 2.5-kg female developed bilateral chylothoraces 10 days after surgery for coarctation of the aorta. Initial conservative management consisted of intermittent positive pressure ventilation, drainage of chylous fluid and enteral feeding, but there was no diminution in loss of chyle. Ligation of the thoracic duct and pleurectomy were performed subsequently to reduce the large daily losses of chyle, amounting to nearly three times the child's circulating blood volume. Brawny oedema of the right upper quadrant of the body developed rapidly after the duct ligation and right pleurectomy. A further period of conservative treatment was required before the latter complication resolved. The literature relating to this iatrogenic complication and to fluid and nutritional losses in paediatric chylothorax is reviewed and discussed. 
Renal effects of atrial natriuretic peptide during dopamine infusion. To study whether the renal effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are different from those of dopamine, we compared the effects of dopamine and dopamine plus ANP on renal circulation. Dopamine was infused at 1 microgram/kg/min for 120 min into 7 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and 5 normotensive subjects (NT). After 40 min of dopamine infusion, ANP infusion at 25 ng/kg/min was added to dopamine for 40 min. Before, during and after the infusion, renal function and nephrogenous cGMP were determined. Dopamine did not influence blood pressure, but increased urinary Na excretion (UNaV) by 100% in EH and NT. Addition of ANP further increased UNaV by 90%, but increases in UNaV were greater in EH than in NT. Renal blood flow was increased only by dopamine, while glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was increased by both dopamine (+8%) and dopamine plus ANP (+7%) as a whole, resulting in a significant increase in filtration fraction by the addition of ANP. Plasma and urinary cGMP and nephrogenous cGMP were elevated only during ANP infusion. These results suggest that the effects of ANP and dopamine on both GFR and UNaV were additive. However, in contrast with dopamine, ANP increased efferent resistance and nephrogenous cGMP, suggesting that the renal effects of ANP are different from those of dopamine. 
Safety and immunogenicity of human rotavirus vaccine strain M37 in adults, children, and infants. Rotavirus vaccine strain M37 (serotype 1), recovered from the stool of an asymptomatic newborn infant and serially passaged in cell culture, was given orally to adults, children, and infants. Serologic responses were detected by neutralization assay or EIA in 59% of 17 adults (10(5)-pfu dose), 55%-60% of 21 infants and children (10(4)-pfu dose), and 70% of 10 infants (10(5)-pfu dose), vaccine virus was shed by 24%, 20%-36%, and 70%, respectively. In adults, neutralizing antibody rises to strain M37 and the related serotype 1 strain Wa occurred with equal frequency (41% vs. 47%). In pediatric subjects, the former were more frequent (36%-40%) than the latter (10%-18%). This was also true of 8 infants who received two doses of vaccine. Mild gastrointestinal illnesses occurred with equal frequency in pediatric subjects who received vaccine or placebo. Thus, strain M37 was well tolerated and immunogenic in young infants, but elicited primarily vaccine-strain-specific rather than serotype-specific neutralizing antibody responses. 
Clinical stage I carcinoma of the cervix: value of MR imaging in determining degree of invasiveness. The depth of tumor invasion measured at histologic examination is the most important prognostic factor in early-stage carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The ability of MR to estimate the depth of tumor invasion was studied in 47 patients who subsequently underwent radical hysterectomy. In two patients, MR failed to detect tumors with infiltration depths of 2 and 4 mm. The maximum sagittal tumor length along the axis of the cervix (D) and the maximum tumor area on sagittal (S) and axial (A) images were measured with MR. The depth of tumor infiltration determined histologically (I) correlated with the degree of infiltration noted on MR images. The univariate correlation coefficients for log I vs log D, log S, and log A were .87, .84, and .77, respectively. By stepwise inclusion of the variables in a multivariate analysis, the contributions to the coefficient of determination from including log S and log A after log D were less than 1%. The regression analysis showed that the best estimate for the depth of invasion was close to half of the sagittal tumor length measured on MR, I = D/2. Our experience shows that MR is valuable in determining the degree of invasiveness in clinical stage I tumors. 
Pneumococcal septic arthritis of the knee in a patient with multiple myeloma. Although most patients with multiple myeloma are predisposed to pneumococcal infections, such infections usually involve the respiratory tract or the meninges. Pneumococcal arthritis is rare in the general population and is unexpectedly even rarer in patients with myeloma. We believe this to be the first case of pneumococcal septic arthritis of the knee in a patient with myeloma. 
Scintillating scotomata associated with internal carotid artery dissection: report of three cases. We report three cases of cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection, which presented with visual symptoms resembling the migraine aura. When prolonged and especially when associated with other neurologic symptoms, such transient and positive visual phenomena can be manifestations of ICA dissection that mimic migraine. 
Motor variables correlated with the hand-to-mouth maneuver in stroke patients. This study investigated the relationship between each of three independent variables and the completion of the hand-to-mouth maneuver in 23 hemiparetic stroke patients. The independent variables were elbow-extensor muscle tone (graded using the Modified Ashworth Scale); active elbow-flexion range-of-motion deficit measured without the influence of gravity; and elbow-flexion strength measured without the influence of gravity with a hand-held dynamometer. The hand-to-mouth maneuver was graded according to the degree of completion using a three-level ordinal scale. Spearman (rs) correlations demonstrated a significant relationship between the extent of completion of the hand-to-mouth maneuver and both the active elbow-flexion-range deficit (rs = -.853) and the elbow-flexor muscle force (rs = .829). The correlation of the maneuver with elbow-extensor muscle tone (rs = -.063) was not significant, but the relationship may have been influenced by the fact that only a minority of subjects had elevated tone, and that elevation was minimal. The result suggest that both active-movement deficits and muscle strength may be important to upper extremity function. 
Posturally induced microvascular constriction in patients with different stages of leg ischaemia: effect of local skin heating. 1. Skin microcirculation was investigated in 12 asymptomatic subjects and 76 patients, grouped according to their ankle-to-brachial systolic blood pressure index, in order to evaluate to what extent posturally induced microvascular constriction is dependent on the stage of leg ischaemia at different local skin temperatures. 2. Skin microcirculation was assessed in the supine and sitting position by using laser Doppler fluxmetry at unheated skin temperature and at 36 degrees C, and transcutaneous oximetry at 37 degrees C and 44 degrees C. 3. Skin perfusion and oxygenation diminished with decreasing ankle-to-brachial systolic blood pressure index. In healthy control subjects, perfusion and oxygenation were reduced when changing from the supine to the sitting position, but were enhanced in patients with severe leg ischaemia (ankle-to-brachial systolic blood pressure less than 30%), indicating disturbed posturally induced vasoconstriction. 4. Increasing the local skin temperature resulted in a higher perfusion and masked the posturally induced vasoconstriction in healthy subjects. In patients with severe leg ischaemia, however, perfusion was unaltered by the temperature increase, apparently because the microvessels were already maximally dilated. The induction of reactive hyperaemia produced no additional increase in perfusion or oxygenation. 5. It is concluded that posturally induced microvascular constriction in the skin is disturbed in patients with severe leg ischaemia (ankle-to-brachial systolic blood pressure index less than 30%). Disturbed microvascular constriction upon dependency was also seen in healthy subjects after local skin heating. This suggests that posturally induced vasoconstriction is mainly regulated by local mechanisms. 
Using a low current radiosurgical unit to obliterate facial telangiectasias. A method is presented using the Ellman Surgitron to obliterate facial telangiectasias in an effective manner. One of several types of needles, low current setting, and continuous depression of the footswitch provide efficiency with virtual pain-free operation. 
Renal O2 consumption during progressive hemorrhage. Most mammalian tissues regulate O2 utilization such that O2 consumption (VO2) is relatively constant at O2 delivery (DO2) higher than a critical value (DO2c). We studied the relationship between VO2 and DO2 of kidney and whole body during graded progressive exsanguination. The relationship between whole body VO2 and DO2 was biphasic, and whole body VO2 decreased by 5.6 +/- 14.4% (P = NS) from the initial value to the value nearest whole body DO2c. Kidney DO2 decreased in direct proportion to whole body DO2 such that the average R2 value describing the linear regression of kidney DO2 vs. whole body DO2 was 0.94 +/- 0.02. The relationship between kidney, like whole body, VO2 and DO2 appeared biphasic; however, kidney VO2 decreased by 63.3 +/- 10.4% (P less than 0.0001) from the initial value to the value nearest kidney DO2c. Renal O2 extraction ratio was relatively constant over a wide range of kidney DO2, whereas whole body O2 extraction ratio increased progressively at all whole body DO2 values as whole body DO2 decreased. However, final values of O2 extraction ratio were indistinguishable for whole body (0.86 +/- 0.1) and kidney (0.86 +/- 0.06) (P = NS). We conclude that the pattern of kidney and whole body VO2 response to decreasing DO2 differs during hemorrhage, particularly in the range of DO2 normally associated with tissue wellness. 
Strongly succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels in muscles from patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. Intramuscular blood vessels were examined with succinate dehydrogenase stain in skeletal muscle biopsy specimens from 6 patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Almost all arteries had large granular deposits with high succinate dehydrogenase activity in their walls. Electron microscopic examination of serial frozen sections of these biopsies showed that the smooth muscle cells of the strongly succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels contained markedly proliferated mitochondria, characteristic of patients with MELAS. The presence of strongly succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels in muscle biopsy specimens provides an important clue toward understanding the underlying pathogenetic mechanism in patients with MELAS as well as another approach to the diagnosis of this disorder. 
Insulin action and metabolism in patients with head and neck cancer. Cachexia is a phenomenon commonly observed in patients with cancer, but its etiology is poorly understood. Abnormalities of insulin action and metabolism that have been hypothesized to promote cancer cachexia were investigated in this study using a computerized euglycemic clamp and modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) in a group of malnourished patients with localized head and neck cancer, and in healthy, well-nourished, age- and, sex-matched controls. Glucose disposal rates, determined by the euglycemic clamp at three different rates of insulin infusion did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, mean plasma insulin concentrations at each level of insulin infused were significantly lower in the patients with cancer than in the control subjects resulting in unexpectedly higher calculated insulin metabolic clearance rate in the patients with cancer. Peripheral insulin sensitivity calculated from the slope of glucose disposal versus plasma insulin concentration did not differ between the two groups. Results from the FSIGT demonstrated no difference in insulin sensitivity or insulin-independent glucose disappearance between the two groups. However, whole body glucose appearance was significantly elevated in the patients with cancer. Thus, increased whole body glucose utilization in the absence of insulin resistance or increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal was observed. These data are consistent with the concept of a localized tumor acting as a glucose drain in which case increased glucose appearance and increased insulin clearance would defend against hypoglycemia. 
Pharmacokinetics of lidocaine in children with congenital heart disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine in children with congenital heart disease (CHD). Fifteen children with left to right intracardiac shunting of blood (acyanotic group) and 15 children with right to left intracardiac shunting of blood (cyanotic group) were studied and compared with 15 children without CHD (control group). Lidocaine (1.5 mg.kg-1) was injected into a peripheral vein over 30 sec and serial samples of arterial blood were obtained up to 120 min after completion of the infusion. Total and free lidocaine were analyzed by enzyme immunoassay. The serum concentration of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) at induction of anaesthesia was measured in the three groups by radial immunodiffusion. The percent free lidocaine (100 x [free lidocaine]/[total lidocaine]) was greater at 30 sec post-infusion in all three groups (35-37%) than it was at any other time but was not significantly different among the three groups (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in either the percent free or the total lidocaine concentration at any sample time or in any of the pharmacokinetic variables among the three groups. The serum concentration of alpha 1-AGP did not differ significantly among the three groups of patients. We conclude that the presence of intracardiac shunts does not alter the pharmacokinetic behaviour of intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg.kg-1) in children. The percent free lidocaine is greatest immediately post-injection and this may mitigate against rapid bolus administration of intravenous lidocaine in children. 
Lithotripsy versus cholecystectomy for management of gallstones. A decision analysis by Markov process. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is a new treatment method that effectively distintegrates radiolucent gallstones and is associated with a low complication rate. Using the model of a Markov process for decision analysis, survival and costs under four possible strategies to treat gallstones were compared: expectant management with cholecystectomy (EC) or lithotripsy (EL) reserved for symptomatic gallstones; prophylactic cholecystectomy (PC) or lithotripsy (PL) for all gallstones. Life expectancy for the different strategies varies by few days. Only if high annual rates of pain and complication occurred in subjects with silent gallstones would both prophylactic procedures marginally increase life expectancy. Prophylactic cholecystectomy then would be more cost-effective than prophylactic lithotripsy. Expectant strategies remain much cheaper than prophylactic management over a broad range of probability values and procedural costs. Expectant use of lithotripsy costs less than cholecystectomy. A low success rate of lithotripsy would raise the direct costs of lithotripsy above those of cholecystectomy but leave total costs of both strategies in the same order of magnitude. Lithotripsy appears to be a feasible alternative to treat symptomatic but not asymptomatic gallstones. 
Role of endothelium on the effects of neuropeptide Y in mesenteric resistance arteries of spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats. The role of the endothelium in the effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and norepinephrine was investigated in mesenteric resistance arteries of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and of the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY). Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (1 microM) was reduced in arteries of SHR compared with WKY. In the presence of the endothelium, the vessels of the two strains responded similarly to norepinephrine and NPY (100 nM) produced only a slight contraction. After removal of the endothelium, the response to norepinephrine was greater in WKY than in SHR. Furthermore, endothelium denudation enhanced markedly contraction elicited by NPY in WKY (up to 40% of the maximal effect of norepinephrine), but not in SHR. NPY potentiated the contractile response to low concentrations of norepinephrine (less than 300 nM) in both strains regardless whether the endothelium was intact or not. These results indicate that the contractile responses to NPY and to norepinephrine are inhibited by the endothelium in vessels of WKY, but not in those of the SHR. Furthermore, the potentiating effect of NPY occurs via an endothelium-independent mechanism in mesenteric arteries of both SHR and WKY. It is proposed that the differential responses between the two strains are related to abnormal function of the endothelium and to decreased responsiveness of smooth muscle cells in mesenteric resistance arteries of SHR compared to WKY. 
Atrial fibrillation in patients with an accessory pathway: importance of the conduction properties of the accessory pathway. To investigate how the electrophysiologic properties of the accessory pathway affect the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, programmed stimulation data of 57 patients with overt pre-excitation and 33 patients with a concealed accessory pathway with documented circus movement tachycardia were reviewed. Atrial fibrillation had occurred spontaneously in 31 (54%) of the 57 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and in 1 (3%) of the 33 with a concealed accessory pathway (p less than 0.001). Sustained atrial fibrillation was induced in 23 of 31 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and spontaneous atrial fibrillation (Group A), in 7 of 26 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome without spontaneous atrial fibrillation (Group B) and in 5 of 33 patients with a concealed accessory pathway (Group C). The anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway was shorter in Group A than in Group B (252 versus 297 ms, p less than 0.001). There were no differences among groups in PA interval, right to left atrium conduction time, cycle length of tachycardia and atrial and retrograde accessory pathway effective refractory period. Atrial fibrillation is more frequent in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome than in those with a concealed accessory pathway. Patients with overt pre-excitation and atrial fibrillation have a shorter anterograde accessory pathway refractory period. It seems therefore that the anterograde rather than the retrograde conduction properties of the accessory pathway are the critical determinants of atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. 
Diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in children: comparison of sonography and 99mTc-DMSA scintigraphy. Ninety-one children 1 week to 10 years old with culture-documented febrile urinary tract infection were evaluated with renal sonography and renal cortical scintigraphy by using 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). On the basis of previous experimental studies, DMSA scintigraphy was used as the standard of reference for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. The DMSA scans showed changes consistent with acute pyelonephritis in 63% (57/91) of the patients. Sonograms showed changes consistent with acute pyelonephritis in 24% (22/91) of the whole group and in only 39% (22/57) of the patients with scintigraphically documented acute pyelonephritis. Pertinent sonographic findings were areas of increased cortical echogenicity in 14 patients and decreased echogenicity in eight, including three patients with renal abscesses. Dilatation of the renal collecting system was noted in nine patients and renal enlargement was noted in three. We conclude that renal sonography is a relatively insensitive test for the detection of acute inflammatory changes of renal cortex. Therefore, it should not be used as the primary imaging technique for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. However, sonography is a useful technique in evaluating the nature of the defects seen on the DMSA scan and in detecting obstructive uropathies that may be associated with urinary tract infections. 
Giant pseudoaneurysm of the extracranial vertebral artery successfully treated using intraoperative balloon catheters. Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the extracranial vertebral artery rarely occur, because of its deeply protected anatomical location. Because the direct surgical approach has resulted in high morbidity and mortality rates, ligation of the vertebral artery has been adopted, but this can cause an ischemia in the vertebrobasilar system. We report the case of a 73-year-old woman with a huge pseudoaneurysm of the right vertebral artery that occurred after attempted placement of a cardiac pacemaker. The aneurysm was 7 x 7 x 5 cm in size and its neck was situated just distal to the right subclavian artery. Direct surgical repair of the injured vessel and removal of the aneurysm were successfully performed using balloon catheters placed intraoperatively in both the innominate artery and the right vertebral artery. 
Group- vs home-based exercise training in healthy older men and women. A community-based clinical trial. OBJECTIVE.--To determine the effectiveness of group- vs home-based exercise training of higher and lower intensities among healthy, sedentary older adults. DESIGN.--Year-long randomized, controlled trial comparing (1) higher-intensity group-based exercise training; (2) higher-intensity home-based exercise training; (3) lower-intensity home-based exercise training; or (4) assessment-only control. SETTING.--General community located in northern California. PARTICIPANTS.--One hundred sixty women and 197 men 50 to 65 years of age who were sedentary and free of cardiovascular disease. One out of nine persons contacted through a community random-digit-dial telephone survey and citywide promotion were randomized. INTERVENTIONS.--For higher-intensity exercise training, three 40-minute endurance training sessions per week were prescribed at 73% to 88% of peak treadmill heart rate. For lower-intensity exercise training, five 30-minute endurance training sessions per week were prescribed at 60% to 73% of peak treadmill heart rate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Treadmill exercise test performance, exercise participation rates, and heart disease risk factors. RESULTS.--Compared with controls, subjects in all three exercise training conditions showed significant improvements in treadmill exercise test performance at 6 and 12 months (P less than .03). Lower-intensity exercise training achieved changes comparable with those of higher-intensity exercise training. Twelve-month exercise adherence rates were better for the two home-based exercise training conditions relative to the group-based exercise training condition (P less than .0005). There were no significant training-induced changes in lipid levels, weight, or blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS.--We conclude that (1) this community-based exercise training program improved fitness but not heart disease risk factors among sedentary, healthy older adults; (2) home-based exercise was as effective as group exercise in producing these changes; (3) lower-intensity exercise training was as effective as higher-intensity exercise training in the home setting; and (4) the exercise programs were relatively safe. 
Role of membrane proteins in monosodium urate crystal-membrane interactions. I. Effect of pretreatment of erythrocyte membranes with glutaraldehyde and neuraminidase. Intact human erythrocytes were pretreated with glutaraldehyde, neuraminidase or a combination of both treatments, incubated with monosodium urate monohydrate (MSUM) crystals and the percent hemolysis values determined by measuring hemoglobin release from the cells. The binding of MSUM crystals to pretreated erythrocyte membranes was also quantitated. Neuraminidase treated cells gave higher percent hemolysis values than untreated cells due primarily to the increased binding of MSUM to neuraminidase treated erythrocyte membranes. Pretreatment of red cells with glutaraldehyde up to a maximum concentration of 0.015% inhibited MSUM induced hemolysis but the binding of MSUM to glutaraldehyde treated and untreated cell membranes was the same. We propose a "pore" model for MSUM induced hemolysis. 
Techniques to create urinary continence in the cloacal exstrophy patient. Of 15 patients with cloacal exstrophy currently under management 11 have undergone procedures for the establishment of urinary continence. There were 8 genetic female subjects, 6 genetic male subjects raised as girls and 1 genetic male subject raised as a boy. The genetic female subjects had all undergone urethral reconstruction. In 4 patients urethral reconstruction was done with local tissues and they have subsequently undergone bladder neck reconstruction: 1 is continent and voids through the urethra, 2 are dry on intermittent catheterization and 1 is dry on intermittent catheterization after augmentation with a hindgut patch. One girl underwent a Kropp procedure along with bladder augmentation, and she is dry on intermittent catheterization, in 1 urethral reconstruction was done with an ileal nipple through which she performs intermittent catheterization and 2 await a continence procedure. The urethral reconstructions in the genetic male subjects were more difficult. Of the 6 genetic male subjects raised as girls 5 have undergone continence procedures and 1 awaits establishment of urinary continence. In only 1 patient was urethral reconstruction possible from local tissues to allow intermittent catheterization. In the other 4 the perineal urethra was closed in favor of an abdominal stoma for intermittent catheterization. Ileal plication with nipple formation of the stoma was done in 3 patients and a Benchekroun stoma was used in 1. The genetic male subject raised as a boy underwent exstrophy reclosure plus epispadias repair and subsequent bladder neck reconstruction and augmentation. Augmentation was performed in 5 patients with hindgut segments in 3 and ileum in 2. All 5 patients are currently dry on intermittent catheterization, although 1 required revision of the ileal nipple to a Benchekroun stoma. Staged reconstruction can produce acceptable urinary continence in this complex anomaly. An innovative approach is required to find the most suitable solution for each patient anatomy, bladder size and function, and mental, neurological and orthopedic status. 
Povidone-iodine in experimental peritoneal hydatidosis. The effect of polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine (PVP-I) on experimental peritoneal hydatidosis was evaluated in this randomized blind controlled study. Seventy-five white, 3-month-old rats were subjected to laparotomy. After the intraperitoneal inoculation of viable scolices, the rats were randomly divided into three groups. Their peritoneal cavities were irrigated with either 1 per cent PVP-I solution (the PVP-I group), hypertonic saline (the HS group) or Ringer's lactate (the control group). Each group was assigned a separate code number; observers blind to the meaning of the code numbers noted all findings during a period of 4 months, after which the rats were killed to allow assessment of the abdominal cavity. The results were decoded after the statistical analyses were completed. The incidence of peritoneal cysts was found to be lower (8.7 per cent) in the PVP-I group compared with the HS (50 per cent) and control (90.9 per cent) groups; the mean number of hydatid cysts per animal was also lower in the PVP-I group compared with the other two groups. We conclude that the scolicidal activity of PVP-I is significantly higher than that of hypertonic saline and that it can be employed as a prophylactic agent against peritoneal hydatidosis. 
Induction of the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria phenotype in normal human erythrocytes: effects of 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide on membrane proteins that regulate complement. To investigate the mechanism by which treatment of normal human erythrocytes with the sulfhydryl reagent 2-aminoethylisothiouronium bromide (AET) induces susceptibility to complement mediated lysis, the effects of AET on the structural and functional integrity of decay accelerating factor (DAF), membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL), and complement receptor type 1 (CR1) were examined. Following treatment with AET, erythrocyte MIRL and CR1 were no longer recognized in situ by antibodies, and antibody binding to DAF was diminished by approximately 50%. These studies indicated that the structural integrity of the three complement regulatory proteins was either partially (DAF) or completely (MIRL and CR1) disrupted by AET. Subsequent experiments showed that functional inactivation paralleled the structural disruption. Treatment of normal erythrocytes with AET induced susceptibility to cobra venom factor-initiated hemolysis, indicating that the functional activity of MIRL had been destroyed. The capacity of erythrocyte CR1 to serve as a cofactor for factor I-mediated cleavage of iC3b to C3c and C3dg was lost following treatment with AET. C3 convertase activity increase markedly following treatment of erythrocytes with AET, but convertase activity on AET cells was approximately 50% less than that observed when DAF function on normal cells was completely inhibited by antibody. Susceptibility of AET cells to acidified serum lysis was shown to be due primarily to inactivation of MIRL. Unexpectedly, in acidified serum the activity of the amplification C3 convertase of the APC was found to be controlled by MIRL as well as by DAF. These studies show that AET induces susceptibility to complement-mediated lysis by disrupting the structural and functional integrity of membrane constituents that regulate the activity of both the C3 convertases and the membrane attack complex of complement. 
Long-term outcome of antidepressant treatment for bulimia nervosa. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was 1) to replicate previous work indicating that antidepressant medication is superior to placebo in the treatment of bulimia nervosa and 2) to assess the long-term efficacy of this form of treatment. METHOD: Eighty patients entered a three-phase treatment protocol. An 8-week double-blind initiation phase was used to compare the effects of desipramine and placebo. Patients who responded satisfactorily to desipramine entered a 16-week maintenance phase. Patients who remained well were then randomly assigned to either desipramine or placebo for 6 additional months (discontinuation phase). The primary outcome measure was binge frequency, which was assessed weekly by self-report diaries. RESULTS: In the initiation phase the superiority of desipramine over placebo in reducing binge frequency was demonstrated. Patients treated with desipramine had a mean reduction in binge frequency of 47% at termination, whereas patients taking placebo experienced a mean increase of 7%. Less than half of the patients treated with desipramine met the criteria for entering the maintenance phase, and 29% of the patients entering that phase relapsed in the following 4 months. There were not enough patients in the discontinuation phase to permit clear conclusions about the need for continued antidepressant medication after 6 months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The study documents a beneficial effect of desipramine in the treatment of bulimia nervosa when compared to placebo. However, limited improvement and considerable relapse with continued treatment suggest serious limitations to the long-term efficacy of a single antidepressant trial in treating bulimia nervosa. 
The prevalence of oral lesions in HIV-infected homosexual and bisexual men: three San Francisco epidemiological cohorts. To establish the prevalence of HIV-related oral lesions, we performed oral examinations of members of three San Francisco epidemiological cohorts of homosexual and bisexual men over a 3-year period. Hairy leukoplakia, pseudomembranous and erythematous candidiasis, angular cheilitis, Kaposi's sarcoma, and oral ulcers were more common in HIV-infected subjects than in HIV-negative subjects. Among HIV-infected individuals, hairy leukoplakia was the most common lesion [20.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.5-23.3%] and pseudomembranous candidiasis was the next most common (5.8%, 95% CI 4.1-7.5%). Hairy leukoplakia, pseudomembranous candidiasis, angular cheilitis and Kaposi's sarcoma were significantly more common in patients with lower CD4 lymphocyte counts (P less than 0.05). The prevalence of erythematous candidiasis and Kaposi's sarcoma increased during the 3-year period. Careful oral examinations may identify infected patients and provide suggestive information concerning their immune status. 
Lack of diameter effect on short-term patency of size-matched Dacron aortobifemoral grafts. This study examined the relationship between graft diameter and subsequent patency in 79 patients who received Dacron aortobifemoral bypass grafts for aortoiliac occlusive disease between 1985 and 1989. Sixty-five percent of these patients were men, 25% were diabetic, and 94% were smokers, with an average age of 62 years. Patients were followed for a mean interval of 24 months. Life-table survival was 92% at 3 years. All surviving patients showed "significant" postoperative improvement by use of Society for Vascular Surgery/International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery combined clinical and vascular laboratory criteria. There were three early and five late graft thromboses. Primary and secondary life-table patencies were 85% and 92%, respectively, at 3 years. Dacron bifurcation grafts were selected to match the size of native arteries. Patients receiving small diameter grafts, defined as 12 mm (n = 9) and 14 mm (n = 39), were compared with patients receiving large diameter grafts of 16 mm (n = 26) and 18 mm (n = 5). Small diameter grafts were more likely to be used in women (p less than 0.01), but patient groups were otherwise comparable with respect to age, smoking history, diabetes, outflow status, operative indications, type of proximal anastomosis (end-to-end or end-to-side), location of distal anastomosis (common femoral vs deep femoral), type of graft construction (knitted vs woven), and functional result. Graft diameter did not influence life-table patency, which was 84% for small and 87% for large diameter grafts at 3 years (p = 0.74). Furthermore, none of the other variables listed above influenced graft patency. 
Nodular vasculitis (erythema induratum): treatment with auranofin. A patient with nodular vasculitis was treated successfully with oral gold. This therapy is safe and devoid of significant side effects. The rationale and advantages of the use of oral gold in patients with nodular vasculitis are discussed. 
Longitudinal analyses of respiratory chemosensitivity in normal subjects. To evaluate relative contributions of inherent versus extrinsic factors to respiratory chemosensitivity, ventilatory responses to isocapnic progressive hypoxia and normoxic progressive hypercapnia were examined at intervals of 8 to 10 yr in 32 healthy male volunteers aged 42.2 +/- 1.4 yr (SEM) in the final examination. The volunteers included 22 sons of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mean value for the slope factor of the end-tidal PO2-ventilation hyperbola (A) significantly decreased from 98.3 +/- 12.2 to 77.4 +/- 10.3 L/min mm Hg (p less than 0.05), but that for the end-tidal PCO2 ventilation line (S) did not change over the years. The individual values for the hypoxic ventilatory response were significantly correlated (r = 0.63, p less than 0.001) between the initial and final examinations but not so for the hypercapnic ventilatory response (r = 0.23, NS), suggesting that the latter is more subject to influence from extrinsic factors than the former in the long term. The reproducibility of both tests expressed as coefficients of variation was similar or rather small for the hypercapnic ventilatory response, which was determined by three consecutive measurements at 1 wk intervals in a different group of six subjects. From these data we conclude that hypoxic chemosensitivity is more determined by factors inherent to the individual than hypercapnic chemosensitivity and that it is more systematically influenced by temporal factors, as demonstrated by the systematic decrease over the years. 
Familial leg ulcers of juvenile onset Chronic ulceration of the legs was found in the propositus and in ten male relatives in a family of Iraqi Jews. All eleven males had juvenile onset of symptoms. Venous lesions with ulceration were found in two of the propositus' brothers and without ulceration in his three sisters. The findings suggest an autosomal dominant sex-limited genetic defect. 
Continuous monitoring of cerebral oxygenation in acute brain injury: injection of mannitol during hyperventilation. Global cerebral oxygenation, perfusion pressure, and expired pCO2 were continuously monitored in 10 adults with acute severe closed head trauma. Cerebral oxygenation was monitored by fiberoptic catheter oximetry, which allowed simultaneous measurements of arterial and jugular bulb oxyhemoglobin saturation. Intracranial pressure levels over 20 mm Hg were recorded several times in all patients, in spite of sedation, muscle paralysis, and profound hyperventilation. Intracranial hypertension was frequently associated with oligemic cerebral hypoxia, identified as abnormally low jugular oxygen saturation in the presence of normal arterial oxygenation. Intracranial hypertension was then managed with intravenous administration of mannitol boluses, which yielded simultaneous decreases in intracranial pressure and increases in cerebral oxygenation to highly statistically significant levels. Monitoring cerebral oxygenation was clinically useful because it allowed identification of impaired cerebral oxygenation even when cerebral perfusion pressure was normal. It is therefore proposed as a new monitoring technique, to supplement conventional monitoring of cerebral perfusion pressure. 
The influence of volume on the tolerance of the brain to radiosurgery. Radiosurgery (delivery of a high dose of radiation to a small volume of the brain) is usually well tolerated since the volume of brain irradiated is small. Despite growing interest in radiosurgery, the influence of the volume of brain irradiated on the tolerance of the brain to radiation is not well understood. The results of six studies reporting clinically significant radiation reactions following radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations are reviewed. In the combined series, 23 (9%) of 255 patients developed a clinically significant radiation reaction. The volume of brain irradiated and the dose delivered in each of these 23 patients are presented. The compiled data suggest that the previously presented guidelines may underestimate the risks of radiosurgery. Additional clinical and experimental data are needed to determine "safe" doses of radiation to be used during radiosurgery. 
Influence of coronary collateral vessels on myocardial infarct size in humans. Results of phase I thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) trial. The TIMI Investigators BACKGROUND. The influence of coronary collateral vessels on infarct size in humans remains controversial, partly because no previous study has examined the impact of collaterals present at the onset of acute myocardial infarction on infarct size. METHODS AND RESULTS. The present study used the data base of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Phase I trial to correlate the presence or absence of angiographically documented collaterals in the initial hours of myocardial infarct evolution with the size of the infarct as assessed by serial measurements of serum creatine kinase (CK). To avoid the confounding effects of reperfusion on enzymatic estimates of infarct size, this report is limited to those 125 patients who failed to recanalize at 90 minutes after administration of tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase. Patients with angiographically documented collaterals (group A, n = 51) had significantly lower values of peak serum CK than patients without collaterals (group B, n = 74) (1,877 +/- 216 versus 2,661 +/- 212 IU/l, respectively [mean +/- SEM], p = 0.004). Similarly, CK-derived infarct size estimates were significantly lower in group A than in group B (20.6 +/- 2.5 versus 31.4 +/- 2.8 CK gram equivalents, p = 0.001). The infarct size observed in patients with collaterals was less for anterior infarctions as well as for infarctions of other locations; thus, the beneficial effects of collaterals were independent of the site of the infarct. In 65 of the 125 patients who failed to reperfuse, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed by contrast ventriculography both at initial cardiac catheterization (before thrombolytic therapy) and at hospital discharge. Among the patients who had both studies, global LVEF tended to increase from pretreatment to hospital discharge in group A (from 50.6 +/- 1.8% to 53.4 +/- 1.8%, p = 0.10) but decreased in group B patients (from 50.3 +/- 1.8% to 47.8 +/- 1.7%, p = 0.02). At hospital discharge, global LVEF was greater in patients with coronary collaterals (53.5 +/- 1.7% versus 49.6 +/- 1.7%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. The results demonstrate that, in patients in whom thrombolytic therapy fails to induce reperfusion, the presence of coronary collateral vessels at the onset of myocardial infarction is associated with limitation of infarct size as assessed enzymatically and with improved ventricular function on discharge as assessed by LVEF. 
A simple method for biliary-enteric anastomosis and chronic bile diversion in the rat. A simple method of biliary-enteric anastomosis, without the use of surgical microscopy, is described. There were no signs of cholestasis after 3 mo of follow-up. A modified procedure using a silicone elastomer catheter as a stent for the biliary-enteric anastomosis resulted in biliary obstruction within 3 wk after surgery. Our experimental bile duct implantation technique is a simple and useful experimental method for the investigation of chronic biliary diversion and biliary physiology. Additionally, it can be performed safely and easily in a rodent model without sophisticated microscopic techniques. 
Central nervous system monitoring. What helps, what does not. The ICU monitoring of CNS function can make a difference in the clinical outcome. No single technique addresses the multiple issues that arise in the ICU setting, especially for the polytrauma patient. Multimodality approaches combining assessment of cerebral blood flow, electrophysiologic parameters, and intracranial pressure, when appropriate, with cardiac and respiratory monitors are being developed at a number of traumatology centers world wide. Experience needs to be gained to establish the best combination of these modalities. Pending this, selected use of intracranial pressure monitoring combined with EEG and transcranial Doppler ultrasound provides reliable immediate assessment and ongoing monitoring of CNS structures. 
Prediction of lymph node involvement in breast cancer by detection of altered glycosylation in the primary tumour. Axillary lymph node metastases at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer is the most accurate predictor of long-term prognosis. However, in patients treated by conservative surgery lymph node status often remains unknown. We have investigated the relation between changes in glycosylation of primary breast cancer cells, as judged by lectin binding, and the presence of axillary lymph node metastases. In a 24-year retrospective study, paraffin-embedded sections of 373 primary breast cancers were stained for the binding of Helix pomatia lectin (HPA). There was a strong association between HPA binding and presence of lymph node metastases, but no association with tumour size, histological grade, S-phase fraction, or patient age at diagnosis. This relation was confirmed by multiple regression analysis (in both survival and relapse free survival models) in which the prognostic significance of HPA binding was lost once nodal status had been introduced into the models. Life tables calculated for lymph-node positive versus lymph-node negative and HPA staining versus non-staining patients were almost identical over 15 years of follow-up. We propose that HPA recognises a glycoprotein that is associated with metastasis (to axillary lymph nodes and elsewhere) and poor prognosis in breast cancer. HPA binding to paraffin sections of primary tumour could aid difficult treatment decisions by providing an additional assessment of staging and likely long-term patient prognosis. 
Prospective evaluation of unilateral adrenal masses in patients with operable non-small-cell lung cancer. Although adrenal metastases are frequently noted with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at autopsy, their incidence in patients with operable NSCLC is unclear. We prospectively assessed consecutive patients with otherwise operable NSCLC for the incidence and histology of unilateral adrenal masses. Assessment included blood chemistries, lung function tests, bronchoscopy, chest x-ray, bone scan, and computed tomography (CT) of the head, chest, and upper abdomen. Of 246 patients with otherwise operable NSCLC, 10 (4.1%) had a unilateral adrenal mass. Unilateral adrenal masses were needle-aspirated under CT control. If cytology was nondiagnostic, adrenalectomy was performed. Four (40%) of 10 patients had adrenal metastases proven by needle aspiration. Of the six (60%) patients with benign unilateral adrenal masses, one was demonstrated by needle aspiration. In the other five patients, a nondiagnostic needle aspiration led to adrenalectomy, which yielded two adenomas, two hyperplastic nodules, and one hemorrhagic cyst. There was no significant difference between the patients with benign and metastatic unilateral adrenal masses with respect to patient age or stage and size of adrenal mass. Patients with benign unilateral adrenal masses underwent curative resection of their NSCLC and had significantly prolonged survival compared with patients with metastatic unilateral adrenal masses treated with chemotherapy (P = .037). Median survival of patients with benign and metastatic unilateral adrenal masses was greater than 30 months and 9 months, respectively. In conclusion, the presence of unilateral adrenal masses in patients with otherwise operable NSCLC should not preclude thoracotomy without pathologic proof of metastatic disease. 
Nocturnal hypoxemia as a determinant of vigilance impairment in sleep apnea syndrome. In sleep apnea syndrome (SAS), vigilance impairment is typically associated with highly disrupted sleep, but recently, nocturnal hypoxemia has also been identified as a second pathogenetic factor in patients with a high degree of desaturation. However, although sleep disruption has been demonstrated to play a role in both the propensity to fall asleep and the capacity to stay awake, the role of nocturnal hypoxemia has been implicated only in the latter. In the present study, both sleep disruption and nocturnal hypoxemia were assessed in 20 moderately to severely apneic patients. During the day, vigilance was assessed both by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), as a measure of the propensity to fall asleep, and by the four-choice reaction time test (FCRTT), as a measure of the capacity to stay awake in a performance task. Severity of nocturnal hypoxemia was found to predict performance on the MSLT, as well as on the FCRTT, but sleep disruption was found to predict performance only on the FCRTT. These results suggest that in moderately to severely affected SAS patients, nocturnal hypoxemia may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of vigilance impairment. 
Treatment of critically ill patients with sepsis of unknown cause: value of percutaneous cholecystostomy. Because of the difficulty in diagnosing acute cholecystitis in critically ill patients with severe intercurrent illness by clinical and imaging methods or percutaneous aspiration of the gallbladder, a trial of percutaneous cholecystostomy was performed in 24 patients in the intensive-care unit with persistent, unexplained sepsis after a complete clinical, laboratory, and radiologic search showed no alternative source of infection. Persistent high fevers, despite antibiotic therapy, were present in all patients, with elevated WBC count in 18 patients, vague abdominal tenderness in 11, and septic shock requiring vasopressors in 15. Sonographically, all patients had distended, spherical gallbladders, six had gallstones, eight had wall thickening, three had pericholecystic fluid, and four had Murphy's sign. All patients were seen by a senior abdominal surgeon, who agreed to a trial of percutaneous cholecystostomy. Fourteen patients (58%) responded to percutaneous cholecystostomy, as evidenced by a decrease in WBC count, defervescence, and the ability to be weaned off vasopressors. Bile cultures were positive in four patients. Ten patients (42%) did not respond to percutaneous cholecystostomy; five eventually died of unrelated causes. A respiratory source of infection was eventually found in three of these 10 patients, with no proved source of infection in the remainder. No complications related to catheter insertion occurred in this group of patients. Bile leaks occurred in two patients when the percutaneous cholecystostomy catheter was removed, but without serious consequence. Our experience suggests that a lower threshold for performing percutaneous cholecystostomy in this difficult clinical subset of patients is worthwhile. 
In situ oncocytic change in association with multiple renal cell adenocarcinomas. We report a case of in situ oncocytic change in association with two low-grade renal cell adenocarcinomas and one contralateral low-grade oncocytic adenocarcinoma. The in situ oncocytic change showed abundant cytoplasmic mitochondria confirmed by ultrastructural examination and phosphotungstic acid-hemotoxylin staining. In addition, this in situ oncocytic change expressed cytokeratin CAM 5.2 in the absence of cytokeratin AE1/AE3, as reported in oncocytic renal cell adenocarcinomas. Further study of in situ oncocytic change identified in kidneys resected for adenocarcinomas with regard to follow-up and management of the contralateral kidney seems indicated. 
Genetics of colon cancer. Strikingly rapid advances in the identification of genetic events that are important in colonic carcinogenesis have been made in the past several years. Specific inherited (adenomatous polyposis coli gene) and acquired (ras gene point mutations; c-myc gene amplification; allelic deletion at specific sites on chromosomes 5, 17, and 18) genetic abnormalities appear to be capable of mediating steps in the progression from normal to malignant colonic mucosa. Understanding these genetic factors and how they influence cellular function will have a profound effect on medical practice. High-risk populations will be (and are being) identified by genetic markers, thus allowing prevention and screening to be more precisely targeted to the population at risk; intervention strategies will be designed on the basis of the known cellular defects of neoplastic colonic mucosa; and new molecular preventive and therapeutic approaches can be developed. 
Head-injured patients who talk and deteriorate into coma. Analysis of 211 cases studied with computerized tomography. Of 838 patients with severe head injuries admitted since the introduction of computerized tomography, 211 (25.1%) talked at some time between trauma and subsequent deterioration into coma. Of these 211 patients, 89 (42.2%) had brain contusion/hematoma, 46 (21.8%) an epidural hematoma, 35 (16.6%) a subdural hematoma, and 41 (19.4%) did not show focal mass lesions. Thus, four of every five patients who deteriorated into coma after suffering an apparently nonsevere head injury had a mass lesion potentially requiring surgery: the mass was intracerebral in 52.3% of the cases and extracerebral in 47.6%. Patients aged 20 years or less had a 39% chance of having a nonfocal mass lesion (diffuse brain damage), a 29% chance of having an epidural hematoma, and a 32% chance of having an intradural mass lesion; patients over 40 years had only a 3% chance of having a nonfocal mass lesion, an 18% chance of having an epidural hematoma, and a 79% chance of having a intradural mass lesion. Sixty-eight (32.2%) patients died and 143 (67.8%) survived. The following were independent outcome predictors (in order of significance): Glasgow Coma Scale score following deterioration into coma, the highest intracranial pressure during the patient's course, the degree of midline shift, the type of intracranial lesion, and the age of the patient. In contrast, the mechanism of injury, the verbal Glasgow Coma Scale score during the lucid interval, and the length of time until deterioration or until operative intervention did not influence the final result. 
Effects of asymptomatic ischemia on long-term prognosis in chronic stable coronary disease. BACKGROUND. Ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring has been shown to adversely affect short-term prognoses in patients with unstable angina, after myocardial infarction, and with chronic stable angina. METHODS AND RESULTS. In this long-term study, we followed 138 patients (mean age, 59 +/- 9 years) with chronic stable angina and positive exercise tests for cardiac events (e.g. death, myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery). In 105 patients, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed after all antianginal medication was withheld for 48 hours. In 26 patients, the diagnostic tests were repeated while on their usual medication. In addition to the 105 patients, 33 patients had their monitoring performed only while on their usual medication. During 37 +/- 17 months of follow-up, there were nine deaths, nine myocardial infarctions, and 35 revascularization procedures. In patients monitored off medication, Cox survival analysis showed that the occurrence of ischemia on electrocardiographic monitoring was the most significant predictor of death and myocardial infarction in the subsequent 2 years (p = 0.02) and all adverse events for 5 years (p = 0.009). Patients who were monitored on medication and did not have ischemia (n = 18) appeared to have more adverse events than patients who had no ischemia while being monitored off medication (n = 43). CONCLUSIONS. Asymptomatic ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in patients with stable angina predicts death and myocardial infarction for 2 years and all adverse events for 5 years. Monitoring performed while on medication may show no ischemia; however, this may not indicate low risk of future coronary events. 
Effect of level of patient acuity on clinical decision making of critical care nurses with varying levels of knowledge and experience. This study is an examination of the effect of patient acuity on the clinical decision making of critical care nurses (N = 68) completing two computerized clinical simulations. Ventricular tachycardia represented the high-acuity situation and atrial flutter the lower-acuity situation. Clinical decision making was measured by proficiency score, patient outcome (cure or die), and amount of data collected. Analyses of variance were conducted to examine proficiency score and the amount of data collected. Fisher's exact test and the McNemar test of homogeneity of proportions were used to examine patient outcome. In the atrial flutter simulation, proficiency scores were higher (p = 0.000), more dysrhythmias were cured (p less than 0.005), and more data were collected (p = 0.040). Experienced and inexperienced nurses did not differ on proficiency score; however, inexperienced nurses collected more data (p = 0.048) and cured fewer atrial flutter simulations (p = 0.040). Nurses certified in advanced cardiac life support had higher proficiency scores (p = 0.033) and collected fewer data (p = 0.048). 
Merkel cell tumour: clinical behaviour and treatment. We have reviewed 30 reports of Merkel cell tumour and described a further five cases in order to establish a database and from this more clearly define the biology of this tumour, prognostic factors that govern outcome, and optimal management. After excision alone of the primary lesion, local recurrence occurred in 39 per cent of patients and regional failure occurred in 46 per cent. In contrast, in patients treated by excision plus prophylactic treatment (adjuvant node dissection and/or adjuvant radiation), local recurrence occurred in 26 per cent and regional failure in 22 per cent. Locoregional recurrence carried an ominous significance with 67 per cent of patients subsequently dying of the disease. For patients who either presented with regional disease or later developed regional disease, the best outcome (44 per cent survival with mean follow-up of 40 months) was obtained following treatment by therapeutic node dissection with or without radiation. In contrast, treatment of regional disease with radiation alone was associated with only a 20 per cent survival rate. Unfavourable prognostic factors included young age, lesions sited in the head and neck or trunk, male sex, and the presence of locoregional failure and/or systemic disease. We conclude that Merkel cell tumours behave in a similar manner to the aggressive variants of melanoma and that minimal treatment consists of wide surgical resection of the primary lesion (with a margin of 2.5-3 cm) coupled with resection and probably also radiation of regional disease if present. In addition, consideration should be given to prophylactic node dissection in node negative patients, especially in those patients with unfavourable prognostic factors. 
A contribution to the genetics of febrile seizures: waking and sleep EEG in siblings. Waking and sleep EEGs were recorded in 67 siblings of 52 patients with febrile seizures (FS). Epileptic activity was noted in at least 1 sibling for 28 of the 52 patients (53.8%). Epileptic discharges were noted in 33 (49.2%) of the 67 siblings. Thirty-two siblings had 3-4 Hz spike wave complexes, and 1 sibling had independent centrotemporal spike foci (rolandic foci). Epileptic activity was noted exclusively in the waking state in only 3%, in waking and sleep in 31.3%, and only in sleep in 14.9%. The greatest number of epileptic discharges occurred in waking during hyperventatilation (32.8%) and during stage C sleep (38.8%). In 5 photosensitive siblings, additional epileptic discharges were noted in sleep in 1 and in waking and sleep in 4. At least 1 sibling in 5 (55.6%) of 9 patients with complicated febrile seizures, in 23 (53.5%) of 43 patients with simple FS, and in 4 of 9 patients (44.4%) with later onset epileptic seizures had seizure discharges. At least 1 sibling in 24 of 43 patients (55.8%) with exclusively FS in 13 of 30 (43.3%) male patients and in 15 of 22 (68.2%) female patients had seizure discharges. Siblings aged 6-10 years had (66.7%) the highest rates of activation. Epileptic discharges were noted in 83.3% of siblings with seizures, but in only 45.9% of siblings without seizures. Seizure activity was recorded in 68.2% of siblings who had occipital 3-4-Hz theta-delta-activity but in only 13.0% of siblings without this pattern. 
Pulmonary vascular reactivity and permeability to alveolar hypoxia in the dog. Hemodynamics and vascular permeability were studied during acute alveolar hypoxia in isolated canine lung lobes perfused at constant flow with autogenous blood. Hypoxia was induced in the presence (COI + Hypox, n = 6) or absence (Hypox, n = 6) of cyclooxygenase inhibition (COI) with indomethacin or meclofenamate. Hypoxic ventilation reduced blood PO2 from 143 to 25-29 Torr without a change in PCO2. During hypoxia a capillary filtration coefficient (Kf) was obtained gravimetrically as an index of vascular permeability to water. In COI + Hypox, pulmonary arterial pressure (Pa) increased from 11.5 +/- 0.7, post-COI normoxia, to a peak of 22.1 +/- 2.3 during hypoxia (P less than 0.01) without a change in capillary pressure (Pc). In contrast, hypoxia changed neither Pa nor Pc in Hypox relative to an untreated normoxic control group (Normox, n = 6, P greater than 0.05). Kfs (means +/- SE in ml.min-1.Torr-1.100 g-1) for Normox (0.070 +/- 0.014), Hypox (0.082 +/- 0.024), and COI + Hypox (0.057 +/- 0.017) did not differ from one another (P greater than 0.05). Although COI markedly enhanced the pressor response to acute alveolar hypoxia, hypoxia increased neither Pc nor vascular permeability regardless of COI. 
Long-term prognosis after early intervention with metoprolol in suspected acute myocardial infarction: experiences from the MIAMI Trial. The MIAMI Trial Research Group. A total of 5778 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomized to early intravenous metoprolol followed by oral treatment for 15 d, or to placebo. Thereafter, the two groups were treated similarly. During a 1-year follow-up period the mortality in patients who were randomized to early metoprolol was 10.6% compared to 10.7% for placebo (P greater than 0.2). Among patients with a higher risk of death, the tendency towards a reduced mortality in the metoprolol group that was observed after 15 d remained similar after 1 year. It is concluded that early intervention with metoprolol in suspected acute myocardial infarction did not improve the long-term prognosis compared to placebo treatment. 
Pediatric Advanced Life Support: Part II. Fluid therapy, medications and dysrhythmias. The first part of this two-part article discussed the equipment needed for pediatric resuscitations and the techniques used for cardiopulmonary assessment, airway securance, circulatory maintenance and intravascular access. In this second part, additional life support measures are reviewed, including fluid therapy, resuscitation medications and the management of cardiac rhythm disturbances. 
Hepatitis B virus infection in patients with idiopathic liver disease. We studied 67 HBsAg-negative Israeli patients (36 negative for all HBV serological markers as group 1 and 31 positive for antibodies to HBs and HBc as group 2) with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis of unknown origin using a rapid, sensitive and specific assay for the detection of low levels of hepatitis B virus in serum. This technique uses a high-affinity monoclonal antibody to HBs against an a domain epitope of HBsAg to capture the virion, followed by hepatitis B virus DNA amplification with the polymerase chain reaction. In addition, 55 subjects without liver disease served as controls: Group 3 (n = 32) was negative for all hepatitis B virus markers; group 4 (n = 23) was positive for antibodies to HBs and HBc. We found 11 individuals in group 1 (31%) and 10 in group 2 (29%) harboring low levels of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum. In contrast, no one in group 3 or group 4 was positive by this technique (p less than 0.0001). Using polymerase chain reaction primers spanning other regions of the hepatitis B virus genome and a method of restriction-fragment analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified sequences, we detected significant DNA sequence heterogeneity, suggesting infection with distinct hepatitis B virus strains. DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded liver biopsy specimens of 42 patients from groups 1 and 2 was shown to contain hepatitis B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction in 11 of 12 patients with circulating virion DNA. More important, 18 additional patients whose sera were negative by HBs-antibody capture/polymerase chain reaction amplification had hepatitis B virus DNA sequences in their livers. 
Effects of DuP 753 on renal function of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. This study examined the effects of a new, orally-active, nonpeptide angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist, 2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biph eny l-4- yl)methyl] imidazole, DuP 753, on renal function of anesthetized, volume-expanded Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and in a group of euvolemic Munich-Wistar (MW) rats. Plasma renin activities were similar and averaged 4.4 +/- 0.7 and 4.3 +/- 1.4 ng AI/mL.h, respectively, in the SHR and WKY rats. In WKY rats (n = 15), DuP 753 (2 or 10 mg/kg, intravenously) had no effect on urine flow, sodium excretion, renal blood flow (RBF), or glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Fractional excretion of lithium (FELi) rose from 32 +/- 5 to 40 +/- 4% of the filtered load and arterial pressure decreased slightly from 129 +/- 2 to 122 +/- 2 mm Hg. In SHR (n = 9), urine flow fell 24%, and FELi and RBF increased by 27% and 30%, respectively, after 2 mg/kg DuP 753, but sodium excretion, GFR, and arterial pressure were not significantly altered. A higher dose of DuP 753 (10 mg/kg; n = 8) reduced arterial pressure, urine flow, and sodium excretion in the SHR. RBF increased 34%, while GFR and FELi were not significantly altered. Similar effects were seen in SHR (n = 11), given an equivalent antihypertensive dose of captopril (20 mg/kg). In euvolemic MW rats in which plasma renin activity was elevated to 18.8 +/- 3.3 ng AI/mL.h, DuP 753 (2 mg/kg, n = 7) increased RBF, urine flow, and sodium excretion, while mean arterial pressure and GFR were unaltered. 
Rhabdomyolysis following total hip arthroplasty. We report six cases of contralateral limb involvement during total hip arthroplasty including swelling of the gluteal muscle compartments, rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and sciatic nerve palsy. The risk factors for such complications include obesity, prolonged operative time, and positioning in the lateral decubitus position. The laboratory and clinical findings are consistent with a gluteal muscle crush-injury with consequent compartment syndrome. The patients should be treated conservatively as symptoms can be expected to resolve. 
Right atrial extension of an embryonal carcinoma of the testis. A case of embryonal carcinoma of the testis extending into the inferior vena cava and the right atrium is presented. Tumor extension was demonstrated preoperatively by computed axial tomography. Successful resection of the intravascular and right atrial extension was achieved using extracorporeal circulation. It is concluded that intravascular and right atrial extension is not a contraindication to radical surgery. This type of metastasis raises the same therapeutic and prognostic problems as those raised by tumor masses in the lungs or lymph nodes found after chemotherapy for malignant nonseminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis. 
Muscle perfusion with technetium-MIBI in lower extremity peripheral arterial diseases. There have been several methods utilized in the diagnosis or assessment of medical or surgical treatments of peripheral arterial diseases. In this study, the diagnostic value of a new tracer: 99mTc-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) has been demonstrated in patients with leg claudication. We successively performed muscle perfusion scans in 6 normals and 18 patients with claudication pain during rest and after exercise on the same day. Muscle perfusion abnormalities in all patients were consistent with the defects in the arteries of the affected limbs. The results show that this is a simple and accurate diagnostic procedure and superior to those that have been previously used. 
Severity of coronary artery disease in young patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Cardiovascular events remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with juvenile-onset, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. To examine the extent and severity of the atherosclerotic lesions underlying this excess morbidity and mortality, clinical and angiographic findings were examined in 32 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and in 31 nondiabetic patients, matched for age and symptoms, undergoing elective cardiac catheterization for evaluation of coronary artery disease. With respect to the individuals without diabetes, patients with insulin-dependent diabetes were significantly more likely to have severe narrowings, to have them in all three major coronary arteries, and to have them in distal segments. Severe narrowing of multiple vessels was significantly more common in men than in women and in individuals with hypercholesterolemia. We conclude that the high risk of cardiovascular events observed in young patients with insulin-dependent diabetes is secondary to advanced atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries. Involvement of distal segments of coronary arteries make these patients frequently unsuitable for bypass grafts. 
Appropriateness of intrapartum fetal heart rate management and risk of cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy affects 2 in 1000 infants in the United States, and the intrapartum period is frequently scrutinized as the etiologic source. In a matched group of 49 infants with cerebral palsy at 1 year of age and 49 controls, no difference in the incidence of inappropriate intrapartum fetal heart rate pattern management was detected. This supports the conclusions of others that the intrapartum period is an infrequent source of cerebral palsy. 
Assessment of aortoiliac obstructive disease by Doppler spectrum analysis of blood flow velocities in the common femoral artery at rest and during reactive hyperemia. Aortoiliac obstructive disease was assessed by Doppler spectrum analysis of blood flow velocities in the common femoral artery measured both at rest and during reactive hyperemia. The intraarterial femoral artery pressure measured at rest and during reactive hyperemia served as the "gold standard" for the definition of a hemodynamically significant aortoiliac stenosis. Our results, obtained from 93 patients (136 limbs), showed that differences between Doppler spectra obtained from limbs with a hemodynamically significant aortoiliac stenosis and those from limbs without were more pronounced during reactive hyperemia than at rest. The best assessment of aortoiliac obstructive disease could be obtained with a combination of parameters derived from Doppler spectra measured at rest and during reactive hyperemia. With these parameters, obtained by multivariate analysis, 85% of the limbs were diagnosed correctly compared with the gold standard. If angiographic data were added to the gold standard, even 91% of the limbs were diagnosed correctly. We conclude that analysis of Doppler spectra-obtained noninvasively from the common femoral artery at rest and during reactive hyperemia provides an accurate hemodynamic assessment of the aortoiliac segment. 
Generation of intracellular signals by low density lipoprotein is independent of the classical LDL receptor. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and apolipoprotein B-100 (1 to 15 micrograms/mL) had no significant influence on the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) formation in vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (15 micrograms/mL) induced an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ from 85 to approximately 210 nmol/L in vascular smooth muscle cells from rat aorta in the absence or in the presence of 15 micrograms/mL monoclonal antibodies against the classical low density lipoprotein receptor or in the presence of apolipoprotein B-100. Moreover, in both human cultured fibroblasts from normocholesterolemic individuals and from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia homozygote class 1, LDL induced a dose-dependent rise of free intracellular calcium and a biphasic change of intracellular pH. Since homozygote class 1 fibroblasts are classical LDL receptor negative, and as antibodies against this receptor, as well as apolipoprotein B-100, did not attenuate the LDL-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium, we conclude that LDL might modify vascular activity via the observed intracellular changes without involving the classical low density lipoprotein receptor. 
Patients with duodenitis have gastric secretory and motor functions like those of duodenal ulcer patients: results of a short-term treatment with ranitidine. Gastric acid secretion, gastric emptying of solids, and the effects of short-term treatment with 300 mg ranitidine at bedtime were evaluated in symptomatic patients with endoscopically and histologically proven duodenitis. The patients investigated had basal and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid hypersecretion, but normal gastric emptying times. Ranitidine brought about a significant improvement of endoscopic and histological features compared with the pretreatment findings. Endoscopic but not histological improvement was significantly better than with placebo. Furthermore, ranitidine brought about a significant reduction of weekly antacid consumption compared with placebo. Both ranitidine and placebo induced significant symptomatic improvement over basal conditions, but the difference between the two treatments did not reach statistical significance. Gastric secretory and motor functions, as well as the response to therapy, were similar in duodenitis patients with and without previous history of duodenal ulcer; the only exception was in antacid consumption, which was higher in the placebo group in those with past evidence of ulcer disease. Our results suggest that duodenitis patients have secretory and motor functions similar to those of duodenal ulcer patients. Therefore, further trials on large populations of duodenitis patients with antisecretory drugs are justified. 
Pharmacodynamic parameters and toxicity of netilmicin (6 milligrams/kilogram/day) given once daily or in three divided doses to cancer patients with urinary tract infection. The pharmacologic parameters and toxicity of netilmicin (6 mg/kg/day) given once daily (qd) or thrice daily (tid) for the treatment of urinary tract infections were studied in a randomized prospective study of 60 cancer patients. The overall efficacy was 96%. Nephrotoxicity, assessed by the measure of urinary excretion of phospholipids, was lower for the patients receiving the qd regimen than for those receiving the tid regimen. Elevation of serum creatinine (20% over baseline) occurred in one patient receiving the qd regimen and in three receiving the tid regimen. Cochleotoxicity, assessed by pure-tone audiometry (250 to 18,000 Hz) occurred in one patient receiving the qd regimen and none receiving the tid regimen. Concentrations in sera were measured on days 1 and 5. No significant accumulation was observed in either group. Median serum bactericidal titers, expressed as reciprocal values (percentage of the sera with a titer greater than or equal to 8), were measured against 25 test organisms in samples collected 6 h after the administration of netilmicin and were, for the qd group, 16 (82%) against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and less than 2 (8%) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the tid group, 4 (57%) against members of the Enterobacteriaceae and less than 2 (0%) against P. aeruginosa. The rate of killing in serum was rapid (2 to 3 log in 2 h against P. aeruginosa; 3 to 5 log in 2 h against members of the Enterobacteriaceae) and correlated with the sampling time and hence the concentration in serum of netilmicin. The duration of the postantibiotic effect in serum depended also on the strain and the sampling time of the serum. 
Transrectal US in the diagnosis of localized colitis cystica profunda. Colitis cystica profunda (CCP) mimicks rectal carcinoma, which makes distinguishing this benign lesion from the more common rectal neoplasm clinically and pathologically difficult. When transrectal ultrasound (US) was used in this case, three features of CCP were seen. There were multiple lesions, which did not penetrate beyond the submucosa. A large cystic component was seen, with a layer of uniform thickness in two of the three lesions. Non-solid contents and a lack of infiltration can be visualized at transrectal US, which helps diagnose CCP. 
Intracerebral grafting impedes hippocampal cell loss during withdrawal after long-term alcohol consumption in rats. We previously found that, in the hippocampal formation as well as other central nervous system regions, withdrawal from alcohol following long periods of ingestion did not impede the ethanol-induced degenerative changes, including cell loss: on the contrary, neuronal degeneration was found to be increased in withdrawn rats. By grafting withdrawn rats either with immature hippocampal blocks or with suspensions of cultured astrocytes, we hoped to arrest the process of cell loss or even reverse it, because it is known that grafted material might display trophic and eventually protective effects in conditions of brain damage. The dentate granule and hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells were counted both in the grafted hemisphere and in the contralateral one. Grafts of astrocyte suspensions did not interfere with the ongoing process of cell death in withdrawn rats. Conversely, grafts of hippocampal tissue impeded the degeneration observed in the granule and pyramidal cells of the grafted hemisphere, although in the contralateral one the cell loss persisted. We therefore conclude that the protective effect displayed by solid grafts might be a local process dependent on the release of diffusible trophic agents. We cannot explain the absence of any effect displayed by astroglial grafts, inasmuch as in different experimental situations such an effect was described. 
The treatment of metastatic breast cancer. While metastatic breast cancer is not curable, it is treatable. Its treatment is associated with a relatively high rate of success, and patients are able to maintain a good quality of life for periods ranging from a few months to several years. This knowledge should encourage both the patient and the oncologist to maintain treatment as long as potentially effective therapeutic methods are available. Progress is ongoing both in the development of new forms of treatment and in new ways of using and combining already existing therapeutic modalities. There is still no established "best" or "only" first treatment of metastatic breast cancer. When secondary and later treatment is to be undertaken, the task of selecting the most appropriate treatment becomes even more complex. It is only through controlled clinical trials that useful therapeutic guidelines will develop. Treatment is a joint endeavor involving both the physician and the patient. Communication must remain open. In the final stages of the illness, treatment should be directed toward the relief of distressing symptoms and anxiety. 
The evaluation of patients with human immunodeficiency virus-related disorders and brain mass lesions. In patients at risk for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who present with a mass lesion, a dilemma arises as to whether to treat empirically for toxoplasmosis or perform a brain biopsy. We present data that further define the indications for performing brain biopsy vs empiric treatment. We reviewed charts on 59 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome--related disorders and cerebral mass lesions. Thirty-two patients met diagnostic criteria for toxoplasmosis. Bayesian analysis demonstrated that the prior probability of toxoplasmosis was increased by the presence of contrast enhancement on computed tomographic scans (0.68) and toxoplasmosis titers greater than 1:64 (0.81). Features associated with decreasing probabilities of toxoplasmosis included the absence of contrast enhancement on computed tomographic scans (0.29) and toxoplasmosis titers less than or equal to 1:64 (0.14). Ten percent of patients had complications of brain biopsy. Treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine produced complications in 29% and serious complications in 8% of treated patients. These data favor empiric therapy for patients with typical features of toxoplasmosis and brain biopsy for defined subsets of patients with atypical features. 
Long-term patency of the aortofemoral Dacron graft. A graft limb related study over a 25-years period. Graft limb patency was studied retrospectively in a consecutive series of 912 patients (1605 limbs), who received an aorto(bi)femoral Dacron graft for occlusive disease over a 25 years period (1963-1987). The mean follow-up for the series was 5.35 years (range 1 month to 23 years) and 18.5% of the patients were followed for at least 10 years. Primary patency decreased progressively to 83% at 10 years and 77% at 15 years. It was significantly improved to 90% (at 10 years) and 84% (at 15 years) by means of operative thrombectomy (secondary patency). Factors influencing patency (univariate analysis) were (1) concomitant femoropopliteal occlusive disease, (2) the site of the femoral anastomosis and (3) the date of the operation. Multivariate analysis in relation to the femoral anastomosis stressed the importance of profunda femoris artery disease and the date of operation. It is concluded that the negative effects of concomitant superficial femoral artery disease may be completely relieved by an adequate profundaplasty. Furthermore the substantial progress, we documented over the years of the study, supports our view that aortofemoral reconstruction may also be offered as the solution of choice to patients with milder forms of claudication. 
A history of boron neutron capture therapy of brain tumours. Postulation of a brain radiation dose tolerance limit. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a form of radiation therapy mediated by the short-range (less than 10 microns) energetic alpha (4He) and lithium-7 (7Li) ionizing particles that result from the prompt disintegration by slow neutrons of the stable (nonradioactive) nucleus boron-10 (10B). Recent advances in radiobiological and toxicological evaluation of tumour-affinitive boron-containing drugs and in optimization of the energies of neutrons in the incident beam have spurred interest in BNCT. This article presents a history of BNCT that emphasizes studies in the USA. A new dosimetric analysis of the 1959-1961 clinical trials of BNCT at Brookhaven National Laboratory is also presented. This analysis yields an acute radiation dose tolerance limit estimate of approximately 10 Gy-Eq to the capillary endothelium of human basal ganglia from BNCT. (Gy-Eq: Gray-equivalent, or relative biological effectiveness of a radiation component multiplied by the physical dose of the component (Gy), summed over the component kinds of radiation.). 
Primary squamous cell carcinoma of a gastric remnant. A 77-yr-old male developed primary gastric squamous cell carcinoma 33 yr after gastric resection for peptic ulcer disease. At the time of diagnosis, he was being endoscopically followed for large irregular stomal polyps. Infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma with focal keratinization and stomal polypoid hypertrophic gastritis was found. Previous reports describe adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma in gastric remnants. There are various theories as to how such a tumor may arise in this setting. 
Intra-articular fractures of the distal part of the radius treated with the small AO external fixator. Thirty adults who had a severely comminuted intra-articular closed fracture of the distal part of the radius were treated by closed reduction and AO external fixation consisting of a converging-pin configuration with a double row of connecting bars. The patients were followed for an average of 2.6 years (range, two to four years). Twenty-seven patients had an excellent result; two, a good result; and one, a poor result, on the basis of pain, motion, strength, and radiographic appearance. Complications were rare, and there was no loss of fixation of the pins. The average grip strength was 92 per cent of normal. Motion of the wrist and rotation of the forearm averaged more than 90 per cent of that of the normal side. Carpal height was used as an indicator of distraction force produced by the fixator. There was an average increase in carpal height of four millimeters initially and 3.7 millimeters immediately before removal of the fixator, indicating near-constant distraction throughout the treatment. Radial length was well maintained, with shortening averaging less than one millimeter. The converging pins of the AO fixator prevent loosening, thereby diminishing the risks of infection, loss of reduction of the fracture, and breakage of the pins. This geometry of the pins allows the use of smaller-diameter (2.5-millimeter) pins and provides rigid fixation, even in osteoporotic bone. 
Spontaneous pneumomediastinum. A report of 25 cases. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is a relatively uncommon, infrequently reported entity. To determine the clinical presentation and sequelae of SPM, data were obtained from 25 patients: 14 from Hadassah University Hospital, and 11 from other medical institutions. The mean age was 18.8 +/- 5.2 years (+/- SD), with a range of 8 to 31 years. The most common presenting complaint was retrosternal pain in 22 patients (88 percent), dyspnea in 15 (60 percent), dysphagia in 10 (40 percent), and weakness in 10 (40 percent). Predisposing factors for the development of SPM could be identified in 18 patients (72 percent). Information on the sequelae of SPM during a mean period of 87.4 +/- 38.0 months following the initial SPM episode was obtained from 23 patients. Recurrent SPM occurred in 1 patient at 18 months, and another patient experienced 4 episodes of recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. No other long-term sequelae were reported. We conclude that SPM is a benign self-limited disease with diverse clinical manifestations. Although uncommon, recurrences of SPM may be observed. 
Traumatic pericallosal aneurysm in a patient with no major trauma. Case report. The case of a young woman who developed a traumatic distal anterior cerebral artery ("pericallosal") aneurysm from a roller-coaster ride is described. She presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) restricted to the interhemispheric fissure. The initial angiogram was normal but repeat angiography at 8 days revealed the aneurysm. After craniotomy and clipping the patient made a satisfactory recovery. This is the only reported case of a traumatic aneurysm arising under circumstances not usually considered as trauma. It raises questions about the pathophysiology of the formation of such aneurysms and suggests that traumatic pericallosal aneurysms should be considered in SAH of unknown etiology. This case provides further evidence that repeat angiography occasionally helps reveal an aneurysm when the initial study fails to do so. 
Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in systemic sclerosis and primary pulmonary hypertension. Reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance by a high inspired oxygen concentration is a common, but not universal phenomenon in patients with pulmonary vascular disease of varying etiology that may determine their response to long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy. We therefore determined changes in PVR during oxygen therapy in two patient populations not previously studied: systemic sclerosis (n = 8, mean age +/- SEM, 44.5 +/- 5.4 years) and primary pulmonary hypertension (n = 7, mean age +/- SEM 38 +/- 7.8 years). All patients were hypoxemic (arterial oxygen tension, on air 9.5 +/- 1.2 kPa for SSc and 8.3 +/- 0.6 kPa for PPH, p greater than 0.05). Right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, systemic arterial pressure, PaO2 and cardiac output by thermodilution were measured at three, 20-min intervals while inspiring air and again after inspiring 60 percent oxygen for 30 min. The PVR fell significantly with oxygen in patients with SSc from 797.6 +/- 179.2 to 610 +/- 151.6 dynes/s/cm-5 (p less than 0.01), and this fall correlated with baseline PAP and PaO2 prior to oxygen therapy (r = 0.86, p less than 0.025; r = 0.77, p less than 0.05, respectively). In patients with PPH, there was no significant fall in PVR with oxygen (from 969 +/- 80.2 to 851.9 +/- 91.2 dynes/s/cm-5, p greater than 0.05) and no predictor of a vasodilator response in individual patients. In SSc, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction contributes more consistently to elevated PVR than in patients with PPH. 
Quantification of cervical change: relationship to preterm delivery in the multifetal gestation. Prematurity is the major contributor to the very high perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with multifetal gestations. Antepartum cervical evaluation has been suggested as a way to better define the risk of preterm delivery in multifetal gestations. Weekly digital cervical examinations were performed in 86 twin and 7 triplet gestations that were being monitored in a special antepartum clinic. A cervical score was calculated from each examination by subtracting cervical dilatation in centimeters from cervical length in centimeters. Cervical scores decline gradually with advancing gestation and are influenced by parity and subsequent preterm delivery. Intervals until delivery decrease significantly with lower cervical scores. A cervical score less than or equal to 0 on or before 34 weeks' gestation was strongly predictive of preterm delivery (75%). Only 2 of 78 (2.6%) with a score greater than 0 were delivered within 1 week of the examination. Cervical scoring is a simple, quantifiable, reproducible, and safe method of evaluating preterm delivery risk. An understanding of the prognostic significance of specific cervical scores may be of value in determining the need for obstetric intervention. 
Nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone as adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of medulloblastoma. A Pediatric Oncology Group study. In a randomized postoperative trial, adjuvant post-irradiation chemotherapy, consisting of nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP), was tested versus radiation therapy alone for newly diagnosed medulloblastoma in patients between 1 and 21 years of age. Patients treated with irradiation plus MOPP had a statistically significant increase in overall survival rate at 5 years posttreatment compared to patients treated with radiation therapy alone (74% vs. 56%; p = 0.06, adjusted for race and gender). Although the overall study failed to show a statistically significant advantage for irradiation plus MOPP in event-free survival (p = 0.18), statistical significance was attained in children 5 years of age or older (p = 0.05). More severe hematological toxicities occurred in the group with irradiation plus MOPP; however, this hematotoxicity appeared to be tolerable and acceptable. These results suggest that patients may benefit from combined irradiation and chemotherapy following surgery for medulloblastoma. 
Motor variables correlated with the hand-to-mouth maneuver in stroke patients. This study investigated the relationship between each of three independent variables and the completion of the hand-to-mouth maneuver in 23 hemiparetic stroke patients. The independent variables were elbow-extensor muscle tone (graded using the Modified Ashworth Scale); active elbow-flexion range-of-motion deficit measured without the influence of gravity; and elbow-flexion strength measured without the influence of gravity with a hand-held dynamometer. The hand-to-mouth maneuver was graded according to the degree of completion using a three-level ordinal scale. Spearman (rs) correlations demonstrated a significant relationship between the extent of completion of the hand-to-mouth maneuver and both the active elbow-flexion-range deficit (rs = -.853) and the elbow-flexor muscle force (rs = .829). The correlation of the maneuver with elbow-extensor muscle tone (rs = -.063) was not significant, but the relationship may have been influenced by the fact that only a minority of subjects had elevated tone, and that elevation was minimal. The result suggest that both active-movement deficits and muscle strength may be important to upper extremity function. 
Imaging of metastatic colorectal cancer with tumour-activated killer lymphocytes. Adoptive immunotherapy may be useful for treating or visualising metastatic cancer. Lymphocytes were taken from 6 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and cultured with cells from the patients primary tumour to produce tumour-activated killer (TAK) lymphocytes. We re-injected each patient with IIIIn-labelled TAK cells in order to visualise metastases. Images were taken with a gamma-camera for up to 48 h after injection. Metastases were revealed as early as 4 h in the lung and as late as 48 h in the abdomen. Liver images produced "cold" spots corresponding to metastatic lesions. Lymph nodes were not visualised. Re-injection of TAK cells raised against autologous colorectal tumours reveals the sites of metastases. 
The rectus abdominis free flap in head and neck reconstruction. The rectus abdominis musculocutaneous free flap, based on the deep inferior epigastric artery and vein, has been used widely in reconstruction of the breast and extremities. The number of reports on its applications in the head and neck is limited. The rectus abdominis free flap is one of the most versatile soft-tissue flaps. The deep inferior epigastric artery and vein are long, large-diameter vessels that are ideal for microvascular anastomoses. The area of skin that can be transferred is probably the largest of all flaps presently in use. The versatility of this donor site is due to the ability to transfer large areas of skin with varying thicknesses and varying amounts of underlying muscle. We have successfully used this flap in 15 consecutive patients to reconstruct defects of the neck, face, mouth, pharynx, skull base, and scalp. No major complications involving either the recipient or donor sites occurred. The literature on the use of the rectus abdominis flap in head and neck reconstruction is reviewed in detail. The advantages and disadvantages of this soft-tissue free flap are thoroughly discussed in an effort to better define its proper place among the reconstructive options available to the head and neck surgeon. 
Fibroblast cell interactions with human melanoma cells affect tumor cell growth as a function of tumor progression. It is known from a variety of experimental systems that the ability of tumor cells to grow locally and metastasize can be affected by the presence of adjacent normal tissues and cells, particularly mesenchymally derived stromal cells such as fibroblasts. However, the comparative influence of such normal cell-tumor cell interactions on tumor behavior has not been thoroughly investigated from the perspective of different stages of tumor progression. To address this question we assessed the influence of normal dermal fibroblasts on the growth of human melanoma cells obtained from different stages of tumor progression. We found that the in vitro growth of most (4 out of 5) melanoma cell lines derived from early-stage radial growth phase or vertical growth phase metastatically incompetent primary lesions is repressed by coculture with normal dermal fibroblasts, suggesting that negative homeostatic growth controls are still operative on melanoma cells from early stages of disease. On the other hand, 9 out of 11 melanoma cell lines derived from advanced metastatically competent vertical growth phase primary lesions, or from distant metastases, were found to be consistently stimulated to grow in the presence of dermal fibroblasts. Evidence was obtained to show that this discriminatory fibroblastic influence is mediated by soluble inhibitory and stimulatory growth factor(s). Taken together, these results indicate that fibroblast-derived signals can have antithetical growth effects on metastatic versus metastatically incompetent tumor subpopulations. This resultant conversion in responsiveness to host tissue environmental factors may confer upon small numbers of metastatically competent cells a growth advantage, allowing them to escape local growth constraints both in the primary tumor site and at distant ectopic tissue sites. 
Borrelia rhombencephalomyelopathy. Three patients, in whom the diagnosis of Borrelia burgdorferi infection was unknown for several years, developed a biphasic involvement of the central nervous system: an acute brain-stem dysfunction was followed up, in two patients, by a progressive, disabling myelitis and, in one patient, by further relapsing-remitting episodes of severe multifocal rhombencephalitis. The most consistent cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in the analysis of sequential specimens were elevated total IgM levels that normalized after penicillin therapy. The neuropathologic findings in one patient showed microgliosis and meningovascular involvement of the central nervous system, resulting in two ischemic infarcts in the myelencephalon. Few spirochetes were localized in the leptomeninges and around subependymal vessels of the fourth ventricle. The vascular element consisted of an obliterative inflammatory vasculopathy in the medullary parenchyma. This study (1) provides pathologic evidence that a vascular disease induced by B burgdorferi is a pathogenetic mechanism for cerebrovascular diseases, and (2) emphasizes the similarities between neuroborreliosis and neurosyphilis. 
Thallium myocardial scintigraphy in congenitally-corrected transposition of the great arteries. A case of congenitally-corrected transposition of the great arteries is presented with the correlation of thallium scintigraphic results with catheterization data. The essential features of the thallium scintigrams were marked counterclockwise rotation of the heart with perfusion abnormalities of the inferior wall and apex. Since patients with congenitally-corrected transposition of the great arteries may present with the symptom of chest pain, the diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries should be considered in patients with marked counterclockwise rotation of the heart and segmental perfusion abnormalities on thallium scintigraphy. 
Chemical peritonitis associated with intraperitoneal vancomycin. A case of chemical peritonitis associated with intraperitoneal vancomycin is reported. A 23-year-old woman presented with signs and symptoms consistent with a chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis catheter exit-site infection. Intraperitoneal vancomycin (Vancoled) 1 g was given, followed by 25 mg/L into each subsequent exchange. On day 4 the patient developed abdominal pain and cloudy dialysis effluent. The vancomycin was discontinued, and the dialysate cleared by day 8. Fluid cultures were negative, and Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the exit site. Subsequent intravenous vancomycin, and smaller intraperitoneal doses, failed to repeat the event. Fluid and serum white blood cell count, serum immunoglobulins and complement, culture results, and the temporal relationship are strongly suggestive of a vancomycin-induced chemical peritonitis. 
Preparing children for venous blood sampling. A convenience sample of 100 children, aged 6-12 years, attending Kuwait government hospital laboratories for venous blood sampling was studied. A picture book was used to prepare half of the children for the procedure. Preparation was carried out just prior to sampling and took less than 5 min. The story provided a simple description of venous blood sampling, and why it is carried out; it stressed that the pain is noticeable but not unbearable, and that children will experience less pain if they relax their arm and cooperate with the technician. Prepared children reported significantly less pain, and radial pulse rates confirmed that they were less distressed by the procedure. Observers' and parents' evaluations also indicated that prepared children coped better. Various explanations for the benefits observed are discussed, together with requirements for managing the pain, fear and stress experienced by children during medical treatment. 
Metastatic properties of the human prostatic cell line, PPC-1, in athymic nude mice. Limitation in the number of human prostatic cell lines has created a gap in knowledge regarding the in-vivo progression of this common cancer. The recently isolated primary prostatic carcinoma cell line, PPC-1, has been shown to be tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. These cells are now shown to form metastases to secondary sites in 10 of 12 animals in this initial study. Metastases were localized to lung and lymph nodes, and the tumor histology closely resembled that of the undifferentiated, rapidly dividing primary tumors. This is the first report describing the metastatic properties of a primary prostatic cancer cell line. PPC-1 cells are therefore likely to represent a good model system for the study of human prostate cancer progression. 
Accordion right coronary artery: an unusual complication of PTCA guidewire entrapment. The contour of the epicardial coronary vessels may change considerably during coronary angioplasty. We report the extreme and unique "accordion-like" wrinkling of the mid right coronary artery as a result of distal guidewire entrapment during coronary angioplasty. Recognition of this artifact and its treatment may prevent further complications of coronary angioplasty. 
Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator: current concepts and guidelines for clinical use in acute myocardial infarction. Part II. The extraordinarily high prevalence of coronary heart disease, coupled with the alarming incidence of MI in Western society, has encouraged the investigation and development of pharmacologic agents that can be employed widely, quickly, effectively, and safely. Recombinant t-PA has played a vital role in the treatment of MI, restoring coronary arterial patency, limiting infarct size, preserving ventricular function, and improving patient survival. It has been shown to be safe when given to carefully selected patients and, although indications for clinical use have been relatively restricted, they appear to be expanding considerably. Future investigations must continue to focus on patient selection to allow treatment for all patients who would derive benefit and to establish dosing regimens and adjuvant therapies that will maximize coronary reperfusion while concomitantly limiting reocclusion and hemorrhagic complications. 
Acute multifocal inner retinitis. Two patients developed acute changes in vision two to four weeks after a febrile illness. On ophthalmic examination, each patient had bilateral vitreitis without anterior segment inflammation and multiple, bilateral, round, yellow-white inner retinal lesions that were located in the posterior pole and midperiphery. Laboratory tests did not contribute to a diagnosis. Symptomatic visual loss was caused by neuroretinitis and serous retinal detachment in one patient and by an occluded branch retinal artery in the other. The multifocal retinal lesions resolved gradually without treatment over several months with minimal or no residual retinal changes. Acute multifocal inner retinal lesions may be associated with a preceding nonspecific viral illness and may cause a sudden change in vision if associated with neuroretinitis, serous retinal detachment, or retinal vessel occlusion. We have termed this constellation of ophthalmic findings acute multifocal inner retinitis. 
Lumbar intervertebral foramens. An in vitro study of their shape in relation to intervertebral disc pathology. The lumbar intervertebral foramens of 20 isolated cadaveric spines were investigated by the use of a molding technique to assess their dimensions accurately and how intervertebral disc pathology altered their configuration. Oval foramens predominated over auricularly shaped foramens when the disc was normal, but when the disc was abnormal, the converse was true. Foraminal size varied from 40 to 160 mm2 but showed great variation even at individual levels; these were not accurately reflected by simple radiologic measurements. 
Residential arrangements for adults with cerebral palsy--California, 1988. In the United States, an estimated 274,000 persons have cerebral palsy (CP), a neurologic condition defined as a group of nonprogressive disorders in which an abnormality of the central nervous system can result in motor dysfunction (e.g., paresis, involuntary movement, and incoordination). CP is the third leading cause of the need for assistance with basic life activities and the fifth leading cause of activity limitation. An adult with CP may require adaptive housing to improve accessibility (e.g., to entrances and toilet facilities), attendant care to assist with activities of daily living, and/or nursing care to meet specific health-care needs. These needs can be met through a variety of residential accommodations. However, because the residential environment has a considerable impact on well-being and quality of life, the accommodations should be in the least restrictive environment and, when possible, community-based. This report summarizes an assessment of characteristics of adults with CP to determine which factors are associated with placement in a more restrictive environment. 
Preoperative clinical evaluation as a predictor of cardiac complications after infrarenal aortic reconstruction. This paper analyses cardiac risk factors in 93 consecutive patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction over a 2 year period. During the perioperative or postoperative period, 26 patients sustained a total of 42 cardiac complications. Eight patients had myocardial infarction, 14 left ventricular failure and 15 arrhythmias. There were five cardiac-related deaths. Angina was the only statistically significant risk factor in predicting postoperative cardiac problems. A multivariate analysis identified a high-risk group of patients in whom cardiac complications after operation were common. 
Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy for metabolic characterization of plaques in multiple sclerosis. We are investigating the potential of in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy for noninvasive characterization of the chemical pathology of plaques in magnetic resonance brain images from patients with multiple sclerosis. Spectra localized to chronic, irreversible plaques showed a decrease in the ratio of N-acetyl/creatine resonance intensities relative to normal-appearing white matter. Spectra localized to active plaques showed different metabolite changes as compared with spectra from identical, plaque-free volumes in the contralateral hemispheres. Some active plaques showed either no abnormalities or only an increase in tissue lactate. Spectra from others showed an increased ratio of choline/creatine resonance intensities, with or without a decreased N-acetyl/creatine resonance intensity ratio. In one case, serial observations showed an evolution of changes in spectra from a single plaque from an increased choline/creatine ratio to a decreased N-acetyl/creatine ratio. These observations suggest that proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy may be able to distinguish acute or active from chronic plaques and to characterize the pathologic evolution of active plaques by measurement of local tissue metabolite levels. 
Experience with indeterminate mammograms. Most radiologists recommend follow-up mammography in 3 to 6 months for asymptomatic patients with mammographic lesions that do not appear suspicious enough to warrant immediate biopsy. In this retrospective cohort study, the medical records of 776 patients were audited 24 to 35 months after mammography to estimate the frequency of indeterminate lesions, the probability of malignancy, and the rate of patients' compliance with recommendations. Almost 2% of patients retested after an indeterminate mammogram were found to have breast cancer (95% confidence limits 0.2% and 5.9%). Only 26% of the patients retested during the audit period had the test within the suggested upper limit of 6 months. We conclude that timely follow-up after an indeterminate mammogram is advisable and that for the population we studied, compliance with this recommendation is low. 
The role of sustained achlorhydria in bleeding peptic ulcer. Twenty-five patients with bleeding peptic ulcers were randomized to receive either ranitidine 50 mg 8 hourly i.v. (control group) or a continuous nasogastric antacid infusion at the rate of 0.5 ml/min along with an i.v. injection of cimetidine 100 mg/h (treatment group). Twelve patients were included in the control group and 13 in the treatment group. The mean gastric pH on therapy was significantly higher in the treatment group (7.88 +/- 0.37) than in the control group (5.00 +/- 0.55) (p less than 0.001), and the gastric pH was noted to be greater than 7 on 95% of the occasions in the treatment group and on 8.6% of the occasions in the control group. An overall control of bleeding was achieved in 92.3% of the patients in the treatment group and 50% of the patients in the control group (p less than .05). Thus, the failure of therapy was significantly more common in the control group than in the treatment group (p less than 0.05), and more patients of the control group had to undergo emergency surgery than that in the treatment group. None of the patients in the treatment group, but 16.6% of the patients in the control group, died during the study period in the hospital stay. We conclude that in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer an intensive medical therapy comprising hourly injections of cimetidine (or presumably of other H2 blockers) and continuous nasogastric antacid infusion can achieve sustained achlorhydria, better control of bleeding, and reduce the need for emergency surgery. 
Experience with a third-generation implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. A Medtronic 7216A pacemaker cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted in 16 patients (mean age 56 years) with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) and organic heart disease with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 33%. Endocardial and epicardial defibrillation shock efficacy was evaluated before or at implant using 1 to 3 shock patterns, i.e., monophasic single, sequential or simultaneous shocks with dual and triple electrode configurations. Endocardial leads used a common right ventricular cathode and dual anodes, whereas epicardial leads used 2 or 3 helical coil patches. VT termination was evaluated using pacing or shock therapy, or both, whereas only shocks were used in VF. Programmable bradycardia pacing, individual zones for VT and VF detection and individualized pacing and shock therapy for VT and VF were used. Monophasic shocks had epicardial defibrillation thresholds ranging from 3 to 18 (mean 10) J and were comparable for sequential and simultaneous shocks (p greater than 0.2). VT detection rates ranged from 340 to 470 ms and VF detection rates from 270 to 330 ms. VT or VF induction, or both, was performed noninvasively in 13 patients after implant and was reproducibly terminated by rapid pacing alone (5 patients), low-energy shocks (2 patients), high-energy shocks (3 patients) and combined therapy (3 patients). Intermediate or high-energy shocks terminated all induced VF episodes. During follow-up (2 to 12 months), there have been 2 noncardiac deaths. Electrical therapy was delivered in 7 patients, for VT (3 patients), VT and VF (3 patients) and indeterminate tachyarrhythmia (1 patient). All VT/VF episodes were successfully terminated, with 78 of 96 (81%) spontaneous VT episodes terminated by pacing. Follow-up reprogramming was required in 5 patients. It is concluded that successful application of individualized electrical therapy prescriptions in patients with VT/VF is feasible. Pacing therapies, which are effective for induced VT, can be reliably used for effective long-term spontaneous VT termination in conjunction with shock therapy and can permit reduced patient exposure to shock therapy. Thus, a programmable hybrid pacemaker cardioverter-defibrillator system provides nonthoracotomy implantation, effective VT/VF termination, demand ventricular pacing and noninvasive modes for arrhythmia induction, event monitoring and clinical trouble-shooting. 
Effects of sucralfate, lansoprazole, and cimetidine on the delayed healing by hydrocortisone sodium phosphate of chronic gastric ulcers in the rat. We have previously shown that chronic sucralfate ingestion stimulates gastric epithelial proliferation in rats, which may explain one of the beneficial effects of sucralfate in healing of peptic ulcers. In a separate study, we have found that chronic steroid administration delays the healing of experimental gastric ulcers in rats. This study was designed to test the beneficial effects of sucralfate, cimetidine, and lansoprazole (AG-1749, a new proton pump inhibitor), on the delayed healing by steroids in rat chronic gastric ulcers. Chronic gastric ulcers were produced in male Wistar rats, weighing 180 g, by the application of 100% acetic acid. The rats were randomly divided into five groups; (1) control, (2) vehicle alone, (3) 10 mg/kg lansoprazole, (4) 500 mg/kg sucralfate, and (5) 100 mg/kg cimetidine. Except for controls, all rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of 2.5 mg/kg hydrocortisone sodium phosphate. Tested drugs were administered intragastrically (lansoprazole and sucralfate) or intraperitoneally (cimetidine) twice a day for 2 weeks. Rats were sacrificed 14 days later and ulcer size was measured. Chronic administration of hydrocortisone sodium phosphate resulted in a significant delay of ulcer healing induced by acetic acid. Treatment with either lansoprazole or sucralfate abolished the deleterious effect of steroids, whereas cimetidine had no effect. These results indicate that lansoprazole and sucralfate overcome the delayed healing by steroids of chronic gastric ulcers in the rat. 
Sonography of the gallbladder: significance of striated (layered) thickening of the gallbladder wall. Sonographic identification of thickening of the gallbladder wall that consists of multiple striations (alternate hypoechoic and hyperechoic layers) has been considered strong evidence of the presence of acute cholecystitis. We studied 27 patients in whom sonograms showed striated thickening of the gallbladder wall to determine the diagnostic significance of this finding. Striations were classified as focal or diffuse. Sonograms were correlated with pathologic findings in 16 patients and with clinical diagnoses and laboratory findings in 11. Patients were categorized as having cholecystitis with or without gangrene or edema of the gallbladder wall unrelated to gallbladder disease. Striated thickening of the gallbladder wall was due to cholecystitis in 10 patients, and all 10 had gangrenous changes at surgery or at pathologic examination. Striations were focal in eight of these patients and diffuse in two. Striated thickening of the gallbladder wall was due to edema of the wall unrelated to gallbladder disease in 17 patients. Causes included congestive heart failure (n = 4), renal failure (n = 5), liver disease (hepatic failure [n = 1], hepatitis [n = 6]), ascites (n = 2), hypoalbuminemia (n = 3), pancreatitis (n = 1), blockage of the lymphatic/venous drainage of the gallbladder (n = 2), and prominent Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses (n = 1). More than one abnormality was present in five patients. Striations were focal in 11 of these patients and diffuse in six. The sonographic finding of striated gallbladder wall thickening is no more specific for cholecystitis than the observation of gallbladder wall thickening by itself, and it may occur in a variety of diseases. However, in the clinical setting of acute cholecystitis, the presence of striations suggests gangrenous changes in the gallbladder. The extent of the striations (focal or diffuse) is not useful in predicting the cause of the striated gallbladder wall thickening. 
A prospective, randomized evaluation of intensive-course 5-fluorouracil plus doxorubicin as surgical adjuvant chemotherapy for resected gastric cancer. This study evaluated combined 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and doxorubicin as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who had undergone potentially curative resection of a primary gastric adenocarcinoma. One hundred twenty-five eligible and evaluable patients were stratified according to extent of surgical resection, location of the primary tumor within the stomach, and lymph node status. They were then randomized to either receive three cycles of chemotherapy or be observed. The median time from patient entry was 7 years. Results showed no significant difference in time to recurrence. The 5-year survival rate was 33% for the observation arm and 32% for the adjuvant therapy arm. The data excluded a 16% improvement in the 5-year survival rate for patients receiving chemotherapy with a P value less than 0.05. There were two drug-related fatalities due to sepsis. These results demonstrate no substantive benefit for this chemotherapy regimen as postoperative adjuvant treatment of resected gastric cancer. 
Effects of nitrous oxide on coronary pressure and regional contractile function in experimental myocardial ischemia. To determine whether nitrous oxide (N2O) worsens myocardial ischemia by diminishing coronary pressure, we performed two sets of experiments using an acutely instrumented swine model of regional coronary ischemia. In constant pressure experiments (n = 11), coronary pressure and heart rate were kept constant as N2O (77%-79%) was substituted for N2 in the inspired gas. Nitrous oxide decreased systolic shortening, measured by sonomicrometry, from 68.0% to 63.6% (P less than 0.05) of preischemic control values in the ischemic zone and from 116.2% to 103.2% (P less than 0.05) of control values in the adjacent normal myocardium. There was no disproportionate effect of N2O on ischemic myocardium, and the N2O-induced depression of contractile function was fully reversible. In a series of constant external stenosis experiments (n = 13), the effects of N2O on heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and the coronary stenosis itself were not controlled. In these experiments, substitution of N2O for N2 induced deterioration in both the ischemic zone (systolic shortening decreased from 68.7% to 58.4% of preischemic control values, P less than 0.05) and in the adjacent normal myocardium (systolic shortening decreased from 113% to 102.9% of preischemic control, P less than 0.05). Nitrous-oxide-induced ischemic zone contractile dysfunction was often not reversible. The pressure gradient across the coronary stenosis did not increase and peripheral coronary pressure did not decrease because of N2O. Diffusion hypoxia was also excluded. This study confirms that N2O has a significant but mild depressant effect on the performance of both normal and ischemic myocardium. 
Long-term benzodiazepine users 3 years after participation in a discontinuation program. OBJECTIVE: Clinical status and use of benzodiazepines and other psychotropic drugs at follow-up were assessed in patients who had been chronically dependent on benzodiazepines and had been referred for participation in a discontinuation study. METHOD: Of 123 benzodiazepine-dependent patients screened for entry into a tapered discontinuation program, 48 had completed the program, 38 had not, and 37 had not undergone drug tapering. Follow-up information was obtained through a structured telephone interview and a mail questionnaire that included a global severity scale assessing anxiety and depression and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. The time to follow-up was 2.7-5.0 years, and the mean +/- SD interval between screening and follow-up was 2.9 +/- 0.9 years. RESULTS: Outcome at follow-up significantly favored the patients who had completed the discontinuation program; 73% were not using benzodiazepines, compared to 39% in the unsuccessful taper group and 14% in the no-taper group. Moderate or marked anxiety was still reported by 35% of the patients who were taking benzodiazepines and 25% of those who were not. At follow-up, 22% of the patients were being treated with nonbenzodiazepine psychotropic agents, primarily antidepressants. CONCLUSIONS: The high percentage of patients who were benzodiazepine-free at follow-up and the continued anxiety and depression present in many patients suggest that some patients may have been taking benzodiazepines because of chronic or recurrent anxiety or depression, not physical dependence. 
The specific activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in disseminated intravascular coagulation with acute promyelocytic leukemia. In disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in the absence of severe infection, marked fibrinolysis was noted in comparison with normal levels of antithrombin III, which is a major inhibitor of the coagulation system. Increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen levels in plasma from patients with septicemia decreased the ratio of the plasma clot lysis rate induced by an anti-alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor monoclonal antibody to the tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentration. This decrease was not as prominent in plasma from patients with DIC, especially those with APL. To explore the character of PAI-1 in these plasmas, we measured the specific activity of PAI-1 by determining the ratio of active PAI-1 antigen to t-PA-unbound PAI-1 antigen. To calculate the amount of active PAI-1 antigen, the amount of t-PA/PAI-1 complex before and after the addition of a fixed amount of t-PA to the sample was measured by a sandwich solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-PAI-1 and anti-t-PA monoclonal antibodies. The assay to measure total PAI-1 antigen used three monoclonal anti-PAI-1 antibodies and had similar sensitivities to free active, latent, vitronectin-bound and t-PA-bound PAI-1. The specific activity of PAI-1 decreased in patients with DIC (43.7% +/- 30.6%) and in DIC cases with APL (10.3% +/- 6.0%) in comparison to patients with septicemia (83.7% +/- 20.2%) or normal controls (85.8% +/- 27.3%). In DIC associated with APL, degraded forms of PAI-1 were detected in plasma by immunoblotting. These results suggest that a decrease in the specific activity of PAI-1 and an increase in secondary fibrinolysis result in a hyperfibrinolytic state in DIC patients with APL. 
Ki-1+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma of T-cell origin in an HIV-infected patient. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are part of the spectrum of disease associated with HIV infection. However, there are only occasional reports of NHL of T-cell origin in HIV-infected patients. A previously asymptomatic HIV-infected man, who was seronegative for human T-lymphotropic virus type I antibodies, developed a high-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma of anaplastic large-cell type which was Ki-1 + (CD30 +), HLA-DR+, epithelial membrane antigen +, CD25 +, CD71 +, CD2 + and CD5 +. Pan-B markers CD19 and CD22 and histiocytic marker CD68 were negative. At diagnosis the patient had 0.3 x 10(9)/l T-helper lymphocytes. The response to chemotherapy was dramatic and the patient is alive and disease-free 18 months after treatment. A review of previously described peripheral T-cell lymphomas in HIV-positive individuals is performed, and we conclude that the spectrum of neoplasms in such cases is probably broader than originally thought. 
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to superior mesenteric artery to duodenum fistula: rare complication of metastatic lung carcinoma. Although metastases from primary carcinoma of the lung to the small intestine appear to be more common than previously suspected, they rarely produce symptoms. Such metastases may present as bowel perforations. Overt gastrointestinal bleeding has been described only as a prelude to perforation. We describe the case of a 55-yr-old man with carcinoma of the lung that had metastasized to the brain and to the third part of the duodenum. The duodenal metastasis presented with massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The metastasis was seen to be actively bleeding at endoscopy, and a direct fistula from a branch of the superior mesenteric artery to the third part of the duodenum was shown angiographically. Arterial invasion and destruction by tumor was confirmed at postmortem examination. This complication of metastatic carcinoma of the lung has not been previously described in the English literature. 
Effects of exercise on heart rate, QT, QTc and QT/QS2 in the Romano-Ward inherited long QT syndrome. Patients with the Romano-Ward inherited long QT syndrome have an incompletely defined cardiac sympathetic system abnormality, and exhibit ventricular arrhythmias during exercise, fear and anxiety. Treadmill and bicycle exercise were used to modulate cardiac autonomic activity in 27 Romano-Ward subjects and 27 normal controls. The heart rate, and the QT, QTc and QT/QS2 (ratio of electrical to mechanical systole) intervals were compared. Subjects with long QT were compared with normals. Those with a long QT interval had the following results: similar resting heart rates; lower rates during moderate (151.6 vs 169.6 beats/min, p = 0.04) and maximal (155.9 vs 182.1 beats/min, p = less than 0.001) exercise; an abnormal QT cycle-length relationship, with failure of the QT to shorten normally with increasing heart rate; an increase in QTc versus a decrease in normals; supine rest QT/QS2 ratio of 1.12 vs 0.93, p = 0.001; and an exercise QT/QS2 that increased by 30%, from 1.12 at rest to 1.45, versus 15%, in normals, from 0.93 to 1.07, p = 0.001. The lower heart rates and excessively prolonged QT/QS2 ratios during exercise further support an abnormality of, or abnormal cardiac response to, sympathetic activity. A QT/QS2 greater than 1.0 at rest, an exercise QT/QS2 ratio greater than 1.17, and an increase in QTc during moderate exercise may be helpful diagnostic findings in patients with borderline long QTc intervals at rest. 
Diuretic agents and beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension. Benzothiadiazine diuretic agents and beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking drugs are two of the main groups of drugs used to treat mild hypertension. Recently, questions have been raised about their relative efficacy in preventing morbidity and mortality from vascular disease in addition to their effect on lowering blood pressure. Attention has been focused on the unfavorable metabolic effects of diuretic drugs and the proven value of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Four randomized controlled trials comparing drugs in these two classes have been published: the Medical Research Council trial, the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension trial, and the Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertension study. These trials, especially that of the Medical Research Council, have raised some questions about the relative efficacy of these two classes of drugs in preventing stroke in smokers and nonsmokers. Overall, there is little evidence of a reduction in morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction. The predicted advantage of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade over diuretic therapy has not been realized although there are sufficient hints of a differential benefit to encourage the performance of further trials. 
Atrial natriuretic factor in the acute nephritic and nephrotic syndromes. Because the role of systemic hormones in the pathophysiology of edema in acute renal disease remains incompletely understood, we compared the levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and plasma renin activity (PRA) in patients with acute glomerulonephritis (AGN), nephrotic syndrome (NS), and normal individuals during salt deprivation and salt loading. Sixteen patients with AGN (10 males) and nine patients with NS and hypoalbuminemia (7 males) were studied on admission, and after recovery (12 AGN patients) or remission (4 NS patients). Eighteen normal controls were each studied after five days on a low (20 mEq Na/day), regular (120 mEq Na/day) and high (300 mEq Na/day) dietary salt intake. Patients with AGN and NS had comparable edema (AGN 2.8 +/- 0.53 kg; NS 3.36 +/- 0.47 kg; SE) and urinary Na excretion (mean +/- SEM: AGN 0.97 +/- 0.11 mEq/hr; NS 1.06 +/- 0.16 mEq/hr), but AGN patients had five times higher ANF (AGN 27.2 +/- 4.06 fmol/ml; NS 5.51 +/- 1.02 fmol/ml; P less than 0.001) and six times lower PRA ng/liter.sec levels (AGN 0.187 +/- 0.047; NS 1.144 +/- 0.222; P less than 0.001) than NS patients. The degree of edema was correlated with ANF levels in AGN patients (P less than 0.001) but not in NS patients. There was a strong exponential negative correlation (r = -0.773, P less than 0.0001) between ANF and PRA, in which AGN patients and Na-restricted controls were located in the opposite ends of the volume sensing-response, and NS patients in the middle, alongside controls with regular Na intake. 
Mortality, cardiovascular risk factors, and diet in China, Finland, and the United States. Mortality, cardiovascular risk factors, and diet were compared in Tianjin province, People's Republic of China; in North Karelia Province, Finland; and in the United States as a whole. People in Tianjin received 7 percent of their energy intake from saturated fats, whereas people in the United States received 13 percent and those in North Karelia received 20. The mean blood cholesterol levels for men were 158 milligrams per deciliter (mg per dl) for Tianjin, 216 mg per dl for the United States, and 241 mg per dl for North Karelia. The smoking prevalence among men was highest in Tianjin (66 percent), followed by the United States (42 percent) and Finland (36 percent). The differences among mortality rates for the three locales were less pronounced among women than among men. Age-standardized total mortality for women was highest for Tianjin and lowest in North Karelia. The reverse was true for men. Age-standardized total mortality for men was lowest in Tianjin and highest in North Karelia. Age-standardized ischemic heart disease mortality for men was lowest in Tianjin (99 per 100,000) and highest in North Karelia (730 per 100,000). For women, the corresponding figures were 83 per 100,000 in Tianjin and 164 per 100,000 in North Karelia. Although salt intake was higher in Tianjin than in North Karelia, the blood pressure was on average lower in persons from Tianjin than in those from North Karelia. The stroke mortality rate in Tianjin, however, was much higher than in either Finland or the United States. 
Comparison between prostaglandin E1 and epoprostenol (prostacyclin) in infants after heart surgery. OBJECTIVE--To study the dose response characteristics of prostaglandin E1 and epoprostenol (prostacyclin) and directly to compare their effectiveness as pulmonary vasodilators in infants with pulmonary hypertension. DESIGN--A crossover design with each patient receiving both drugs in random order. SETTING--Infants were studied in the intensive care unit while they were sedated, paralysed, and ventilated. PATIENTS--Twenty infants who had undergone corrective cardiac surgery and who were in sinus rhythm, had stable haemodynamic function, and had a pulmonary artery catheter in place. All infants were receiving dopamine and phenoxybenzamine. INTERVENTIONS--Baseline haemodynamic measurements were taken and an infusion of the first drug was started at the lowest dose: after 20 minutes the measurements were repeated and the dose increased. This protocol was repeated for all doses of both drugs: 10, 30, and 100 ng/kg/min of prostaglandin E1 and 5, 10, and 25 ng/kg/min of epoprostenol. Cardiac output was measured by the pulsed Doppler ultrasound method. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances were calculated from the cardiac output and compared by the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. RESULTS--Both prostaglandin E1 and epoprostenol were effective vasodilators: 5 ng/kg/min of epoprostenol was equivalent to 30 ng/kg/min of prostaglandin E1. CONCLUSIONS--Neither drug showed pulmonary specificity. 
Intraepithelial sebaceous epithelioma of lids, conjunctiva, and cornea treated with minimal orbital exenteration. "Minimal" orbital exenteration, obtained by excision of a lid tumor (that had recurred after local incision), removal of the conjunctival sac, enucleation, and tenonectomy were used to treat intraepithelial sebaceous epithelioma with pagetoid spread to conjunctiva and cornea in an 80-year-old man. 
Ebstein's anomaly associated with splenomegaly and reversible hypersplenism. A case of Ebstein's anomaly associated with chronic right heart failure, hepatosplenomegaly, and the haematological features of hypersplenism is presented. The haematological abnormalities were corrected after tricuspid valve replacement but recurred with the reemergence of clinical features of right heart failure. 
Cardiac reperfusion damage prevented by a nitroxide free radical. Experimental evidence is presented that directly links ischemia/reperfusion injury to the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO)--a stable nitroxide radical that disproportionates superoxide radicals and oxidizes reduced metal ions required for OH. formation--was tested for its ability to prevent reperfusion damage in the isolated rat heart subjected to regional ischemia. Severe reperfusion arrhythmia--ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia--were prominent in control hearts, and their duration was significantly reduced by the presence of 0.4 or 1 mM TEMPO. TEMPO also repressed both postischemic release of lactate dehydrogenase and OH. formation. TEMPO slowed the heart rate, but compensatory pacing did not alter the dramatic effect of the nitroxide on reperfusion arrhythmia. TEMPO was partially protective when introduced at the end of ischemia but had no effect when added 1 min into reperfusion. It was concluded that both reperfusion arrhythmia and cell damage were directly related to oxidative damage incurred during the critical first minute of reperfusion. TEMPO strongly protected against reperfusion injury by preventing the formation of OH. and not by decreasing heart rate or by direct suppression of arrhythmia. 
Gastric emptying after gastric interposition for cancer of the esophagus or hypopharynx. Transhiatal esophagectomy with primary anastomosis to the stomach (gastric pull-up) is an attractive surgical alternative to colic interposition in patients with cancer of the esophagus and hypopharynx. However, the lack of intrinsic gastric peristalsis and complaints by patients of postprandial regurgitation prompted us to measure the effect of body posture on the rates of gastric emptying in these patients. The rates of solid and liquid gastric emptying were measured in 14 patients who had undergone gastric interposition for esophageal and hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Rates of emptying were measured in both the supine and upright position using a dual-isotope radiolabeling technique. In these patients, the rate of gastric emptying of both solids and liquids was significantly slower in the supine position than in the upright position. Emptying in supine patients was also prolonged when compared with supine normal volunteers. Conversely, the upright rate of solid and liquid emptying in the patients was accelerated when compared with published values for upright normal volunteers. We conclude that gastric emptying after gastric interposition is dependent on upright posture after meals. 
Proinflammatory cytokines in acute asthma. Cytokine-mediated interactions between monocytes/macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils may be important in regulation of airway inflammation in asthma. Peripheral blood cytokine concentrations were measured in twenty adults with severe, acute asthma, ten with mild asthma (intermittent inhaled beta-agonists), twelve with chronic asthma (high-dose inhaled steroids), and in sixteen healthy subjects. Interleukin-1 beta, tumour necrosis factor, and interferon gamma were not detected in most subjects. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor concentrations were higher in patients with severe asthma than in healthy subjects (median 179 vs 80 pg/ml; 95% confidence interval for difference 16-168; p = 0.009). Plasma concentrations of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were similar in all asthma groups (geometric mean in severe acute group 570 U/ml, mild group 559 U/ml, and chronic group 560 U/ml) and higher than those in healthy controls (361 U/ml, p less than 0.01). Sequential sIL-2R measurements were done in fifteen of the patients with severe acute asthma. There was no difference between baseline concentrations and those after 2 days of steroid treatment but by day 7 they had fallen significantly (ratio day 7/day 3 = 0.74, [95% CI 0.67-0.82]; p less than 0.001); however, there was no correlation with improvement in peak expiratory flow. This study provides further evidence for T-lymphocyte activation in asthma but shows that plasma sIL-2R is not a useful marker of disease activity. 
Vitreon, a new perfluorocarbon. We evaluated a new liquid perfluorocarbon, perfluorophenanthrene (Vitreon). This material has proven to be non-toxic in vitrectomised rabbit eyes for up to six weeks. Present investigation under FDA guidelines establishes both the safety and efficacy of Vitreon in human eyes. We used Vitreon for intraoperative hydrokinetic retinal manipulation in 15 patients. In cases of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (6), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (5), giant retinal tear (2), retinal dialysis (1), and tractional retinal detachment (1) the retina was successfully reattached. Postoperatively two patients developed proliferative vitreoretinopathy necessitating further surgery, and one patient developed hypotony. Follow-up showed 100% reattachment rate with a mean duration of 6.3 months. Postoperative visual acuity ranges from light perception to 20/30. 
Genotyping study of alcohol dehydrogenase class I polymorphism in French patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The French Group for Research on Alcohol and Liver. Comparison of alcohol dehydrogenase polymorphism at the loci ADH2 and ADH3 is made in France between 46 alcoholic cirrhotic patients and 39 controls, by genotyping technique using polymerase chain reaction on blood microsample collected on blotting paper. The genotype distributions are similar, with low frequency of the ADH2(2) allele. Polymorphism at the ADH3 locus is not a genetic factor for alcoholic cirrhosis in France. 
Role of intrarenal angiotensin II and alpha-adrenoceptors in renal vasoconstriction with acute hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis in conscious dogs. To evaluate our previous observation of renal vasoconstriction during combined acute hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis preceded by acute hypoxemia, we studied 13 conscious mongrel uninephrectomized dogs with chronic renal catheters and controlled sodium intake (80 meq/day for 4 days). Five dogs were studied during combined acute hypoxemia (PaO2, 37 +/- 1 mm Hg) and hypercapnic acidosis (PaCO2, 59 +/- 1 mm Hg; pH 7.20 +/- 0.01). Each dog was studied during infusion of 1) the intrarenal vehicle (n = 5), 2) the intrarenal alpha 1-antagonist prazosin (0.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, n = 5), 3) intrarenal [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II (70 ng.kg-1.min-1, n = 5), and 4) intrarenal prazosin and [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II (n = 4). Immediate induction of combined hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis after control measurements during intrarenal vehicle infusion resulted in a decrease in effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate, increase in renal vascular resistance, and decrease in filtered sodium load in the first 20 minutes of the blood gas derangement. Intrarenal administration of [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II failed to reverse the effects of the combined blood gas derangement on renal function. In contrast, intrarenal prazosin administration either alone or in combination with [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II abrogated the increase in renal vascular resistance, decrease in glomerular filtration rate, and fall in filtered sodium load. These studies identify a major role for alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the renal vasoconstriction during combined hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis. 
Immunohistochemical localization of tissue-type plasminogen activator in the lining wall of chronic subdural hematoma. Capsules of chronic subdural hematoma were immunohistochemically stained with monoclonal antibody against tissue-type plasminogen activator. Endothelial cells of sinusoids and capillaries in the outer membrane showed strong immunostaining. Endothelial cells of veins and arteries in the dura mater showed moderate and weak staining. No cells other than the endothelial cells were stained. In the inner membrane, tissue-type plasminogen activator immunoreactivity was not seen. The mean concentration of tissue-type plasminogen activator in the hematoma content was higher than that in the plasma. The more the sinusoids in the outer membrane were developed, the higher the concentration of tissue-type plasminogen activator contained in the hematoma fluid. In chronic subdural hematoma, overproduction and oversecretion of tissue-type plasminogen activator from the sinusoidal and capillary endothelial cells in the outer membrane cause increased fibrinolysis, which in turn impairs hemostasis, and hemorrhage from the capillaries recurs, resulting in enlargement of the chronic subdural hematoma. 
Carbon dioxide laser vaporization of recalcitrant symptomatic plaques of Hailey-Hailey disease and Darier's disease. Carbon dioxide laser vaporization of localized, recalcitrant intertriginous plaques was done in two patients with Hailey-Hailey disease and two patients with Darier's disease. After treatment, only one patient had recurrence in one treatment site. All patients had significant clinical and symptomatic improvement. Destructive treatment must include the follicular infundibulum in Darier's disease, because histologically this was the focus of recurrent disease at one treated site. We suggest carbon dioxide laser vaporization for the treatment of chronic, localized, symptomatic plaques of Hailey-Hailey or Darier's disease, if medical therapy has been ineffective. 
Rearrangement of the T-cell receptor delta chain gene in T-cell lymphomas with a mature phenotype. The configuration of the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta chain gene was assessed using restriction fragment analysis and the Southern blot technique in 39 T-cell lymphomas with a mature immunophenotype. The TCR delta gene was rearranged in four lymphomas although the gamma/delta TCR was not expressed in two cases studied. The TCR delta gene was the only TCR gene rearranged in two cases. Each lymphoma with TCR delta gene rearrangement had an aberrant T-cell immunophenotype and three cases were of the large cell anaplastic type. The TCR delta gene was deleted in 22 cases and was in the germline configuration in 13 lymphomas. Deletion of the TCR delta gene was characteristic of mycosis fungoides, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (human T cell leukemia-lymphoma virus positive), and Lennert's lymphoma, and was not identified in angiocentric lymphomas. In eight cases with TCR delta deletion, however, a large number of polyclonal (presumably reactive) T cells were present and, in these lymphomas, the authors could not determine if TCR delta gene deletion occurred in the polyclonal T cells, the neoplastic cells, or both cell populations. The authors conclude that the TCR delta gene is usually deleted in mature T-cell lymphomas, as would be expected in alpha/beta TCR T cells. However, TCR delta gene rearrangement is detectable in approximately 10% of cases. Analysis of this locus may be useful diagnostically, as it occasionally may be the only molecular marker of clonality in mature T-cell lymphomas T-cell receptor delta chain gene rearrangement also is found most often in lymphomas of the large cell anaplastic type. 
Spinal leptomeningeal metastasis from cerebral glioblastoma. Appearance on magnetic resonance imaging. A case of circumferential leptomeningeal metastasis to the spinal cord from an intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (spinal meningeal gliomatosis) is presented. The clinical, radiographic, and pathological features are described. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid accurately demonstrated the spread of disease when compared with autopsy findings. The value of spinal magnetic resonance imaging in patients with symptoms attributable to cerebrospinal fluid metastases is discussed. 
Penetrating cardiac injuries. One hundred nine penetrating cardiac injuries were reviewed: 49 gunshot wounds and 60 stab wounds. They were classified into four groups: group 1 (lifeless), 38; group 2 (agonal), 16; group 3 (shock), 33; and group 4 (stable), 22. Thirty-six patients in group 1 (94%) and 8 of 16 patients in group 2 (50%) underwent emergency room thoracotomy; 24 of 33 in group 3 (73%) and 20 of 22 (90%) underwent thoracotomy in the operating room. Twenty-one (38%) of 55 patients undergoing emergency room thoracotomy survived, whereas 47 (87%) of 54 patients undergoing operating room thoracotomy survived. Survival was 12 of 38 (31%) in group 1, 11 of 16 (69%) in group 2, 26 of 33 (79%) in group 3, and 18 of 22 (82%) in group 4 with an overall survival of 67 of 109 (61%). Gunshot wounds of the heart portend a worse prognosis than stab wounds. Survival of gunshot wounds was 20 of 49 (40%) compared with 47 survivors of 60 stab wounds (78%). Aggressive treatment, including emergency room thoracotomy, is justified for lifeless and deteriorating cardiac injury victims. 
Cytology of head and neck tumors, liver, and pancreas. The use of fine needle aspiration biopsy helps in reducing the number of thyroidectomies. Cytologic differentiation between cellular adenomas and well-differentiated follicular carcinomas is difficult, however; hence, both groups of lesions should be excised. Cytologic diagnosis of the common salivary gland tumors (ie, pleomorphic adenomas and Warthin's tumors) is accurate, but much experience is required for the cytodiagnosis of other tumor types. The majority of liver malignancies is metastatic in origin and poses no diagnostic problems. Pathologists also should be familiar with the cytology of hepatocellular carcinoma as the population of Asian immigrants in North America is increasing. Most of the pancreatic tumors are ductal adenocarcinomas, which can be diagnosed cytologically. Occasionally, atypical ductal epithelium in chronic pancreatitis may mimic malignancy. Cytodiagnosis of nonduct-cell neoplasms of the pancreas requires experience. 
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura first seen as massive vaginal necrosis. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a hematologic disorder that affects the microcirculation. A 38-year-old woman was first seen with fever, thrombocytopenia, and vaginal bleeding. Pelvic examination revealed massive vaginal necrosis. Hematology consultation resulted in agreement with the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. This is the first reported case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura first seen as vaginal necrosis of which we are aware. 
Transthoracic high frequency (7.5 MHz) echocardiographic assessment of coronary vascular reserve and its relation to left ventricular mass. Transthoracic high frequency (7.5 MHz) ultrasonography can visualize the distal left anterior descending coronary artery. Thirty-seven patients were studied before and after administration of 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin to determine whether this technique could quantitatively record changes in coronary artery diameter after intervention. Left anterior descending coronary artery diameter increased from 2.2 to 2.8 mm (p less than 0.05). The vasodilator response of this artery was compared with left ventricular mass index in normal subjects, patients with congestive cardiomyopathy and those with end-stage renal disease and left ventricular hypertrophy. Left anterior descending artery diameter increased 55% in normal subjects, 27% in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 10% in those with end-stage renal disease with left ventricular hypertrophy. These results demonstrate that high frequency ultrasound can detect nitroglycerin-induced changes in left anterior descending artery diameter. The percent increase is related to the diameter before nitroglycerin administration, which is related to the underlying diagnosis and left ventricular mass index. 
Somatosensory evoked potentials to median nerve stimulation after partial section of the corpus callosum. Cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to electrical stimulation of the median nerve were studied in four patients with intractable epilepsy who had undergone callosotomy and in a patient with infarction in the corpus callosum in order to determine whether the corpus callosum was involved in the generation of ipsilateral frontal components. Both pre- and postoperative SEPs were recorded in three of four epileptic patients. There were no significant differences in the latencies and amplitudes of the bilateral frontal components (P20, N26) between pre- and postoperative recordings. Furthermore, irrespective of the extent of the section or lesion in the corpus callosum, the nature of the impairment and the existence of the disconnection syndrome, the SEP findings showed no significant differences compared with those of normal subjects. It thus appears unlikely that the ipsilateral SEP responses are transmitted from the contralateral hemisphere through at least the anterior portion of the corpus callosum. 
Scanning electron microscopic study of microaneurysms in the diabetic retina. We describe the clinical and pathologic appearance of the retinal microcirculation in a patient with a 22-year history of diabetes mellitus. A vascular cast of one eye was prepared and studied with scanning electron microscopy. The three-dimensional views obtained give insight into the pathogenesis of microaneurysms. 
Risks and benefits of home parenteral nutrition in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The gastrointestinal tract is a major target of the human immunodeficiency virus. Many AIDS patients have weight loss and/or diarrhea. Parenteral nutrition can be used to treat malnutrition associated with malabsorption. We reviewed retrospectively the clinical course of 22 patients with AIDS and weight loss greater than 10% who received home parenteral nutrition (HPN) for 56.2 patient-months. Mean weight loss was 21.4%, mean duration of HPN 2.55 months, mean age 37.4 years. Fifteen patients gained weight, six stabilized and two continued to lose weight. Nine patients returned to previous activity. Five died. The rates of catheter-related sepsis, complications, and metabolic disturbances were 0.12, 0.25, and 0.12/100 catheter days, respectively, results identical to those reported in other patient populations where HPN is commonly applied. We found that HPN induced weight gain and clinical improvement in most patients without higher risks of sepsis than in patients with malignancies. 
Multidrug-resistant myeloma: laboratory and clinical effects of verapamil as a chemosensitizer. Verapamil was evaluated as a chemosensitizer for reversing multidrug resistance in multiple myeloma both in vitro and in clinical trials. Bone marrows from 59 myeloma patients in relapse were evaluated for several resistance parameters: expression of p-glycoprotein (MDR1), doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and vincristine sensitivity, and the ability of added verapamil to reduce resistance to the cytotoxic agents. We found that verapamil was capable of sensitizing myeloma cells that exhibited resistance to doxorubicin and vincristine in vitro, but did not enhance sensitivity of cells that were drug sensitive (P less than .001). Myeloma cells expressing MDR1 immunohistochemically tended to be more doxorubicin resistant in vitro than MDR1-negative cells. In the clinical trials, 22 patients with myeloma refractory to vincristine-Adriamycin-dexamethasone (VAD) were treated with VAD plus high-dose intravenous verapamil (Ve). Among the 22 patients treated with VAD/Ve, five achieved a partial remission (23%). The median relapse-free survival for the VAD/Ve responders was 5.4 months and their overall survival from the start of VAD/Ve was better than that of the nonresponders. Among the subset of 10 patients whose myeloma cells were MDR1 positive, four responded clinically (40%), whereas none of five patients with MDR1-negative myeloma cells achieved remission with VAD/Ve. We also observed that myeloma cells from three of four VAD/Ve clinical responders exhibited in vitro chemosensitization with verapamil, whereas in vitro verapamil chemosensitization was seen in only one of six clinical nonresponders. Our observations demonstrate that clinical reversal of multidrug resistance can be achieved in some patients with VAD-refractory myeloma with the use of verapamil. In addition to their value in drug development, in vitro tests of MDR1 expression and of chemosensitizers plus cytotoxic drugs on the patients' bone marrow myeloma cells may identify patients who will respond clinically to chemosensitizer-containing regimens. We anticipate that chemosensitizer regimens capable of inhibiting multidrug resistance will play an increasing role in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, including B-cell neoplasms such as multiple myeloma and the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. 
Suppression of rat deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension by kallikrein-kinin system. Brown Norway kininogen-deficient rats had very low levels of plasma kininogens and lower levels of plasma prekallikrein, compared with those of normal rats of the same strain. Systolic blood pressure, determined by the tail-cuff method, of 5-week-old kininogen-deficient rats (106 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, n = 7) and the rate of systolic blood pressure increase with age were not different from those in normal rats. Weekly injections of deoxycorticosterone acetate (5 mg/kg s.c.) with 1% sodium chloride solution in drinking water after uninephrectomy at 7 weeks of age caused a gradual increase in the blood pressure of normal rats, reaching a plateau at 18 weeks of age, whereas that of deficient rats rose rapidly to 158 +/- 6 mm Hg 2 weeks after the start of treatment and continued to increase slightly, becoming significantly higher than normal rats at 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 weeks of age (p less than 0.05 or 0.01). The levels of urinary prokallikrein and active kallikrein were slightly higher in deficient rats before deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt treatment but were not significantly increased after this treatment, whereas these levels in normal rats were increased 3.6- and 4.7-fold by this treatment. Urinary free kinin, collected from the ureter in untreated deficient rats, was below the detection limit. The plasma level of low molecular weight kininogen, the substrate of glandular kallikrein, was decreased in normal rats during the treatment. Continuous subcutaneous injection of aprotinin by an osmotic pump to normal rats induced significant increase in blood pressure. These results indicate that glandular kallikrein may play a suppressive role in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension. 
Biochemical and molecular analysis of cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in Leigh's syndrome. We studied three patients with Leigh's syndrome (LS) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency. Biochemical studies in brain, muscle, heart, liver, kidney, and fibroblasts disclosed a generalized COX deficiency. Kinetic studies of COX activity in brain mitochondria showed a low Vmax and a normal Km for reduced cytochrome c. Immunologic studies showed decrease of all COX subunits studied, without a specific defect of any one of them. Southern blot analysis excluded large deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) but revealed a generalized increase in mtDNA quantity. Although Northern blot analysis showed no alteration in the 12 COX subunit mRNAs studied, two of three patients showed a decreased steady state rate of COX transcription in brain. COX deficiency in LS thus appears to be related to a decreased amount of otherwise normal COX holoenzyme. 
Meakin adjuvant regimen in premenopausal patients with breast cancer. A 10-year experience using ovarian ablation and prednisolone as adjuvant therapy for premenopausal patients with breast carcinoma, emphasizing tolerability and morbidity is reported. Thirty patients (15 aged less than 45 years, 15 aged greater than or equal to 45 years; range 28-54 years) underwent mastectomy/lumpectomy with axillary clearance (with or without local irradiation) followed by ovarian irradiation and prednisolone therapy (2.5 mg three times daily for 5 years). Patients were reviewed every 3 months for the first 3 years and every 6 months thereafter. Follow-up was between 1.5 and 10 years (median 5 years). Twenty-four patients are still alive. Three patients stopped therapy because of side-effects. There was a mean(s.e.m.) weight gain of 8.46(1.69) per cent on therapy. Nineteen patients have been weaned off prednisolone over a period of 0.5-7.5 months (median 2 months) and the median length of time off steroids is now 3 years (range 0.5-5 years). This regimen appears to be associated with an acceptable level of patient tolerability and a low chronic morbidity rate and should be considered as an alternative to adjuvant systemic cytotoxic therapy. 
Interrupted aortic arch with tetralogy of Fallot. A report of an unsuccessful surgically treated case. Interrupted aortic arch is a complete discontinuity of two segments of the aorta. Although associated with a number of conditions, it does not occur in association with pulmonary stenosis. We report a case unsuccessfully treated but from which we have learnt a lesson. 
Haemolytic effects of exercise. 1. Exercise-induced haemolysis has been implicated in the sub-optimal iron status of endurance-trained athletes. Accordingly, erythrocyte survival studies using 51Cr were performed on male and female distance runners (n = 20) and sedentary control subjects (n = 10) in order to determine whether the rate of erythrocyte destruction was altered as a consequence of repetitive exercise training. 2. The chromium half-disappearance time of the male (25.4 +/- 3.6 days, mean +/- SD) but not the female (28.3 +/- 4.6 days) athletes was significantly lower than that of the male (33.1 +/- 4.5 days) and female (32.3 +/- 2.6 days) control subjects (P less than 0.01). The mean erythrocyte lifespan of the male and female distance runners (67.2 +/- 22.2 and 72.4 +/- 26.0 days, respectively) was significantly shorter than that of the non-exercising male and female subjects (113.4 +/- 31.0 and 114.1 +/- 29.0 days, respectively) (P less than 0.01). 3. There was no correlation between the mean erythrocyte lifespan and the haemoglobin concentration, serum ferritin levels, body mass, weekly training distance, number of years running or daily protein intake. The mean cell volume and reticulocyte count measured in the same athletes before and after completing a standard 42 km marathon race were within the normal range, whereas the plasma haemoglobin levels were elevated (77.0 +/- 50.5 mg/l) and the serum haptoglobin levels were decreased (0.89 +/- 0.4 g/l) at rest, with a further significant decrease after running (0.69 +/- 0.4 g/l) in the latter measurement (P less than 0.05). 4. It is concluded that the demonstrated increase in erythrocyte turnover may be sufficient to precipitate an iron deficiency in endurance athletes when dietary intake or absorption does not meet the accelerated erythropoietic demands. 
Cell migration and actin organization in cultured human primary, recurrent cutaneous and metastatic melanoma. Time-lapse and image analysis. Random cell migration and actin organization in seven human primary, recurrent cutaneous, and metastatic melanoma cell lines were studied by time-lapse video recording and image analysis. The migration of over 800 randomly selected cells from the cell lines were recorded using an inverted microscope with an attached incubator housing. The fraction of cells with random migration rates greater than 10 microns/hour was 8% in an established primary melanoma cell line, 2% and 34% in two recurrent cutaneous melanoma cell lines, and 5%, 30%, 31%, and 60% in four metastatic cell lines. The three metastatic cell lines with significantly higher mean migration rates (P less than 0.001) were derived from lymph node metastases, whereas the fourth metastatic cell line was derived from a visceral metastasis. The cellular morphology and presence of cell nests in the original tissue correlated with in vitro cell morphology and the formation of colonies. The ability of cells to organize actin into stress fibers directly correlated with significantly higher random migration rates and lack of colony formation. Characterization of random migration rates and actin organization of human melanoma cells that are isolated from different stages of tumor progression may lend insight into metastasis. 
Stasis ulcers: the role of compliance in healing. The goal in treating a stasis ulcer is rapid and permanent reepithelialization of the ulcer bed. The patient can reach this goal by strict compliance with a program taught and continually reinforced by the physician. The program teaches about the effects of the force of gravity on the flow of blood and lymph in the lower extremities in various positions. The program consists of three rules for the patient to follow: (1) Never sit with legs below heart level. (2) Never stand still. Walk in place or even while sitting (if sitting is necessary). (3) Always wear compressive stockings or pneumatic leggings when walking. I present four case histories demonstrating the different rates of healing of stasis ulcers during noncompliance and during compliance with the physiologic methods of controlling edema and venous stasis in the legs. 
Hemianesthesia, sensory neglect, and defective access to conscious experience. We report a patient with an ischemic stroke in the vascular territory of the right middle cerebral artery who had left spatial neglect and left hemianesthesia. The patient showed a dissociation between defective verbal reporting of somatosensory stimuli delivered to the left hand and physiologic evidence from an autonomic index. This indicates that there was processing of undetected stimuli without the patient's awareness, and suggests that the hemianesthesia was due, at least in part, to somesthetic hemi-inattention. 
Embryological and molecular investigations of parental imprinting on mouse chromosome 7 Mouse embryos with duplications of whole maternal (parthenogenetic and gynogenetic) or paternal (androgenetic) genomes show reciprocal phenotypes and do not develop to term. Genetic complementation has identified the distal region of chromosome 7 (Chr 7) as one of the regions for which both a maternal and paternal chromosome copy are essential for normal development, presumably because of the presence of imprinted genes whose expression is dependent on their parental origin. Embryos with the maternal duplication and paternal deficiency of distal Chr 7 are growth retarded and die around day 16 of gestation; the reciprocal paternal duplication embryos die at an unidentified earlier stage. We report here the incorporation of cells with the paternal duplication into chimaeras, resulting in a striking growth enhancement of the embryos. One gene located on mouse distal Chr 7 (ref. 5) is the insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) gene, an embryonic mitogen. In embryos with the maternal duplication of distal Chr 7, the two maternal alleles of the Igf2 gene are repressed. The presence of two paternal alleles of this gene in many cells is probably responsible for the growth enhancement observed in chimaeras. We propose that there are other imprinted genes in this Chr 7 region. We also compare the imprinting of this subgenomic region with phenotypes resulting from the duplication of the whole parental genome in parthenogenones and androgenones. 
Initial blood pressure fall on stand up and exercise explained by changes in total peripheral resistance. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the initial fall in blood pressure on standing upright from the supine position, we measured the beat-to-beat changes in intra-arterial pressure in eight healthy male subjects in response to standing. Changes in stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance were computed from the pressure waveform using a pulse contour method. To determine possible mechanisms for the changes observed on standing, similar measures were made on passive tilting and a brief (3-s) bout of cycle exercise. Standing elicited a transient 25% (23-mmHg) fall in mean blood pressure as a result of a 36% fall in total peripheral resistance. Head-up tilt elicited a gradual change in haemodynamic parameters, which reached plateau levels in 20-30 s. Cycling elicited a transient 17% (18-mmHg) fall in blood pressure and a 41% fall in total peripheral resistance. In addition, we measured right atrial and esophageal pressures in two subjects on standing and cycling and found a 10- to 15-mmHg rise in right atrial pressure without a corresponding change in esophageal pressure. This points to the cardiopulmonary reflex as the primary effector of peripheral vasodilation, but we cannot exclude the possibility that 1) local metabolic vasodilation and 2) central command-mediated cholinergic vasodilation contributed to the fall in vascular resistance. 
Effects of a three-drug antineoplastic protocol of wound healing in rats: a biomechanical and histologic study on gastrointestinal anastomoses and laparotomy wounds. Using biomechanical and histologic approaches, the effect of perioperative administration of a drug protocol containing 5-fluoruracil, Adriamycin, and mitomycin C (FAM) on the healing of gastrointestinal anastomoses and laparotomy wounds in rats was examined. Application of FAM immediately before operation resulted in significant impairment of wound healing in the early postoperative period. Once the proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis had led to an increase of mechanical strength, no negative effect on wound healing could be detected applying the same chemotherapeutic agents. These findings indicate the early inflammatory phase of the wound healing process to be most vulnerable to the chemotherapeutic effects. This has significant implications if the theoretical advantages of starting adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment in the immediate postoperative period are implemented. 
Involvement of vacuolar H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase activity in multidrug resistance in HL60 cells. HL60 cells isolated for resistance to vincristine (HL60/Vinc cells) or doxorubicin (HL60/Adr cells) contain enhanced levels of an energy-dependent drug efflux pump. HL60/Vinc cells contain the drug transporter P-glycoprotein, whereas the HL60/Adr isolate does not. In the present study, we examined the possible involvement of vacuolar H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (H(+)-ATPase) activity in drug resistance in HL60 cells. We utilized bafilomycin A1, an agent which selectively inhibits vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity at low concentrations. The results showed that bafilomycin A1 induced a major increase in drug accumulation and inhibited drug efflux in both HL60/Adr cells and HL60/Vinc cells. Similar results were obtained with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa 1,3 diazole, an agent which is also capable of inhibiting vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Azide, an inhibitor of F1F0 mitochondrial ATPase, and vanadate and ouabain, which are inhibitors of E1E2-type ATPase, did not affect drug levels in resistant cells. We also observed that bafilomycin A1 did not compete with [3H]azidopine binding to P-glycoprotein. Thus, bafilomycin A1 does not appear to function as a substrate for P-glycoprotein. These results suggest an involvement of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity in the pathway of drug efflux from HL60/Adr cells and HL60/Vinc cells. The mechanism of this action remains to be determined. 
Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome of the scalp: histologic and ultrastructural findings. Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome is an association of connective tissue nevi and osteopoikilosis that usually appears in the first decades of life. The nevi occur on the trunk and extremities. In a 48-year-old man with this rare syndrome the connective tissue nevus was located on the scalp and was pruritic. Histologically, involvement of the epidermis with cystic dilatation of the hair follicles and an abnormality of mucopolysaccharides were present. The nevi in this syndrome may involve an alteration in the three components of connective tissue to a variable degree. 
A regional prospective study of in-hospital mortality associated with coronary artery bypass grafting. The Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group. OBJECTIVE--A prospective regional study was conducted to determine if the observed differences in in-hospital mortality rates associated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are solely the result of differences in patient case mix. DESIGN-Regional prospective cohort study. Data including patient demographic and historical data, body surface area, cardiac catheterization results, priority of surgery, comorbidity, and status at hospital discharge were collected. This study presents data for 3055 CABG patients between July 1, 1987, and April 15, 1989. SETTING--This study includes data from all surgeons performing cardiothoracic surgery in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont; the data were collected from five regional medical centers. PATIENTS--Data were collected from all consecutive isolated CABG surgery patients during the study period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Crude and adjusted in-hospital mortality rates associated with CABG. MAIN RESULTS--The overall crude in-hospital mortality rate for isolated CABG was 4.3%. The rate varied among centers (range, 3.1% to 6.3%) and among surgeons (range, 1.9% to 9.2%). Predictors of in-hospital mortality included increased age, female gender, small body surface area, greater comorbidity, reoperation, poorer cardiac function as indicated by a lower ejection fraction, increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure and emergent or urgent surgery. After adjusting for the effects of potentially confounding variables, substantial and statistically significant variability was observed among medical centers (P = .021) and among surgeons (P = .025). CONCLUSION--We conclude that the observed differences in in-hospital mortality rates among institutions and among surgeons in northern New England are not solely the result of differences in case mix as described by these variables and may reflect differences in currently unknown aspects of patient care. Understanding this variation requires a detailed understanding of the processes of care. 
Sinus bradycardia related to temporomandibular joint surgery. The carotid artery lies in close relationship to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Manipulation of the mandible during TMJ surgery has been observed in several cases to be directly associated with the development of sinus bradycardia as the joint is distracted during arthrotomy and arthroplasty procedures. We report several cases and discuss differential diagnosis of sinus bradycardia associated with positional changes of the TMJ. This report emphasizes the importance to the surgeon and to the anesthesiologist of recognition of this cardiac phenomenon, mediated through the trigeminovagal reflex, to appropriately manage the patients during TMJ surgery. 
Malignant biliary obstruction: percutaneous use of self-expandable stents A total of 83 self-expandable metallic stents were placed percutaneously in 69 patients for palliation of malignant biliary obstruction. Stent diameter was 1 cm; length, 3.5-10.5 cm. Of the 41 patients with common bile duct obstruction, 27 died 0.2-12 months (median, 3.2 months) after stent insertion. Two patients developed recurrent jaundice and cholangitis after 6 and 12 months, respectively. One patient underwent reintervention. Fourteen patients were alive without jaundice 1-8 months (median, 6.3 months) after stent placement. Of the 28 patients with hilar lesions, 13 died 0.7-7.6 months (median, 4.3 months) after stent placement. Fifteen were alive 1-15.5 months (median, 8.1 months) afterward. Recurrent jaundice and cholangitis were seen in eight of the 28 patients (28%) after 1-6 months (median, 3.6 months). The cause of malfunction of the stent(s) was tumor ingrowth in one patient, tumor overgrowth at the proximal end in five patients, and overgrowth at the distal end in two patients. Reintervention was performed in five patients (18%). Stent-related complications were seen in four patients. 
Eosinophil-induced chronic active hepatitis in the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. A 19-yr-old man had features of chronic hepatitis with piecemeal necrosis as the sole clinical feature of the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Liver biopsy specimens demonstrated the presence of activated eosinophils and, by immunohistochemical staining, major basic protein in areas of hepatic cell damage. The case demonstrates the clinical presentation of the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome as chronic hepatitis and the association between eosinophil infiltration and degranulation with the presence of hepatocyte necrosis. 
Expression of a mutant DNA topoisomerase II in CCRF-CEM human leukemic cells selected for resistance to teniposide. Nuclear extracts from teniposide (VM-26)-resistant sublines of the human leukemic cell line CCRF-CEM have decreased levels of DNA topoisomerase II catalytic activity and decreased capacity to form drug-stabilized covalent protein-DNA complexes. The ATP concentration required for equivalent activity in a DNA-unknotting assay is 2- to 8-fold higher in nuclear extracts from drug-resistant cell lines as compared with the parental line. When adenosine 5'-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate is substituted for ATP in complex-formation assays, no significant change is seen with drug-sensitive cells, but a 50-65% reduction is seen with VM-26-resistant cells. Collectively, these results indicate that an alteration in ATP binding may be involved in the resistance phenotype. Therefore, we identified regions of the topoisomerase II sequence that conform to previously identified nucleotide-binding sites. Starting with cDNA as the template we determined the sequence of the topoisomerase II mRNA surrounding these sites by sequencing DNA fragments produced by the polymerase chain reaction. In the region corresponding to the consensus B ATP-binding sequence described by Walker et al. [Walker, J. E., Saraste, M., Runswick, M. J. & Gay, N. J. (1982) EMBO J. 1, 945-951], the cDNA from the two VM-26-resistant sublines contained an altered sequence having a G----A base change. This base substitution results in the replacement of the conserved arginine at position 449 with a glutamine. Hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides confirmed the presence of both the normal and the altered sequence in the resistant cell lines, whereas only the normal sequence was found in the sensitive CEM cells. A chemical mismatch cleavage procedure for the detection of mispaired bases in DNA duplexes identified no other alterations in the 5' third of the mRNA coding sequence, which contains the complete ATP-binding domain of topoisomerase II. The presence of mRNA encoding topoisomerase II with Gln449 correlates both with the presence of a topoisomerase II protein whose interaction with ATP is altered and with increased resistance to the cytotoxicity of VM-26. 
Relation of risk factor levels in young adulthood to parental history of disease. The CARDIA study BACKGROUND. The relation between self-reported parental disease and risk factor levels was examined in 2,637 black and 2,478 white men and women aged 18-30 years at the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study baseline examination (1985-1986). METHODS AND RESULTS. The prevalence of parental disease (at least one parent) in white versus black participants was 44% and 56% for hypertension, 47% and 44% for obesity, 16% and 13% for myocardial infarction, 11% and 17% for diabetes, and 6% and 10% for stroke, respectively. Among these young adults, parental hypertension was associated with higher sex- and age-adjusted systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Parental myocardial infarction was associated with higher plasma cholesterol, higher blood pressure levels, and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in white participants. Parental diabetes was associated with higher fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in all race-sex groups and with higher triglycerides and lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol in black participants only. Parental history of obesity was related to less favorable age- and sex-adjusted lipid levels in white participants and higher blood pressure levels in black participants. Parental history of stroke was associated with higher systolic blood pressure levels in black participants. In general, these differences across family history were predicted only in part by obesity. The prevalence of more than one disease reported in parents occurred more frequently than would have been expected due to chance alone. CONCLUSIONS. These associations between parental disease and risk factors in their adult children probably reflects the impact of both environmental and genetic factors. Parental history may be a useful marker for high risk individuals. 
Morphine pharmacokinetics and pain assessment after intracerebroventricular administration in patients with terminal cancer. Morphine pharmacokinetics and pain relief were evaluated after intracerebroventricular administration of morphine (0.4 +/- 0.11 mg) in seven patients with cancer suffering from intractable pain. Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), lumbar CSF, and plasma morphine concentrations were analyzed by a specific morphine radioimmunoassay. A two-compartment model was sufficient to describe the kinetics of morphine in ventricular CSF. Morphine diffuses to the lumbar level, and the mean maximum concentration was 192 +/- 105 ng/ml at 4.5 +/- 1.3 hours. Ventricular and lumbar CSF morphine kinetics showed a similar decline during the elimination phase, with terminal half-lives of 3.8 +/- 0.6 hours and 4.2 +/- 1.6 hours, respectively. Pain relief was evaluated by a visual analog scale: the test showed a rapid onset of analgesia (less than 10 minutes). Analgesic effectiveness reached a maximum between 6 and 10 hours. The relationship between pharmacologic effect and morphine concentrations in ventricular CSF resulted in an anticlockwise hysteresis curve. The presence of morphine in lumbar CSF suggested an additive spinal action of morphine, which probably plays a role in the duration of analgesia. 
Pentoxifylline inhibits interleukin-2-induced leukocyte-endothelial adherence and reduces systemic toxicity. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) mediates the regression of metastatic cancer, but clinical application has been limited by the induction of dose-dependent toxicities in normal tissues. The most clinically significant toxicities occur secondary to a vascular leak syndrome and include acute respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability. Because previous studies suggested a role for pentoxifylline in attenuating the toxic effects of IL-2, we hypothesized that pentoxifylline would inhibit alterations in the microvasculature induced by IL-2 and would ultimately reduce IL-2-induced toxicity. To determine the validity of this hypothesis, we prepared four groups of rats for in vivo microvascular observation. In the first group, a bolus intravenous injection of IL-2 (1 x 10(6) units/kg) acutely induced hypotension, tachypnea, hypoxia, increased lung water, decreased microvascular blood flow, and increased leukocyte-endothelial adherence. No significant changes occurred in animals treated by pentoxifylline alone or the control IL-2 vehicle-alone group. However, pentoxifylline inhibited many of the IL-2-induced systemic and microvascular effects, such as hypotension, tachypnea, increased lung water, hypoxia, and increased leukocyte-endothelial adherence, but not tachycardia or increased microvascular protein leakage. These data support our hypothesis that systemic toxicities induced by IL-2 are associated with alterations in the microcirculation, which may be ameliorated by pentoxifylline. 
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left coronary artery in patients with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery: clinical and functional results. The safety and therapeutic benefits of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery, the left circumflex coronary artery or both were assessed in 61 patients with chronic (greater than 3 months) occlusion of the right coronary artery. Recanalization of the right coronary artery was not performed before dilatation of left coronary artery lesions. All lesions could be dilated without an acute ischemic event in the catheterization laboratory. However, three patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery within the first 8 days after coronary angioplasty. There were no in-hospital deaths. Of the remaining 58 patients, 51 (88%) had repeat angiography at a mean of 5.2 +/- 2.5 months. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence (n = 17) or absence (n = 34) of restenosis defined as greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis at the dilated site. Baseline characteristics were comparable. The mean value for angina functional class at follow-up was significantly better in the group without than in the group with restenosis (0.4 +/- 0.6 vs 2.1 +/- 1.1, respectively; p less than 0.001). Sixty-five percent of the patients without restenosis were asymptomatic at follow-up. Seventy-five percent of the predicted maximal physical capacity was reached by 76% of the patients without restenosis compared with 33% in the group with restenosis (p less than 0.05). 
Neonatal short bowel syndrome. In this retrospective study the management of infants who had undergone resection of more than 50% of the small bowel as newborn infants between 1970 and 1988 was analyzed to define prognostic factors. Small bowel resections were performed for atresia (36 cases), volvulus (22 cases), gastroschisis (10 cases), necrotizing enterocolitis (11 cases), and other disorders (8 cases). Patients were classified into two groups depending on the length of residual small bowel: group 1 (n = 35) had less than 40 cm of small bowel and group 2 (n = 51) had 40 to 80 cm of residual small bowel. Patients in group 2 had significantly better survival rates than those in group 1 (92.0% vs 66.6%; p less than 0.001). The patients in group 1 who were born after 1980, when home parenteral nutrition was introduced, had better survival rates than those who were treated before 1980 (95.0% vs 65.0%; p less than 0.01). The time required for acquisition of intestinal adaptation depended on the intestinal length (average, 27.3 months for group 1 and 14 months for group 2; p less than 0.01) and on the presence or absence of the ileocecal valve. Parenteral or supportive enteral nutrition, or both, ensured normal growth in both groups. We conclude that more than 90% of infants now survive after extensive small bowel resection with parenteral nutrition and that the remaining small intestine will adapt with time. Home-based parenteral nutrition allowed children to be treated in the best psychosocial environment. 
Carcinoembryonic antigen levels in peritoneal washings can predict peritoneal recurrence after curative resection of gastric cancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were determined in the peritoneal washings from 120 patients with gastric cancer and 9 patients with benign diseases. Elevated values (greater than 100 ng/g of protein) were observed in 20 of 25 patients with gastric cancer with visible dissemination and 16 of 25 patients with serosal invasion but no dissemination. The same elevation was found in only 9 of 70 patients with no serosal invasion and none of the patients with benign disease. The 2-year survival rates after curative operation for the patients with and without elevation of CEA levels were 21% (19 patients) and 100% (66 patients), respectively (P less than 0.001). A negative correlation was found between CEA levels and survival times after noncurative operation. These results indicate that the CEA level in peritoneal washings could be a sensitive detector of invisible peritoneal dissemination and a new predictor for the postoperative prognosis of gastric cancer. 
Asymptomatic bacterascites: is it spontaneous bacterial peritonitis? Asymptomatic bacterascites is defined as the presence of bacteria in ascitic fluid without clinical features of peritonitis or increased ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cells. Asymptomatic bacterascites is a controversial entity, and little information is available regarding its spontaneous evolution. Clinical features, bacteriological data and outcome in 22 cirrhotic patients with asymptomatic bacterascites are reported and are compared with those of a group of 36 cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Eleven patients had gram-negative bacteria and 11 had one gram-positive bacteria. Only in three patients (13.6%) did peritonitis develop. Twelve patients received no antibiotic therapy, and in none did peritonitis develop. At 1 month, 27% of patients with asymptomatic bacterascites had died. Patients with asymptomatic bacterascites had less-severe liver disease; they more frequently had gram-positive bacteria in ascitic fluid and had a lower 1-mo mortality rate than did patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We conclude that asymptomatic bacterascites is usually the transient residence of bacteria in ascitic fluid. Peritonitis rarely develops in patients with asymptomatic bacterascites and, in most of them, antibiotic therapy is not required. 
Population-based study of surgery in juvenile onset Crohn's disease. A geographically based cohort of 68 children with Crohn's disease was derived by sampling from Scottish Hospital In-patient Statistics. Surgical histories were examined and analysed by actuarial methods, and the nature of major operations performed was compared with operations for Crohn's disease in the Lothians' Surgical Audit. Fifty-four of the 68 patients were treated surgically, with a total of 135 operations (71 major, 64 minor). Fifty per cent of the cohort had a major operation within 5 years of onset of symptoms; median time to a second operation was 4 years. The types of major operation performed in juvenile onset patients differed significantly from those recorded in the Lothians' audit, with a high rate of exploratory laparotomy in younger patients (12 cases). With a mean follow-up of 7 years, 12 patients (18 per cent) have a permanent stoma. There were five deaths, three postoperative. This study highlights the frequency of surgical intervention in young people with Crohn's disease. 
Effect of preoperative stabilization on respiratory system compliance and outcome in newborn infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. To determine whether preoperative stabilization and delay of operative repair of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) may decrease operative risk, we performed serial pulmonary function tests on 22 newborn infants with CDH and on four infants without pulmonary hypoplasia (two with ileal atresia and two with tracheoesophageal anomalies) who served as control subjects. We used 2 passive respiratory mechanics technique to measure respiratory system compliance. All patients with CDH had respiratory distress immediately after birth, and required mechanical ventilation. Thirteen babies underwent emergency repair (six survived, seven died); nine of them received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) after the operation (two survived, seven died). Operative repair was delayed deliberately for 2 to 11 days in nine infants with severe hypoxemia. Six immediately received ECMO for 4 to 10 days; one died of intraventricular hemorrhage, and five survived and later underwent surgical repair. The seventh patient did not receive ECMO but appeared to have respiratory distress syndrome of infancy and improved after administration of synthetic surfactant. Improvement was seen in two additional infants who received conventional assisted ventilation during a 48-hour delay before surgery, and survived. In all, eight of nine infants who underwent preoperative stabilization survived (p less than 0.05 compared with survival after emergency surgery). Following surgical repair immediately after birth, respiratory system compliance improved only slightly during the first week of life, a time when control infants had a rapid increase in respiratory system compliance (p less than 0.001). In contrast, respiratory system compliance increased nearly twofold in the nine patients undergoing preoperative stabilization (p less than 0.02). Preoperative ECMO was associated with an increase in respiratory system compliance of more than 60% for 1 week, a significant difference from respiratory system compliance among patients undergoing emergency CDH repair (p less than 0.05). These observations provide physiologic evidence of possible benefits of preoperative stabilization before repair of CDH. 
Acute pseudobulbar or suprabulbar palsy. We studied 13 patients with supranuclear lower cranial nerve ("pseudobulbar" or "suprabulbar") palsy of acute onset. While seven patients had had a prior stroke, six patients had no history of stroke. Eight patients experienced a complete bilateral supranuclear lower cranial nerve palsy, which was isolated in five patients and associated with hemiplegia and with hemiparesis in three patients. Pseudobulbar palsy was partial in five patients. Only one patient had neuropsychologic impairment. The pseudobulbar features improved or recovered within a few weeks in all patients. The common characteristic of the lesions on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was the interruption of the corticonuclear pathways contrasting with marked sparing of the corticospinal pathways in both hemispheres. These lesions were either an opercular infarct, or a deep infarct in the corona radiata or internal capsule, or a lenticular hemorrhage. Hypertension was the most prevalent concomitant. Our findings suggest that acute pseudobulbar or suprabulbar palsy has rather stereotyped anatomic-vascular correlates and time course. 
Rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma as a result of blunt abdominal trauma. Spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma occurs frequently in populations in which this tumor is common, but rarely in populations with a low incidence of the tumor. Rupture caused by blunt abdominal trauma has previously been reported in a single patient only. We describe three southern African black men who presented with an acute hemoperitoneum after blunt trauma to the abdomen, and in whom a moderate-size hepatocellular carcinoma was found at laparotomy to have ruptured. In two of the patients, it was possible to resect the tumor. This resectability rate is unusual in blacks with hepatocellular carcinoma, because the tumor is characteristically far advanced at the time of presentation and is rarely amenable to resection. 
Microvascular angina. Cardiovascular investigations regarding pathophysiology and management. A significant minority of patients with chest pain who undergo cardiac catheterization are found to have angiographically normal coronary arteries. Over the past 25 years, several studies have shown that a subset have demonstrable abnormalities in coronary flow and cardiac function; however, only a minority of these patients have convincing evidence for myocardial ischemia during stress, and alternative mechanisms have been explored to explain the frequent and debilitating symptoms of pain experienced by the majority of these patients undergoing study. Abnormal visceral nociception appears to be a fundamental abnormality in this population, whether or not demonstrable abnormalities in coronary flow or cardiac function can be demonstrated. 
Low-dose enoximone in subjects awaiting cardiac transplantation. Clinical results and effects on beta-adrenergic receptors. During a 3-year period we administered enoximone, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with positive inotropic and vasodilator properties, to 73 pretransplantation patients with end-stage heart failure who exhibited a clinical requirement for additional inotropic support. The clinical course and myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor status in the explanted hearts of these 73 patients was compared with results in 113 concurrently listed pretransplantation patients not requiring additional inotropic support. Only three patients required cessation of enoximone because of adverse effects, all from exacerbation of ventricular arrhythmias. Sixty-six of 73 (90.4%) enoximone-treated patients ultimately underwent cardiac transplantation a mean of 39.2 +/- 6.6 days (range 1 to 221 days) after starting enoximone, whereas seven patients (9.6%) died awaiting cardiac transplantation. The respective 1-, 3-, and 6-month pretransplantation survival rates of patients treated with enoximone calculated from their time on the waiting list for transplantation were 88.0%, 82.5%, and 82.5% compared with 92.1%, 83.8%, and 76.2% in control patients not receiving enoximone (all p = not significant). In 25 patients who received enoximone, ventricular myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors were measured at the time of transplantation and compared with values in failing ventricles from 52 pretransplantation patients not exposed to enoximone. Compared with ventricular myocardium of patients not given enoximone or intravenous beta-adrenergic agonists, total beta-adrenergic receptor (beta 1 plus beta 2) density was not decreased in patients treated with enoximone or enoximone plus intravenous beta-adrenergic agonists, but was decreased by 31% (p less than 0.05) in patients given intravenous beta-adrenergic agonists alone. Additionally, patients treated with enoximone had higher myocardial beta 2-adrenergic receptor densities than respective subgroups treated without (28% higher, p less than 0.01) or with (65% higher, p less than 0.01) intravenous beta-adrenergic agonists. Finally, isoproterenol- or calcium-mediated contractile responses in isolated right ventricular preparations from 14 patients treated with enoximone were similar to values in control patients not exposed to enoximone or intravenous beta-adrenergic agonists, suggesting that enoximone-related beta-adrenergic subsensitivity or damage to the contractile apparatus does not occur. 
Long-term soft-tissue effects of biliary extracorporeal shock waves: an animal study. Although delayed effects of renal extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) have been reported, the long-term soft-tissue effects after biliary ESWL have not been investigated. We report soft-tissue effects seen up to 1 year after biliary extracorporeal shock waves were administered to 18 Yucatan pigs. The gallbladder received 4000 electromagnetic shock waves from a Siemens Lithostar overhead module. Blood samples were drawn from each pig for hematologic, coagulation, and biochemical profiles immediately before and then at prescribed time intervals after administration of shock waves. Autopsy and histopathologic examination of the gallbladder and surrounding organs were performed. Kidneys and adrenal glands also were examined in five pigs followed up for 1 year. There were no gross or microscopic abnormalities in 11 animals, including all five animals in the 1-year group in which kidneys and adrenal glands also were normal. One animal (3-week group) had two 2-mm foci of parenchymal necrosis in the right lobe of the liver, probably related to ischemia after shock-wave therapy. Transient rise in liver and pancreatic enzyme levels was seen in most animals after administration of shock waves. The levels returned to normal within 2 months in all but one animal. We conclude that biliary ESWL with the Lithostar Plus does not produce long-term histologic evidence of organ damage in Yucatan pigs. 
Jolt accentuation of headache: the most sensitive sign of CSF pleocytosis. We prospectively examined the clinical signs of 54 febrile patients associated with recent-onset headache. They underwent lumbar puncture (LP) on suspicion of meningitis. The relation of each sign to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis was estimated. Among 34 patients with pleocytosis, 33 had jolt accentuation (sensitivity: 97.1%), while only 5 of them had neck stiffness or Kernig's sign. Among 20 patients without pleocytosis, 12 had no jolt accentuation (specificity: 60%). We found jolt accentuation to be the most sensitive sign of CSF pleocytosis. If jolt accentuation is noted in a febrile patient associated with recent onset headache, the CSF should be examined even in the absence of neck stiffness or Kernig's sign. 
Cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment. General considerations. Cost-effectiveness analysis, a set of methods for estimating the costs and health effects of medical interventions, helps decision makers to compare alternative treatments and to decide which interventions are appropriate in which situations. This article outlines some fundamental principles of cost-effectiveness analysis and discusses the characteristics necessary if alternative therapies are to be more cost-effective than traditional drug treatment for hypertension. The discussion focuses primarily on the newer drugs like angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers, and calcium antagonists. 
Quantitative analysis of signal-averaged P waves in idiopathic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Detailed analysis of the QRS complex can identify patients at risk from ventricular arrhythmias, but similar techniques applied to the atria have been disappointing. This study attempts to quantitate differences in the fine morphology of P waves in a group of 9 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) versus 15 control subjects. Atrial triggered signal-averaging was combined with a detailed investigation of P-wave duration, high-frequency spatial voltage and spatial velocity. Signal-averaged P-wave duration was significantly increased in patients with paroxysmal AF (135 +/- 8 vs 126 +/- 4 ms, p less than 0.05). The root-mean-square voltage at frequencies greater than 35 Hz in these patients was also significantly greater (16 +/- 3 vs 12 +/- 1 microV, p less than 0.05). Similar observations were made at frequencies greater than 40 Hz (10 +/- 3 vs 7 +/- 1 microV, p less than 0.05). These differences appeared to be confined to the third quarter of the P wave (third quarter root-mean-square voltage at greater than 40 Hz expressed as a ratio of total P-wave root-mean-square voltage, 1.4 +/- 0.1 vs 1.2 +/- 0.1, p = 0.005). Spatial velocity was also increased in the paroxysmal AF group (peak spatial velocity 6.4 +/- 1.8 vs 4.6 +/- 0.5 mV/s, p less than 0.05). These observations support previous intracardiac data that implicate delay and fragmentation of intraatrial conduction in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal AF. 
Evolution of the treatment of the injured colon in the 1980s. During the past 10 years, 1006 patients with colon injuries were treated in an urban trauma center. Primary repair, including suture repair and resection with anastomosis, was performed in 614 patients (61%), colostomy in 284 patients (28%), and exteriorized repairs in 83 patients (8.3%). In the remaining 25 patients (2.5%) who were exsanguinating, the colon injuries were ligated. Independent risk factors for adverse outcomes (defined as a fecal fistula, abdominal abscess, stomal complication, or death from multisystem failure) were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. These factors were used to match patients at similar risk within different treatment groups, and odds ratios for each treatment were calculated. The odds ratios for primary repair, colostomy, and exteriorized repair were 1.0, 1.9, and 2.0, respectively. Therefore, the chance of an adverse outcome was twice as great for both exteriorized repair or colostomy as for primary repair. It is concluded that further increases in the use of primary repair are warranted. 
Current and future drugs for acid-peptic disease: a plethora of opinions on possible mechanisms of action. Sixty-seven invited participants involved in the development, evaluation, and use of therapies for acid-peptic disorders participated in a meeting to discuss the scientific basis for healing actions of ulcer drugs and the prospects for future developments ("Realities of Mucosal Protection in the Upper Gastrointestinal Tract," Lausanne, Switzerland, November 8-10, 1987). Eighty-one key statements were prepared and subsequently analyzed on the basis of a voting system. Of the 45 statements that dealt with existing therapies, only 3 statements showed positive consensus (agreement of two-thirds or more of voters) about mechanisms of ulcer healing. Participants agreed that both (1) hydrogen/potassium adenosine triphosphatase inhibitors and (2) histamine H2 antagonists healed ulcers solely by acid inhibition, and (3) that sucralfate works by topical action. Substantial uncertainty about the mechanisms by which bismuth compounds and antacids heal ulcers was noted as well as their wide range of effects. The mechanism of ulcer healing by prostaglandins and the clinical relevance of antiulcer effects of drugs demonstrated in acute studies with animals were also controversial. There was greater agreement among participants about unexplored drug effects that might produce ulcer healing. Of the 36 such mechanisms surveyed, the most support went to therapies aimed at enhancement of mucosal blood flow, epithelial restitution, and mucosal alkaline secretion or inhibition of luminal pepsin activity. The diversity of opinions among participants suggests a high level of empiricism in the development of ulcer healing drugs apart from those that inhibit acid secretion. This empiricism probably arises from inadequate understanding of processes of mucosal injury and repair. 
von Willebrand factor and animal models: contributions to gene therapy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and coronary artery thrombosis. Use of animal models of von Willebrand factor (vWF) deficiency, both inherited and induced, continues to advance the knowledge of vWF-related diseases. Three examples are reviewed in this article--von Willebrand's disease (vWD), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and coronary artery thrombosis. The success of gene transfer by liver and bone marrow transplantation in porcine vWD and canine hemophilia A, with a change in phenotype that establishes improved hemostasis, portends imminent testing of gene therapy in these models. With use of recombinant technology, the phenotype of hemophilia B fibroblasts has been transformed to normal, as evidenced by secretion of the normal hemostatically active protein. This result is a prelude to implantation in hemophilic animals. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is characterized by qualitative and quantitative alterations in vWF. A new animal model induced by the venom factor botrocetin, a cofactor of vWF, closely mimics the human syndrome. A proposed pathophysiologic mechanism for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is outlined. The third contribution is recognition that occlusive coronary thrombosis is a vWF-dependent condition. Without vWF, as in porcine vWD or normal pigs treated with a monoclonal anti-vWF antibody, occlusive thrombi do not develop, even with luminal stenosis. The thrombogenicity of coronary atheromas, including those with fissures of the fibrous cap, is also vWF-dependent. 
Persistent platelet activation by passivated grafts. Vascular grafts in canines exhibit similar healing patterns to humans in that the graft surface forms a pseudointima over time but endothelializes only near the anastomotic sites. Thus the pseudointima at the midportion of the graft may represent a nidus for persistent platelet activation. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effect of the maturing graft surface on platelet activation. Long Dacron subcutaneous carotid to aorta grafts (50 cm x 8 mm) were placed in nine dogs. Blood samples were obtained by direct graft puncture, at the proximal and distal ends of the graft, at 1, 24, 48, 72 hours, 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks, and monthly thereafter for 8 months. Seven sham dogs had subcutaneous grafts implanted without arterial anastomoses, and blood samples were drawn from the femoral artery. Platelet counts were determined with a platelet counter. Platelet aggregation and release of adenosine triphosphate was determined with a whole blood aggregometer by use of arachidonic acid, collagen, and adenosine diphosphate as agonists. No difference was found in platelet aggregation to collagen or adenosine diphosphate stimulation across the graft, but platelets released significantly less adenosine triphosphate to collagen and adenosine diphosphate stimulation distally versus proximally. In the graft dogs a decrease in systemic platelet counts of 50% occurred from the preoperative level which persisted over 8 months (p less than 0.01). Also less response occurred to collagen and ADP stimulated platelet aggregation in the graft animals than the sham animals during the first month of study. These data suggest that significant platelet-graft interactions occur even after the graft has formed a mature pseudointima. 
Evaluation of different systems for clinical quantification of varicose veins. One hundred twenty-five lower limbs with varicose veins were studied clinically, essentially by palpation. Two specialists in venous pathology scored the severity of the varicose veins from 0 to 20. Comparison between the different clinical parameters and the scores of the specialists showed that two systems of clinical quantification gave good results and were easy to use. One system is the maximum diameter of the largest varicose vein; the other system is the sum of maximum diameters over 7 sections (3 for thigh, 3 for leg, 1 for foot). This latter system gives a more precise evaluation of the clinical severity of the varicose veins. 
Recurrent classic migraine attacks following transdermal scopolamine intoxication. A 20 year old male naval crew-member suffering from sea sickness was treated with transdermal scopolamine (TS). After 5 months of continuous treatment, he developed scopolamine intoxication followed by the appearance of recurrent classic migraine attacks. He had never suffered from headache or migraine prior to TS intoxication. The migraine attacks comprised a prodrome of apathy, bad mood and loss of appetite lasting several hours. An aura of scintillating spots, left arm numbness and paresthesias lasting several minutes was followed by a severe throbbing unilateral headache with photophobia, sonophobia and nausea. After one year of repeated follow-up examination, he continued to suffer from the attacks once every 10 to 14 days, with no identified precipitating factors. We are not aware of similar cases in the medical literature. Although it is not possible to establish TS intoxication as a causal effect of the appearance of classic migraine in our patient, the temporal association and clinical course are very supportive of this assumption. Central nervous system neurotransmitter imbalance of cardiovascular alterations may possibly be implicated. 
Should elective endoscopic sphincterotomy replace cholecystectomy for the treatment of high-risk patients with gallstone pancreatitis? [editorial] Since the introduction of endoscopic sphincterotomy approximately 15 years ago, the indications for this procedure have expanded. Currently endoscopic sphincterotomy is the procedure of choice for management of retained common bile duct stones following cholecystectomy. It is also being used more frequently for choledocholithiasis with an intact gallbladder in high-risk patients and in some patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis. In patients recovering from an episode of gallstone pancreatitis, standard practice has been subsequent cholecystectomy with possible exploration of the common bile duct. To avoid surgery in high-risk patients, we propose that an elective endoscopic sphincterotomy may be a reasonable therapeutic option regardless of whether common bile duct stones are present at the time of ERCP. A prospective trial is needed to examine this issue since to date there is no literature on endoscopic sphincterotomy in the absence of choledocholithiasis for gallstone pancreatitis in patients with intact gallbladders. 
A case of chronic mountain sickness diagnosed by routine pulmonary function tests. In summary, this is a patient who presented with respiratory acidosis and cor pulmonale. The major diagnostic challenge was in differentiating primary cardiopulmonary disease from a central abnormality of ventilatory drive. The arterial blood gases showed a normal A-a gradient suggesting hypoventilation as the etiology of his hypoxemia. Pulmonary function testing showed air trapping, but a relatively normal FEV1/FVC and airways resistance. The literature suggests that most altitude natives have depressed hypoxemic and hypercapnic drives with a distinct subset demonstrating a profoundly depressed drive to ventilation. This latter group has been labeled as having chronic mountain sickness or Monge's disease. As one might expect, ventilatory control during sleep is also abnormal in these patients with CMS. Our patient indeed showed typical frequent severe desaturations with hypopnea. The diagnosis of CMS in our patient was made with routine arterial blood gases and standard pulmonary function tests. Additional tests of ventilatory responsiveness to oxygen and carbon dioxide could have been performed, but are not necessary to make the diagnosis. 
Possible deletion of a developmentally regulated heavy-chain variable region gene in autoimmune diseases. Several autoantibody-associated variable region (V) genes are preferentially expressed during early ontogenic development, suggesting strongly that they are of developmental and physiological importance. As such, it is possible that polymorphisms in one or more of these genes may alter susceptibility to autoimmune disease. We have searched extensively for a probe related to a developmentally regulated V gene that has the power to differentiate among highly homologous V genes in human populations. Using such a probe (i.e., Humhv3005/P1) related to both anti-DNA and anti-IgG autoantibodies, we studied restriction fragment length polymorphisms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus and found an apparent heavy-chain V (VH) gene deletion that was nearly restricted to the autoimmune patients. These data suggest that deletions of physiologically important VH genes may increase the risk of autoimmunity through indirect effects on the development and homeostasis of the B-cell repertoire. 
Routine programmed electrical stimulation in survivors of acute myocardial infarction for prediction of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up: results, optimal stimulation protocol and cost-effective screening Of 3,286 consecutive patients treated for acute myocardial infarction, electrophysiologic testing was performed in 1,209 survivors (37%) free of significant complications at the time of hospital discharge to determine their risk of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was inducible by programmed electrical stimulation in 75 (6.2%). Antiarrhythmic therapy was not routinely prescribed regardless of the test results. During the 1st year of follow-up, 14 infarct survivors (19%) with inducible ventricular tachycardia experienced spontaneous ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in the absence of new ischemia compared with 34 (2.9%) of those without inducible ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.0005). During the extended follow-up period (median 28 months) of those with inducible ventricular tachycardia, 19 (25%) had a spontaneous electrical event; 37% of these first events were fatal. These results suggest that the most cost-effective strategy for predicting arrhythmia will be obtained by restricting electrophysiologic testing to infarct survivors whose left ventricular ejection fraction is less than 40% and using a stimulation protocol containing four extrastimuli. Electrophysiologic testing is the single best predictor of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up in infarct survivors. The majority (94%) with a negative test benefit from the more reliable reassurance that all is well, whereas the 25% risk of electrical events in those with inducible ventricular tachycardia justifies a prospective trial of effective prophylactic antiarrhythmic interventions. 
Digital rectal examination and carcinoma of the prostate. Urologists have considered themselves to be the experts in the use of digital rectal examination for the evaluation of diseases of the prostate. However, without close attention to the teaching of this examination, it probably is inaccurate and unreliable. Moreover, many patients who are destined to die of prostate cancer never develop a palpable abnormality. In patients with prostate cancer, a palpable abnormality usually indicates the presence of carcinoma, but the majority of patients will be upstaged by pathologic examination. In patients undergoing a digitally guided biopsy, it appears critical that those with a negative biopsy be followed closely, as they have a measurable risk of developing overt carcinoma. It is unclear how transrectal ultrasound will interface with digital rectal examination because of the multiple echo patterns this disease can exhibit. 
Prevalence and treatment of giardiasis in chronic diarrhoea and malnutrition. To determine the prevalence of giardiasis in Gambian children with chronic diarrhoea and to assess their response to treatment, 31 children with chronic diarrhoea and malnutrition were investigated for giardiasis using a combination of serology (specific antigiardia IgM antibody) and microscopy of faeces and jejunal biopsy specimens. Fourteen of 31 children with chronic diarrhoea had giardiasis compared with only four of 33 healthy age and sex matched control children. Four of 15 malnourished children without diarrhoea were giardia positive. Twenty-three children with chronic diarrhoea were reinvestigated after treatment with metronidazole; giardia was found in 11 of them. These results show that giardia is highly prevalent in children with chronic diarrhoea and malnutrition and that the infection does not respond to standard therapeutic measures. 
Quantitative cervical flexor strength in healthy subjects and in subjects with mechanical neck pain. Although weakness of anterior cervical muscles is postulated to contribute to persistent neck pain in patients with mechanical neck pain, quantitation of weakness has never been reported. We compared anterior cervical muscle strength in 30 subjects with mechanical neck pain and in 30 asymptomatic control subjects. Testing was performed with the subject supine, chin retracted, and neck flexed. Assessment was made using a hand-held dynamometer with head held at the midline and with rotation left and right within a pain-free range. Analysis with Wilcoxon scores showed that patients with neck pain had significantly less (p less than .05) strength (N.Kg-1) in all three positions than controls (1.16 +/- 0.49 vs 1.71 +/- 0.42, sagittally; 1.01 +/- 0.52 vs 1.47 +/- 0.41, rotation left; .99 +/- 0.46 vs 1.43 +/- 0.43 rotation right; neck pain vs control, respectively.) This weakness and its role in persistent neck pain should be recognized. The efficiency and effect of cervical muscle strengthening in treatment of chronic neck pain should be further defined. 
A phase I, II study of high-dose 5-fluorouracil and high-dose leucovorin with low-dose phosphonacetyl-L-aspartic acid in patients with advanced malignancies. Twenty-eight patients with refractory advanced malignancies were treated with a 24-hour infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin (LV), and N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartic acid (PALA) weekly. Twenty-seven patients were evaluable to assess toxicity and antitumor activity. The PALA was administered as an intravenous bolus over 15 minutes at a fixed dose (250 mg/m2) 24 hours before the start of the 5-FU and leucovorin infusions. Initially the dose of 5-FU was 750 mg/m2; this was increased incrementally to 2600 mg/m2. The LV was administered in a fixed dose of 500 mg/m2 concurrently with the 5-FU over a 24-hour period. This regimen was repeated weekly. Diarrhea, stomatitis, nausea, and vomiting were among the dose-limiting toxicities. Others were hand-foot syndrome, hair loss of the scalp and eyelashes, overall weakness, rhinitis, and chemical conjunctivitis. The maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU in this combination and schedule was 2600 mg/m2. Seven of 14 patients treated with 2600 mg/m2 were able to tolerate the chemotherapy on a weekly basis without interruption. The other seven patients required dose reductions, but most received 5-FU at a dose of 2100 mg/m2. Twenty-three of 27 patients were treated previously. Eight patients had a partial response; five of these were treated previously. A complete response was observed in one patient with pancreatic carcinoma, previously untreated. The overall response rate for patients treated with 2100 or 2600 mg/m2 of 5-FU was nine of 18 patients (50%). Three of four previously untreated patients with pancreatic cancer responded to this treatment (two responded partially, and one had a complete response). One of three heavily pretreated patients with non-small cell lung cancer had a partial response as did a patient with breast cancer. Four of ten patients with colorectal cancer responded to the treatment (four partial responses), of whom three had been treated previously. 
Anemia and postoperative apnea in former preterm infants. To examine the association between anemia and postoperative apnea in former preterm infants, 24 former preterm infants of less than 60 weeks postconceptual age undergoing inguinal hernia repair were studied. A hematocrit of at least 25% was required for study participation. General endotracheal inhalational anesthesia, supplemented with neuromuscular blockade and controlled ventilation, was used. No barbiturates or opioids were administered. Respiratory pattern and heart rate were recorded for at least 12 h postoperatively using an impedance pneumograph. Tracings were analyzed for evidence of apnea, periodic breathing, and/or bradycardia by a pulmonologist unaware of the hematologic profile of the infant. Nineteen patients had a hematocrit of 30% or greater (group 1). Their mean (+/- standard deviation [SD]) gestational age was 33.5 +/- 2.7 weeks and postconceptual age 45.5 +/- 4.6 weeks. Five infants had a hematocrit less than 30% (group 2). Their mean gestational age (+/- SD) was 32.4 +/- 3.2 weeks and postconceptual age 43.6 +/- 5.5 weeks. Anemic infants had an 80% incidence of postoperative apnea versus 21% in infants with a normal hematocrit (P less than .03). In the infants who developed postoperative prolonged apnea and/or bradycardia, a prior history of apnea was equally present in both groups (21% in group 1 and 20% in group 2). This study shows that anemia in former preterm infants can be associated with an increased incidence of postoperative apnea. 
Acute inflammation: the underlying mechanism in delayed onset muscle soreness? It is well documented in animal and human research that unaccustomed eccentric muscle action of sufficient intensity and/or duration causes disruption of connective and/or contractile tissue. In humans, this appears to be associated with the sensation of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). During the late 1970's, it was proposed that this sensation of soreness might be associated with the acute inflammatory response. However, subsequent research failed to substantiate this theory. The present article suggests that the results of much of the research concerning DOMS reflect events typically seen in acute inflammation. Similarities between the two events include: the cardinal symptoms of pain, swelling, and loss of function; evidence of cellular infiltrates, especially the macrophage; biochemical markers such as increased lysosomal activity and increased circulating levels of some of the acute phase proteins; and histological changes during the initial 72 h. In the final section of this paper, a theoretical sequence of events is proposed, based on research involving acute inflammation and DOMS. 
Medical evaluation of internationally adopted children. BACKGROUND. Despite many reports of medical illness in children adopted from abroad, there are currently no accepted guidelines for medical evaluation of this population. METHODS. Two hundred ninety-three children adopted from 15 countries (mean age, 14.0 months; 55 percent girls) were evaluated by history taking, physical examination, and screening tests for hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1, tuberculin reactivity, intestinal parasites, syphilis, excretion of cytomegalovirus, renal disease, and anemia. All but four were seen within one month of their arrival in the United States. RESULTS. Fifty-seven percent of the children (168 of 293) were found to have at least one important medical condition. Eighty-one percent of the diagnoses were established by screening test, rather than by history taking or physical examination. Infectious diseases made up the majority of the medical conditions (73 percent). Serologic testing for hepatitis B surface antigen was positive in 5 percent of the children. Characteristics associated with the acquisition of HBV infection included arrival within the first three years of the study (P = 0.017), Asian origin (P = 0.011), and receipt of a blood transfusion abroad (P = 0.008). Ten children (3 percent) had positive Mantoux skin tests, and four of these had active pulmonary tuberculosis. Tuberculin reactivity was significantly associated with older age (P less than 0.001) and lower weight (P = 0.037). Intestinal parasites were isolated from 14 percent of the international adoptees. Non-Korean adoptees were 16 times more likely to be harboring at least one intestinal parasite than were Korean adoptees (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS. Directed screening tests should be a routine component of the medical evaluation of all children adopted from abroad, regardless of age, sex, or country of origin. 
A limitation of endoscopic ultrasound: an unusual case of early gastric cancer overlying a pancreatic rest. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has been developed as a valuable tool for examining the depth of carcinoma invasion and evaluating the submucosal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. In the present case, that of a 60-yr-old woman, the work-up of radiography and conventional endoscopy revealed an ulcerating cancer of the stomach. Subsequent EUS showed a solid high-echoic mass occupying the third (submucosal) and fourth (muscularis propria) layers of gastric wall, suggestive of an advanced cancer invading the muscularis propria. However, histologic examination of the surgical specimen showed that this tumor was early submucosal carcinoma confined to the surface of a pancreatic rest. Retrospective evaluation of EUS pictures proved that the mass had tubular or circular echoless structures associated with thickening of the fourth layer, suggesting the pancreatic rest. Our experience in reviewing EUS findings of this tumor seems noteworthy, inasmuch as EUS indicates that EUS may provide certain characteristic features of gastric pancreatic rest that should be differentiated from invading carcinoma. 
Acidic polyamino acids inhibit human eosinophil granule major basic protein toxicity. Evidence of a functional role for ProMBP. Eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP), a potent toxin for helminths and mammalian cells in vitro, is a single polypeptide chain rich in arginine. MBP has been localized on damaged helminths and tissues in hypersensitivity diseases including bronchial asthma. The MBP cDNA indicates that MBP is translated as a slightly acidic preproprotein with an acidic propart. To test the hypothesis that the acidic pro-part of proMBP inhibits the toxicity of mature MBP, acidic polyamino acids (aa) were used as antagonists of MBP toxicity to K562 cells and guinea pig tracheal epithelium and used as antagonists of MBP airway hyperresponsiveness in primates. The acidic poly aa inhibited MBP toxicity and MBP airway hyperresposiveness. The acidic poly aa inhibited MBP toxicity in a charge-dependent manner similar to that proposed for proMBP, suggesting that the acidic pro-part of proMBP functions to mask mature MBP toxicity. This inhibition was not limited to MBP, but also applied to polyarginine and eosinophil cationic protein. These acidic poly aa may be useful to inhibit the actions of a number of cationic toxins released by the eosinophil in numerous hypersensitivity diseases. 
Role of oxygen-derived free radicals in myocardial edema and ischemia in coronary microvascular embolization BACKGROUND. Oxygen-derived free radicals are thought to injure the ischemic heart during coronary microvascular embolization. METHODS AND RESULTS. To test this idea, microspheres (15 microns in diameter) were repetitively administered into the left anterior descending coronary artery to cause microvascular embolization in dogs. Myocardial contractile and metabolic dysfunctions were significantly attenuated after treatments with recombinant human superoxide dismutase, an acyl derivative of ascorbic acid (CV3611, 2-O-octadecylascorbic acid), and xanthine oxidase inhibitor (allopurinol). The free radical scavengers and inhibitor enhanced the coronary hyperemic flow response during embolization, and the total number of microspheres causing maximal embolization was increased by these drugs. When 8-phenyltheophylline was additionally administered with superoxide dismutase, these beneficial effects were abolished, indicating that coronary effects of these drugs may be due to increased release of adenosine during coronary microvascular embolization. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that oxygen radicals worsen the ischemic injury in coronary microembolization. 
Mechanisms of disease in Hantavirus infection: pathophysiology of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute viral disease that occurs over wide areas of Europe and Asia. Hantaviruses are the cause of this syndrome. The hallmark of HFRS is the triad of fever, hemorrhage, and renal failure. In its severe form it is associated with significant mortality. The syndrome evolves through five phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, diuretic, and convalescent. The central physiologic derangement in HFRS is vascular dysfunction, manifested by impaired vascular tone and increased vascular permeability. The systemic effects of this dysfunction account for the occurrence of hypotension and shock, while local effects are probably important in the development of renal failure. Shock in HFRS has distributive and oligemic features, while renal failure has features of acute tubular necrosis. Hemorrhage is a consequence of vascular injury and a deficit of functional platelets. Vascular and platelet dysfunction are both compounded by uremia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation contributes to hemorrhage in some patients. Although hantaviruses are infectious for endothelial cells and may cause direct injury, a large body of evidence suggests that immune mechanisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of HFRS. 
Treatment of aplastic anemia with antilymphocyte globulin and methylprednisolone with or without cyclosporine. The German Aplastic Anemia Study Group BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Immunosuppression is the most effective treatment for patients with aplastic anemia, except for bone marrow transplantation. The best results are achieved with antilymphocyte globulin or cyclosporine. Patients have been treated successfully with a combination of both agents, but there has been no controlled evaluation of its efficacy. We conducted a randomized, multicenter trial in 84 patients not eligible for bone marrow transplantation, comparing treatment with antilymphocyte globulin and methylprednisolone (41 patients--the control group) with antilymphocyte globulin, methylprednisolone, and cyclosporine (43 patients--the cyclosporine group). RESULTS. At three months significantly more patients in the cyclosporine group had a complete or partial remission in response to treatment than did patients in the control group (65 percent vs. 39 percent, P less than 0.03); this difference was confirmed at six months (70 percent vs. 46 percent, P less than 0.05). The superior results of the regimen including cyclosporine were most evident in the patients with severe or very severe aplastic anemia, whose response rate at six months was 65 percent, as compared with 31 percent of such patients in the control group (P less than 0.02). Granulocyte and hemoglobin levels became normal in most patients who responded, but platelet counts continued to be subnormal in 61 percent of the patients. Ten of 52 patients with responses (3 in the cyclosporine group and 7 in the control group) relapsed 4 to 37 months after treatment. The actuarial survival of all patients at 41 months is 64 percent in the cyclosporine group and 58 percent in the control group (P = 0.16); among the patients with severe or very severe disease, survival is 80 percent and 44 percent, respectively (P = 0.077). Cyclosporine had substantial but reversible side effects. CONCLUSIONS. Immunosuppressive treatment of aplastic anemia with antilymphocyte globulin, methylprednisolone, and cyclosporine appears to be more effective than a regimen of antilymphocyte globulin and methylprednisolone without cyclosporine and may thus represent a treatment of choice for patients who are not eligible for bone marrow transplantation. 
Isolated calf venous thrombosis: diagnosis with compression US. Compression ultrasound (US) is an excellent means of evaluating the femoral and popliteal veins but is generally regarded as inadequate for the diagnosis of calf vein thrombosis. This prospective study evaluated compression sonography of the calf veins in 45 symptomatic patients with normal femoral and popliteal veins. All patients underwent correlative venography. Compression US enabled identification of 15 of 17 patients with calf vein thrombosis (sensitivity, 88%). The two false-negative results were in patients with small isolated thrombi. Compression US results were true-negative in 26 of 27 patients with normal venograms (specificity, 96%). If these results can be duplicated by other investigators in larger series of patients, compression US will be an adequate screening modality for calf vein thrombosis. 
Talc granulomatosis presenting as spontaneous pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax has been described in association with conglomerate masses and bullous disease in end-stage talc granulomatosis. Our case demonstrates that pneumothorax can occur earlier in the course of the disease before these end-stage radiographic changes are present. 
Site-directed mutagenesis of lysine within the immunodominant autoepitope of PDC-E2. The major autoantigens of PBC have been identified as the four closely related mitochondrial enzymes PDC-E2, BCKD-E2 OGDC-E2 and protein X. A major structural similarity of these enzymes is the presence of one or more lipoyl domains. The immunodominant epitope of each autoantigen has either been postulated or been demonstrated to be located within the lipoate binding region. However, it is not clear whether the binding of lipoic acid to the epitope is necessary for autoantibody recognition. To address this issue we have constructed by oligonucleotide site-directed mutatagenesis three mutants in the lipoyl domain of human PDC-E2. Because lipoic acid is covalently bound to the zeta-amino group of the lysine residue of PDC-E2, the mutants were designed to replace the lysine residue in the lipoyl domain with glutamine, a negatively charged amino acid; histidine, a positively charged amino acid; and tyrosine, an aromatic amino acid. Binding reactivity of sera from patients with PBC were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblotting and specific absorption against each of the three mutants and control clones. All data were compared with parallel studies with a control recombinant clone, the liver-specific F alloantigen. We believe the recognition of the lipoyl domain is a reflection of the surface-exposed, hydrophilic and relatively mobile nature of this region of the autoantigen. Further studies on direct assay for the presence of lipoic acid will be needed to clarify these issues. 
Detection of minimal residual disease in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia using polymerase chain reaction predicts impending relapse. After achieving remission, approximately one-third of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) relapse due to the resurgence of residual leukemic cells that cannot be detected in remission by morphologic methods. Thus, the early detection of residual disease is highly desirable to monitor the efficacy of therapy, or to institute an alternative mode of therapy. Toward this aim, we have examined the applicability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification in the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow samples from patients with T-ALL in morphologic remission. Two different approaches were taken to identify leukemic clone-specific sequences that could be used as targets for PCR amplification. The first technique used T-cell receptor-delta (TCR-delta) gene rearrangements that were sequenced directly after PCR amplification of leukemic DNA. This method was successful in generating clone-specific probes for 76% of T-ALL patients screened. An alternative method was used to clone and sequence a TCR-beta chain gene from leukemic cells to generate a specific probe. The PCR assays that we used were specific for each patient's leukemic clone, and were capable of routinely detecting one leukemic cell in 10(4) normal cells. Using these sensitive PCR-based assays, we found no evidence for persistence of the leukemic clone in any of the bone marrow samples from four T-ALL patients who are in long-term (3.9 + to 8.1 + years) remission. In contrast, we detected residual disease in clinical remission samples from two patients who subsequently relapsed. In one patient, where we had appropriate samples, we observed a dramatic expansion of the leukemic clone 3 months before clinical relapse. These results suggest that PCR-based assays for detection of MRD in T-ALL patients have great potential in predicting impending relapse, and in determining the efficacy of the anti-leukemic therapy. These methods may also allow the identification of long-term survivors. 
Enhanced antitumor activity in mice after administration of thermosensitive liposome encapsulating cisplatin with hyperthermia. The antitumor effect of cisplatin-(CDDP)-encapsulated thermosensitive large unilamellar liposome (ThLip) administration with hyperthermia (HT) was examined in mice bearing Meth A fibrosarcoma. The tumor Pt levels after ThLip administration were increased in response to HT. The targeting index was approximately 3. The antitumor activity of ThLip + HT, as measured by tumor growth delay or tumor weight inhibition, was larger than that of ThLip without HT or a solution with or without HT. The CDDP dose in ThLip + HT to give equivalent tumor growth delay in solution (40 micrograms/mouse) + HT was about 10 micrograms/mouse, and therefore the targeted drug delivery enhancement ratio was about 4. The ratio correlates with the targeting index. The blood urea nitrogen level, as an indicator of CDDP nephrotoxicity, was increased 7 days after the administration of ThLip (40 micrograms CDDP/mouse) with HT. However, this blood urea nitrogen level rise was independent of the activity enhancement by the liposome. These findings suggest that the HT combined CDDP delivery system using ThLip can decrease the effective CDDP dose, thereby increasing its therapeutic index. 
Contribution of prostaglandins to pressure natriuresis in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. To examine the role of prostaglandins on pressure natriuresis in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rat, the pressure-natriuresis relationships in DS and Dahl salt-resistant (DR) rats were characterized with or without indomethacin (2 mg/kg/h) by utilizing an in vivo renal perfusion study. When untreated, in the DS rat the pressure-natriuresis curve was blunted (P less than .05) and excretion of prostaglandin E2 (38 +/- 11 to 109 +/- 43 pg/min) was decreased in comparison to the DR rat. With indomethacin, the pressure-natriuresis curve in the DR rat was blunted, while no significant changes were observed in the DS rat. Plasma renin activity and concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide were not changed by the treatment of indomethacin in both strains. These results suggest that the decrease in renal prostaglandins, at least in prostaglandin E2, plays some role in blunting pressure natriuresis in DS rat. 
Alterations in hepatic lipids and proteins by chronic ethanol intake: a high-pressure Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic study on alcoholic liver disease in the rat. Using high-pressure Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, alterations of hepatic lipids and proteins in alcoholic liver disease of the rat were examined. FT-IR spectra were obtained from the liver tissues of the rats pair-fed a nutritionally adequate liquid diet and ethanol/dextrose via an implanted intragastric tube for 6 months. The pressure on the liver samples was raised up to 10 kbar, taking FT-IR spectra at regular increments as the pressure was raised. Total lipids measured by the band derived from the stretching mode of carbonyl groups in lipid (v C = O) were increased 4 times in the liver of ethanol-fed rats (E) compared with the pair-fed control rats (C). The frequency of the C = O band of E decreased with increasing pressure, which indicated that hydrogen-bonding was present on the C = O groups of lipids in E. The intensity of the CH stretching bond of the HC = CH groups was 2.8 times higher in E than that in C, which means that there was an increase in the population of unsaturated double bonds in acyl chains of lipids in E. The conformational structure of the protein molecules was slightly changed in E. The reactivity of carboxylate side groups in proteins observed by reaction with Ba++ ions was higher in E than that in C. These infrared spectroscopic results suggest that chronic ethanol intake induces not only an increase in the amount of total lipid but also changes the composition of lipids and the conformation of protein molecules in the liver of rats. 
Mutations of chromosome 5q21 genes in FAP and colorectal cancer patients. Previous studies suggested that one or more genes on chromosome 5q21 are responsible for the inheritance of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Gardner's syndrome (GS), and contribute to tumor development in patients with noninherited forms of colorectal cancer. Two genes on 5q21 that are tightly linked to FAP (MCC and APC) were found to be somatically altered in tumors from sporadic colorectal cancer patients. One of the genes (APC) was also found to be altered by point mutation in the germ line of FAP and GS patients. These data suggest that more than one gene on chromosome 5q21 may contribute to colorectal neoplasia, and that mutations of the APC gene can cause both FAP and GS. The identification of these genes should aid in understanding the pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasia and in the diagnosis and counseling of patients with inherited predispositions to colorectal cancer. 
Failure of vasoldilator infusion to alter pulmonary diffusing capacity in systemic sclerosis. PURPOSE: Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) do not exhibit a normal increase in the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) on assuming the supine position. We sought to determine whether a potent prostacyclin derivative and vasodilator, iloprost, would reverse this defect. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with SSc were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of iloprost. Patients were tested before and during 3 days of iloprost or placebo infusion with both upright and supine pulmonary function studies. RESULTS: The results of baseline pulmonary function studies including DLCO were not significantly altered by iloprost. Furthermore, iloprost did not alter the abnormal postural DLCO response. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the pulmonary vascular defects seen in this group of patients are not a consequence of reversible pulmonary vasospasm. 
Cholecystectomy as a risk factor for colorectal adenomatous polyps and carcinoma. Multiple studies have suggested a possible relationship between prior cholecystectomy and the occurrence of subsequent colorectal carcinoma. This relationship has been particularly noticed among female patients and for right-sided lesions of the colon. In the current study, the authors undertook a case-control study among patients who underwent colonoscopy in three private practices in New York City between April 1986 and March 1988. Over this period, 302 adenomatous polyp cases, 106 colon cancer cases, and 507 controls were interviewed regarding their prior history of cholecystectomy. Overall, no significant association was observed between cholecystectomy and either colorectal adenomatous polyps or cancer. Cholecystectomy does not appear to be a significant risk factor for colorectal neoplasia. 
Role of acid milieu in the gastroprotective and ulcer-healing activity of sucralfate. Sucralfate prevents the formation of acute gastric lesions induced by various ulcerogens and enhances the healing of chronic gastroduodenal ulcerations, but the mechanism of these effects has not been fully explained. This study was designed to determine the importance of intragastric pH in the sucralfate-induced gastroprotection against 100% ethanol, acidified aspirin, taurocholate, or stress, and in the healing of chronic gastroduodenal ulcerations induced by acetic acid. Sucralfate acidified to pH 2.0 showed significantly stronger protective activity against all four irritants, its protective potency against 100% ethanol being about eight times greater and the duration of the protection about four times longer than those obtained with sucralfate at its pH of 5.0. Pretreatment with indomethacin to suppress mucosal generation of prostaglandin or the removal of salivary glands to eliminate the endogenous source of epidermal growth factor failed to affect sucralfate-induced gastroprotection. In contrast, the rate of healing of chronic gastric ulcerations was significantly delayed by indomethacin or sialoadenectomy; but sucralfate enhanced the healing, and a marked inhibition of gastric acid secretion by ranitidine did not eliminate this enhancement. We conclude that the protective activity of sucralfate depends on the presence of acid milieu in the stomach, but that the ulcer-healing effects of this drug occur even after a marked inhibition of gastric acid secretion. 
Causes and correlates of recurrent falls in ambulatory frail elderly. To determine causes and clinical correlates of recurrent falls in ambulatory frail elderly people, we evaluated 70 recurrent fallers and 56 nonfallers (mean age = 87 years) from two long-term care facilities. Evaluations included a detailed history, physical examination, performance-oriented mobility assessment, and laboratory studies. Primary causes including stroke, parkinsonism, blindness, drug-related hypotension, and arthritis were established for the most recent fall in 51 (73%) fallers. Eighteen fallers (26%) had multiple conditions that could not be prioritized for their contribution to the fall. Fallers were more often women, were functionally more impaired, and were taking more medications than nonfallers. Specific diseases did not distinguish fallers from nonfallers. Fallers of both sexes took more steps to turn 360 degrees, could not stand up from a chair without pushing off, had a higher prevalence of antidepressant use, and had impaired position sensation. These easily obtained clinical variables characterized nearly three-quarters of ambulatory elderly nursing home residents with a history of recurrent falls.
