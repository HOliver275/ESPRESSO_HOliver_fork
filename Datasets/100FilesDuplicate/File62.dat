Appendicitis: prospective evaluation with high-resolution CT. Computed tomography (CT) was used to prospectively evaluate 100 patients with clinical indications for acute appendicitis. Examinations were performed with the terminal ileum and cecum filled with contrast material. Acute appendicitis was diagnosed when an abnormal appendix or inflammatory changes plus an appendicolith were detected. Failure to visualize an abnormal appendix or appendicolith in the presence of pericecal inflammatory changes was considered suspicious but nonspecific. CT results were correlated with surgical and pathologic results (74 patients) and other radiologic and clinical findings (26 patients). CT helped to diagnose appendicitis (64 patients) and nonspecific right lower quadrant inflammation (five patients) and to rule out appendicitis (31 patients). CT had a 98% sensitivity, an 83% specificity, and a 93% accuracy. In 17 of 31 patients without CT evidence of appendicitis, other conditions explaining their symptoms were detected. When the clinical diagnosis is in doubt, CT can be used successfully to evaluate patients with acute appendicitis. 
Syndrome of the cervical plexus caused by high cervical nerve root compression. Lesions affecting the roots of the cervical plexus can cause a syndrome not previously described. The C3-C4 disc space is the most likely to be involved, but pressure on the C5 root can also produce facial, auricular, or retroauricular pain. Motor innervation to the diaphragm can be affected, and even the uppermost disc space at C2-C3 might be implicated. Findings on examination findings are sparse, although sensory impairment in areas of cervical plexus innervation has been observed. In a series of 1000 cervical decompression cases (both anterior and posterior) for disc disease or similar processes, only 10 instances of this syndrome have been found. Paresthesia or episodic shock-like pain affecting the ear, para-auricular, lower occipital, and mandibular areas prompted by head turning or extension are the most common complaints. 
Fast short-tau inversion-recovery MR imaging. To enhance the versatility of the short-tau inversion-recovery (STIR) sequences, the authors determined a range of repetition time (TR) and inversion time (TI) combinations that suppress signal intensity from fat by study of both patient and phantom images. To make fast STIR images, variations in the following pulsing conditions were studied with use of an interactive computer program: decreasing the TR, limiting the number of excitations, and limiting the number of phase-encoding steps. The authors found that (a) STIR imaging need not be time consuming, (b) fat suppression can be accomplished at shorter TR by using shorter TI, and (c) short-TR fast STIR imaging is sensitive to enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine. 
Antibody responses to protein, polysaccharide, and phi X174 antigens in the hyperimmunoglobulinemia E (hyper-IgE) syndrome. To investigate whether an underlying defect in antibody (Ab)-forming capacity could contribute to the infection susceptibility of patients with hyper-IgE syndrome, we evaluated 11 such patients for their responses to bacteriophage phi X174 (phi X174), diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and pneumococcal (Pneumovax) and Hemophilus influenzae vaccines. Three of nine patients immunized with phi X174 had normal primary and secondary Ab responses, five had accelerated declines in their titers after initially normal primary Ab responses and lower than normal secondary Ab responses, and two of the latter patients failed to switch normally from IgM to IgG Ab production. Only one of 10 patients tested had normal Ab responses to diphtheria toxoid, and postimmunization antitetanus titers were abnormally low in five of the 10 patients tested. Serum Abs to H. influenzae polyribose phosphate were protective in seven of the eight immunized patients. Five of the nine patients administered Pneumovax had poor Ab responses to at least one of the pneumococcal serotypes 7, 9, or 14. Abnormal antipolysaccharide responses did not correlate with IgG2 deficiency. All patients responded with protective Ab levels to type 3. Thus, patients with hyper-IgE syndrome are heterogeneous with respect to their Ab-forming capacities. Ab deficiency may contribute to infection susceptibility in some of these patients. 
Immunohistochemical expression of galactomannan in the cytoplasm of phagocytic cells during invasive aspergillosis. The monoclonal antibody EB-A1 to galactomannan is apparently specific for detecting Aspergillus species and Penicillium marneffei in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. It reveals hyphae, remnants of filaments, and organisms in the cytoplasm of some phagocytic cells. 
Successful transcatheter embolization of pseudoaneurysm associated with pancreatic pseudocyst. Hemorrhage into a pancreatic pseudocyst is a rare event, but is the most rapidly lethal complication of chronic pancreatitis. Visceral-vessel aneurysms are an unexpectedly common finding in arteriography of patients with chronic pancreatitis. This case report describes bleeding from an anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm, caused by chronic pancreatitis. The aneurysm was successfully treated by embolization with a steel coil. 
Successful operation on a coronary arteriovenous fistula in a 74 year old woman. Coronary arteriovenous fistulas are rare and are usually diagnosed in children or young adults. Most are believed to be congenital. A right coronary arteriovenous fistula was first diagnosed in a patient of 74. Despite her age the fistula was successfully operated on and her symptoms were relieved. 
Antifungal treatment by amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine delays the recovery of normal hematopoietic cells after intensive cytostatic therapy for acute myeloid leukemia. Systemic fungal infections are recognized at increasing frequency during the course of intensive therapy for acute leukemias and require parenteral antifungal treatment mostly by amphotericin B (ampho B) alone or in combination with 5-Fluorocytosine (5-FC). Because of the potential myelosuppressive side effects of 5-FC it was the aim of the current study to evaluate the recovery of hematopoietic cells after intensive antileukemic therapy in patients receiving ampho B and 5-FC treatment for proven or suspected systemic fungal infections. The study population comprised 87 patients who were treated by standard chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at first diagnosis or relapse. Twenty-two patients underwent systemic antifungal therapy consisting of ampho B (3 to 10 mg/kg/d) and 5-FC (150 mg/kg/d) for 3 to 33 days (median, 12 days). The remaining 65 patients served as controls to assess the hematologic recovery time (TR) as defined by the interval between the onset of chemotherapy and the post-treatment rise of granulocyte levels to greater than 500 cmm and thrombocyte levels to greater than 20,000 cmm. In patients receiving antifungal therapy, a significant prolongation of TR was observed with a median TR of 29 days compared with a median TR of 24 days (P = 0.0016) for the control group. No correlation was found between TR and the total dose of either ampho B or 5-FC or the type of antileukemic regimen. A possibly direct myelosuppressive effect of a fungal infection was unlikely to explain the findings because the ampho B/5-FC treatment was started in patients with proven or only suspected fungal infections, causing a similar delay of TR in both groups. The present data strongly suggest a myelosuppressive effect of ampho B/5-FC antifungal treatment in patients after intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemias. 
Postoperative deficits and functional recovery following removal of tumors involving the dominant hemisphere supplementary motor area. The supplementary motor area (SMA) is a region located within each cerebral hemisphere at the posterior mesial border of the frontal lobe adjacent to the falx. The functional significance of this area has been somewhat unclear, and information regarding its influence on motor output has largely been based on evoked responses to direct stimulation in primates and humans. In this series of patients with primary and metastatic tumors involving the dominant hemisphere SMA, a distinct pattern of postoperative deficits and recovery has emerged which emphasizes the role of this critical area in the initiation of motor activity, including speech. Based upon this analysis, ablation of this region after first identifying the primary motor cortex may be accomplished without risk of permanent loss of motor activity or speech function, despite the initial severe deficits. 
A case of photosensitivity and contact allergy to systemic tricyclic drugs, with unusual features. A 43-year-old farmer on tricyclic antidepressive drugs developed a severe photodermatitis with associated liver involvement. The lesions spread to covered areas of the skin, suggesting photoallergy clinically. Patch and photopatch testing revealed photoallergy and contact allergy to clomipramine and contact allergy also to carbamazepine. In addition, the patient had positive patch test reactions to chlorpromazine, balsam of Peru and fragrance-mix, as well as a positive photopatch test to fentichlor. UVA and UVB erythema thresholds were normal. In this patient, an initial episode of photosensitization, probably elicited by clomipramine, was accompanied by contact allergy to this drug and to carbamazepine. The contact sensitivity to clomipramine could also be elicited by oral provocation without UV light. Hypothetically, a photoproduct of clomipramine may have been the original sensitizer, this compound subsequently cross-reacting with clomipramine and, possibly with carbamazepine. 
Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia in von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis. Skeletal lesions are not uncommon in von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis. Most of them are considered to be dysplastic in nature. Association of osteomalacia or rickets with neurofibromatosis has been documented only rarely. Reported herein is a 40-year-old woman with known von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis who presented with bone pain, multiple pseudofractures, marked increase in osteoid by bone biopsy, and hypophosphatemia with renal phosphate wasting. Treatment with oral phosphate and vitamin D was effective. A survey of the literature revealed that 34 similar cases have been reported in the past. Although the exact pathogenetic mechanism remains to be determined, osteomalacia in neurofibromatosis appears to be distinct from more common dysplastic skeletal affections of this disease, being characterized by later onset in adulthood as a rule, renal phosphate loss with hypophosphatemia, multiple pseudofractures in typical cases, and response to treatment with pharmacological dose of vitamin D with or without phosphate supplement. 
Occult metastatic neck disease: detection with US and US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology. The authors performed a prospective study of the value of ultrasonography (US) and US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for assessment of N0 lesions in the neck. Preoperative US was performed in 107 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who underwent 132 elective neck dissections. During the US examination of the last 54 patients, who underwent 70 elective neck dissections, US-guided FNAC was performed. US alone was found to be an unreliable method for detecting occult lymph node metastasis; the accuracy never exceeded 70% (93 of 132), with a sensitivity of 60% (32 of 53) and a specificity of 77% (61 of 79). In contrast, US-guided FNAC had an accuracy of 89% (62 of 70), a sensitivity of 76% (25 of 33), and a specificity of 100% (37 of 37). Because of the high sensitivity and specificity of US-guided FNAC for the assessment of the N0 neck, this modality may play an important role in directing treatment of these patients in the future. 
Impact of temperature elevation on immunologic defenses. Fever is a common response to infection and to other challenges to host defense. Temperature elevation has been associated with effects on the recognition, recruitment, and effector phases of the immune response. Specific immunologic responses are generally enhanced in the setting of temperature elevation within the physiologic range but not the supraphysiologic range. In contrast, natural immune responses may be unchanged or adversely affected. Temperature elevation appears to affect primarily the phase of recognition and sensitization or activation of mononuclear leukocytes. T lymphocyte responses (and/or the interactions of T lymphocytes with monocytes-macrophages) are enhanced for generation of effector cells. The activities of the effector cells, once generated, are usually not enhanced--or may even be depressed--by temperature elevation, but decreases are more than offset by increased T helper function. Overall, the data suggest that temperature elevations of the febrile response constitute a beneficial component of effective host defense. 
Pericardial mass mimicking constrictive pericarditis. Persistent pericardial hematoma due to blunt chest trauma is extremely rare. We report a case of constricted myocardium resulting from a large, partially organized hematoma in the right cardiophrenic angle. The hematoma was assumed to be caused by an occupational accident 17 years before diagnosis. Constriction could only be controlled by complete removal of the fibrous posterior capsule of the hematoma, which covered the epicardium of the right heart. 
Paediatric haemangiomas: the role of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy currently maintains an occasional place in the therapy of complicated haemangiomas of childhood. Eight such childhood benign lesions have been so treated at St Bartholomew's Hospital in the last 10 years. The case histories are presented before being discussed in the context of other therapies available (no treatment, steroids, embolism and surgery), radiation technique used and radiation dose prescription advised. 
Cavoatrial tumor thrombectomy using cardiopulmonary bypass without circulatory arrest. Of 29 patients with inferior vena caval tumor thrombus, 14 with supradiaphragmatic extension were deemed suitable for operation. Patients (age, 7.5 to 70 years) had renal cell carcinoma (n = 8), Wilms' tumor (n = 2), transitional cell carcinoma (n = 1), and adrenal carcinoma (n = 3). Seven patients had stage III disease, and 7 patients had stage IV disease. Two patients (group A) had unresectable disease at exploratory celiotomy, 4 patients (group B) underwent tumor thrombectomy without cardiopulmonary bypass, and cardiopulmonary bypass was employed in 8 patients (group C). Three of 8 group C patients had Budd-Chiari syndrome at diagnosis. Cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia, and inferior vena caval interruption (clip or filter), was employed in all patients. There were no perioperative deaths. Transient neurological impairment was observed postoperatively in 2 patients. Coagulopathy developed in 1 patient who had hepatic encephalopathy and Budd-Chiari syndrome preoperatively and in another patient in whom protamine could not be administered. No patient had acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Median survival is 41 and 17 months in groups B and C, respectively. Some authors have advocated profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest in these patients. We find that satisfactory visualization and excision can be performed with cardiopulmonary bypass and moderate hypothermia, avoiding potential renal, hepatic, neurological, and septic complications associated with circulatory arrest. 
Transplantation after first-stage reconstruction for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The surgical treatment of infants born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome has received considerable attention in recent years. Although this lesion was previously considered uniformly fatal, dramatic successes have been achieved with the use of staged reconstructive and replacement therapies. However, both surgical options have benefits and limitations, and neither has demonstrated clear superiority over the other. As survival for first-stage reconstruction by the Norwood procedure has improved, a greater number of patients are potential candidates for the Fontan operation, but not all will be suitable at an acceptable risk. These patients may be treated by cardiac transplantation. The results of a treatment protocol for 90 patients with classic hypoplastic left heart syndrome or its variants at The University of Michigan are reported, with particular attention given to those patients surviving initial palliation but judged to be unsuitable for a subsequent Fontan procedure. 
Staurosporine facilitates recovery from the basal forebrain-lesion-induced impairment of learning and deficit of cholinergic neuron in rats. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the loss of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert and by a primary loss of memory function. Since staurosporine has been reported to induce differentiation in human neuroblastoma cells in vitro, we studied the effects of staurosporine on the amnesia induced by basal forebrain-lesion in rats. Staurosporine (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneal) attenuated the impaired performance of water maze and passive avoidance tasks, even though the drug administration began 2 weeks after the lesion. Moreover, staurosporine (0.1 mg/kg) partially reversed the decrease of choline acetyltransferase activity in the fronto-parietal cortex induced by basal forebrain-lesion. These results suggest that staurosporine attenuates impairment of learning through reversal of damage to cholinergic neurons induced by basal forebrain-lesion. This evidence indicates that neurotrophic factor-like substances may be used in novel therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer's disease. 
Perioperative total parenteral nutrition in surgical patients. The Veterans Affairs Total Parenteral Nutrition Cooperative Study Group BACKGROUND. We undertook this study to test the hypothesis that perioperative total parenteral nutrition (TPN) decreases the incidence of serious complications after major abdominal or thoracic surgical procedures in malnourished patients. METHODS. We studied 395 malnourished patients (99 percent of them male) who required laparotomy or noncardiac thoracotomy. They were randomly assigned to receive either TPN for 7 to 15 days before surgery and 3 days afterward (the TPN group) or no perioperative TPN (the control group). The patients were monitored for complications for 90 days after surgery. RESULTS. The rates of major complications during the first 30 days after surgery in the two groups were similar (TPN group, 25.5 percent; control group, 24.6 percent), as were the overall 90-day mortality rates (13.4 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively). There were more infectious complications in the TPN group than in the controls (14.1 vs. 6.4 percent; P = 0.01; relative risk, 2.20; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 4.05), but slightly more noninfectious complications in the control group (16.7 vs. 22.2 percent; P = 0.20; relative risk, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 1.13). The increased rate of infections was confined to patients categorized as either borderline or mildly malnourished, according to Subjective Global Assessment or an objective nutritional assessment, and these patients had no demonstrable benefit from TPN. In contrast, severely malnourished patients who received TPN had fewer noninfectious complications than controls (5 vs. 43 percent; P = 0.03; relative risk, 0.12; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.91), with no concomitant increase in infectious complications. CONCLUSIONS. The use of preoperative TPN should be limited to patients who are severely malnourished unless there are other specific indications. 
Consequences of queuing for care at a public hospital emergency department OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the length of a queue at a public hospital emergency department was associated with increased likelihood of patients' leaving without being seen by a physician and whether leaving adversely affected patients' health or affected their subsequent use of health care services. DESIGN: Observational cohort. Patients were surveyed during 1 week in July 1990 and received a follow-up survey 7 to 14 days later. The responses of patients who left without being seen by a physician were compared with those who were seen by a physician. SETTING: Emergency department at San Francisco (Calif) General Hospital. PATIENTS: All English-, Spanish-, and Cantonese-speaking adults waiting for emergency care were eligible. Of 882 eligible individuals, 700 agreed to participate; 85% of enrolled subjects saw a physician and 15% left without being seen. Demographic characteristics of patients who were and who were not seen were not significantly different. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Emergency department waiting time and changes in patients' self-reported health. RESULTS: Patients were more likely to leave as waiting times increased. At follow-up, patients who left without being seen were twice as likely as those who were seen to report that their pain or the seriousness of their problem was worse. Only 4% of patients who left required subsequent hospitalization, but 27% returned to an emergency department. CONCLUSION: Many patients can appropriately decide whether their problem is truly urgent and make alternative plans in the face of long waits, but the health of some patients may be jeopardized by long queues for emergency care. 
The hyperekplexias and their relationship to the normal startle reflex. The startle response to unexpected auditory and somaesthetic stimulation was studied in 8 patients with hereditary or symptomatic hyperekplexia. It was abnormal in its resistance to habituation and in its exaggerated motor response. Both noise and taps to the face and head elicited a normal early blink response, separate from the subsequent true startle reflex. The earliest reflex EMG activity recorded after the blink was in sternocleidomastoid. EMG activity in masseter, and trunk and limb muscles followed later. This pattern of muscle recruitment suggests a brainstem origin for the abnormal startle responses. In addition, the abnormal startle responses exhibited disproportionately long latencies to the intrinsic hand and foot muscles and relatively slow recruitment of caudal muscles. The pattern of muscle recruitment was similar between patients, irrespective of the absolute latency of the response, and regardless of whether stimulation was auditory or somaesthetic. This suggests that auditory and somaesthetic afferents converge on a common brainstem efferent system, and that this system forms the final common pathway for abnormal startle responses of differing latency. The characteristics of this efferent system differ from those previously described in brainstem reticular reflex myoclonus, but are similar to those described in the normal auditory startle reflex in man. This suggests that the abnormal startle response in hyperekplexia, and the normal startle reflex represent pathological and physiological activity in the same brainstem efferent system. 
Four years of North American registry home parenteral nutrition outcome data and their implications for patient management. The OASIS Registry started annual collection of longitudinal data on patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN) in 1984. This report describes outcome profiles on 1594 HPN patients in seven disease categories. Analysis showed clinical outcome was principally a reflection of the underlying diagnosis. Patients with Crohn's disease, ischemic bowel disease, motility disorders, radiation enteritis, and congenital bowel dysfunction all had a fairly long-term clinical outcome, whereas those with active cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had a short-term outcome. The long-term group had a 3-year survival rate of 65 to 80%, they averaged 2.6 complications requiring hospitalization per year, and 49% experienced complete rehabilitation. The short-term group had a mean survival of 6 months; they averaged 4.6 complications per year and about 15% experienced complete rehabilitation. The registry data also indicated HPN was used for 19,700 patients in 1987 with therapy growth averaging about 8% per year. This growth was chiefly from new cancer patients. The number of new patients with long-term disorders in whom HPN was initiated appeared rather constant. We conclude that these clinical outcome assessments justify HPN for long-term patients, but the utility and appropriateness of HPN for the cancer and AIDS patients remains uncertain and requires further study. Medical, social, and fiscal aspects of HPN management in long-term and short-term patients appear to involve quite separate considerations. 
Can decision analysis help in the management of giant hemangioma of the liver? [editorial] We explore the trade-off between the risk and expected benefits from resection of giant liver hemangioma (GLH), one larger than 4 cm in diameter. We searched the English-language literature for studies of the postoperative mortality after resection of GLH and of the outcome of expectantly treated patients. The results of the data synthesis showed an operative mortality of 1.5% (90% confidence intervals, 0.1-3.0%) and an early surgical morbidity of up to 13%. Mortality among the 37 reported cases with ruptured GLH was 78%. There were no cases of spontaneous or traumatic rupture of unresected GLH during a follow-up of a total of 282 patient years. The main source of ambiguity regarding the management of GLH is the uncertain risk of its rupture. Rough estimates of this risk based on published data suggest that surgical resection is not justified in asymptomatic GLH. Yet, although rare, rupture of GLH does occur with disastrous consequences. Future research may attempt to define patient subsets whose GLHs are at higher risk of rupture, and in whom preventive resection may improve survival. 
Evidence of a selective increase in cardiac sympathetic activity in patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias BACKGROUND. Although enhanced efferent cardiac sympathetic nervous activity has been proposed as an important factor in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, direct clinical evidence has been lacking. METHODS. We measured the rates of total and cardiac norepinephrine spillover into the plasma, which reflect respectively overall and cardiac sympathetic nervous activity, in 12 patients who had recovered from a spontaneous, sustained episode of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation outside the hospital 4 to 48 days earlier. The results were compared with those from three age-matched reference groups without a history of ventricular arrhythmias: 12 patients with coronary artery disease, 6 patients with chest pain but normal coronary arteries, and 12 healthy, normal subjects. RESULTS. The patients who had had ventricular arrhythmias had reduced left ventricular ejection fractions, as compared with the patients with coronary artery disease or chest pain (mean [+/- SE], 46 +/- 3 percent vs. 58 +/- 4 percent and 69 +/- 5 percent, respectively; P less than 0.003). The rates of total norepinephrine spillover into the plasma were similar in the three reference groups, but 80 percent higher in the patients with ventricular arrhythmias (P less than 0.005). The rate of cardiac norepinephrine spillover was 450 percent higher in these patients (176 +/- 39 pmol per minute, as compared with 32 +/- 8 pmol per minute in the normal subjects; P less than 0.001), a disproportionate increase relative to the increase in total spillover, which indicated selective activation of the cardiac sympathetic outflow. This increase in cardiac norepinephrine spillover was probably caused by a reduction in left ventricular function. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that in some patients major ventricular arrhythmias are associated with and perhaps caused by sustained and selective cardiac sympathetic activation. We speculate that depressed ventricular function was present before the ventricular arrhythmia occurred, and that this resulted in reflex cardiac sympathetic activation, which in turn contributed to the genesis of the arrhythmia. 
Sebaceous carcinoma: an unusual cause of a rapidly enlarging rhinophyma. We describe a patient who developed sebaceous carcinoma within a long-standing rhinophyma with rapid enlargement of the lesion. We believe the development of this tumour was a random occurrence but the possibility of tumour development should be considered in any rhinophyma showing a rapid increase in size. 
End-stage avascular necrosis of bone in renal transplant patients. The natural history. We report the results of conservative treatment of stage III and stage IV avascular necrosis of bone (AVN) affecting the hip or knee in renal transplant patients. Twenty-nine patients were followed for a mean period of five years. Conservative management was successful in controlling symptoms in 40% of those with AVN of the hip and in 70% of those with AVN of the knee. Knowledge of the natural history of AVN is important because of the long survival times after renal transplantation. 
Sigmoid sinus thrombosis diagnosis by contrasted MRI scanning. Septic thrombosis of the transverse-sigmoid sinuses and the jugular bulb is a highly lethal condition. The presenting signs and symptoms of this disease entity are subtle and not in proportion to the magnitude of the problem. Later in the disease course, sudden fulminant findings appear. A high index of suspicion, combined with scanning techniques of either enhanced MRI or CT, allows prompt diagnosis and treatment. MRI enhanced with gadolinium-DTPA (Gd) is a valuable adjunct that confirms the diagnosis and delineates the extent of suspected pathology. 
Epicardial and endocardial mapping of ventricular tachycardia in patients with myocardial infarction. Is the origin of the tachycardia always subendocardially localized? BACKGROUND. Left ventricular endocardial reentry is the conventional concept underlying surgery for ventricular tachycardia (VT). We assessed the incidences of patterns showing complete reentry circuits at either the subendocardial or subepicardial level and of patterns in which left ventricular endocardial mapping could only in part account for a reentrant mechanism. METHODS AND RESULTS. We retrospectively analyzed epicardial and left ventricular endocardial isochronal maps of 47 VTs induced in 28 patients with chronic myocardial infarction (inferior, 14 patients; anteroseptal, 14 patients). Electrograms were recorded intraoperatively from 128 sites with epicardial sock and transatrial left ventricular endocardial balloon electrode arrays. Given the methodology used in this study, the mapping characteristics of the tachycardias suggested five types of activation patterns: 1) complete (90% or more of VT cycle length) subendocardial reentry circuits in seven VTs (15%) and seven patients (25%), 2) complete subepicardial reentry circuits in four VTs (9%) and four patients (14%), 3) incompletely mapped circuits with a left ventricular endocardial breakthrough preceding the epicardial breakthrough in 25 VTs (53%) and 21 patients (75%), 4) incompletely mapped circuits with a left ventricular epicardial breakthrough preceding the endocardial breakthrough in three VTs (6%) and three patients (11%), and 5) a right ventricular epicardial breakthrough preceding the left ventricular endocardial breakthrough in eight VTs (17%) and seven patients (25%). After surgery, one type 3 VT and three type 5 VTs were reinducible. Thus, left ventricular endocardial reentry substrates (types 1 and 3) accounted for 68% of VTs, but substrates involving subepicardial (types 2 and 4) and deep septal layers (type 5) accounted for 32% of VTs. CONCLUSIONS: In a substantial number of VTs, a substrate localization that is at variance with the conventional concept can be detected by simultaneous epicardial and endocardial mapping and may require modification of the surgical approach conventionally aimed at endocardial layers. 
Williams syndrome: masseter spasm during anaesthesia. A 4-year-old boy with Williams syndrome developed masseter spasm after halothane and suxamethonium. He did not develop malignant hyperthermia; the surgery was accomplished with a nontriggering anaesthetic and no further problems. 
Preherpetic neuralgia. We have encountered six zoster patients whose pain preceded rash by 7 to more than 100 days. Pain was severe, burning, and radicular, and located both in dermatomes different from, as well as in, the area of eventual rash. Two patients ultimately developed disseminated zoster with neurologic complications, one of zoster paresis, and the other, a fatal zoster encephalitis; both had been taking long-term, low-dose steroids. A third case of preherpetic neuralgia developed in a patient with prior metastatic carcinoma, and another case in a patient with an earlier episode of brachial neuritis. The final two cases of preherpetic neuralgia developed in individuals with no underlying disease. An extended period of pain before the onset of zoster rash has gone largely unrecognized. 
Clonorchis-associated cholangiocarcinoma: a report of two cases with unusual manifestations. Two cases of Clonorchis-associated cholangiocarcinoma are described along with their cholangiographic features to illustrate the spectrum of pathology ascribed to the injurious effects of the flukes on the bile duct epithelium. This includes adenomatous hyperplasia, extensive fibrosis, and carcinoma. The first case was also complicated by hepatic abscesses, left hepatic lobar atrophy, gastrobiliary and biliarocutaneous fistulae. The second case features an unusually dilated pancreatic duct containing pancreaticoliths that was found later to consist of hyperplastic bile duct epithelium, presumably carried by worm migration in the biliary tree. Liver sections from both patients showed typical features of hepatic clonorchiasis with the cancer. A knowledge of the wide spectrum of clinical presentation of clonorchiasis, particularly cholangiocarcinoma, might aid Western physicians in averting this serious sequela through prompt eradication of the helminthic infection and early recognition and treatment of its complications. 
Biliary lithotripsy: correlation between gallbladder contractility before treatment and the success of treatment. We perform biliary lithotripsy without adjuvant chemolitholytic agents, and therefore fragment clearance depends solely on the gallbladder's ability to evacuate its contents. We studied 205 patients to determine if gallbladder contractility before biliary lithotripsy is a predictor of treatment results and rate of fragment clearance. Percentage gallbladder contraction was calculated from the fractional difference in the sonographically measured gallbladder volumes before and after a fatty meal. Seventy-six patients (37%) were free of stones and fragments, and 129 patients (63%) had residual fragments at comparable follow-up intervals. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference in gallbladder contractility before biliary lithotripsy between the fragment-free group and the residual-fragment group (p = .008). Stone burden before treatment showed no significant difference between the groups (p = .074), but the number of stones was significantly less in the fragment-free group (p = .022). In the fragment-free group, a poor correlation (r = .047) was found between the percentage gallbladder contraction and the rate of fragment clearance. These data indicate that contractility of the gallbladder before treatment correlates with overall success of biliary lithotripsy but is not a predictor of the speed of fragment clearance. 
Long-term follow-up and prognostic factor analysis in advanced ovarian carcinoma: the Gynecologic Oncology Group experience. Long-term follow-up was obtained on 726 women with advanced ovarian carcinoma (suboptimal stage III and stage IV) who had received primary chemotherapy on two Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocols between 1976 and 1982. The first study compared melphalan alone versus melphalan plus hexamethylmelamine versus cyclophosphamide plus doxorubicin (CA). The second study evaluated the same CA regimen with or without cisplatin. Eligibility for the two studies was the same. At last contact, 76 patients were alive. In a multivariate analysis, cell type other than clear cell or mucinous, cisplatin-based treatment, good performance status, younger age, lower stage, clinically nonmeasurable disease, smaller residual tumor volume, and absence of ascites were favorable characteristics for overall survival (P less than .05). Second-look laparotomy was negative significantly more often among those with endometrioid tumors; there were no negative second-look laparotomies among those with mucinous or clear cell tumors. There were 30 patients with suboptimal stage III disease who had a negative second-look laparotomy; 18 (60%) have experienced recurrence, and 13 (43%) have died. Although cisplatin treatment was beneficial, new treatments are clearly needed. 
Radiolabeled antibody imaging in the management of colorectal cancer. Results of a multicenter clinical study. Presurgical colorectal cancer patients (n = 116) received single intravenous infusions of 1 mg of CYT-103 (OncoScint CR103), an immunoconjugate of monoclonal antibody B72.3, radiolabeled with 111In. Following gamma camera imaging, 103 patients underwent an operative procedure: 92 had primary or recurrent colorectal carcinoma, 1 patient evaluated for recurrence of colorectal cancer had a second primary malignancy (small cell lung), and 10 patients had no demonstrable evidence of malignancy. 111In-CYT-103 immunoscintigraphic findings were consistent with the pathologic diagnoses for 70% of patients with colorectal cancer and 90% of disease-free patients. Antibody imaging contributed to surgical decision making through the detection of occult disease (12% of patients) and the confirmation of localized, potentially resectable disease without regional or metastatic spread. Seven patients (6%) experienced adverse effects, primarily fevers and itching, and 33% of patients developed antibodies to murine immunoglobulin after administration of 111In-CYT-103. The results of this study suggest that 111In-CYT-103 is a useful diagnostic tool for the presurgical evaluation of colorectal cancer patients. 
Management of infected aortoiliac aneurysms. A 30-year retrospective review identified 13 patients treated for infected aneurysms of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries, for an overall incidence of 0.65%. A constellation of clinical findings led to the correct preoperative diagnosis in 11 (85%) of 13 patients. Treatment methods included resection and in situ replacement grafting in seven patients, resection and extra-anatomic bypass in five patients, and resection-ligation in one patient. Four (31%) of 13 patients died within 30 days of operation, three of whom died of rupture. Overall, good results were achieved in five patients (38%), while poor results were noted in the remaining eight patients (62%). The determinants of outcome were aneurysm location or rupture, the presence of established infection, and the virulence of the infecting organism. In 10 (77%) of the 13 aneurysms, Salmonella species, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for all deaths, ruptures, and suprarenal aneurysm infections. These data suggest that patients with primary infections of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries continue to present with advanced infections or aneurysm rupture that result in a high mortality. 
Reduction in the incidence of acute bronchitis by an oral Haemophilus influenzae vaccine in patients with chronic bronchitis in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Following the administration of a standardized questionnaire, 62 adult patients with chronic bronchitis were enrolled into a double-blind controlled trial of an oral killed Haemophilus influenzae vaccine in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. A 3-day course of vaccine or placebo was given monthly for 3 consecutive months. Participants were monitored weekly over 12 months for acute exacerbations; early morning sputum specimens were collected monthly and during acute exacerbations. Density of colonization by H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae was determined by standard quantitative and semiquantitative techniques, and the latter method (quadrant score) was used to determine the density of growth of pneumococci. A total of 30 patients received vaccine and 32 placebo. The incidence rate of acute bronchitis in the vaccine group (0.011 episodes/person-weeks) was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (0.021 episodes/person-weeks), but there was no difference between the two groups in the incidence rates of more severe disease. Vaccine efficacy was maximal at times of peak incidence of disease. There was no evidence of a decline in vaccine efficacy for acute bronchitis over the 12-month follow-up period. The number of viable H. influenzae in the sputum declined in both vaccine and placebo groups over the 12-month follow-up period. The average concentration of H. influenzae in the vaccine group fell below that in the placebo group within 1 to 2 months after first immunization and remained so for 12 months, although the difference between the two groups narrowed during the follow-up period. 
Regenerating nodules in hepatic cirrhosis: MR findings with pathologic correlation. To establish clearly the pathologic basis for small low-intensity nodules seen on MR images of the cirrhotic liver, we obtained MR images in 26 patients with cirrhosis in whom partial hepatectomy for hepatoma (15 patients), laparoscopy for cirrhosis (10 patients), or autopsy (one patient) was subsequently performed. Small low-intensity nodules were seen on gradient-echo images with short TEs (10-13 msec) in 13 of the 26 patients. In 12 of these 13 patients, small low-intensity nodules appeared larger and clearer as the TE was prolonged (14-25 msec). On T2-weighted spin-echo images, small low-intensity nodules were seen in 12 of the 13 patients, but not seen as well as on gradient-echo images. Pathologic correlation in these 13 patients revealed that the nodules on the MR images corresponded to iron deposits in regenerating nodules. Small low-intensity nodules were observed only on T2-weighted spin-echo images in two of the remaining 13 patients, in whom microscopic examination of the liver revealed marked inflammatory cell infiltration in the fibrous septa and no iron deposition. We conclude that small low-intensity nodules observed on MR images are caused by iron deposits in regenerating nodules, and that gradient-echo images with short and prolonged TEs are useful to confirm the presence of iron deposits in regenerating nodules. 
Suture length to wound length ratio and the integrity of midline and lateral paramedian incisions. A total of 349 patients were randomized to undergo laparotomy through a lateral paramedian incision with layered closure (n = 137), a midline incision with mass closure (n = 104) or a midline incision using layered closure (n = 108), endeavouring to close the latter two incisions with a measured suture length to wound length ratio of greater than 4:1. After 18 months follow-up, no patient in the lateral paramedian group had developed an incisional hernia whereas 7 of 104 patients undergoing a midline incision with mass closure and 7 of 108 patients undergoing a midline incision with layered closure had incisional hernias (P less than 0.01). The mean suture length to wound length ratios for the three groups were 2.6 (range 1.3-6.2), 5.0 (range 3.0-8.7) and 3.7 (range 2.0-6.3) respectively (P less than 0.0001). The lateral paramedian incision remains superior to the midline incision closed with the mass technique and its integrity is independent of the suture length to wound length ratio. 
Bilateral coronary ostial stenosis associated with aortitis syndrome. A patient with aortitis syndrome showed severe stenosis of the bilateral coronary ostium. We discuss the coronary angiographic findings and the treatment. 
Spontaneous haematomyelia: a necropsy study. Spontaneous haematomyelia (intramedullary spinal haematoma), is an uncommon event. Predisposing conditions have been reported including syringomyelia, pregnancy and delivery, angioma, spinal artery aneurysm, and haemophilia, but only rarely has a pathological evaluation been performed. Two such cases studied at necropsy are reported. In one case, the haematoma was restricted to the cervical spinal cord, while in the second case it extended from the medulla into the lowest thoracic cord segments. In both cases the haematomyelia was fatal. In the first case the clinical course was subacute, but in the other the course was more acute. Careful neuropathological examination showed no apparent cause for the haemorrhages. 
Cancer occurrence in a cohort of patients surgically treated for peptic ulcer. A cohort of 4107 patients treated surgically for peptic ulcer between 1955 and 1960 was followed up to determine the incidence of cancer by record linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. A total of 930 cases of cancer were observed during 76,634 person-years. Relative risks of cancer were computed by comparison with the recorded cancer incidence in the Danish population. During the first five years after surgery the relative risk of gastric cancer was slightly increased (RR = 1.43), but 5-15 years after the operation the risk was lower than expected (RR = 0.55). Thereafter, the relative risk of gastric cancer increased steadily and increased more than twofold after 25 years. Lung cancer occurred more frequently in the cohort members than expected (RR = 1.66), but the relative risk was independent of time since surgery. Malignancies other than gastric cancer and cancers related to tobacco smoking were close to the expected numbers. The results do not support the findings of a recent British study of similar size in which increased risks were reported for cancer at other sites. 
Interleukin 4 promotes expression of mast cell ICAM-1 antigen. Cell recognition molecules play a crucial role in the regulation of immune cells. We recently found that mast cells (MCs) express leukocyte recognition molecules, including ICAM-1 antigen, a natural ligand of LFA-1. We here report that interleukin 4 (IL-4), a pleiotropic cytokine and mast cell differentiation factor, selectively promotes expression of surface ICAM-1 antigen and ICAM-1 mRNA in human MCs. IL-4 also up-regulates ICAM-1 antigen in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage but has no effect on ICAM-1 antigen expressed on basophils, fibroblasts, or lymphocytes. The increase in expression of mast cell/macrophage ICAM-1 antigen induced by IL-4 may contribute to the accumulation of leukocytes and facilitate cell-contact-dependent regulation of immune cells in inflamed tissues. 
Visual and quantitative analysis of interictal SPECT with technetium-99m-HMPAO in temporal lobe epilepsy. Interictal 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT images were compared to ictal EEG localization in 51 patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy to determine their usefulness for preoperative seizure focus localization. Both quantified temporal lobe asymmetry and blinded visual detection of temporal lobe hypoperfusion were employed. Visual analysis detected ipsilateral hypoperfusion in 18 (39%) of the 46 patients with a unilateral focus and contralateral hypoperfusion in 3. None of the five patients with bitemporal foci had unilateral hypoperfusion. The positive predictive value of unilateral temporal lobe hypoperfusion was 86% (18/21). Quantified anterior temporal lobe asymmetry, greater than a previously derived normal range, correctly identified the focus in 22 (48%) but gave the wrong side in 5, resulting in a predictive value of 81%. The degree of asymmetry correlated inversely with age of seizure onset, but not with other clinical parameters, histology, or verbal and nonverbal memory. The usefulness of interictal 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT for pre-operative seizure focus localization is limited by low sensitivity when performed with a conventional rotating gamma camera. This suggests that ictal or immediate postictal imaging may be necessary for this purpose. 
Appendicitis in cystic fibrosis. Appendicitis is said to be uncommon and difficult to diagnose in cystic fibrosis. The clinical and radiological features in nine patients with cystic fibrosis who had appendicitis were studied. All but one of the patients had an appendiceal abscess at surgery. Four patients had a delay in diagnosis of greater than three days before the correct diagnosis was made. This delay may have been due to a more indolent presentation or because these patients were initially considered to have distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. Appendicitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis if a contrast enema demonstrates extrinsic compression of the caecum. Ultrasound, computed tomography, and gallium scans were found to be of limited help in our series. 
Vitrectomy for premacular fibroplasia. Prognostic factors, long-term follow-up, and time course of visual improvement. Two hundred seventy eyes with premacular fibroplasia consecutively treated by pars plana vitrectomy and membrane peeling were reviewed. This study is among the largest series with long-term follow-up reported to date. Visual improvement of two or more lines was achieved in 43% of eyes at 6 to 12 months, in 54% at 1 to 2 years, in 60% at 2 to 3 years, and in 58% at 3 to 5 years. Overall, complications occurred in 34 eyes (13%). Cataract progression after vitrectomy was noted in 106 (57%) of phakic eyes at 3 to 5 years, and 43 of these eyes underwent subsequent cataract extraction. Mean time to best visual acuity after vitrectomy was slightly less than 1 year for all eyes unless they had cataract worsening with subsequent cataract extraction (1.9 years). Significant factors affecting visual outcome were: preoperative lens status, visual acuity before vitrectomy, duration of preoperative symptoms of distortion and/or blurred vision, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications. 
Retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section: efficacy in disorders other than Meniere's disease. The retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section has evolved as an effective treatment for intractable vertigo of peripheral vestibular origin when hearing preservation is desired. This report studies the efficacy of retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section for control of vertigo due to causes other than Meniere's disease. This report details our experience with 42 patients with a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduced success rate of retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section in these patients is difficult to evaluate, as very few patients have been analyzed with respect to their specific diagnoses. Of patients who underwent retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section for control of vertigo, 23 patients had uncompensated vestibular neuritis and 19 others had a wide range of other diagnoses. For patients with uncompensated vestibular neuritis (n = 23), the physician record noted that 39% of patients were cured and 30% improved. This compares to our series of patients with Meniere's disease (n = 48), where 94% were cured and 2% improved. The true vestibular abnormality may be less reliably identified in patients with uncompensated vestibular neuritis, contributing to the less effective results. Since the development of a vestibular rehabilitation program, retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section for uncompensated vestibular neuritis has been all but abandoned. Retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section appears to achieve a high cure rate in patients with sensorineural hearing loss associated with their vestibular abnormalities. While retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section is helpful for control of vertigo in some diagnoses, a substantial incidence of persistent postoperative dysequilibrium was noted. 
Study of experimental pain measures and nociceptive reflex in chronic pain patients and normal subjects. This study evaluates (i) the effect of heterotopic chronic pain on various experimental pain measures, (ii) the relationship between experimental pain measures and chronic pain symptomatology assessment, and (iii) the influence of the various pain aetiologies on experimental pain measures. Fifty-three chronic pain patients were compared to 17 pain-free subjects with the following psychophysical and physiological indices: pain threshold (PTh), pain tolerance (PTol), verbal estimation of intensity and unpleasantness (intensity scale, IS; unpleasantness scale, US), threshold for intensity and unpleasantness (ITh and UTh), lower limb RIII nociceptive reflex (RIIITh and RIII frequency of occurrence). Chronic pain syndromes included neuropathic pain (n = 12), iodopathic pain (n = 12), myofascial syndromes (n = 9), headache (n = 9), and miscellaneous pain (n = 11). Chronic pain symptomatology was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS), a French MPQ adaptation (QDSA), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger State Trait Inventory (STAI) and Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). No significant difference was observed between chronic pain patients and pain-free control groups and between patient subgroups for PTh, PTol and RIIITh. No significant correlation was found between experimental pain measures and clinical pain, anxiety or depression scores. However, the chronic pain patients had a higher threshold for unpleasantness and judged the suprathreshold stimuli significantly less intense and less unpleasant than the control group. These results are discussed in relation to diffuse noxious inhibitory controls and the adaptation level theory of chronic pain experience. 
Influence of racial origin on admission rates of patients with suspected myocardial infarction in Birmingham. All patients with suspected myocardial infarction admitted to hospital in four Birmingham health districts were studied to test the hypothesis that Asian patients would be overrepresented and Caribbean patients underrepresented compared with the indigenous population. One thousand four hundred and ninety six patients had a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction or severe angina pectoris. The relative risk of admission for Asian men compared with white men aged 45-64 years was 2.65 (95% confidence interval 2.20 to 3.19) and the risk for Asian men was high for both myocardial infarction and ischaemia when analysed separately. The relative risk of admission for Caribbean men compared with white men was 0.53 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.20). The relative risk for Asian women compared with white women in the same age group was 2.58 (95% CI 1.68 to 3.96), but this was due to an excess of admissions diagnosed as ischaemia rather than infarction in the Asian women. For Caribbean and white women the risk of admission was the same, although significantly fewer Caribbean women were admitted with myocardial infarction. The study was undertaken in 1986-87 and population data had to be derived from the 1981 census. The resident population changed in those five years and so the results were recalculated making allowances for these changes in the health districts involved. Based on these data the admission rate for Asian men with suspected myocardial infarction aged 45-64 was nearly twice that for white men (1.8): the relative risk of admission for Asian men compared with white men was 2.04 (95% CI 1.53 to 2.18). 
Biopterin-dependent hyperphenylalaninemia due to deficiency of 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase. We describe the clinical, neurologic, and biochemical findings in 10 patients with 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (6-PTS) deficiency from seven families, all of whom originate from one large tribe in Saudi Arabia. This deficiency presents with severe, early onset of failure to thrive, neurologic deterioration, and morbidity and mortality secondary to repeated episodes of bronchopneumonia or cardiorespiratory abnormalities. The urinary pterin excretion pattern indicates deficient activity of 6-PTS, which has been confirmed by direct enzyme assay in red blood cells of three patients. We treated our patients with combined use of tetrahydrobiopterin 20 mg/kg/d, L-dihydroxyphenylalanine 15 mg/kg/d, carbidopa 3.75 mg/kg/d, and L-5-hydroxytryptophan 5 mg/kg/d. Neurologic findings improved significantly in all after 5 to 24 months. Although head circumference and weight returned to the lower limit of normal in four, height normalized only in one of seven patients. Despite an unrestricted diet during combined therapy, blood phenylalanine and urinary excretion of neopterin and biopterin returned to normal. 
Alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes and alcoholic pancreatitis. Altered frequencies of alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes have been reported in patients with chronic pancreatitis, suggesting a possible genetic basis for individual susceptibility to this disease. Alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes, with particular regard to alcoholic pancreatitis, were studied. Patients with alcoholic pancreatitis were compared with alcoholic control subjects with no history of pancreatic disease. Serum alpha 1 antitrypsin concentrations were raised in pancreatitis patients sampled within one month of an acute attack of pancreatitis, but otherwise values were similar to those of control subjects. There were no significant differences in alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes between alcoholics with pancreatitis and alcoholic control subjects. This study of alpha 1 antitrypsin phenotypes provides no evidence of an inherited susceptibility to alcoholic pancreatitis. 
Percutaneous coronary mid-infra-red laser angioplasty. A pilot study was performed to determine the safety and efficacy of coronary pulsed mid-infra-red laser angioplasty. The laser was coupled with a novel 2.0 mm multifiber catheter consisting of 37 optical fibers of 150 microns each arranged concentrically around a 0.018-inch central lumen and a soft leading tapered distal tip to maintain coaxial alignment and position plaque in front of fibers. The laser was operated at 500 millijoules/pulse, 3.5 Hz, and 250 microseconds/pulse. Twenty-three patients with stenosis or occlusion of the left anterior descending or right coronary artery were selected for laser treatment. In three patients the catheter could not be positioned against the obstruction. In the 20 remaining patients laser angioplasty increased the diameter of the lumen from 0.3 +/- 0.3 mm to 1.4 +/- 0.3 mm and reduced the stenosis from 91 +/- 8% to 57 +/- 10%. In three patients "stand-alone" laser treatment was sufficient. In 17 patients balloon dilatation further reduced the stenosis to 20 +/- 18%. In two patients who had previously undergone unsuccessful balloon angioplasty with high inflation pressure, laser angioplasty allowed subsequent successful dilatation with low inflation pressure. There were no deaths, perforations, dissections, or arrhythmias. One patient had abrupt reclosure 24 hours after the procedure. Spasm occurred in four patients, and six patients had chest sensations during laser emission. Thus mid-infra-red pulsed coronary laser angioplasty is safe and effective for recanalization of stenosed and totally occluded arteries. The efficacy may be sufficient for "stand-alone" laser treatment. The technique may improve the efficacy of balloon angioplasty in cases of unsuccessful primary dilatation. 
Association of hypovolemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage with computed tomographic scan evidence of raised intracranial pressure. Hypovolemic patients are more likely to suffer delayed cerebral ischemia and infarction after a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Prompt recognition and correction of hypovolemia may improve the outcome. We have identified computed tomographic (CT) scan findings that increase the probability of a patient presenting with hypovolemia soon after an SAH. The plasma volume (PV) of 25 patients admitted within 96 hours of an SAH was measured using radioiodinated serum albumin. The normal PVs were measured in an outpatient setting 6 months later or predicted from their total body water. Nine patients (36%) were found to be hypovolemic, defined as a fall in PV exceeding 10% of the normal PV (mean fall, 18 +/- 2%). Sixteen patients were normovolemic or hypervolemic (mean PV, +9 +/- 2%). The basal cisterns were compressed or obliterated on the CT scans of all hypovolemic patients compared with 12.5% of normovolemic patients (chi-square, 14.52; P less than 0.01). The probabilities of a patient being hypovolemic if the CT scan indicated raised intracranial pressure were high: hydrocephalus, P = 0.80; compression of the basal cisterns, P = 0.82; and compression of the basal cisterns associated with intracerebral hematoma or midline shift, P = 1.00. Patients with an SAH and radiological evidence of raised intracranial pressure should be considered at particular risk for systemic hypovolemia. 
Candidal mediastinitis after surgical repair of esophageal perforation. Candidal mediastinitis, like Boerhaave's syndrome, is uncommon, and both, if treated late or incompletely, frequently result in death. Early recognition and aggressive medical and surgical intervention are the best means to convalescence and cure in both conditions. 
Vaginal and vulvar adenosis. An unsuspected side effect of CO2 laser vaporization. During a 15-month period, September 1984 through January 1986, 10 women who were treated in the Section of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, developed vaginal or vulvar adenosis after CO2 laser vaporization. The indications for therapy were condylomata of the cervix, vagina and vulva refractory to conservative management in 3 patients, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia in 3, lichen sclerosus in 1 and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with condylomata on the cervix and vagina in 3. All the patients underwent treatment of the vagina. Most underwent treatment of the cervix, and some underwent treatment of the vulva at various degrees of intensity and depth. During the posttreatment colposcopic follow-up examination, all the patients demonstrated lesions colposcopically consistent with adenosis of the vagina or vulva within the area treated with the CO2 laser. Biopsies of the lesions were performed, adenosis was confirmed histologically, and endometriosis was ruled out histologically. This entity has not been previously associated with CO2 laser vaporization, and its clinical significance is undetermined. Further follow-up is indicated. 
Incidence of ultrasound-detected intrahepatic hematomas due to Tru-cut needle liver biopsy. This is a prospective study in which 120 patients with diffuse liver disease undergoing liver biopsy were followed by serial ultrasounds to determine the incidence of postbiopsy intrahepatic hematoma formation. Forty-five of the patients had a blind biopsy, while the remaining 75 patients had a biopsy performed during laparoscopy. In both groups a 2.0-mm Tru-cut needle was employed. The overall incidence of postbiopsy hematoma formation was 18.3%, with approximately the same results occurring in blind biopsy patients (20%) and laparoscopy-guided biopsy patients (17%). Only two patients had significant pain associated with the hematoma formation (one from each group), one of whom had evidence of intraperitoneal bleed and rebleed. Our results suggest that postbiopsy asymptomatic hematomas occur more frequently than had been generally thought and that laparoscopy-guided biopsy is not safer than blind biopsy. 
Pulmonary dysfunction in surgical conditions of the newborn infant. OBJECTIVE: To describe the pathophysiology of surgical conditions that are associated with respiratory insufficiency in the newborn infant. DESIGN: Survey. SETTING: Newborn ICU in a children's hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-four newborn infants (1 to 28 days old) who required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for operative procedures or postoperative ventilatory support. INTERVENTIONS: Flow-volume curves obtained by manual inflation of the lungs, followed by forced deflation by negative pressure, and by passive expiration, under sedation and pharmacologic paralysis. MEASUREMENTS: Deflation flow-volume curves and passive expiratory curves were measured. Pulmonary function testing before and after bronchodilator administration (n = 11) began midway during the study period. Term and preterm groups served as controls. MAIN RESULTS: Forced vital capacity (FVC) was decreased in all groups with surgical disease as follows: abdominal wall defects and necrotizing enterocolitis groups to 48.3% and 62.1% that of preterm, respectively; pulmonary hypoplasia group to 55.5% that of term (p less than .05). Maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC decreased in all groups: abdominal wall defects and necrotizing enterocolitis group, to 36.8% and 37.9% that of preterm, respectively (p less than .05); pulmonary hypoplasia group, 20.0% that of term (p less than .05). The ratio of maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC divided by FVC was significantly decreased in necrotizing enterocolitis and pulmonary hypoplasia groups compared with that of preterm and term groups, respectively, but not in the abdominal wall defects group. Maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC, but not FVC, increased significantly (36%, p less than .05) after bronchodilator nebulization, indicating the presence of airway reactivity. Respiratory system compliance was decreased significantly (p less than .05) in all surgical disease groups compared with the term group. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchial reactivity contributes to decreased maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC, a feature also seen in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome who later develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Babies who require chronic ventilatory support after operation and who have developed reactive airways may benefit from the administration of bronchodilators during postoperative ventilatory management. 
Azathioprine induced liver disease: nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver and perivenous fibrosis in a patient treated for multiple sclerosis. Azathioprine hepatotoxicity has been described mainly in renal transplant recipients. Most reported cases are related to lesions of the venous system of the liver: peliosis hepatis, veno-occlusive disease of the liver, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. The most common clinical manifestation of these hepatic vascular lesions is portal hypertension. We present a case of nodular regenerative hyperplasia and perivenous fibrosis in a patient receiving azathioprine for multiple sclerosis. Histological abnormalities were similar to those described in renal transplant patients, and azathioprine was the only potential hepatotoxic agent present. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple symmetrical lipomatosis. Multiple symmetrical lipomatosis is a striking clinical finding associated with a variety of peripheral and central nervous system abnormalities. We describe 4 unrelated patients with evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. Multiple symmetrical lipomatosis is an additional, albeit unusual, manifestation of the expanding clinical spectrum of mitochondrial diseases. 
Role of endothelium-derived relaxing factor in regulation of vascular tone and remodeling. Update on humoral regulation of vascular tone. In addition to preserving the permselectivity of the vascular wall and providing an antithrombogenic surface, the vascular endothelium contributes importantly to the regulation of vasomotor tone. Indeed, the endothelium participates in the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II; the enzymatic inactivation of several plasma constituents such as bradykinin, norepinephrine, serotonin, and ADP; and the synthesis and release of vasodilator substances such as prostacyclin and the recently discovered endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). The diffusible EDRF released from the endothelium is nitric oxide or a substance closely related to it such as nitrosothiol. The endothelium also synthesizes and releases vasoconstrictive factors, including products derived from arachidonic acid metabolism and the recently discovered peptide endothelin. An increasing body of evidence from experimental and clinical studies indicates that EDRF and endothelium-derived contracting factors play an important role in vascular physiology and pathology. It has become apparent that the balance of these factors may be a major determinant of systemic and regional hemodynamics. Moreover, through generally opposite effects on growth-related vascular changes, contracting factors such as endothelin and relaxing factors such as EDRF also may be important determinants of the vascular response to injury in various disease states such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. It is clear that the vascular endothelium is a complex and dynamic organ. Understanding endothelium function in normal physiology and disease states is of potential clinical importance and should be the focus of future investigation. 
Comparison of an antiinflammatory dose of ibuprofen, an analgesic dose of ibuprofen, and acetaminophen in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee BACKGROUND. The optimal short-term, symptomatic therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee has not been fully determined. Accordingly, we compared the efficacy of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, ibuprofen, given in either an antiinflammatory dose (high dose) or an analgesic dose (low dose), with that of acetaminophen, a pure analgesic. METHODS. In a randomized, double-blind trial, 184 patients with chronic knee pain due to osteoarthritis were given either 2400 or 1200 mg of ibuprofen per day or 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day. They were evaluated after a washout period of three to seven days before the beginning of the study, and again after four weeks of treatment. The major measures of outcome included scores on the pain and disability scales of the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (range of possible scores, 0 to 3), scores on the visual-analogue scales for pain at rest and pain while walking, the time needed to walk 50 ft (15 m), and the physician's global assessment of the patient's arthritis. RESULTS. Seventy-eight percent of the patients completed four weeks of therapy. No significant differences were noted among the three treatment groups with respect to failure to complete the trial because of noncompliance or adverse events. All three groups had improvement in all major outcome variables, and the groups did not differ significantly in the magnitude of improvement in most variables. The mean improvement (change) in the scores on the pain scale of the Health Assessment Questionnaire was 0.33 with acetaminophen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 0.52), 0.30 with the low dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.09 to 0.51), and 0.35 with the high dose of ibuprofen (95 percent confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.57). Side effects were minor and similar in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS. In short-term, symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, the efficacy of acetaminophen was similar to that of ibuprofen, whether the latter was administered in an analgesic or an antiinflammatory dose. 
Mouse macrophage clones immortalized by retroviruses are functionally heterogeneous. Murine macrophage clones were generated from thymus, spleen, brain, and bone marrow by in vitro immortalization with recombinant retroviruses carrying an avian v-myc oncogene. The cloned cell lines express F4/80 molecules, exert phagocytosis, have nonspecific esterase activity, and express class II molecules after interferon gamma activation. The macrophage clones are diploid and their karyotypes have remained stable for greater than 3 years in culture. After the macrophage clones were activated, their pattern of cytokine production was investigated. Functional heterogeneity in cytokine transcription was demonstrated: one of six liposaccharide-activated macrophages was unable to transcribe interleukin 1 alpha, whereas all of the liposaccharide-activated clones were able to transcribe tumor necrosis factor alpha. Interleukin 6 production was detected in three of six clones. The production of nitrite and tumor necrosis factor alpha as effector molecules of cytotoxicity was detected in all clones, thus showing that a single macrophage can exert more than one cytotoxic mechanism. The results indicate that immortalized and cloned macrophages have a differentially regulated expression of cytokine genes, adding further evidence for the existence of functional heterogeneity among cloned macrophages. This heterogeneity seems to derive from differentiation-related mechanisms rather than from external constraints. 
Does selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract prevent multiple organ failure? An experimental study. Gut bacteria have been incriminated as causing or contributing to generalized sepsis with multiple organ failure in severely ill patients, and selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract of Enterobacteriaceae has been claimed to decrease septic complications in these patients. We studied the effects of selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract on survival and organ function in an experimental model of sepsis with multiple organ failure. Wistar rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with zymosan and randomized into control or treatment groups (trimethoprim or streptomycin sulfate). Selective decontamination effectively prevented bacterial translocation of Enterobacteriaceae. However, only early mortality was decreased, and only so in the streptomycin-treated rats. Selective decontamination did not result in a significantly better condition of the surviving animals on day 12. 
Role of intraoperative ultrasound examination in patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. To determine its potential impact on perioperative surgical management intraoperative ultrasound examination (cross sectional imaging, colour flow mapping, pulsed and continuous wave Doppler) was used in 16 consecutive patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. Epicardial cross sectional imaging before bypass defined the precise intracardiac morphology in 15 of 16 patients. The preoperative morphological diagnosis was refined in four patients (25%), and this influenced surgical management in two (12%). Epicardial studies after bypass identified seven residual haemodynamic lesions in five patients (three residual intercardiac shunts, one ventricular outflow obstruction, one pulmonary artery obstruction, two mitral valve regurgitation), and led to immediate revision during a second period of bypass in three (18%). In one patient who required early reoperation residual shunting was not detected after bypass by either colour flow mapping or a contrast study. Final intraoperative studies showed a good surgical result in 14 patients (87%). Flow characteristics and flow velocities within the Fontan circulation could be assessed immediately after the patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass by means of combined pulsed wave Doppler and colour flow mapping in 14 of the 16 patients. Cross sectional studies of the left heart after bypass showed no change in ventricular function and allowed monitoring of volume replacement and ventricular filling. Intraoperative ultrasound was a valuable monitoring technique in patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. It refined preoperative diagnosis, monitored ventricular function, and identified or excluded residual haemodynamic lesions in most patients. 
Primary cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma presenting as disseminated pagetoid reticulosis. The first case of primary gamma/delta cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) with a fatal outcome is reported. The patient had the clinical and histopathologic features of disseminated pagetoid reticulosis, a rare form of CTCL characterized by a strong epidermotropic lymphoid infiltrate. Extensive immuno-cytochemical studies showed that the neoplastic cells were almost exclusively localized in the epidermis, expressed the gamma/delta variant of the T-cell receptor (CD3+, TCR-delta-1+) and were CD5+, CD7+, CD27+, CD29+, CD43+, CD44+, CD45+, CD45RA+, CD54+, CD69+, but beta F1-, Ti gamma a-, BB3-, A13-, CD2-, CD4-, CD8-, CD11a-, CD49d-, CD25-, CD30-, and HLA-DR-. A comparison of our results with those of the literature, which have not included gamma/delta T-cell receptor analysis, suggests that some reported cases of pagetoid reticulosis may have phenotypes similar to our case. Electron microscopy studies demonstrated that the gamma/delta T lymphocytes were villous, containing dense and multivesicular bodies, and formed close contacts with the surrounding keratinocytes, suggesting that these cells should have a role in the skin-associated lymphoid tissue. The proliferating cells in our case might represent the neoplastic counterpart of the recently reported CD2- subset of normal human peripheral blood gamma/delta T lymphocytes. 
Efficacy of (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine in various models of herpes simplex virus infection in mice. The phosphonylmethoxyalkyl derivative (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine (HPMPC) was evaluated for its in vivo efficacy in several model infections for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) and thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) HSV-1 in mice. In hairless mice infected intracutaneously with HSV-1 or HSV-2, HPMPC completely suppressed all manifestations of the disease (skin lesions, paralysis of the hind legs, and mortality) if it was administered topically at a concentration of as low as 0.1, 0.3, or 1%. Similarly, HPMPC completely suppressed TK- HSV-1 infection in athymic nude mice if it was administered topically at 0.1 or 0.3% or intraperitoneally at 100 or 250 mg/kg/day. HPMPC was also effective against intraperitoneal HSV infection if it was given orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day or higher. In mice inoculated intracerebrally with HSV-2, intraperitoneal HPMPC treatment achieved a significant and dose-dependent protection at doses ranging from 5 to 400 mg/kg/day. The protective effect of HPMPC (at 200 mg/kg/day) was accompanied by a complete inhibition of virus multiplication in the brain. In all models of infections studied, the efficacy of HPMPC proved to be superior to that of acyclovir. The most remarkable feature of HPMPC was that a single administration of the compound, even as late as 4 days after infection, conferred significant protection against HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection. Topical or systemic HPMPC treatment is efficacious in murine models of HSV-1, HSV-2, and TK- HSV infections. 
Total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection. Reports of high mortality and amputation rates following total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection have prompted the use of alternate approaches including local antibiotics, partial resection, in situ revascularization, and graft excision without revascularization. Experience with aortic graft infection was reviewed to establish current morbidity and mortality rates and evaluate our bias in favor of total excision and extra-anatomic bypass. Aortic graft infection was identified in 32 patients, 8 with aortoenteric fistulas. The mean interval between graft placement and infection was 34 months. History of groin exposure (75%) or multiple prior vascular surgery (50%) was common. Clinical signs included fever and/or leukocytosis (23 patients), false aneurysm (9 patients), graft thrombosis (6 patients), groin infection (11 patients), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (6 patients). Microbiologic data, available in 26 patients, demonstrated gram-positive organisms in 15 patients and gram-negative in 9. Multiple organisms were seen in 11 patients. Patients were treated by partial removal with (8 patients) or without (4 patients) revascularization or total removal with (18 patients) or without (2 patients) revascularization. Revascularization was by an extra-anatomic route, either simultaneous or staged. Overall morbidity/mortality was less in the revascularized groups (p = 0.01), while late complications were seen only after partial removal (p less than 0.01). The best results were found after total excision with revascularization. No patient in this group experienced late infection or amputation during a mean follow-up of 34 months (range: 1 to 168 months). Complications after total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection are lower than generally appreciated. This approach should remain the standard to which other approaches are compared. 
Use of life-sustaining care for the elderly. Advanced age has been proposed as one criterion for limiting the use of life-sustaining medical treatment, but very little is known about current practices. We retrospectively studied utilization rates of intensive care (IC) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in admissions to a university hospital over 1 year (n = 9,998), to test whether these treatments are used more selectively for elderly patients. Overall utilization rates did not vary by age. However, among 524 terminal admissions, IC was used for 63% of patients age 35-74 but for only 50% of patients 75 and older (P less than 0.01). Among elderly patients, nursing home residence, diagnosis of advanced malignancy, severe chronic illness, and older age were independent predictors of withholding IC prior to death. Despite more selective use, survival rates were lower for elderly than for younger patients receiving IC (88% vs 78%, P less than 0.001). CPR showed similar but non-significant trends. Intensive care is being used less frequently prior to death for elderly patients, based on diagnosis and functional status as well as chronologic age. 
Paediatric blood pressure and anaesthesia. One percent of children have appreciably and consistently raised arterial blood pressure. A 7-year-old girl admitted for routine tonsillectomy, had unrecognised hypertension which put her at increased risk. Should anaesthetic practice take more note of paediatric blood pressures?. 
Role of intraoperative enteroscopy in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding of small bowel origin. Intraoperative enteroscopy was performed in 12 patients (median age 68 years) with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding probably of small bowel origin, six of whom were men. All the patients were evaluated by routine haematological, coagulation and biochemical profiles, upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies, visceral angiography and/or isotope scanning. All the patients were anaemic. Visceral angiography was useful on three of the 12 occasions on which it was used and isotope scanning was valuable on eight of the 11 occasions it was used. Nine patients had undergone previous laparotomy. Enteroscopy was performed successfully in all cases, with fresh blood and discrete vascular lesions being the chief findings (10 of 12 cases). Segmental resections (n = 8) and local resections (n = 2) were performed in ten patients, with two patients having more than one laparotomy for rebleeding. Five patients developed postoperative complications and there was an operative death and one late death. Three of the ten surviving patients experienced further rebleeding. Intraoperative enteroscopy is now an essential adjunct to laparotomy for gastrointestinal bleeding which has been localized to the small bowel before operation. 
Changes in body composition and energy expenditure after six weeks' growth hormone treatment. Changes in body composition and energy expenditure were assessed in 15 children after six weeks of human growth hormone (hGH) treatment. Body composition measurements were made by stable isotope labelled water (H2(18)O) dilution, bioelectrical impedance, and skinfold thickness techniques. Energy expenditure was assessed both by indirect ventilated hood calorimetry (resting energy expenditure) and the stable isotope doubly labelled water (2H2(18)O) technique (free living daily total energy expenditure). Mean increases in weight of 0.96 kg and fat free mass of 1.37 kg and a mean decrease in fat mass of 0.41 kg were observed. Significant increases both in resting energy expenditure and free living daily energy expenditure were detected. Absolute changes in fat mass and resting energy expenditure were correlated. The data suggest (i) that the increase in the fat free mass is the most significant early clinical measure of hGH response and (ii) that hGH increases the metabolic activity of the fat free mass. Monitoring such changes may be predictive of the efficacy of hGH in promoting growth. 
Gastric leiomyosarcoma. Prognostic factors and surgical management. Information on gastric leiomyosarcoma, such as important prognostic factors, patterns of disease recurrence, and optimal methods of treatment, are derived from limited patient experience. We address these questions, with specific focus on whether an advantage could be demonstrated for radical resection compared with wide local excision, by retrospectively investigating 53 patients who underwent surgical treatment at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. Abdominal pain and/or gastrointestinal bleeding associated with an intramural or exogastric mass were typical features of this disease. Only tumor size and histologic grade were statistically significant prognostic factors. With analysis of survival curves and patterns of recurrence, neither the addition of lymphadenectomy nor the wider tumor-free margins of a radical gastrectomy seemed superior to the more conservative local excision. Therefore, wide local excision remains the preferred treatment when technically feasible. 
Alpha-thalassemia resulting from deletion of regulatory sequences far upstream of the alpha-globin structural genes. We describe an alpha-thalassemia determinant in which alpha-globin expression is silenced by a deletion located 27 kb 5' to the transcription start site of the alpha 2-globin gene. This alpha-thalassemic determinant, (alpha alpha)MM, is a member of a newly described group of thalassemic mutations resulting from deletion of locus-controlling sequences critical to globin gene expression. 
Thrombogenic microballoon for cerebral aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and carotid cavernous fistula occlusion. Preliminary technical note. A thrombogenic microballoon was developed to overcome the problems of cerebral aneurysm rupture during microballoon inflation and incomplete aneurysm obliteration by microballoons with subsequent fatal rupture. These complications occur in about 35% of reported series with current microballoon embolization techniques. The wall of the new thrombogenic microballoon allows 80% aneurysm occlusion by inflation, thus avoiding mechanical rupture, and at the same time it produces a blood clot in the space remaining between the microballoon and the aneurysm wall. This clot undergoes fibrosis with firm adherence of the microballoon to the aneurysm wall. Experimental evidence is presented to support these conclusions. This thrombogenic microballoon system is also applicable to carotid-cavernous fistulas and arteriovenous malformations. 
Technetium-99m-d,1-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) uptake and glutathione content in brain tumors Technetium-d, HMPAO SPECT was performed in 70 patients suffering from intracerebral tumors of various histologic types (glioma n = 30, meningioma n = 19, metastases n = 10, angioma n = 3, neuroma n = 2, lymphoma n = 2, neurocytoma n = 1, epidermoid n = 1, gliosis n = 1, cholesteatoma n = 1). Tumor classification was histologically verified in all subjects except in two cases with inoperable angiomas. SPECT was performed under resting state conditions with a dual-head rotating camera (SIEMENS ZLC 37) following intravenous injection of 18-25 mCi 99mTc-d, 1-HMPAO. Regional tracer deposit was expressed in terms of a cerebellar index (CBI). Significantly higher regional HMPAO uptake was found in meningiomas when compared with gliomas of different malignancy (ANOVA p less than 0.05). Within gliomas, regional uptake increased with malignancy (n.s.). In 23 patients, a total of 32 tumor specimens were obtained for histochemical analysis of glutathione (GSH) content using high-pressure liquid chromatography. A significant correlation (least square method, p less than 0.001) between CBIs and GSH values was found, supporting the hypothesis that GSH is the predominant factor for the conversion of the lipophilic complex to hydrophilic derivates. 
Doxapram after general anaesthesia. Its role in stopping shivering during recovery. A group of patients who developed postoperative shivering after receiving inhalational anaesthesia were assigned, at random, to receive either doxapram or a placebo under double-blind conditions. A significantly higher proportion of patients stopped shivering after being given doxapram than after the placebo. 
A technique for control of hypertrophic scarring in the central region of the face. Various methods are available for applying pressure to the central portion of the face to reduce hypertrophic scarring after burn injury. Our center uses an elastomer insert with a thermoplastic backing, which is formed over a plaster mold of the patient's face. The insert is worn under a traditional anti-burn scar face mask. We reviewed the records of 26 patients with hypertrophic scarring to the central portion of the face to assess the effectiveness of the insert. Seventeen (65%) of these patients wore the insert until scar maturation. Three of these 17 patients later required reconstructive surgery of the central face. Our findings suggest that pressure to this part of the face may be effective in decreasing hypertrophic scar formation. The insert described in this article is inexpensive and relatively easy to fabricate. 
Normal thymus simulating pericardial disease: diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging. Normal enlargement of the thymus in infancy can often lead to erroneous clinical suspicion of cardiomegaly. Roentgenographic differentiation is not always definitive but echocardiography is generally effective in differentiating cardiac pathology from an enlarged thymus. In this patient, magnetic resonance imaging was necessary to differentiate benign thymic hyperplasia from pericardial or mediastinal pathology. Thymic involution with a severe neonatal illness, followed by thymic rebound, which later subsided, added to the interest and initial confusion in this patient. 
Transseptal catheterization in adults: enhanced efficacy and safety by low-volume operators using a "non-standard" technique. Transseptal catheterization is often not performed because of concerns about morbidity and mortality. The authors present several refinements of this technique that have allowed a series of cases to be done with minimal morbidity or mortality. This was possible despite limited previous experience in this technique and a relatively low-volume of cases. 
Association between disturbances in the immune system and hypertension. For many decades evidence has been accumulating which implicates the immune system in the etiology and pathogenesis of hypertension. There appears to be a strong association between hypertension and immunologic dysfunction in humans and in rats. Patients with severe hypertension have significantly higher levels of serum IgG in comparison with normotensive controls. A positive correlation has been found between serum IgG levels and blood pressure in untreated essential hypertensive patients. In some studies it has been demonstrated that autoantibody levels are higher in both untreated and treated hypertensive patients than in normotensive control subjects. Furthermore, in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), several indices of immune system function have been shown to be depressed. There is also a significant correlation between immune intervention and antihypertensive effects. Short term administration of anti-rat thymocyte serum results in a significant decrease in the arterial pressure of the SHR. Chronic cyclophosphamide treatment prevents the progression of hypertension and significantly reduces its final level in the adult SHR. Neonatal thymic implants from normotensive donor rats delay the development of hypertension and significantly attenuate the level of the hypertensive state in the SHR. Also, thymectomy at an age of 4 weeks delays the development of hypertension in the SHR. The differences in the antihypertensive effectiveness of a variety of immunological manipulations in the SHR may be the result of their different levels of improvement on the severity of the autoimmune process in these rats. 
Klebsiella pneumoniae urinary tract infection complicated by endophthalmitis, perinephric abscess, and ecthyma gangrenosum. We have reported the case of an immunocompromised patient with a K pneumoniae bacteremia admitted with endophthalmitis. The source of the infection was an asymptomatic left renal calculus associated with a perinephric abscess. Persistent bacteremia resulted in the development of ecthyma gangrenosum, which has not previously been associated with Klebsiella spp infection. 
DEGR-factor Xa blocks disseminated intravascular coagulation initiated by Escherichia coli without preventing shock or organ damage. One of the aims of research in the area of thrombosis has been to design an effective anticoagulant that would function in a predictable and direct manner. In evaluating the role of coagulation in sepsis we used factor Xa blocked in the active center with [5-(dimethylamino)1-naphthalenesulfonyl]-glutamylglycylarginyl+ ++ chloromethyl ketone (DEGR-Xa). We infused 1 mg/kg of DEGR-Xa together with LD100 concentrations of Escherichia coli (4 x 10(10) organisms/kg) into five baboons. As controls, we infused E coli alone into five baboons. The inflammatory, coagulant, and cell injury responses to E coli of both the treated and control groups were lethal and were similar in every respect except for the complete inhibition of the consumption of fibrinogen in the DEGR-Xa group. The half life of DEGR-Xa was approximately 10 hours and 2 hours, as determined by isotopic and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. These results for the first time demonstrate that, although coagulation occurs in E coli sepsis, fibrin formation per se did not influence the lethal outcome in this model. These results also show the effectiveness of DEGR-Xa as an anticoagulant and raise the possibility that it could serve as an alternative to anticoagulants currently in use. 
Symptomatic pancreatic heterotopia treated by local excision. Non-ulcer dyspepsia is a continuing problem and in many cases a precise cause is never identified. We present five patients with an allegedly uncommon condition--pancreatic heterotopia. They were managed by local excision of the tumour and after a mean (range) follow up of 42 (9-80) months all remain free of the original symptoms. 
Influence of parenteral nutrition on leg nitrogen exchange in injured patients. Body N balance, 3-methylhistidine (MEH) excretion, amino acid (AA) plasma concentration, and fluxes across the leg were investigated both during fasting and during parenteral nutrition of injured patients in order to better understand protein-sparing mechanisms induced by metabolic support in the whole body and in skeletal muscle. Patients were randomized to receive 15 or 30 kcal/kg.day coupled with 0.30 g of N either with standard or branch-chain (BC)-enriched AA solutions. During fasting, patients were highly catabolic (N balance -14.7 +/- 1.2 g N/m2.day, MEH excretion 422 +/- 25 mumol/m2.day) and showed a high efflux of AA N from the leg (5.08 +/- 2.1 g N/m2.day) without difference between the groups. During treatment, body N balance (-5.55 +/- 0.88, p less than .001) and MEH excretion (284 +/- 20, p less than .001) were significantly reduced without difference among the groups; also, AA N leg efflux (2.64 +/- 0.47, p less than .001) was reduced. Moreover, considering the effect of calorie load, patients receiving 30 kcal/kg.day showed a lower efflux of total AA N and of some AA considered as markers of muscle protein catabolism, such as phe, lys, met, and glu. The main difference between solutions was in the efflux of BCAA; particularly, val and leu efflux was turned into uptake in the BCAA group. No significant difference among the groups was found in N balance and MEH excretion during treatment. In brief, muscle catabolism was reduced in an amount dependent on glucose and insulin load, but it was not influenced by BCAA supply. Whole body net protein catabolism was reduced through different mechanisms, either an increased visceral N retention or a decreased muscle N loss. However, muscle N loss was never abolished even in the high calorie groups. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of temporomandibular joint after surgical treatment of internal derangement. Sagittal and coronal surface coil magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 21 patients who about 2 years earlier had surgery for temporomandibular joint internal derangement. Surgical procedure included disk repositioning (23 joints) and diskectomy (seven joints). At the time of reimaging, 20 joints showed recurrence of pain and 10 joints were asymptomatic. Extensive fibrous tissue was seen in the joint space and in the joint capsule in 13 of the 20 painful joints, whereas minimal fibrous tissue in the lateral capsule wall was seen in 3 of the 10 nonpainful joints. Fibrous tissue was surgically confirmed in 10 of the painful joints. Disk displacement was seen in 11 of the 23 joints that had surgical disk repositioning. Disk displacement was seen in both painful (9/17) and nonpainful joints (2/6). It was concluded that magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent method for postoperative imaging of the temporomandibular joint and that attention should be directed to the presence or absence and extension of the fibrous tissue in the joint space and in the joint capsule. 
Post-laryngectomy stomal recurrence: tumour implantation or paratracheal lymphatic metastasis? In the treatment of obstructing laryngeal cancer, an association has often been noted between emergency tracheotomy for airway relief and subsequent post-laryngectomy stomal recurrence. It is however unclear whether this is due to tumour implantation in the tracheotomy track, or paratracheal lymph node metastasis. To investigate the pathophysiology of stomal recurrence, the recurrence rate and clinical outcome of 26 cases of T3N0M0 glottic cancer treated with emergency tracheotomy and subsequent laryngectomy were analysed, and compared with 65 stage-matched cases treated with laryngectomy alone. Analysis shows the 'emergency tracheotomy' group to have a very poor prognosis with a higher incidence of recurrence at the stoma, and also in the regional lymph nodes. These findings suggest that paratracheal lymph node metastasis is an important mechanism in the development of stomal recurrence and thus has considerable implications for the prevention of such a recurrence following laryngectomy in the patient presenting with malignant airway obstruction. 
Ventricular tachycardia with congenital ventricular diverticulum. A 24-year-old man presented with symptomatic, recurrent, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). He was found to have a basal inferior left ventricular diverticulum. His sustained VT was reproduced by programmed electrical stimulation and was unresponsive to procainamide, tocainide, propafenone, and flecainide. Endocardial mapping followed by resection and cryoablative surgery was performed. The patient had only one recurrence after 18 months, with subsequent control with procainamide for over 14 months. 
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies in childhood. I. Biochemical and morphologic investigations. During a 4-year period (1984 to 1988), 50 children referred with manifestations of central nervous system or neuromuscular disease combined with hyperlactatemia were subjected to investigations that aimed to identify and characterize children with mitochondrial disorders. Biochemical and morphologic investigations of quadriceps muscle biopsy tissue were done, including oximetric and spectrophotometric analysis of the respiratory chain function, enzyme histochemistry, electron microscopy, and analysis of mitochondrial DNA. A diagnosis of mitochondrial disease was based on the presence of at least two of five criteria: (1) abnormal results of oximetry, (2) abnormal results of spectrophotometry, (3) enzyme histochemical evidence of cytochrome x oxidase deficiency, (4) deletions or point mutations of mitochondrial DNA, and (5) abundant ultrastructurally abnormal mitochondria. With the combined biochemical and morphologic investigation, 20 of the children were found to have mitochondrial disorders. In an additional 10 children a mitochondrial disorder was neither excluded nor verified. Mitochondrial disorders are thus an important cause of central nervous system and neuromuscular disease in children with hyperlactatemia. 
Predicting the outcomes of electrophysiologic studies of patients with unexplained syncope: preliminary validation of a derived model. PURPOSE: To develop and validate a predictive model that would allow clinicians to determine whether an electrophysiologic (EP) study is likely to result in useful diagnostic information for a patient who has unexplained syncope. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-nine consecutive patients with unexplained syncope who underwent EP studies at two university medical centers comprised the training sample. A test sample to validate the model was made up of 138 patients from the clinical literature who had undergone EP studies for syncope. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing EP studies for syncope. The data collector was blinded to the study hypothesis; the electrophysiologist assessing outcomes was blinded to clinical and historical data. Clinical predictor variables available from the history, the physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), and Holter monitoring were analyzed via two multivariable predictive modeling strategies (ordinal logistic regression and recursive partitioning) for their abilities to predict the results of EP studies, namely tachyarrhythmic and bradyarrhythmic outcomes. These categories were further divided into full arrhythmia and borderline arrhythmia groups. RESULTS: Important outcomes were 1) sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 2) bradyarrhythmias, including sinus node and atrioventricular (AV) conducting disease. The results of the logistic regression (in this study, the superior strategy) showed that the presence of organic heart disease [odds ratio (OR) = 3.0, p less than 0.001] and frequent premature ventricular contractions on ECG (OR = 6.7, p less than 0.004) were associated with VT, while the following abnormal ECG findings were associated with bradyarrhythmias: first-degree heart block (OR = 7.9, p less than 0.001), bundle-branch block (OR = 3.0, p less than 0.02), and sinus bradycardia (OR = 3.5, p less than 0.03). Eighty-seven percent of the 31 patients with important outcomes at EP study had at least one of these clinical risk factors, while 95% of the patients with none of these risk factors had normal or nondiagnostic EP studies. In the validation sample, the presence of one or more risk factors would have correctly identified 88% of the test VT patients and 65% of the test bradyarrhythmia patients as needing EP study. CONCLUSION: These five identified predictive factors, available from the history, the physical examination, and the initial ECG, could be useful to clinicians in selecting those patients with unexplained syncope who will have a serious arrhythmia identified by EP studies. 
Stress erosive gastritis. Bleeding from stress erosive gastritis continues to be a potential problem in critically ill and injured patients, but fortunately its incidence has decreased dramatically over the last decade. The explanation for this circumstance is probably multifactorial, but clearly relates to our increased knowledge of its pathophysiology. This understanding has led to the routine use of measures to reduce intragastric acidity (luminal acid being a prerequisite for stress ulcer to occur), coupled with improved techniques for the treatment of shock and the accompanying gastric mucosal hypoperfusion (another prerequisite for the formation of stress ulcers). A number of measures have been used to lower intragastric acidity with H2 receptor blockers emerging as the agents of choice to accomplish this goal. In the unlikely event that bleeding occurs despite these prophylactic measures, aggressive medical management will result in cessation of hemorrhage in over 80% of patients. In those few individuals requiring surgery to control bleeding, no operation has emerged as the recognized procedure of choice. Thus, we believe that a conservative operative approach is indicated in this setting and recommend vagotomy and pyloroplasty with oversewing of the bleeding erosions as appropriate therapy for most patients requiring surgical intervention. 
First-pass nuclear magnetic resonance imaging studies using gadolinium-DTPA in patients with coronary artery disease. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging has been shown to accurately portray cardiac anatomy and function. To investigate the potential of NMR imaging for the assessment of coronary stenosis in patients with chest pain, ultrafast NMR imaging in conjunction with a T1 (longitudinal relaxation time) contrast agent was performed in 17 patients with chest pain who had undergone cardiac catheterization. These included 12 patients with significant coronary artery stenoses and 4 who underwent repeat NMR study after myocardial revascularization. Cardiac images at rest were obtained during rapid intravenous injection of gadolinium-DTPA (0.04 mM/kg). Electrocardiographic-gated images were acquired over 380 ms, with repetitive images obtained every 3 to 4 s. After contrast injection, there was pronounced signal enhancement in the right ventricular cavity, followed by enhancement in the left ventricular cavity and myocardium. Regional myocardium perfused by a diseased vessel demonstrated a lower peak signal intensity (p = 0.001) and lower rate of signal increase (p = 0.001) than did myocardium perfused by coronary arteries without stenosis. Repeat NMR study after revascularization showed an increase in peak signal intensity (p less than 0.002). These results demonstrate the clinical potential of dynamic gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced NMR imaging for the assessment of coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain. In combination with anatomic and functional NMR imaging, this technique has the potential to provide a comprehensive noninvasive cardiac evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. 
Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide in young normotensive subjects with a family history of hypertension and in young hypertensive patients. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) behavior was evaluated in 26 untreated essential hypertensives, 21 normotensives, and 20 normotensives with hypertensive heredity under normal sodium intake (120 mEq of Na+/day). All subjects were men, mean age 22.1 +/- 1.9 years. Plasma ANP was evaluated by radioimmunoassay on samples collected in supine position upon waking and again after 1 h of orthostatism. Resulting data showed that ANP in hypertensives (supine = 44.5 +/- 19.4 pg/mL, orthostatism = 24.1 +/- 11.6 pg/mL) was at higher levels than in controls (supine = 38.3 +/- 19.4 pg/mL, orthostatism = 19.9 +/- 10.6 pg/mL) or in normotensives with hypertensive heredity (supine = 42.1 +/- 16.8 pg/mL, orthostatism = 23.2 +/- 10.8 pg/mL). Mean ANP level was higher in the latter group than in the control group (supine = +9%; orthostatism = +14.2%). In conclusion, plasma ANP is raised in young essential hypertensives, resulting in slightly elevated levels in normotensives with hypertensive heredity. 
Birthweight ratio revisited. In order to test the hypothesis suggested in a recent report that the birthweight ratio might be a useful predictor of several important clinical outcome measures in babies of less than 31 weeks' gestation, we examined the association between the birthweight ratio and aspects of both short and long term outcome in 436 Leeds babies of less than 31 weeks' gestation. Unlike the report, and contrary to what we had expected, we were unable to find any significant association between birthweight ratio and length of time on the ventilator, mortality, neurological outcome, or intellectual outcome. 
Dideoxyinosine in children with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection. BACKGROUND. 2',3'-Dideoxyinosine (ddl) is a dideoxynucleoside with potent activity in vitro against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In initial clinical trials in adults, ddl showed evidence of antiretroviral activity with little hematologic toxicity. METHODS. We conducted a phase I-II study in 43 children with symptomatic (CDC class P-2) HIV infection. Of these children, 16 (median age, 10 years) had previously received zidovudine, and 27 (median age, 2.6 years) had not. ddl was administered orally in three divided doses totalling 60, 120, 180, 360, or 540 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for 24 weeks. Eight of the 43 patients did not complete 24 weeks of ddl: 6 died, 1 was withdrawn because of progressive disease, and the other because of toxicity. RESULTS. After oral administration, ddl was rapidly absorbed, although its bioavailability varied greatly among patients. Pancreatitis developed in two children, one receiving ddl at each of the two highest doses. The median CD4 cell count in 38 patients with paired counts increased from 0.218 x 10(9) per liter (218 per cubic millimeter) at base line to 0.327 x 10(9) per liter (327 per cubic millimeter) after 20 to 24 weeks (P = 0.001). Those with CD4 cell counts above 0.1 x 10(9) per liter (100 per cubic millimeter) at base line were significantly more likely to improve in this respect. The median levels of p24 antigen (in 27 patients with detectable levels at entry) declined from 272 pg per milliliter at base line to 77 pg per milliliter at 20 to 24 weeks (P = 0.005). The plasma concentration of ddl correlated significantly with both the degree of decline in the p24 antigen and the degree of improvement in IQ score. Improvement in clinical and immunologic measures occurred in both the previously untreated patients and in those who had been treated with zidovudine. CONCLUSIONS. Dideoxyinosine was well tolerated and showed promising antiretroviral activity in HIV-infected children. The correlation between the clinical response and the plasma concentration of ddl indicates that bioavailability is an important consideration in the use of ddl to treat HIV infection and that individualized pharmacokinetic monitoring and dose adjustment may be important for optimal activity. 
Dietary risk factors associated with acute and persistent diarrhea in children in Karachi, Pakistan. Feeding practices may have an important impact on diarrheal diseases in developing countries. This study evaluated feeding practices in three groups of male children aged 6-36 mo: 100 with persistent diarrhea (PD), 79 with acute diarrhea (AD), and 86 in a comparison group (CG). The children came from comparably poor socioeconomic settings in Karachi, Pakistan, except that the literacy rates were higher in mothers of the CG (P = 0.0001). Although greater than 95% of all infants were breast-fed, delayed initiation of breast-feeding was more common in the diarrhea groups. Children with diarrhea were also more likely to receive supplemental milk (PD = 92%, AD = 87%) than were children in the CG (69%, P less than 0.05). Feedings were not withheld during diarrhea but changes were made in the nature of foods given. These results indicate that several feeding practices may be important risk factors for diarrhea in Pakistan. 
Optic nerve sheath decompression for the treatment of progressive nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy. We performed optic nerve sheath decompression on four patients (five eyes) with visual loss secondary to nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Four of the five eyes had marked improvement in visual function after the operation. Optic nerve sheath decompression is an effective treatment for patients with nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy and progressive visual loss. 
Resection of a granular cell tumor at the hepatic confluence. A precarious location for a benign tumor. Granular cell tumors are lesions that account for less than 10 per cent of benign biliary tumors and only 1 per cent occur in the biliary tract. Since the first description, 45 other cases have been described to which we add a case. In reviewing the literature, a striking predominance in black females is evident. The most frequent location of these tumors in the biliary tree appears to be the common bile duct (50%), followed by the cystic duct (37%), the hepatic ducts (15%), and the gallbladder (4%). Most patients have been treated with resection followed by restoration of biliary continuity using biliary enteric diversion. In the case presented, the tumor was located at the hepatic confluence with extension into the hepatic substance requiring segmental duct cholangiojejunostomy after resection. This resulted in fulminant sepsis and death despite adequate preoperative biliary decompression and the lack of signs or symptoms of infected bile. Alternative forms of management in the treatment of this benign condition at this location are discussed. 
Advantages of an immunohistochemical estrogen receptor assay. Immunohistochemical and biochemical assays for estrogen and progesterone receptors were done on 20 breast carcinomas, and results were correlated with various histologic features. The slide-based immunohistochemical technique demonstrated several distinct advantages relative to the tissue homogenization required by the traditional biochemical assay. With the use of frozen tissue sections, the immunohistochemical technique permitted direct visualization of antireceptor binding to tumor cells. Receptor staining of reactive stroma, necrotic tumor, and intermingled benign parenchyma was easily distinguished from receptor staining of the actual carcinoma. This separation is not possible with the biochemical assay. In addition, in situ and invasive components and different morphologic subtypes were evaluated independently. Receptor content of the most aggressive portion of the neoplasm is likely to have the greatest clinical relevance and prognostic significance. Careful correlation of histochemical scores with biochemical assay concentrations is needed to permit the application of this technique to patients entering cancer treatment protocols. 
Use of adenosine echocardiography for diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Two-dimensional echocardiography combined with exercise is sensitive and specific in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) by demonstrating transient abnormalities in wall motion. Frequently, however, patients cannot achieve maximal exercise because of various factors. Pharmacologic stress testing with intravenous adenosine was evaluated as a means of detecting CAD in a noninvasive manner. Patients with suspected CAD underwent echocardiographic imaging and simultaneous thallium 201 single-photon emission computed tomography during the intravenous administration of 140 micrograms/kg/min of adenosine. An increase in heart rate, decrease in blood pressure, and increase in double product were observed during adenosine administration. Initial observations revealed that wall motion abnormalities were induced by adenosine in areas of perfusion defects. The adenosine infusion was well tolerated, and symptoms disappeared within 1 to 2 minutes after termination of the infusion. Therefore preliminary observations suggest that adenosine echocardiography appears to be useful in the assessment of CAD. 
Treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts with octreotide. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common and painful complication of chronic pancreatitis. Seven patients (six male, one female; mean age 49.9 years) with chronic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocysts and persistent pain were treated with the pancreatic anti-secretory drug octreotide for 2 weeks. Octreotide caused no notable changes in the size of the pseudocysts of three patients. In the remaining four patients, the pseudocysts decreased in size by a mean of 42% (range 29-52%), and pain disappeared completely. These findings suggest a role for octreotide in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts. 
An open label study of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain. Ten patients with advanced cancer and breakthrough pain between the ages of 39 and 78 received oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (10-15 micrograms/kg) 4 or 5 times each over 2 days (42 total administrations) in an open study. Baseline vital sign and rating scale results did not vary over administrations, except for heart rate which showed an 8 beats/min decrease over 4 administrations. Heart rate and oxygen saturation did not vary significantly over 120 min of evaluation, and minimal changes in blood pressure and respiration rate were found. Significant reduction in pain scores as measured by a pain descriptive scale, the McGill-Melzack scale, and a numeric (VAS) scale were seen at all evaluations from 5 to 120 min. Average time to onset of pain relief was 9.5 min after administration. Wellbeing was significantly increased at all evaluations. Activity level as recorded by the investigator was significantly reduced from 10 to 30 min after administration, however, activity level as reported by the patient was significantly increased at 5 min and from 60 to 120 min after OTFC administration. There were no significant adverse effects. 
Influence of calcium administration on the short-term hemodynamic and anti-ischemic effects of nifedipine. This prospective study investigated whether pretreatment with intravenously administered calcium would influence the effect of nifedipine on rest hemodynamics and treadmill performance in patients with ischemic heart disease. Seventeen patients were studied after undergoing a qualifying treadmill exercise test that revealed ST segment depression indicative of ischemic heart disease. Study subjects performed three additional treadmill tests as part of the protocol. One treadmill test was obtained from each patient to provide baseline measurements without a preceding intravenous infusion and in the absence of all antianginal drugs including nifedipine; two additional exercise tests were preceded by an infusion and 10 mg of bite-and-swallow nifedipine. The infusions, administered in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion, consisted of either 10 ml of 10% calcium chloride (13.6 mEq) in 50 ml of 5% dextrose in water or 5% dextrose in water alone. Rest systolic blood pressure (134 +/- 4.6 mm Hg) was unchanged after placebo infusion (135 +/- 4.6 mm Hg) but decreased to 124 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) 25 min after nifedipine administration. Rest systolic blood pressure increased after calcium infusion (from 139 +/- 4.3 to 148 +/- 4.8 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and then decreased significantly 25 min after nifedipine administration to 135 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Despite a decrease at the time of peak nifedipine effect after either infusion, systolic blood pressure was significantly lower after administration of nifedipine alone than after administration of calcium and nifedipine (124 +/- 4.1 vs. 135 +/- 4.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). 
Neurophysiologic assessment of the anal sphincters. One hundred twenty consecutive patients with either fecal incontinence (60 patients), chronic constipation (41 patients), or idiopathic intractable pelvic pain (19 patients) were prospectively assessed. Patients underwent concentric needle electromyography (EMG), bilateral pudendal nerve terminal motor latency evaluation, anorectal manometry, and cinedefecography. The most common EMG finding in patients with fecal incontinence was decreased recruitment of motor units with squeezing and polyphasic motor unit potentials; these are consistent with an injury pattern. The most common EMG finding in the constipated patients was paradoxical puborectalis contraction. This latter abnormality was also a frequent finding in patients with rectal pain, as was prolongation of pudendal nerve latency. Paradoxical puborectalis contraction was diagnosed more frequently with EMG than with cinedefecography. Inter-examination correlation was best in the incontinent group between EMG and manometry. Cinedefecography had poor correlation with EMG in all patient groups but was valuable in the detection of additional pathology such as rectoanal intussusception and anterior rectocele. Electromyography including pudendal nerve terminal motor latency assessment is a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of disorders of evacuation. The information it yields is complementary to that offered by more routine physiologic examinations. 
Prenatal diagnosis of the neurofibromatoses. This article reviews the application of genetic linkage analysis to molecular prenatal diagnosis using the neurofibromatoses as an example. The clinical manifestations and diagnostic criteria for these diseases are reviewed first, followed by a brief description of the principles underlying genetic linkage analysis, the detection of DNA polymorphisms and their application to the cloning of the NF1 gene. The last two sections review the molecular diagnosis and some of the problems in prenatal genetic counseling for NF1. 
Ventriculoatrial intervals during narrow complex reentrant tachycardia in children. Ventriculoatrial (VA) intervals during narrow complex tachycardia were measured in a pediatric population. The VA intervals were similar to those in adults but were slightly shorter. In the pediatric subjects values less than 60 msec excluded the participation of an accessory pathway in the tachycardia circuit. Three out of 11 patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) had VA values greater than or equal to 70 msec, while 5 of 28 patients with orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia (ORT) had values less than or equal to 70 msec. Using a cut-off value of 70 msec as the sole criteria to distinguish between ORT and AVNRT could lead to errors in classification of the underlying mechanism of the tachycardia. 
A familial coincidence of pseudotumor cerebri and communicating hydrocephalus. A family in which the mother and two of four daughters had a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri and one son developed communicating hydrocephalus is described. The other two daughters both have a long history of headaches but no signs of intracranial hypertension. The argument is advanced that there exists a defect of cerebrospinal fluid absorption common to pseudotumor cerebri and communicating hydrocephalus. 
Physical activity and reduced occurrence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus BACKGROUND. Physical activity is recommended by physicians to patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), because it increases sensitivity to insulin. Whether physical activity is effective in preventing this disease is not known. METHODS. We used questionnaires to examine patterns of physical activity and other personal characteristics in relation to the subsequent development of NIDDM in 5990 male alumni of the University of Pennsylvania. The disease developed in a total of 202 men during 98,524 man-years of follow-up from 1962 to 1976. RESULTS. Leisure-time physical activity, expressed in kilocalories expended per week in walking, stair climbing, and sports, was inversely related to the development of NIDDM. The incidence rates declined as energy expenditure increased from less than 500 kcal to 3500 kcal. For each 500-kcal increment in energy expenditure, the age-adjusted risk of NIDDM was reduced by 6 percent (relative risk, 0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 0.98). This association remained the same when the data were adjusted for obesity, hypertension, and a parental history of diabetes. The association was weaker when we considered weight gain between the time of college attendance and 1962 (relative risk, 0.95; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.00). The protective effect of physical activity was strongest in persons at highest risk for NIDDM, defined as those with a high body-mass index, a history of hypertension, or a parental history of diabetes. These factors, in addition to weight gain since college, were also independent predictors of the disease. CONCLUSIONS. Increased physical activity is effective in preventing NIDDM, and the protective benefit is especially pronounced in persons at the highest risk for the disease. 
Isolation of a human DNA sequence which spans the fragile X. To identify the sequences involved in the expression of the fragile X and to characterize the molecular basis of the genetic lesion, we have constructed yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing human DNA and have screened them with cloned DNA probes which map close to the fragile site at Xq27.3. We have isolated and partly characterized a YAC containing approximately 270 kb of human DNA from an X chromosome which expresses the fragile X. This sequence in a yeast artificial ring chromosome, XTY26, hybridizes to the two closest DNA markers, VK16 and Do33, which flank the fragile site. The human DNA sequence in XTY26 also spans the fragile site on chromosome in situ hybridization. When a restriction map of XTY26, derived by using infrequently cutting restriction enzymes, is compared with similar YAC maps derived from non-fragile-X patients, no large-scale differences are observed. This YAC, XTY26, may enable (a) the fragile site to be fully characterized at the molecular level and (b) the pathogenetic basis of the fragile-X syndrome to be determined. 
Hepatitis C virus infection and chronic liver disease in children with leukemia in long-term remission. Antibody to the recently identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) was investigated in sera of 50 leukemic children who had chronic liver disease (CLD), observed for 1 to 12.6 years after therapy withdrawal. All patients were tested for anti-HCV at regular intervals: Ortho-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was performed in all cases. Reactive sera were also tested by recombinant immunoblotting assay to define the specificity of the results obtained by ELISA. Twelve cases (24%) were persistently positive (group A), 11 (22%) were transiently anti-HCV+ positive (group B), and 27 (54%) were negative. Mean SGPT peak during follow-up was significantly higher in group A (P = .014, A v B and P less than .00001, A v C). SGPT normalized off-therapy in 1 of 12 cases (group A), 10 of 11 (group B), and 19 of 27 (group C) (P = .0004, A v B and P = .012, A v C). Accordingly, liver histology, available in 37 patients, showed signs of chronic hepatitis in all patients in group A while most patients in group B and C had less severe liver lesions. These results indicate that HCV plays a significant role in the etiology of chronic hepatitis in leukemic patients and that persistent anti-HCV activity correlates with a more severe CLD, which could jeopardize the final prognosis of children cured of leukemia. 
Antihypertensive effect of isradipine on blood pressure at rest and during exercise. After three months of treatment with isradipine, 20 patients with mild hypertension had reduced their resting blood pressure (BP) from 157/103 to 132/85 mm Hg and their BP during isometric exercise from 192/124 to 166/105 mm Hg. The isradipine dose necessary to normalize BP (both at rest and post-exercise) was 1.25 mg twice daily (2 x 1/2 tablet) in 50% of patients and 2.5 mg twice daily (2 x 1 tablet) in 25%. In the remaining 25% of patients, isradipine was combined with 1 mg/day bopindolol. There were virtually no accompanying side effects; in particular, reflex tachycardia was negligible or absent. It is concluded that isradipine is a reliable antihypertensive treatment in mild-to-moderate hypertension. 
Diagnostic imaging of musculoskeletal infection. Roentgenography; gallium, indium-labeled white blood cell, gammaglobulin, bone scintigraphy; and MRI. A great deal of effort has been made to evaluate and define the role of various diagnostic imaging techniques in various clinical settings that complicate the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Except possibly in neonates, bone scintigraphy remains generally recommended when there has been no previous osseous involvement. In other cases of chronic disease, previous fracture or trauma, prosthesis, and diabetic foot, In-WBC scintigraphy is generally accepted as an appropriate imaging technique. MRI will play an increasingly important role in diagnosing osteomyelitis and may prove to be an important adjunct in these cases. Research continues to improve our current diagnostic armamentarium. In-IgG appears to avoid practical deficiencies encountered with 67Ga and In-WBC; it remains to be seen what role this agent will play in routine clinical practice. All agents to date image inflammation, not infection, and most require delayed imaging sessions, usually at 24 hours. These shortcomings necessitate further research to develop new radiotracers that can provide useful images within several hours and that are specific for infection, perhaps ultimately delineating the particular microorganism involved. 
Meningiomas of the lateral skull base: neurotologic manifestations and patterns of recurrence. The eradication of basicranial meningiomas by traditional surgical techniques is often hindered by neoplastic entanglement with critical neurovascular structures. Apparent, complete tumor resection is frequently followed by extensive, yet clinically silent, recurrent disease with local infiltration of bone, cranial nerves, and brain. Fifty-five cases of sphenoid wing or parasellar meningioma were analyzed to identify clinical manifestations suggestive of early tumor recurrence. Regrowth patterns were then defined according to preoperative radiographic and intraoperative surgical findings. Medial tumor regrowth, involving the cavernous sinus, caused neurapraxia of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI, with associated diplopia or ophthalmoplegia. Inferior (caudal) regrowth of disease involved the infratemporal fossa, pterygomaxillary space, or paranasal sinuses by bony erosion of the middle cranial fossa floor or through natural anatomic foramina and fissures. Such inferior extension was manifested clinically by facial hypesthesia, trismus, and referred otalgia caused by trigeminal nerve involvement and by autophony or serous otitis media related to eustachian tube obstruction. Posterior tumor regrowth occurred along the petrous bone and horizontal carotid canal, resulting in internal auditory meatus erosion and cerebellopontine angle extension with associated tinnitus, hearing loss, unsteadiness, and occasional facial twitching. While the clinical and radiographic evaluations of any patient with a suspected recurrent basicranial meningioma are critical in planning the method and magnitude of reoperation, an understanding of potential recurrence patterns can be used in devising more extensive, combined approaches that may allow complete tumor extirpation at the initial surgical intervention. 
Provocation of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations by meals in patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux. The effect of a meal on the rate of transient lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxations and patterns of gastroesophageal reflux was investigated in 49 patients referred for evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux. Esophageal motility and pH were recorded concurrently before and after a standard meal. In the patients with symptomatic reflux, the meal induced a four- to sevenfold increase in the gastroesophageal reflux through two mechanisms: a four- to fivefold increase in the rate of transient LES relaxations and an increase in the proportion of transient LES relaxations accompanied by reflux from 47% to 68%. Overall the rate of reflux episodes that occurred by mechanisms other than transient LES relaxation did not increase significantly. An exception to these findings were those in six patients with chronically absent basal LES pressure in whom transient LES relaxations could not be scored. In these patients, reflux increased postprandially through mechanisms other than transient LES relaxation. These findings confirm the pivotal importance of transient LES relaxations in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux. 
Atrial antitachycardia pacing in children and young adults. Atrial antitachycardia pacing was tested in 23 children and young adults. The majority of these patients had had operative repair of congenital cardiac defects and had both bradycardia and tachycardia. Pacemakers were usually implanted by the transvenous technique using bipolar leads. In each patient it was possible to find a tachycardia termination algorithm that successfully converted the tachycardia. In some patients very complex algorithms were necessary. In each patient it was also possible to find an algorithm that successfully differentiated the abnormal tachycardia from sinus tachycardia. Twelve patients required no antiarrhythmic drugs after pacemaker implantation, while 10 patients required one drug and one patient required two drugs. Eight of 23 patients had symptomatic tachycardias that required reprogramming the pacemaker to a different tachycardia termination sequence. Seven patients required reoperations, five for adapter problems and two for infection or erosion. Cardiac function improved in 15 of the 23 patients. Antitachycardia pacing is a viable option for management of tachycardias in children and young adults. 
Prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon in Japanese males and females. In order to estimate the prevalence rate of Raynaud's phenomenon in the Japanese population, 1875 males and 1998 females were interviewed by medical doctors, aided by a typical photograph of Raynaud's phenomenon. The prevalence rates were 3.3% in males and 2.5% in females. Approximately 60% of the male cases of Raynaud's phenomenon were presumed to be caused by vibration syndrome or trauma to the fingers. Prevalence rates excluding these two causes were 1.2% in males and 2.2% in females. The male:female ratio of these prevalence rates was 1:1.9. The prevalence rate for males increased with age, while that for females tended to decrease. The male:female ratio for subjects under 50 years old was 1:5.2 and for those 50 years old or older the ratio was 1:1.1. The prevalence rates of symptoms limited to finger whitening, excluding cases caused by vibration syndrome or trauma, were 1.0% in males and 1.8% in females. Both of these prevalence rates were lower than those of male and female Caucasians. 
The physical examination in acute cardiac ischemic syndromes. The physical examination in acute cardiac ischemia remains a valuable tool when done with skill. Ischemia without infarction alters cardiac function, and the physical examination yields findings that reflect these changes. Ischemia with infarction alters structure and function, resulting in physical findings that are usually more dramatic and of longer duration, sometimes permanent. Carefully done, the physical examination provides information that helps in management of the immediate course, predicts prognosis, and allows for better interpretation of cardiovascular tests, both invasive and noninvasive. 
Phase I/II study of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin for treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma. Leucovorin enhances the cytotoxicity of fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with colorectal cancer and may increase the efficacy of combination chemotherapy regimens containing 5-FU. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU with leucovorin for use in combination with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, we conducted a phase I/II trial in 20 patients. The doses of leucovorin (200 mg/m2 on days 1-5), cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 on day 1), and doxorubicin (40 mg/m2 on day 1) were held constant, while the dose of 5-FU was escalated in cohorts of patients beginning at 150 mg/m2 on days 1-5. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. Significant mucositis, diarrhea, and myelosuppression were infrequently observed in patients receiving up to 250 mg/m2 5-FU on days 1-5. In contrast, at a dose of 300 mg/m2 on days 1-5, three of six patients had granulocyte count nadirs of less than 500/microL during the first cycle of therapy, and two of these three had platelet counts of less than 25,000/microL. In addition, two patients treated at this dose had significant mucosal toxic effects, and three had insufficient recovery to permit a second course by day 22. Among 14 patients with assessable breast cancer, there were one complete and nine partial responses (response rate 71%). Leucovorin modulation of 5-FU can be safely incorporated into combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin and provides a highly active regimen for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Further study will be required to determine whether the addition of leucovorin significantly enhances the activity of this regimen. 
Deep vein thrombosis: effect of graduated compression stockings on distension of the deep veins of the calf. The mechanisms by which graduated compression stockings prevent deep vein thrombosis are not completely understood. Recent work has suggested that venous distension plays a role in initiating the process. Our previous work has shown that the deep veins of the lower limb distend in patients undergoing surgical procedures. We have investigated 40 patients receiving surgical treatment on the abdomen or neck. A medial gastrocnemius vein was studied using ultrasound imaging during the operations. In half the patients a graduated compression anti-embolism stocking was applied to the limb under study at the start of the operation, immediately after initial measurements of vein diameter. The median vein diameter in both groups was the same at the start of the operative procedures (control, 2.6 mm, interquartile range 2.1-3.3 mm; stocking, 2.6 mm, interquartile range 2.1-3.7 mm). After application of a stocking the median diameter in this group fell to 1.6 mm (interquartile range 1.3-2.8 mm) and then decreased slightly at the end of the operation. In the control group the vein diameter increased to 2.9 mm (interquartile range 2.3-4.0 mm) during the operative procedure. 
Right coronary artery disease. Pathophysiology, clinical relevance, and methods for recognition. Among the clinical manifestations of ischemic heart disease, right coronary artery (RCA) disease offers a wide variety of right and left ventricular ischemic involvement, including prevalent right ventricular dysfunction and severe cardiac failure. Whether the right ventricular impairment is dependent primarily on ischemia of the right ventricle or requires a concomitant left ventricular dysfunction remains debatable. To assess the pathophysiology and clinical relevance of RCA-related ischemia, a systematic study of patients with single RCA disease (either vasospastic angina at rest or typical stable angina) was undertaken by radionuclide ventriculography. A high incidence of ischemia-induced right ventricular dysfunction was observed (93% and 95% in angina at rest and on effort, respectively), either alone or associated with left ventricular impairment. These results were compared with those obtained in a control population with isolated left anterior descending artery disease and either primary or secondary angina pectoris. We infer that the impairment of the right ventricle was related primarily to right ventricular ischemia and that left ventricular dysfunction alone did not cause an important depression of right ventricular systolic function. In conclusion, the clinical manifestations of RCA disease can be protean; the right ventricle can be the target of ischemia, and recognition of its impairment poses diagnostic problems. Radionuclide ventriculography and two-dimensional echocardiography, together with stressors of coronary flow reserve, are reliable techniques for assessing RCA-related ischemia. 
Unrecognized stenosis by angiography documented by intravascular ultrasound imaging. This report documents how intravascular ultrasound imaging was used to diagnose a short "napkin-ring" stenosis that was missed by coronary angiography. Intravascular ultrasound revealed a lumen of 2.6 x 2.5 mm in diameter and 5.0 mm2 in cross-sectional area, with a residual atheroma that occluded 63% of available cross-sectional area at the stenosis. 
Reduction in the frequency of ventricular late potentials after acute myocardial infarction by early thrombolytic therapy. Ventricular late potentials are strong predictors of arrhythmic events after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). To assess the effect of intravenous thrombolysis on the incidence of ventricular late potentials, 223 consecutive patients surviving a first AMI were included in the present study: 59 patients (53 men, 6 women, mean age +/- standard deviation 55 +/- 10 years) received intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (100 mg over 3 hours, group A) and 164 patients (123 men, 41 women, mean age 61 +/- 11 years) received conventional medical treatment (group B). A time-domain signal-averaged electrocardiogram and a high-resolution beat-to-beat recording (gain 10(6), filters 100 to 300 Hz) were performed at 10 +/- 3 days after AMI. There was no difference between group A and B patients in terms of AMI location (anterior in 28 of 59 vs 80 of 164, difference not significant [NS]), mean left ventricular ejection fraction (55 +/- 10 vs 55 +/- 13%, NS), or presence of heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV in 12 of 59 vs 40 of 164, NS). The incidence of ventricular late potentials was 10% (6 of 59) in group A and 24% (39 of 164) in group B (p less than 0.05). Among the 146 patients who underwent coronary arteriography, the incidence of ventricular late potentials was 13% (10 of 80) in patients with a patent infarct-related artery and 26% (17 of 66) in patients with an occluded infarct-related artery (p less than 0.05). 
A phase IA trial of sequential administration recombinant DNA-produced interferons: combination recombinant interferon gamma and recombinant interferon alfa in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study investigated the effects of sequentially administered recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN gamma) and recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN alpha) in 36 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). rIFN alpha was subcutaneously administered daily for 70 days at dosages that varied (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 x 10(6) U/m2) across four cohorts of patients. Within each cohort of patients receiving a given dose of rIFN alpha, three subsets of patients received either 30, 300, or 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. rIFN gamma was administered intravenously for 5 days every third week, 6 hours prior to administration of rIFN alpha. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) included constitutional symptoms, leukopenia, nephrotic syndrome with acute renal failure, hypotension associated with death, and congestive heart failure. DLT was related more often to the rIFN alpha dose level than to rIFN gamma dose level. Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 10 x 10(6) U/m2 rIFN alpha and 1,000 micrograms/m2 rIFN gamma. Six patients failed to complete a minimum of 21 days of therapy due to toxicity or rapid progression of disease. Clinical responses were seen in eight of 30 assessable patients. Two patients experienced complete remission and have remained in complete remission 20+ and 22+ months. An additional six patients have shown partial responses for 4 to 18+ months. One patient in partial remission continues to show slow regression of pulmonary and liver lesions off therapy with rIFNs. Clinical responses have remained durable for patients with complete remissions and patients with partial remissions. The results of this study suggest that toxicities associated with combination rIFN therapy can be reduced by administering these agents sequentially as opposed to simultaneously. 
Primary cardiac leiomyosarcomas. Two patients with primary cardiac leiomyosarcoma, one of the rarest malignant tumors of the heart, are described. The first patient had a tumor of the pulmonary trunk and was admitted with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary thromboembolism. The second had a tumor of the left atrium and had signs and symptoms of mitral valve obstruction and regurgitation. The 2 patients were operated on and later underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. Both died more than 22 months after operation, having required multiple hospital admissions for treatment of complications related to the pathology or the treatment of the primary cardiac leiomyosarcoma. Nonetheless, aggressive surgical excision followed by chemotherapy appears to have improved survival in these patients with primary cardiac leiomyosarcoma, as they are among the longest survivors reported. 
Regulation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptor binding by heterologous and autologous receptor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Pancreatic cancers overexpress tyrosine kinase and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) receptor (LH-RHR)-mediated tyrosine phosphatase. LH-RHR is a 60-kDa protein. One of the substrates of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity and LH-RH- and somatostatin-stimulated tyrosine phosphatase activity is also a 60-kDa protein. This suggests the possibility that LH-RHR regulation by tyrosine phosphatase and tyrosine kinase is mediated by (de)phosphorylation of existing LH-RHR. To test this hypothesis, membranes of MIA PaCa-2 cells, a human dedifferentiated pancreatic cancer cell line, were incubated without hormone (control) or with 0.1 microM EGF or somatostatin analogue RC-160 for 1 hr at 4 degrees C to phosphorylate the 60-kDa protein. Competition binding experiments with I125-labeled [D-Trp6]LH-RH by displacement with a nonradioactive ligand showed that the LH-RH binding in 69% of the points was increased by EGF and 85% was decreased by RC-160 compared with controls (n = 61; both significant, P less than 0.001). The specific binding was altered, increasing 50-150% after preincubation with EGF and decreasing 60-70% after RC-160. No change was seen in the binding affinity constant after pretreatment with EGF or RC-160. This shows that phosphorylation regulates binding of LH-RH and may explain the up-regulation by EGF and down-regulation by RC-160 and by LH-RH of the LH-RH response. 
Noninvasive diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. Deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity poses a diagnostic challenge. Clinical signs and symptoms are often misleading, and sensitive and specific tests are essential for diagnosis. The cost, patient discomfort and risk of morbidity associated with contrast venography have led to the development of noninvasive diagnostic techniques such as Doppler ultrasound, impedance plethysmography and duplex ultrasound scanning. If noninvasive tests unequivocally indicate deep venous thrombosis, treatment may be started without the need for contrast venography. 
Effects of perinatal stroke on striatal amino acid efflux in rats studied with in vivo microdialysis. We used in vivo microdialysis to determine the impact of a focal hypoxic-ischemic insult on striatal amino acid efflux in the immature brain. Microdialysis probes were inserted into the right striatum of postnatal day 7 rats. To induce hypoxic-ischemic injury, the right carotid artery was ligated and the animals were exposed to 8% oxygen for 2.5 hours (n = 22). Rats exposed to ligation alone (n = 10) or hypoxia alone (n = 8) and untreated controls (n = 17) were also studied. Two hours after probe insertion, a 30-minute baseline microdialysis sample was obtained. After arterial ligation, two additional baseline samples were collected. Five more samples were collected over the next 2.5 hours (in 8% oxygen or room air). Eight amino acids (glutamate, aspartate, taurine, glutamine, alanine, serine, glycine, and asparagine) were consistently detected in dialysates using a high-performance liquid chromatography assay with electrochemical detection. In untreated controls, amino acid efflux did not change over 4 hours. During hypoxia-ischemia, efflux values fluctuated widely, with marked intra-animal and interanimal variability. Efflux peaks for each amino acid were defined as values greater than the highest control mean value plus two standard deviations. Glutamate efflux peaks (greater than 7 pmol/min compared with 2 pmol/min at baseline) were detected in no controls and in eight hypoxic-ischemic rats (p = 0.006, Fisher's two-tailed exact test). Taurine efflux peaks (greater than 75 pmol/min compared with 10 pmol/min for controls at baseline) were detected in 10 hypoxic-ischemic rats and one control (p = 0.01) and in seven of the eight animals in which glutamate efflux peaks occurred (p = 0.006). 
Patterns of morbidity and mortality in typhoid fever dependent on age and gender: review of 552 hospitalized patients with diarrhea. Features of typhoid fever were correlated with age and gender through a review of the charts of 552 hospitalized culture-positive patients with diarrhea in Bangladesh. Seizures occurred more frequently in children from birth through 10 years of age (5%-11%) and pneumonia more frequently in children from birth through 5 years of age (8%-15%) than in older age groups (P less than .05), whereas intestinal perforation occurred more frequently in patients greater than or equal to 11 years of age (5%-25%) than in younger age groups (P less than .005). Compared with older age groups, children from birth through 10 years of age were more anemic, those from birth through 5 years of age had a higher mean white blood cell count, and those from birth through 1 year of age had a lower mean blood carbon dioxide content (all P less than .05). Female patients were more severely anemic than male patients (P less than .05). The case-fatality rate was 4.3% overall, with the highest rates for children from birth through 1 year of age (11%) and adults greater than or equal to 31 years of age (10%). Female patients had a higher case-fatality rate (6%) than male patients (3%), although the difference was not significant (P greater than .05). Death was independently associated with seizures, intestinal perforation, pneumonia, and delirium or coma. These results indicated that the patients with typhoid fever who were at highest risk of complications and death were children from birth through 1 year of age and adults greater than or equal to 31 years of age. 
Diurnal blood pressure variation in quadriplegic chronic spinal cord injury patients. 1. Measurement of blood pressure and heart rate over a 24 h period was performed in 10 quadriplegic spinal cord injury patients and 10 immobilized, neurologically intact orthopaedic subjects by using the Spacelabs 90207 automated ambulatory monitoring system. 2. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell significantly at night in orthopaedic subjects but not in quadriplegic patients, and night-time blood pressures were similar in both groups. 3. Cumulative summation of differences from a reference value (cusum analysis) confirmed a markedly diminished diurnal blood pressure variation in the quadriplegic patients. 4. These findings could not be accounted for on the basis of blood pressure variations during chronic postural change. 5. Heart rate fell significantly at night in both groups. 6. The findings suggest that the increase in blood pressure during waking hours in neurologically intact subjects is a consequence of a diurnal variation in sympathetic activity (absent in quadriplegic patients with sympathetic decentralization) which is independent of changes in physical activity. 
Postpericardiotomy and postmyocardial infarction syndrome presenting as noncardiac pulmonary edema. Three cases are reported that describe acute pulmonary edema as an early manifestation of a postpericardiotomy or postmyocardial infarction syndrome. Each of these cases occurred in the presence of good left ventricular function. The cases suggest this syndrome occurs in immunologically primed patients who have had prior cardiac injury resulting in readily available heart antibody. The first report followed an acute myocardial infarction that required a temporary pacemaker, and the two other cases occurred following coronary artery bypass surgery. Two of the patients had a history of distant myocardial or pericardial injury, and the third patient had an acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction two to three weeks before cardiac surgery. All three patients with pulmonary edema responded dramatically to corticosteroids, having been resistant to diuretic and pre-load and afterload reduction therapy, suggesting an autoimmune capillary injury process. Early recognition of such a syndrome is important since all three patients were successfully treated, and might otherwise have been confused with other causes of pulmonary edema. 
Splanchnic oxygen consumption in septic and hemorrhagic shock. Oxygen consumption (VO2) is dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2) in septic shock. Local hypoxia with later secondary organ failure may develop, however, despite an often hyperdynamic circulation. The splanchnic organs seem to be of vital importance in this context. In experiments performed in pigs we compared total body VO2 and DO2 with oxygen consumption and delivery in the gastrointestinal organs and the liver in two different shock states: (1) septic shock induced by peritonitis (n = 6) and (2) hemorrhagic shock (n = 6). Another group of six animals not in shock served as controls. Total, gastrointestinal, and liver DO2 decreased in a similar pattern in both septic and hemorrhagic shock. Gastrointestinal and liver VO2 increased in sepsis, whereas it was unchanged in hemorrhage. In the later phase of sepsis, liver VO2, but not gastrointestinal VO2, again decreased, because liver oxygen extraction was almost total and liver DO2 decreased further. The development of flow-dependent liver hypoxia was reflected in a decrease in liver lactate turnover (increased liver lactate release) during late sepsis. Early hypoxia in the splanchnic region is suggested as a plausible mechanism behind the development of secondary organ failure, especially in sepsis. 
Long-term L-carnitine treatment in isovaleric acidemia. A 5-year-old girl with isovaleric acidemia was treated with long-term L-carnitine and no supplemental glycine. Clinical and laboratory data are presented. Following diagnosis and treatment at age 2 years, the frequency of acute exacerbations of metabolic acidosis was reduced and she resumed normal growth and development. L-carnitine supplementation and protein restriction may be sufficient for effective therapy of isovaleric acidemia. 
Wrist movements in able-bodied and brain injured individuals. The purpose of this study was to compare movement velocity characteristics during targeted wrist movements between able-bodied individuals and a sample of individuals with spasticity secondary to closed head injury. Two amplitudes (30 degrees and 60 degrees) of movement were performed at slow and fast velocities, with the forearm either passively supported or actively supported by elbow extension and shoulder flexion. Variables measured were the following: (1) average velocity of entire movement, (2) velocity for 10 degrees increments of a movement, and (3) ratio of average peak 10 degrees increment velocity to average velocity. In addition, qualitative examination of velocity profiles was performed. Slow movements were performed in a discontinuous manner by both groups; however, observable differences in peak/average velocity were noted between groups in the unsupported position during slow and fast movements. Able-bodied individuals performed seven of eight fast movements with greater velocity (p less than .05) than brain injured individuals, and the fast movements of the able-bodied subjects were continuous. 
Recurrent prolonged coma due to basilar artery migraine. A case report. A 25 year old patient presented with recurrent prolonged episodes of life-threatening coma varying from 3 to 10 days. The clinical recovery was slow. The history and technical examinations led to the diagnosis of basilar artery migraine (BAM). The etiology of the coma episodes is thought to be related to ischemic dysfunction of the rostral part of the brainstem due to severe spasm of the basilar artery demonstrated by arteriography. Exceptional are the recurrent prolonged coma episodes of sudden onset, the severe spasm of the basilar artery, and the suppression-burst and FIRDA pattern on the EEG examinations during the coma episodes. 
White sponge naevus and ocular coloboma. White sponge naevus occurred in association with coloboma of the iris in six members of one family, across three generations. The association of these two dominantly inherited conditions has not to our knowledge previously been described. 
Effects of short-term, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia on systemic hemodynamics, myocardial blood flow, and infarct size in awake dogs with acute myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. Short-term cholesterol feeding has been shown to affect vasomotor tone and increase infarct size in anesthetized rabbits. The purpose of the study was to determine whether acute hypercholesterolemia reduced collateral flow to ischemic myocardium and increased infarct size in the awake dog. METHODS AND RESULTS. Acute myocardial infarction was produced in awake dogs by a 4-hour left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by 6-hour reperfusion after either a cholesterol-supplemented diet (n = 14) or a control diet of dog chow (n = 15) for 10 days. Infarct size was determined using nitroblue tetrazolium staining. In two subgroups, a 15-minute transient occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was produced before the diet treatments and was compared with occlusion after diet treatments, so that the effects of hypercholesterolemia of collateral flow could be determined by paired comparisons. Cholesterol feeding increased plasma cholesterol to 288 +/- 52 mg/dl, which was twofold to threefold that in the control group (127 +/- 35 mg/dl), but had no effects on baseline systemic hemodynamics and myocardial blood flow. Coronary artery occlusion produced similar increases in heart rate, mean aortic pressure, left atrial pressure, and plasma norepinephrine in both groups of animals. However, cholesterol feeding reduced collateral flow to ischemic myocardium and increased infarct size, compared with the control group. The infarct size correlated with ischemic myocardial blood flow in both groups, but the slopes of regression lines relating the two variables did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. Short-term, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia increased infarct size in awake dogs. This change results, at least in part, from a decrease in collateral blood flow to ischemic myocardium during coronary artery occlusion. 
Stress incontinence and cystoceles. We studied prospectively 62 women with cystoceles by video-urodynamics before and after operative repair. Of 29 women with grades 1 and 2 cystoceles 8 had residual urine, 14 had urge incontinence and 24 had symptoms of stress urinary incontinence. Of these women 23 had urodynamic evidence of stress incontinence, as did 3 of 5 without stress incontinence symptoms. Of 33 women with large cystoceles 22 had symptoms of stress urinary incontinence but 10 more had urodynamic evidence of stress urinary incontinence. Of these 33 women 18 had significant residual urine and 24 had urge incontinence. Operative repair resolved stress incontinence in 51 of 54 women, urge incontinence in 33 of 38 and residual urine in 24 of 26. Cystoceles recurred in 3 patients, and enteroceles developed in 3 and recurred in 2. These findings indicate that cystoceles may cause voiding dysfunction and lack of symptoms of stress incontinence is unreliable in patients with cystoceles. In addition, cystoceles are associated with other symptoms, most of which actually resolve after operative repair. 
Cardiovascular and catecholamine responses to head-up tilt in the diagnosis of recurrent unexplained syncope in elderly patients. To increase understanding of the mechanisms causing syncope in patients over the age of 60, hemodynamic and hormonal responses to 60 minutes of 60 degree head-up tilt were examined in 10 patients with recurrent syncope of unknown origin and five controls with no history of syncope. Nine of 10 patients and all five controls experienced orthostatic intolerance on the tilt table. Syncope or pre-syncope occurred later in controls than in those syncope patients who had exact reproduction of their clinical symptoms (median time 52 versus 22 minutes, P = 0.05). Three different mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance were identified in the 14 subjects: (1) vasovagal syncope, n = 9 (sudden hypotension +/- bradycardia); (2) dysautonomic syncope, n = 3 (immediate and gradual parallel declines in both systolic and diastolic pressures with blunted increase in heart rate); (3) psychogenic or vestibular reaction, n = 2 (orthostatic intolerance without hemodynamic changes). Vasovagal syncope patients showed a significant increase in plasma norepinephrine from baseline to maximum level during tilt (100 +/- 39% increase, P = 0.03) and a subsequent decrease at the time of syncope (30 +/- 5% decrease, P = 0.01), while plasma epinephrine increased markedly from baseline to the time of syncope (827 +/- 154% increase, P = 0.0003). Dysautonomic syncope patients had lower supine levels of norepinephrine compared to vasovagal syncope patients (182 +/- 30 versus 614 +/- 146 pg/mL, P = 0.008) and no significant change in norepinephrine over time; epinephrine levels increased significantly less than in vasovagal patients (net change 38 +/- 8 versus 189 +/- 56 pg/mL, P = 0.008). 
Cystoscopic suction diathermy for the treatment of superficial bladder tumours. The treatment of superficial bladder tumours (Ta, T1) is a time-consuming exercise for urological surgeons and patients. A method of treating the tumours, whether primary or recurrent, by endoscopic suction diathermy has been developed. The technique significantly reduces the amount of tumour debris within the bladder during treatment as well as the amount of diathermy employed. By removing the free tumour cells in the irrigation fluid the risk of tumour cell implantation may be kept to a minimum. 
The t(1;22) (p13;q13) is nonrandom and restricted to infants with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia: a Pediatric Oncology Group Study. We report the nonrandom occurrence and frequency of the t(1;22)(p13;q13) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and its close association with the French-American-British M7 subtype of AML in infants (less than 1 year). This chromosomal abnormality occurred in 6 of 252 (2.4%) children and adolescents with AML (6 of 28 infants, 22%; 6 of 18 M7 AML cases overall, 33%; and 6 of 6 M7 cases in infants). Infants with AML of M7 subtype and the t(1;22) often presented with prominent abdominal masses. Two of these infants were not treated and died early. Three of four treated infants entered complete remission with therapy for AML; the remaining infant died of hemorrhage on day 8. Of the three infants who entered remission, only one remains alive and disease free at 5+ months. The other two infants relapsed in the bone marrow at 5 and 2 months from the start of therapy, respectively. We conclude that M7 AML with the t(1;22) usually presents in infants with extensive infiltration of abdominal organs by leukemic cells and may confer a poor prognosis despite intensive AML-directed treatment. Identification of this nonrandom translocation exclusively in infants with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMkL) implies that it may serve as an additional diagnostic marker for this disease and links it to the pathogenesis of AMkL in infants. 
Pentoxifylline in resuscitation of experimental hemorrhagic shock. BACKGROUND: Pentoxifylline improves survival in animal models of hemorrhagic shock. The purpose of this study was to determine the physiologic effects of pentoxifylline in hemorrhagic shock that may be responsible for improved survival. METHODS: Randomized, prospective, blinded trials in Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to hemorrhage and resuscitation, with or without pentoxifylline. RESULTS: Pentoxifylline had no effect on BP or cardiac output. However, tissue oxygenation and oxygen consumption were increased with pentoxifylline resuscitation. Pentoxifylline resuscitation also significantly decreased polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Pentoxifylline improves tissue oxygenation and oxygen consumption posthemorrhage and this effect is not due to increased cardiac output. Therefore, it must be due to improved microcirculatory blood flow. This effect may be due to decreased polymorphonuclear leukocyte adhesiveness induced by pentoxifylline resuscitation. 
Alcoholic liver disease: pathologic, pathogenetic and clinical aspects [published erratum appears in Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1991 Mar;15(2):180] Alcoholic liver disease includes steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Other liver diseases of genetic origin, but with a curious association with alcohol intake, are hemochromatosis and porphyria cutanea tarda. The attribution of chronic hepatitis to alcohol intake remains speculative, and the association may reflect hepatitis C infection. Hepatic injury attributed to alcohol includes the changes reported in the fetal alcohol syndrome. Steatosis, the characteristic consequence of excess alcohol intake, is usually macrovesicular and rarely microvesicular. Acute intrahepatic cholestasis, which in rare instances accompanies steatosis, must be distinguished from other causes of intrahepatic cholestasis (e.g., drug-induced) and from mechanical obstruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts (e.g., pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis) before being accepted. Alcoholic hepatitis (steatonecrosis) is characterized by a constellation of lesions: steatosis, Mallory bodies (with or without a neutrophilic inflammatory response), megamitochondria, occlusive lesions of terminal hepatic venules, and a lattice-like pattern of pericellular fibrosis. All these lesions mainly affect zone 3 of the hepatic acinus. Other changes, observed at the ultrastructural level, are of importance in progression of the disease. They include widespread cytoplasmic shedding, and capillarization and defenestration of sinusoids. Progressive fibrosis complicating alcoholic hepatitis eventually leads to cirrhosis that is typically micronodular but can evolve to a mixed or macronodular pattern. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in 5 to 15% of patients with alcoholic liver disease. The clinical syndrome of alcoholic liver disease is the result of three factors--parenchymal insufficiency, portal hypertension and the clinical consequences of extrahepatic damage produced by alcohol. At the several phases of the life history of alcoholic liver disease, the individual factors play a different role. The clinical manifestations of alcoholic steatosis are mainly extrahepatic in origin. Those of alcoholic hepatitis reflect mainly parenchymal insufficiency and those of cirrhosis are mainly those of portal hypertension. Alcoholic liver injury appears to be generated by the effects of ethanol metabolism and the toxic effects of acetaldehyde, perhaps the immune responses to alcohol- or acetaldehyde-altered proteins, and questionably enhanced by viral hepatitis. Alcoholic hepatitis may be mimicked histologically, and to a varying degree clinically, by a number of conditions (obesity, diabetes, several drug-induced injuries, jejunoileal bypass, and related "shortcircuiting" of the bowel). Perhaps the most important facet of the hepatotoxicity of alcohol is its enhancement of the effects of a number of other hepatotoxic agents, among which acetaminophen is the prime example. 
Correlation of clinical and histopathologic features in clinically atypical melanocytic nevi. To define better the evolving entity of dysplastic melanocytic nevus (DMN), studies correlating clinical with histologic features of DMN are essential. However, based on a literature search, no previous quantitative analysis was found of the relationship between gross morphologic features and histologic features of DMN. The authors correlated individual clinical features with histopathologic features and histologic diagnosis of the clinically most atypical nevus in 153 melanoma patients. This nevus was identified, evaluated clinically, and removed for histologic evaluation from each patient. Gross morphologic features assessed for nevi included: size (in mm), the presence of a macular component, irregular border, ill-defined border, haphazard coloration, distortion of skin cleavage lines on tangential lighting, asymmetry, and number of colors present (12 features in all). Nineteen histologic features were assessed in each nevus by a single dermatopathologist. These included architectural, nuclear, and cytoplasmic parameters ascribed to dysplastic nevi. Each of these histologic features was correlated with the 12 individual clinical features. Seventeen percent of the nevi fulfilled the criteria for the histologic diagnosis of DMN. Among individual nevus parameters, size (in mm), irregular border, ill-defined border, macular component, and pink color were associated significantly with histologic DMN. Nevus size (in mm) and irregular borders correlated with the greatest number of individual histologic parameters. A comparison of clinicopathologic correlations for two different examiners revealed that certain clinical features are probably more important than others for the recognition of dysplastic nevi and that individual examiners have different thresholds for the perception of some gross morphologic features. These observations are relevant to the development of clinical criteria for dysplastic nevi. 
Acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in a hospital population in Warsaw, Poland: clinical and epidemiological aspects. In the years 1986-1988, 530 consecutive cases of acute viral hepatitis were admitted to an infectious disease hospital in Warsaw. Hepatitis A was diagnosed in 34 cases (6.4%), hepatitis B in 436 (82.3%), CMV infection in five (0.9%), and 55 cases (10.4%) were classified as hepatitis non-A, non-B. In 47 cases (85%) of non-A, non-B hepatitis, there was evidence of parenteral transmission, whereas in eight (15%), the source of infection was unknown. Chronic liver disease developed in 50% of patients with parenteral exposure, but there were no cases with known exposure. Seroconversion to anti-HCV was observed only in patients with parenteral exposure, and 60% of followed up cases developed antibodies within 6 months. 
Pericardial effusion after intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator for acute myocardial infarction. The effect of thrombolytic therapy on the frequency, time course and sequelae of pericardial effusion after myocardial infarction are unknown. A prospective, serial, 2-dimensional echocardiographic study of patients with myocardial infarction who received recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was undertaken to address this issue. The study population comprised 52 of the 112 patients enrolled in the first Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction trial at Duke University Medical Center. Enrollment in the serial echocardiography protocol was determined by equipment and support staff availability. Complete echocardiographic studies were performed within 90 minutes after initiation of thrombolytic therapy (day 0), and on days 1, 3 and 6. Patients undergoing serial echocardiography did not differ in demographic or clinical characteristics from those who did not. Pericardial effusion was present in 3 of 38 patients (8%) at day 0, in 2 of 44 (5%) at day 1, in 8 of 43 (19%) at day 3, and in 10 of 42 (24%) at day 6. By day 6, 3 of 10 pericardial effusions were moderate in size, 1 of 10 was large and the remainder were small. No patients developed echocardiographic or hemodynamic signs of cardiac tamponade. The prevalence and time course of pericardial effusion among patients with acute myocardial infarction who received rt-PA in this study are similar to observations reported in earlier studies in which patients did not receive thrombolytic therapy. Adverse sequelae of pericardial effusion after thrombolytic therapy are rare. 
Developing a dysphagia program in an acute care hospital: a needs assessment. A needs assessment for a hospital-based dysphagia program was conducted to determine incidence, management procedures, and outcome for stroke patients with swallowing disorders. Using a chart review of 225 patients, it was found that 28% had documented evidence of dysphagia. When dysphagia co-occurred with stroke, significantly more functional problems and medical complications were reported, as well as increased need for dietary modifications and alternative feeding methods. The dysphagic patients were more often aphasic and dysarthric and less able to communicate. Mental status was more likely to be reduced and the need for staff supervision during mealtime was increased. Dysphagic patients had significantly longer hospital stays, thus increasing the cost of their care. At discharge, almost half of them continued to need feeding modifications, which may have delayed rehabilitation or transfer to facilities with other levels of care. The dysphagia group clearly displayed a wide range of clinical symptoms that would alert staff to their risk for medical complications because of swallowing problems. We believe that this needs assessment clearly showed that a multidisciplinary dysphagia management program has the potential to enhance patient care while decreasing the cost of health care delivery for the hospital. 
Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging following cranial base surgery. The computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging films of 57 patients who underwent anterior or anterolateral cranial base surgery from January 1987 to August 1989 were retrospectively reviewed to ascertain the significance of early and late postoperative intracranial imaging changes. Extra-axial changes (air, blood, cerebrospinal fluid collection) were found in 96% of patients; axial changes (brain edema, contusion) were seen in 30% of patients in the first postoperative period (72 hours). Subsequently, extra-axial changes began to resolve but axial changes became more prevalent. After 6 months, only axial changes persisted (encephalomalacia). It was encouraging to find a low correlation of imaging abnormalities with clinically significant findings. 
Resistant hypertension in a tertiary care clinic. STUDY OBJECTIVE.--To determine the prevalence of resistant hypertension in a tertiary care facility, the frequency of its various causes, and the results of treatment. DESIGN.--Review of clinic records of all patients seen for the first time between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 1988. METHODS.--Patients meeting criteria for resistant hypertension were examined for appropriateness of their medical regimen, presence of secondary causes of hypertension, noncompliance, interfering substances, drug interactions, office resistance (elevated blood pressure in the office only while receiving treatment), and other potential causes of resistance. RESULTS.--Of the 436 charts reviewed, 91 were those of patients who met criteria for resistant hypertension and were seen more than once. The most common cause was a suboptimal medical regimen (39 patients), followed by medication intolerance (13 patients), previously undiagnosed secondary hypertension (10 patients), noncompliance (nine patients), psychiatric causes (seven patients), office resistance (two patients), an interfering substance (two patients), and drug interaction (one patient). Blood pressure control, defined as diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less and systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or less for patients aged 50 years or less (less than or equal to 150 mm Hg for those aged 51 to 60 years and less than or equal to 160 mm Hg for those aged greater than 60 years), was achieved in 48 (53%) of those 91 patients. Another 10 had significant improvement in their blood pressure (greater than or equal to 15% decrease in diastolic blood pressure). Of patients whose blood pressure was controlled after they had been on a suboptimal regimen, the two most frequently used therapeutic strategies were to add (50%) or modify (24%) diuretic therapy or to add (50%) or increase the dose of (12%) a newer drug, either a calcium entry blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. CONCLUSION.--We conclude that resistant hypertension is common in a tertiary care facility and that a suboptimal regimen is the most common reason. Furthermore, in the majority of these patients, the elevated blood pressures can be controlled or significantly improved. 
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of aortocoronary venous bypass grafts and effect of the caliber of the grafted coronary artery on graft stenosis. The influence of morphologic parameters on the recurrence of stenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of 49 stenoses in aortocoronary venous bypass grafts of 41 patients was investigated. Vessel dimensions were measured quantitatively. Angioplasty was successful in 46 stenoses (94%) of 38 patients (93%). In 35 patients (92% of successfully treated patients) with 42 stenoses, control angiography was performed after a mean interval of 189 +/- 186 days. In 9 patients (26%), 9 stenoses (21%) had recurred. The diameter of the grafted coronary artery distal to the anastomosis was significantly smaller in grafted arteries with than without recurrent stenoses (1.92 +/- 0.52 vs 2.45 +/- 0.50 mm; p less than 0.01). Recurrence also correlated with the ratio between graft diameter and coronary artery diameter greater than 1.35 (p less than 0.02) and with the stenosis length greater than 10 mm before angioplasty (p less than 0.01). Graft age, graft diameter and stenosis location in the graft had no significant influence on recurrence. Thus, the diameter of the grafted coronary artery and the length of the critical stenosis are parameters for recurrence after angioplasty of graft stenoses and should be considered in the selection of patients for this intervention. 
Prolonged paralysis after treatment with neuromuscular junction blocking agents. OBJECTIVES: Previous reports have described prolonged paralysis after treatment with neuromuscular junction blocking agents in critically ill patients. The purpose of this study was to further describe a group of patients who developed prolonged weakness after treatment with these agents. DESIGN: Clinical information, electrodiagnostic and muscle pathology results are described in this group of patients. Clinical information includes diagnoses, dosage of neuromuscular junction blocker, other medications affecting the neuromuscular system, and neuromuscular examination and clinical course. SETTING: All patients were seen in the ICUs of three local hospitals. PATIENTS: Included were critically ill patients with a variety of diagnoses, all of whom developed severe weakness after discontinuation of neuromuscular junction blocking agents. INTERVENTIONS: Electrodiagnostic studies and muscle biopsies were performed on several of the patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients had pronounced weakness without sensory loss. Electrodiagnostic and muscle pathology findings were consistent with failed neuromuscular transmission. Although many patients had disorders or were taking medications that can injure the neuromuscular system, no disorder or medication was common to all. Recovery of strength often took several months and most patients were slow to wean from mechanical ventilator support. CONCLUSIONS: Although alternative explanations cannot be excluded with certainty, the use of neuromuscular junction blocking agents may lead to neurogenic atrophy and care must be taken when using them. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor: a gallium-avid mobile mesenteric mass. An 8-yr-old boy with a 1-mo history of culture-negative fever and anemia underwent gallium, ultrasound, and computed tomography studies as part of the evaluation of a fever of unknown origin. These studies revealed a mobile gallium-avid solid abdominal mass subsequently proven to be an inflammatory pseudotumor of the mesentery, a rare benign mass. This report documents the gallium-avid nature of this rare lesion and discusses associated characteristic clinical, pathologic, and radiographic features. 
Radiologic evaluation of aortic dissection. The radiologic assessment of patients suspected of having an aortic dissection must be based on an understanding of the treatment options and how these are to be employed in any clinical setting. The appropriate selection and timing of imaging studies is crucial. The diagnosis of dissection must be quickly confirmed, other diseases that mimic dissection must be excluded, and the type and extent of dissection must be established so that appropriate therapy can be instituted. Although computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and echocardiography greatly enhanced the ability to evaluate the aorta by noninvasive means, aortography remains the examination of choice for defining the vascular anatomy, especially when surgical intervention is considered. MR imaging may become the primary examination for the initial and subsequent evaluation of acute and chronic dissections as MR angiographic techniques improve and changes are made in monitoring equipment to allow the safe examination of acutely ill patients. 
Genital chlamydial infections: epidemiology and reproductive sequelae. Genital chlamydial infection is increasing and is now more common than gonorrhea. A sizable percentage of chlamydial infections of the lower genital tract in women progress to endometritis and salpingitis. Tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy are important sequelae. Failure to control chlamydial infections reflects the following four factors: (1) Many cases are mild or asymptomatic; (2) diagnostic tests are expensive and technically demanding; (3) at least 7 days of multiple-dose therapy are currently required; and (4) partner notification is not routinely performed. Thus early identification of infected persons and compliance with curative therapy are less likely than with other sexually transmitted bacterial diseases. 
Detection of hepatitis B virus DNA sequences in liver in HBsAg seronegative patients with liver disease with and without anti-HBc antibodies. Excluding studies from Brechot and co-workers, little support has been found for a role of the hepatitis B virus in the pathogenesis of HBsAg seronegative patients with predominantly chronic liver diseases, including primary liver cancer. In this study liver DNA from 59 predominantly British patients (four cases with paired biopsies, 6-12 months apart) with different, mostly chronic, liver diseases was analysed by molecular hybridization. All were seronegative for HBsAg and serum hepatitis B virus DNA (dot blot hybridization) and their liver diseases were believed to be unrelated to hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in liver of 11 (18.6 per cent) patients; nine had episomal (3.2 Kb) DNA and eight had higher molecular weight bands suggesting integrated forms. Six patients were also seronegative for anti-HBc. Patients of UK and non-UK origin were equally represented. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in serum of six of nine patients tested using the polymerase chain reaction. The detection of hepatitis B virus DNA in liver and in serum by this assay in a significant proportion of patients with chronic liver disease, hitherto unsuspected of being hepatitis B virus-related, suggests a possible role for this virus in low- as well as high-prevalence countries. 
Evolution of renal insufficiency in ischemic nephropathy. This retrospective review of data collected during a recent 42-month period from 58 consecutive patients with ischemic nephropathy submitted to operative management in the authors' center was undertaken to report the rate of decline in their renal function during the period before intervention and to examine the impact of operation on their outcome. Based on serum creatinine values, immediate preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rates (EGFR) ranged from 0 to 46 mL/minute (mean, 23.85 +/- 9.76 mL/minute). Eight patients were dialysis dependent or anuric at the time of operation. Patients with at least three sequential measurements for calculations of EGFR changes during the 6 months before operation (n = 50) and the first 12 months after operation (n = 32) were used to describe the preoperative rate of decline in EGFR and the impact of operation on this decrease in the operative survivors. In addition comparative analyses of data from patients with unilateral versus bilateral lesions and patients classified as having improvement in EGFR versus no improvement after operation were performed. Comparison of the immediate preoperative EGFR with the immediate postoperative EGFR for the entire group showed significant improvement in response to operation. Likewise the rate of deterioration in EGFR for the total group was improved after operation. A similar improvement in the rate of deterioration in EGFR was seen in the subgroup of patients who received an immediate improvement in EGFR in response to operation. These data argue that ischemic nephropathy is a rapidly progressive form of renal insufficiency. Although individual responses to operation were heterogeneous, renal revascularization may provide both immediate improvement in renal function and an improvement in its rate of deterioration during follow-up in patients with ischemic nephropathy. 
Metastatic meningioma in the neck. Although meningiomas represent 15 per cent of tumours of the central nervous system, they rarely metastasize. A case is presented in which metastasis to a cervical lymph node occurred, together with local recurrence, nine years after initial diagnosis and treatment. This case serves to illustrate that malignant meningioma is a rare cause of a neck mass. 
Validation of a clinical antisaccadic eye movement test in the assessment of dementia. The ability to generate antisaccades (eye movements deliberately made in the direction opposite to that of a visual stimulus) may be used to assess central nervous system function in a variety of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. However, the usefulness of this paradigm in clinical practice is limited by the need for an oculographic laboratory. We describe a clinical version of such an antisaccadic task and present normative data from 332 subjects. We also examined clinical antisaccades and cognitive performance in 30 patients with Alzheimer's disease, five patients with Huntington's disease, and 12 patients with pseudodementia. In Alzheimer's disease, error rates in the clinical antisaccadic test correlated well with those from a laboratory-based antisaccadic task measured on the same day by infrared oculography, confirming that the clinical antisaccadic test is a valid analog of the more sophisticated laboratory paradigms. Clinical antisaccadic error rates correlated strongly with the severity of dementia in Alzheimer's disease, and correlations with cognitive performance suggested that the clinical antisaccadic test may have some specificity for frontal lobe dysfunction. Patients with pseudodementia had normal clinical antisaccadic error rates, and the test may therefore be of use in differentiating dementia from pseudodementia. This clinical antisaccadic test provides a simple, reliable, and inexpensive quantitative clinical tool that is of value in the assessment of disturbances of higher cortical function. 
Neuromodulatory effects of atrial natriuretic factor are independent of guanylate cyclase in adrenergic neuronal pheochromocytoma cells. This study tests the hypothesis that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and C-ANF(4-23)-NH2 (C-ANF) augment cGMP generation and inhibit both cAMP generation and depolarization-induced catecholamine release in nerve growth factor treated pheochromocytoma cells by a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive mechanism. Synthetic rat ANF(99-126) and the clearance receptor antagonist C-ANF (10(-12)-10(-9) M) inhibited basal and 5 microM vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-induced cAMP generation in a concentration-dependent manner. These actions of ANF and C-ANF were blocked by 12-18 h pretreatment with PTX (100 ng/ml), suggesting ANF receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase via an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein. Both ANF (10(-11)-10(-9) M) and C-ANF (10(-11)-10(-8) M) also inhibited K(+)-induced catecholamine release in a concentration-dependent manner. ANF (10(-11)-10(-8) M) increased cGMP generation in a concentration-dependent manner but C-ANF did not. The accumulation of cGMP in response to ANF was not altered by treatment with PTX. Therefore, PTX dissociated the increased concentrations of cGMP from the ANF-mediated depression of evoked catecholamine release. C-ANF also dissociated elevations in cGMP concentrations from an ANF-mediated attenuation of evoked catecholamine release. The results of this study indicate that ANF inhibits adrenergic neurotransmission independent of guanylate cyclase. 
Leptotrichia buccalis bacteremia in patients with cancer: report of four cases and review. Leptotrichia buccalis, an anaerobic gram-negative rod, is part of the normal oral flora and has rarely been isolated from clinical material. We describe four patients with neutropenia and progressive malignancy who had symptomatic L. buccalis bacteremia, and we review an additional four cases from the literature. The mean age of the patients was 31 years (range, 7-73 years), with an equal number of males and females. The number of positive blood cultures in each case ranged from one to four (mean, two); these cultures became positive after 48-120 hours (median, 54 hours). All tested isolates were sensitive to the beta-lactam agents, clindamycin, tetracycline, and metronidazole; five of seven were sensitive to chloramphenicol; and not one was sensitive to the aminoglycosides, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, or erythromycin. Seven patients had one or more possible portals of entry for bacteremia, including mucositis (four patients), mucositis plus esophageal lesions (two), and possible mucositis plus diverticulitis (one). L. buccalis should be considered a potential pathogen in neutropenic patients, especially when breaks in the mucosal breaks in the mucosal barriers are present. 
How AIDS forces reappraisal of hepatitis B virus control in sub-Saharan Africa For developing countries the cost-benefit of vaccination in the control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is great since the acute infection is generally subclinical and the benefit is the prevention of small numbers of cases of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Since the pattern of HBV infection in Africa is such that, compared with south-east Asia, infection occurs later in childhood and spread is horizontal rather than vertical, investigation of the method of spread of HBV may result in a means of control other than by vaccination. In the meantime, because of the overlap in the means by which HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are spread, it could be worthwhile taking advantage of existing AIDS prevention programmes to educate people about how to avoid both HBV and HIV infections. 
Impending paradoxical embolism: a rare but important diagnosis. A man aged 50 presented with a history of a cerebrovascular accident and arterial embolism at two discrete peripheral sites. Echocardiography showed thrombus trapped in an interatrial site and impending paradoxical embolism was diagnosed. Treatment with heparin was started and the potentially embolic intracardiac material was removed at open heart surgery. The patient was treated with warfarin and made a good recovery. This is only the third case report of impending paradoxical embolism diagnosed in life. 
The low-affinity p75 nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor mediates NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a potential mechanism for initial signaling in PC12 cells during differentiation in response to nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation has been found to be initiated by the trk protooncogene, which participates in the formation of high-affinity NGF binding sites. In contrast to transfection of wild-type low-affinity p75 NGF receptors, transfection of p75NGFR with mutations in the cytoplasmic domain resulted in an inability of NGF to elicit tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates, indicating that p75NGFR is involved in initiating phosphorylation events by NGF. Even though the p75NGFR receptor does not possess any inherent tyrosine kinase activity, these experiments demonstrate that the p75NGFR has a potential role in NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. 
Effect of a cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase inhibitor, DN-9693, on myocardial reperfusion injury. A new cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase inhibitor, DN-9693, was examined to see whether myocardial reperfusion injury could be reduced in a setting of cardioplegic arrest through its antiaggregation effect on leukocytes. Isolated rabbit heart models with whole blood perfusion were used, and 18 hearts were divided into three groups according to the reperfusion method: control (G-1, n = 5), DN-9693 (G-2, n = 7), and leukocyte depletion (G-3, n = 6). The hearts were subjected to 120 minutes of cold global ischemia under crystalloid cardioplegia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. A dose of 20 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 of DN-9693 was administered in G-2, and a leukocyte removal filter was used in G-3 during reperfusion. Ultrastructural changes in mitochondrial injuries, intracellular edema, and capillary injuries of the myocardium showed worse changes in G-1 than in G-2 and G-3. Under microscopic study, the intracapillary leukocyte count was significantly higher in G-1 than in G-2 and G-3. Recovery of rate-pressure product, left ventricular developed pressure, and coronary flow were significantly better in G-2 and G-3 than in G-1. There were no significant differences between G-2 and G-3 for all these indices. These results indicate that reperfusion with leukocyte-depleted blood attenuates reperfusion myocardial injury and DN-9693 has a comparable myocardial protective effect with possible inhibition of leukocyte aggregation. 
The role of contraception in the development of postmolar gestational trophoblastic tumor. From January 1974 to June 1988, 299 evaluable patients were referred to the John I. Brewer Trophoblastic Disease Center of Northwestern University Cancer Center for treatment and/or follow-up of a hydatidiform mole (N = 162) or postmolar gestational trophoblastic tumor (N = 137). The type of contraception and other prognostic factors before and after evacuation were correlated with the development of gestational trophoblastic tumor using both univariate and multivariate analysis. There was no relationship between pre-hydatidiform mole contraception and the development of gestational trophoblastic tumor. Oral contraceptives (OCs) were used by 139 patients (46%), barrier methods by 141 patients (47%), intrauterine devices (IUDs) by two patients (1%), and no contraception by 17 patients (6%). The risk of developing gestational trophoblastic tumor was compared between patients using versus not using: OCs--33 versus 57% (P less than .001), barrier methods--53 versus 40% (P = .30), IUD--100 versus 46% (P = .21), and any contraceptive method--43 versus 88% (P less than .001). The dose of estrogens could be determined in 75 patients taking OCs; 14 of 49 (29%) of the patients taking less than 50 micrograms versus nine of 26 (35%) taking 50 micrograms or more developed gestational trophoblastic tumor (P = .78). Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the type of contraceptive used was the most important prognostic factor in gestational trophoblastic tumor development (P less than .0001), followed by the occurrence of theca-lutein cysts (P less than .0001), Asian maternal race (P = .02), lesser time from the last menstrual period (P = .005), and greater maternal age (P = .04). 
Removal of massive right atrial thrombus guided by transesophageal echocardiography. Formation of massive right atrial thrombi around a peritoneovenous shunt is a known complication of these devices. Removal of an obstructive right atrial thrombus requires cardiopulmonary bypass and has been associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Transesophageal echocardiography was used in this case to diagnose and guide the surgical removal of a massive right atrial thrombus. 
Amikacin pharmacokinetics in patients receiving high-dose cancer chemotherapy. We retrospectively analyzed amikacin pharmacokinetics in 28 patients (mean age, 47.4 +/- 13.6 years) who received high-dose chemotherapy during a neutropenic febrile episode. Patients received an experimental protocol of high-dose anticancer chemotherapy. Amikacin pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from two or more concentrations in serum around a single dose by the method of Sawchuck and Zaske (J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 4:183-195, 1976). Predicted parameters were calculated by using standard methods. The observed amikacin volume of distribution and clearance were significantly greater and the elimination half-life was longer than predicted (0.38 +/- 0.13 versus 0.25 liter/kg [P = 0.0001], 1.51 +/- 0.92 versus 1.17 +/- 0.38 liters/h/kg [P = 0.012], and 3.8 +/- 2.4 versus 2.9 +/- 1.1 h [P = 0.011], respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that albumin correlated negatively and creatinine correlated positively with the volume of distribution and the elimination half-life. Creatinine and the percentage below the ideal body weight correlated negatively and hematocrit correlated positively with clearance. Administration of dosage regimens based on predicted pharmacokinetic parameters yielded subtherapeutic amikacin concentrations in serum in our patients. Because of the increased dosage requirements and the need for adequate antibiotic treatment in this population, we suggest guidelines for empiric dosing for patients with advanced cancer receiving intensive chemotherapy. 
Autoimmune Addison's disease and thyrotoxic thyroiditis presenting as encephalopathy in twins. An 11 year old boy who presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms including delirium and pronounced agitation was found to have simultaneous onset of autoimmune adrenocortical insufficiency and hyperthyroidism. His identical twin also had hyperthyroidism and six months later developed symptoms of adrenocortical insufficiency. In children presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms, adrenal (or pituitary) and other endocrine disorders should be considered. 
Treatment of vasospasm with a 480-nm pulsed-dye laser. Laser energy at a wavelength of 480 nm was applied in 1-microseconds pulses of 3 to 10 mJ to two models of vasospasm. Rabbit common carotid arteries (CCA's) were constricted chronically by the application of human blood within a silicone sheath. Peak vasospasm developed 24 to 48 hours later, and persisted for up to 6 days. Endovascular laser treatment was delivered to 40 CCA's via a 200-microns diameter silica quartz fiber introduced through the femoral artery. The CCA caliber increased from 60% of the pre-vasospasm control diameter to a minimum post-laser diameter of 83% of control. No instances of laser-induced perforation or of arterial thrombosis were observed for up to 60 days after treatment. Prophylactic laser application to nine normal vessels was able to attenuate the development of vasospasm if blood was applied immediately thereafter (88% vs. 59% of control diameter, p less than 0.02), but not if blood was applied 7 days later. Studies in 16 normal CCA's established that there was a considerable margin between the laser energy required to induce dilatation and that which caused perforation, providing that the fiber remained relatively central within the artery. Morphological examination demonstrated focal loss of endothelial cells immediately after laser application, followed approximately 7 days later by the development of areas of intimal hyperplasia. Only minimal changes were observed in the medial or adventitial layers. In a second study, the basilar artery of seven dogs was constricted chronically by two intracisternal injections of autologous blood 3 days apart. Five dogs received endovascular laser treatment 7 or 10 days after the first injection, when basilar artery diameter was reduced to a mean of 61% and 77% of control, respectively. Immediately following treatment, basilar artery diameter increased to 104% and 102% of resting diameter, respectively. Both untreated and laser-treated arteries were smaller than the control diameter at 30 days (80% and 82%, respectively), but in each group the vasodilatory response to hypercapnia was preserved. These findings indicate that 1-microsecond laser pulses are well tolerated by systemic and cerebral arteries in two different animal models, and suggest that the 480-nm pulsed-dye laser may have an application for the treatment or prophylaxis of cerebral vasospasm. 
Acute reversible hypoxemia in systemic lupus erythematosus. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of unexplained reversible hypoxemia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and to assess the relation between hypoxemia and elevated plasma levels of complement split products. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Inpatient and outpatient facilities of the New York University Medical Center/Bellevue Hospital and the Hospital for Joint Diseases. PATIENTS: Case patients were 22 patients hospitalized with disease exacerbation and no evidence of parenchymal lung disease on chest roentgenogram. Four patients with stable disease were followed in the outpatient clinic, and five healthy normal volunteers served as controls. MEASUREMENTS: Plasma levels of complement split products (C3a, factor Bb fragment), alveolar-arterial (A-a) Po2 gradients, and pulmonary function were measured. MAIN RESULTS: Nine episodes of hypoxemia or hypocapnia (mean A-a gradient, 30.4 +/- 4.8 mm Hg) or both (despite normal chest roentgenogram results) were noted in six hospitalized patients (group 1). Gas exchange improved within 72 hours of steroid therapy (mean A-a gradient, 11.6 +/- 4.3 mm Hg; P less than 0.01). These patients had an elevated initial mean C3a level (938.4 +/- 246.8 ng/mL) that decreased within 72 hours (407.8 +/- 80.9 ng/mL; P less than 0.01), concomitant with improved oxygenation. Ventilation-perfusion scans, obtained for four of six group 1 patients, excluded pulmonary emboli. Four hospitalized patients (group 2) had a normal A-a gradient (mean, 7.5 +/- 2.7 mm Hg). The mean C3a level of this group (358.3 +/- 39.2 ng/mL) was lower than that of group 1 (P less than 0.05). Four patients with stable disease (group 3) had a mean A-a gradient and a mean C3a level of 3.3 +/- 2.7 mm Hg and 237.8 +/- 105.7 ng/mL, respectively, similar to values found in five normal volunteers, in whom the mean A-a gradient was 3.7 +/- 1.7 mm Hg and the mean C3a level was 124.8 +/- 9.2 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: A syndrome of reversible hypoxemia, unassociated with parenchymal lung disease, is unexpectedly common in acutely ill, hospitalized patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is unclear, although the data are compatible with the hypothesis that hypoxemia may be related to pulmonary leukoaggregation. 
Enteral feeding as sole treatment for Crohn's disease: controlled trial of whole protein v amino acid based feed and a case study of dietary challenge. A controlled trial was performed to compare enteral feeding with either an amino acid based feed or a whole protein feed as sole treatment for active Crohn's disease. Twenty four patients were studied (nine with ileal, 11 with ileocolonic, and four with colonic disease). Both feeds proved effective; nine of 13 patients randomised to receive the amino acid based feed were in clinical remission within three weeks as defined by a simple activity index compared with eight of 11 treated with the whole protein feed. Patients in clinical remission were then crossed over onto the other feed. None of the six patients who were changed to the whole protein feed relapsed over the subsequent three week period compared with three of seven patients who were changed to the amino acid based feed. In responders the median serum C reactive protein concentration fell from 21 mg/l (range 9-82) on entry to 6 mg/l (range 3-19) at six weeks. Seven patients relapsed within eight months of starting solid food (mean 3.7 months), while nine were still in remission (follow up period 3-9 months, median six months). Detailed studies of staged reintroduction of food and permitted food additives were carried out over a four year period in a patient with extensive stricturing small bowel Crohn's disease who had been brought into remission by open treatment with enteral feeding. Carrageenan, other permitted emulsifiers, bread, meat, potatoes, oranges, refined sugar, dairy produce, flour, and rice were all reintroduced without any objective ill effect, but green vegetables provoked a clinical and biochemical relapse within one week of introduction. 
An open-label study of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in severe childhood asthma. Eight pediatric patients with severe steroid-dependent asthma were enrolled in an open-label trial of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in an attempt to decrease their steroid requirements. Monthly therapy with high-dose IVIG resulted in a threefold decrease in both maintenance oral corticosteroid dose and in extra oral corticosteroids needed for control of exacerbations of asthma. This was accompanied by significant improvements in peak expiratory flow rates and in symptom-score rating. An immunomodulatory effect of IVIG was suggested by the changes in immediate skin test reactivity. Seven of the eight patients demonstrated one or more reactions to a panel of allergens before therapy. During the course of the trial, there was a progressive diminution in skin test reactivity with a 100-fold reduction in sensitivity at the completion of 6 months of therapy. In this preliminary study, the reduction in steroid requirements, improvement in symptoms and peak flow measurements, and diminution in immediate skin test reactivity support a potential role for IVIG in the treatment of severe steroid-dependent asthma. A larger, randomized trial now appears warranted. 
Venous thromboembolism after brain tumor surgery: a retrospective review. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence rate of clinical postoperative deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in 1703 patients undergoing initial craniotomy for meningioma, glioma, or cerebral metastasis. The incidence rate of clinical thromboembolic complications was 1.59% for all tumor groups within the first 4 weeks of surgery. Patients undergoing surgery for meningiomas had a statistically significant increased risk of thromboembolism despite fewer overall perioperative risk factors, when compared with the other tumor groups. The tumor-specific incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism for meningioma, glioma, and metastasis were 3.09%, 0.97%, and 1.03%, respectively. Whether this difference was a result of increased surgical time or an inherent property of meningiomas could not be ascertained. 
Loss of heterozygosity suggests multiple genetic alterations in pheochromocytomas and medullary thyroid carcinomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific loci may help localize tumor suppressor genes involved in the formation of various familial and sporadic tumors. In addition, the genetic loci for a number of familial tumor syndromes have been mapped by linkage analysis. To explore the possible role of tumor suppressor genes in endocrine tumors, we tested 41 pheochromocytomas (34 sporadic and 7 familial) and 11 medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) (10 sporadic and 1 familial) for LOH near a variety of potentially important genetic loci: (a) the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) locus on chromosome 10; (b) the von Hippel-Lindau locus on 3p; and (c) the p53 and neurofibromatosis 1 loci on 17. We also examined chromosomes 1p and 22q because previous studies in a small number of pheochromocytomas and MTCs suggested LOH in these regions. Background rates for LOH were assessed using several "random" probes. Finally, we examined a number of clinical and histologic characteristics of these tumors for possible correlations with specific genetic alterations. LOH in the region of the MEN 2A locus was uncommon (0% for MTCs, 5% for pheochromocytomas). However, we found significant allelic losses in pheochromocytomas on chromosomes 1p (42%), 3p (16%), 17p (24%), and 22q (31%). We also noted a correlation between LOH on 1p and urinary excretion of metanephrine by these patients (P = 0.02). LOH on 1p, 3p, and 17p also appeared to be associated with increased tumor volume. Analysis of the smaller number of MTCs demonstrated allelic losses on chromosomes 1p and 22q. Our results suggest that tumor formation and/or progression in pheochromocytomas and MTCs involves multiple genes, analogous with the model proposed for colon carcinoma. 
Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Immunocytochemical study of 32 cases. To study the histogenesis of and determine the most useful markers for diagnosing anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), 32 cases, including 2 with numerous osteoclast-like cells, were stained with a battery of antibodies to epithelial (keratin, epithelial membrane antigen [EMA], carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]), mesenchymal (vimentin, desmin, muscle-specific actin [MSA], Factor VIII-related antigen [FVIII:RAg]), endocrine (thyroglobulin, calcitonin, chromogranin [Cg]), lymphocytic (leukocyte common antigen [LCA]), histiocytic (alpha-1-antitrypsin [alpha 1AT], alpha-1-antichymotrypsin [alpha 1AChy], KP1), melanocytic (HMB-45), and Schwann cell (S-100 protein) markers. Five tumors were associated with papillary carcinoma. In one of these cases, a morphologic continuum between the well-differentiated carcinoma and the ATC was visualized by their positive immunostaining for both vimentin and keratin, thus supporting the hypothesis that the latter tumor originated from the former. Twenty-five (78.1%) tumors expressed keratin, 10 (31.3%) reacted for EMA, and 3 (9.4%) expressed CEA, confirming the epithelial nature of this neoplasm. Reactivity for thyroglobulin was seen in a small number of cells in five (15.6%) thyroglobulin was seen in a small number of cells in five (15.6%) ATCs. Because all of the cases that expressed keratin also stained positively for EMA, CEA, or thyroglobulin, it is believed that keratin is the most useful epithelial marker for diagnosis of ATC. A lack of reactivity for calcitonin and Cg indicates that these tumors are not derived from C cells, as has been proposed by some authors. Reactivity for KP1 (CD68), a monoclonal antibody that reacts with a macrophage-associated antigen, occurred in the osteoclast-like cells but not in the anaplastic tumor cells. This finding, together with negative keratin staining of the osteoclast-like cells, indicates that these cells are not epithelial in nature and therefore should be considered reactive rather than neoplastic. Thirty tumors (93.8%) expressed vimentin, 15 (46.9%) marked for alpha 1AChy, 11 (34.4%) exhibited alpha 1AT, and 11 (34.4%) expressed S-100 protein. Because all of these markers can be seen in a wide variety of tumors of different histogeneses, they have no value in the diagnosis of ATC. Although immunostaining for FVIII:RAg, desmin, and MSA was negative in all of these tumors, these markers can help to differentiate between ATCs and some soft tissue sarcomas with which they can be confused. 
Acute appendicitis following blunt abdominal trauma. Incidence or coincidence? Inflammation of the appendix is a common cause of acute abdominal pain. The etiology and pathophysiology of appendicitis have been well described. The initiating factor often is obstruction of the appendiceal lumen by inspissated stool, barium, food, parasites, or hyperplastic lymphoid tissue. Two patients have been identified who developed appendicitis temporally related to blunt abdominal trauma, without other clear etiology. Although absolute documentation of trauma as an etiologic factor in these cases is difficult, theoretical mechanisms for the occurrence are discussed. In the setting of right lower quadrant pain following mild to moderate blunt abdominal trauma, acute appendicitis should be considered as a possibility. 
Continuous interleukin-2 and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as treatment of advanced melanoma. A national biotherapy study group trial. Melanoma metastases were harvested from 82 patients for the purpose of growing and expanding tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Tumor tissue cell suspensions were incubated with interleukin-2 (IL-2), followed by repeated exposure to tumor antigen with or without OKT3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb). Initial growth success was achieved in 56 of 82 cultures (72%). Efforts were made to expand 26 of these 56 cultures for therapeutic TIL; 23 of 26 early cultures (88%) were successfully expanded for in vivo therapy. It took a mean of 78.5 +/- 25.4 days to grow sufficient TIL for treatment. Therapy included cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2) on day 1, followed by a 96-hour continuous infusion of IL-2 (18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d) on days 2 to 5, and approximately 10(11) (mean 1.49 +/- 0.93 x 10(11)) TIL on day 2. Patients who responded received monthly IL-2 as a 96-hour infusion. Median patient age was 45 years of age. Sixty-seven percent of the patients were men. Performance status was 0 to 1 in 77% of patients. Thirty-four percent of the patients had liver metastases. The usual IL-2 toxicities were seen. Response rate for 21 patients was 24% (95% confidence interval, 10% to 49%). One complete response was achieved with cells 98% CD4+; four partial responses were achieved with cells 80%, 94%, 98%, and 98% CD8+, respectively. Four of eight patients who received TIL, which had never been stimulated with OKT3, had tumor response. The authors conclude that a treatment plan for IL-2/TIL is technically difficult, costly, and effective for only a minority of patients. Overall, clinical results are not clearly superior to those obtained with other IL-2 regimens. 
Somatosensory function following dorsal root entry zone lesions in patients with neurogenic pain or spasticity. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesioning procedure, microsurgical DREZ-otomy (MDT), on spinal cord somatosensory function based on peri- and intraoperative clinical and electrophysiological data. The study was performed prospectively on a series of 20 patients suffering from either chronic neurogenic pain or spasticity. Physiological observations were made of the intraoperative evoked electrospinographic recordings as collected from the surface of the spinal cord. The MDT procedure produced analgesia or severe hypalgesia, moderate hypesthesia, and only slight deficits in proprioception and cutaneous spatial discrimination on the body segments operated on. These clinical data correlated well with evoked electrospinographic recordings, which showed a moderate effect of MDT on presynaptic compound action potentials recorded from the spinal cord (N11 and N21), a partial or even reversible effect on the cortical postcentral N20 wave, a more marked effect on the postsynaptic dorsal horn waves N13 and N24 related to large primary afferent fibers, and a disappearance of dorsal horn waves related to finer afferents (N2 and possibly N3). These data provide evidence for an acceptably selective action of MDT on spinal cord nociceptive mechanisms, and for a partial, often slight, involvement of the other somatosensory domains. The presence of abnormal evoked electrospinographic waves is discussed in relation to the mechanisms of neurogenic pain and spasticity. The hypothesis of a "retuning" of the dorsal horn as the mode of action of MDT is presented. 
A prospective study of aspirin use and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women OBJECTIVE. The aim of the study was to examine prospectively the association between regular aspirin use and the risk of a first myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events in women. DESIGN. Prospective cohort study including 6 years of follow-up. SETTING. Registered nurses residing in 11 US states. PARTICIPANTS. US registered nurses (n = 87,678) aged 34 to 65 years and free of diagnosed coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer at baseline. Followup was 96.7% of total potential person-years of follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, and all important vascular events. RESULTS. During 475,265 person-years of follow-up, we documented 240 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 146 nonfatal strokes, and 130 deaths due to cardiovascular disease (total, 516 important vascular events). Among women who reported taking one through six aspirin per week, the age-adjusted relative risk (RR) of a first myocardial infarction was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 0.89; P = .005), as compared with those women who took no aspirin. After simultaneous adjustment for risk factors for coronary disease, the RR was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.99; P = .04). For women aged 50 years and older, the age-adjusted RR was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.84; P = .002) and the multivariate RR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.50 to 0.93; P = .02). We observed no alteration in the risk of stroke (multivariate RR = 0.99; P = .94). The multivariate RR of cardiovascular death was 0.89 (P = .56) and of important vascular events was 0.85 (P = .12). When examined separately, the results were nearly identical for the subgroups who took one through three and four through six aspirin per week. Among women who took seven or more aspirin per week, there were no apparent reductions in risk. CONCLUSIONS. The use of one through six aspirin per week appears to be associated with a reduced risk of a first myocardial infarction among women. A randomized trial in women is necessary, however, to provide conclusive data on the role of aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women. 
National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group Report on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy This consensus report focuses the presentation, pathophysiology, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy expanding on recommendations first presented in 1988 by the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Practicing physicians should determine whether a patient's hypertension during pregnancy falls into the classification of (1) chronic hypertension, (2) preeclampsia, (3) preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension, or (4) transient hypertension. The distinction, for management considerations, is made between hypertension that is present before pregnancy (chronic and preexisting) and that occurring as part of the pregnancy-specific condition preeclampsia. When maternal blood pressure reaches diastolic levels of 100 mm Hg or greater, treatment should be instituted to avoid hypertensive vascular damage. The report includes a discussion of antihypertensive therapy specific to the chronic or acute hypertension occurring concomitantly with pregnancy. The roles of calcium supplementation and low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia and chronic and transient hypertension are under investigation. 
Globoid cell leukodystrophy: a family with both late-infantile and adult type. We present a patient with adult-onset globoid cell leukodystrophy (GBL) who had almost complete deficiency of galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase. A brother of the index patient deteriorated neurologically and died at the age of 4, probably from the late-infantile form of the disease. In this family, two clinical types of GBL are probably different expressions of an identical genotype. 
Elimination of clonogenic breast cancer cells from human bone marrow. A comparison of immunotoxin treatment with chemoimmunoseparation using 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, monoclonal antibodies, and magnetic microspheres. Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) may aid in the management of breast cancer, but is currently limited to patients without bone marrow metastases. In earlier studies, 5 logs of malignant clonogenic breast cancer cells could be eliminated from human bone marrow using a combination of chemoseparation with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) and immunoseparation with monoclonal antibodies and magnetic microspheres. In this report the authors compare chemoimmunoseparation to treatment with immunotoxins for elimination of tumor cells from human bone marrow and for the preservation of normal precursors. Breast cancer cells from each of five cell lines were mixed with a tenfold excess of irradiated human bone marrow cells. Treatment with a combination of five immunotoxins reduced clonogenic tumor cell growth by 1.8 to 5.5 logs depending upon the cell line. With two of the five cell lines, clonogenic tumor cells were eliminated quantitatively. Using the CAMA-1 breast cancer cell line, treatment with multiple immunotoxins was compared with chemoimmunoseparation with 4-HC, a panel of five unconjugated monoclonal antibodies and magnetic microspheres. Chemoimmunoseparation eliminated 3.5 to 5.4 logs of malignant cells, while preserving 21% of Colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and 37% of burst-forming unit-erythrocyte (BFU-E). No clonogenic breast cancer cells could be detected. Immunotoxin treatment eliminated 2.2 to 5.4 logs of clonogenic breast cancer cells, but had no effect on the bone marrow precursors. In seven of ten experiments, however, clonogenic breast cancer cells remained after immunotoxin treatment. Consequently, treatment with 4-HC, multiple murine monoclonal antibodies and magnetic microspheres provided more consistent elimination of tumor cells than separation with immunotoxins, but was significantly more toxic for marrow precursors. 
Low-back pain in adolescent athletes: detection of stress injury to the pars interarticularis with SPECT. The authors reviewed 1 year of experience with planar and single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) bone scintigraphy in 162 young patients with symptoms of low-back pain possibly related to stress injury to the pars interarticularis or spondylolysis. Planar scintigraphy and SPECT revealed no abnormality in 91 patients (56%). All abnormalities detected on planar images were also detectable with SPECT. SPECT showed an abnormal focus of radiotracer uptake in the lumbar spine in 71 patients (44%). In 32 of these 71 patients, these findings were also evident with planar scintigraphy. In 39 of these 71 patients, use of SPECT. Correlation with contemporaneous radiographs was made in 72 cases (including computed tomography in 10 cases). SPECT can be used to detect stress injury not seen with planar bone imaging or radiography and is recommended in evaluation of low-back pain in young athletes. 
Sucralfate retention enemas in solitary rectal ulcer. The conservative treatment of solitary rectal ulcer is generally unsatisfactory. Six patients, aged 27-54 years, with recurrent solitary rectal ulcer were treated with topical administration of sucralfate in a daily dose of 2 g twice a day for 6 weeks. Four patients experienced complete relief of symptoms and the remaining two patients had marked improvement. Although macroscopic healing of the ulcer was apparent in all, histologic improvement was not appreciable. Five of the six patients remain in remission during a follow-up period of 4-14 months (mean, 8 +/- 1.5 months). Recurrence was observed in one patient at 5 months, which satisfactorily resolved with sucralfate enemas. From these preliminary observations we infer that solitary rectal ulcer can be effectively treated with topical application of sucralfate. 
Relation between mixed venous oxygen saturation and cardiac index. Nonlinearity and normalization for oxygen uptake and hemoglobin. The ability of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) monitoring to reflect changes in cardiac index (CI) with therapy in critically ill patients is unclear. To this end, SvO2 and CI were measured before and during an infusion of enoximone and/or dobutamine in 30 patients with advanced heart failure. A nonlinear relationship was observed between SvO2 and CI with the nonlinear correlation coefficient being 0.52. On normalizing for individual differences in hemoglobin and oxygen consumption, this correlation coefficient became 0.90. Further analysis of individual data was performed using linear regression, and the slopes and correlation coefficients were found to span a wide range slope: -10.0 to 30.9 min-m2/L, r: -0.27 to 0.99). However, the mean slope and correlation coefficient for patients with baseline CI and SvO2 less than 21/min/m2 and less than 55 percent were 18.3 min-m2/L and 0.87, respectively, while those for the remainder of patients were only 3.1 min-m2/L and 0.42, respectively. Thus, the nonlinear correlation coefficient of the SvO2-CI relationship in a group of patients is dependent on the homogeneity of their oxygen consumption and hemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, the ability of SvO2 to serve as a therapeutic indicator in any given patient is dependent on baseline SvO2 and CI. 
Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy in the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia. A group of 54 patients with acute or chronic limb ischaemia were initially treated with low dose intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy using streptokinase (10,000 units h-1) or plasminogen activator (0.5 mg h-1). Complete thrombolysis was obtained in 90 per cent of patients with symptoms of less than 1 week duration, and in 50 per cent with symptoms of greater than 1 week (P less than 0.05). Successful lysis in 36 patients was followed by successful bypass surgery in seven, percutaneous angioplasty in 13, no further treatment in 13, repeat thrombolysis in two and amputation in one. Failed therapy was associated with major amputation in 40 per cent. One patient died of haemorrhage and another of stroke as a direct result of thrombolytic treatment. The most common complication was haematoma at the site of cannulation of the vessel. Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy can be very useful for the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia, but complications do occur and patients should be carefully selected. 
Comparison of the effects of ureteral calculosis and occlusion on muscular sensitivity to painful stimulation in rats. An animal model of muscular hyperalgesia was developed. In humans, this disorder follows painful crises due to ureteral calculosis. Changes in vocalization thresholds to electrical stimulation of the obliquus externus muscle of both sides were studied in a group of rats with chronically implanted muscles before and after the production of a stone in one ureter. In another group of rats with implanted muscles, it had been verified preliminarily that these thresholds did not vary widely from day to day. On the contrary, a significant lowering in threshold (max 31%) in the muscle ipsilateral to the implanted ureter appeared the day after the production of the stone and persisted for the subsequent 10 days of observation, although less pronounced during the last 5 days. Hypersensitivity to manual pressure was also observed, mainly in the ipsilateral muscle, in most rats during the same period. In order to differentiate between the effects due to the presence of the stone in the ureteral lumen and those due to the spontaneous occlusion which frequently occurred in the implanted ureter, 2 other groups of rats were studied. In one, a unilateral ureteral ligature was performed; in the other, the production of a stone was combined with a ligature (placed distally to the stone). Ligature alone never induced any hyperalgesic effect. Stone plus ligature produced a marked hyperalgesia (max 39%) in the ipsilateral muscle, which lasted for only 5 days. It is concluded that the ureteral stone is the factor responsible for the appearance of muscular hyperalgesia. 
Genetic aspects of admissions to a paediatric intensive care unit. Of 821 consecutive admissions to a paediatric intensive care unit, 47 (5.7%) were for chromosomal or monogenic disorders. These patients had more readmissions, longer mean stays, and a higher mortality rate than the group as a whole. In two of the four cases that died of single gene disorders, failure to store DNA made genetic counseling difficult. 
Late follow-up of carotid endarterectomy with venous patch angioplasty. Ninety carotid endarterectomies with venous patch angioplasty were performed in 83 patients between July 1980 and December 1985. The primary indication for patching was a small-caliber internal carotid artery (ICA) with a diameter less than 3.0 mm in 54 arteriotomies (60%). Patency of the endarterectomy was evaluated by completion arteriography in all instances. Follow-up was conducted after an intermediate postoperative period of 21 +/- 12.5 months in 69 sides by arteriography. A late follow-up was conducted at 55.4 +/- 11.2 months either by arteriography (in 45 sides) or by carotid duplex scanning (in 11 sides). Twenty-one patients with 23 endarterectomies died, only 1 of a cerebral event. Seven patients moved or refused study and five were lost to follow-up. Three recurrent stenoses and five carotid occlusions developed by the time of the intermediate follow-up. By the time of late follow-up, three additional patients developed recurrent stenoses. Our results suggest that recurrent stenosis continues to develop with a longer period of follow-up in patients undergoing venous patch angioplasty with carotid endarterectomy. 
Headaches due to cerebrovascular disease. Subarachnoid hemorrhage causes sudden, severe headache and requires immediate medical and surgical diagnosis and treatment. A CT scan is the first choice for correct diagnosis. In order to prevent rebleeding, delays in treatment should be avoided. Intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage is now often recognized by means of CT scanning and sometimes is a cause of headache. Cerebellar hemorrhage commonly causes occipital headache and is an indication for immediate surgical intervention, although small cerebellar hemorrhages can be treated conservatively. Ischemic cerebrovascular disease is frequently accompanied by headache, but its etiology remains uncertain. Thrombosis of the cerebrovenous system is a less frequent cause of head pain than that of the arterial system, but it usually shows characteristic neurologic signs. Following carotid endarterectomy or superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass surgery, the patient may have moderate to severe unilateral headaches, probably as a result of platelet aggregation and serotonin release. 
Sodium and volume sensitivity of blood pressure. Age and pressure change over time. Salt sensitivity has been implicated in the age-related increase in blood pressure. We studied the reproducibility of a rapid method for assessing sodium sensitivity and resistance of blood pressure as well as the effect of age on this phenomenon. Blood pressure after volume expansion with 2 l intravenous saline (0.9%) over 4 hours was compared with that after 1 day of 10 mmol sodium chloride intake and 3 and 40 mg oral doses of furosemide. Normal and hypertensive subjects (n = 28) were studied twice within a year. Cross-sectional observations of the effect of age were made from studies in 230 hypertensive and 430 normotensive subjects. Longitudinal observations of blood pressure change over time were made 10 or more years after categorization of sodium responsivity in 31 subjects. The blood pressure response was reproducible in 28 subjects studied twice (r = 0.56, p less than 0.002). Four subjects changed salt-responsiveness status and six were indeterminate on restudy. Sodium sensitivity of blood pressure increased significantly with increasing age in the entire population (n = 660, r = -0.38, p less than 0.001). The relation was more striking in hypertensive subjects (n = 230, r = -0.31, p less than 0.001) in whom a progressive increase in salt sensitivity with decades was seen than in the normotensive group (n = 430, r = -0.19, p less than 0.01) in whom salt sensitivity was not observed until the sixth decade. Salt-sensitive subjects had a significantly greater increase in systolic (p less than 0.001) and diastolic (p less than 0.01) pressure over time than those who were salt-resistant. Salt sensitivity is a reproducible phenomenon that is related to the age-associated increase in blood pressure characteristic of industrialized societies. In addition, salt sensitivity can be shown to be a predictor of subsequent, age-related blood pressure increase. 
Aztreonam in the treatment of gram-negative bacterial meningitis. Aztreonam was administered to 122 patients with presumptive or confirmed gram-negative bacillary meningitis in an open, multinational study. The antibiotic was administered at a dosage of 1-2 g to adults, 50 mg/kg to children greater than 2 years old, and 30 mg/kg to infants three or four times daily. Seventy-seven patients had microbiologically confirmed gram-negative meningitis due to an aztreonam-susceptible organism and received aztreonam for at least 48 hours. Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequently recovered pathogen (40 patients), followed by Enterobacteriaceae (16 patients), Neisseria meningitidis (15 patients), and Pseudomonas species (six patients). All but four patients were microbiologically cured. Microbiologic failure was associated with either a persistent intracerebral abscess (one patient) or a foreshortened course of therapy before microbiologic reevaluation and death (at 48 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours after initiation of treatment, respectively). These data suggest that aztreonam is effective in the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis caused by susceptible organisms. 
The clinical significance and pathophysiology of stress-related gastric mucosal hemorrhage. Critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) develop a spectrum of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions that may result in mucosal hemorrhage and subsequent morbidity and mortality. Although stress-related mucosal lesions may be detected endoscopically in most critically ill patients, the incidence of clinically significant bleeding from these lesions is difficult to establish because of the heterogeneity in patient populations, the definitions of bleeding, and the methods of monitoring in various studies. Bleeding occurs overall in approximately 16% of patients not receiving prophylaxis, but the incidence of life-threatening hemorrhage appears to be much lower (less than 6%). In light of the increasing use of pharmacologic prophylaxis in ICUs, the clinical impact of stress-related bleeding and its prophylaxis is discussed in terms of bleeding incidence, morbidity and mortality, cost, and potential side effects. The pathophysiology of stress-related mucosal ulceration involves the complex interaction of gastric luminal factors, alterations in blood flow and intramucosal pH, and alterations in numerous factors that are normally responsible for maintaining an intact mucosa. The pathophysiology of stress ulceration is discussed, with an emphasis on cause-and-effect relationships, evolving areas of investigation, and implications for prophylaxis and treatment. 
Cervical paraganglioma with subsequent intracranial and intraspinal metastases. Case report. Paragangliomas, tumors derived from the extra-adrenal paraganglion system, have commonly been found in the retroperitoneum, abdomen, mediastinum, skull base, and neck. Rare intraspinal cases have included involvement of the cauda equina and filum terminale, and a recent case has been reported of thoracic cord paraganglioma with metastasis to the cauda equina. The authors present the case of a patient with a cervical paraganglioma who underwent subtotal resection followed by postoperative irradiation; she subsequently developed multiple intracranial and intraspinal metastases 7 months following the first decompression procedure. 
Comparison of different antibiotic regimens for therapy of 32 cases of Q fever endocarditis. We studied 32 cases of Q fever endocarditis diagnosed in France between January 1985 and December 1989 to evaluate the efficacies of the different regimens of antibiotics used for treatment. Each patient was monitored during the treatment (range, 12 to 60 months), and clinical and biological information was computerized. Various treatments were prescribed, including doxycycline alone (9 cases) or in association with rifampin (4 cases), quinolones (16 cases), or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (1 case). Two patients died before the beginning of the treatment. Nineteen patients had hemodynamic failure and subsequently underwent valve replacement. Nine valve tissue cultures were positive despite previous antibiotic treatment. In terms of their effects on mortality, the difference between doxycycline alone and doxycycline plus quinolones is statistically significant. We conclude that the addition of quinolones to doxycycline is beneficial. On the basis of clinical, serological, and valve tissue culture results, no treatment was able to cure Q fever endocarditis within 2 years, even with a combination of antibiotics. We advise a minimum duration of treatment of 3 years with therapy combining quinolones and doxycycline. 
How prevalent is cancer family syndrome? Based on an established but pragmatic definition of cancer family syndrome as the presence of three or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer in a first degree kinship, the contribution of this syndrome to the total cancer burden in Northern Ireland has been studied by investigating all non-polyposis probands under 55 years old at histological diagnosis between 1976 and 1978. Family interviews were possible for 95% (n = 205) of all non-polyposis probands and verification of vital status or medical history was obtained for 98% of 1811 first degree relatives. The prevalence of cancer family syndrome was between 1 and 2%, a figure some fivefold less than that estimated elsewhere. A proximal tumour excess was not characteristic of the ascertained families. These results may have implications for the identification of susceptible people if screening for high risk groups is considered a worthwhile option for reducing colorectal cancer mortality in the United Kingdom. 
Percutaneous transjugular portosystemic shunt. OBJECTIVE.--To determine the effectiveness of the Palmaz balloon expandable stent for the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. The device is designed to achieve portal decompression in patients with variceal hemorrhage secondary to portal hypertension. DESIGN.--Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting was performed in eight patients during a 9-month period. Mean follow-up was 5 months. PATIENTS.--All patients had cirrhosis with portal hypertension and varices. Bleeding occurred in seven patients from esophageal varices and in one patient from hemorrhoids. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Shunt patency and recurrent variceal hemorrhage. RESULTS.--Shunts created from a transjugular approach between a hepatic and a portal vein (diameters of 8 to 12 mm) lowered the average portosystemic pressure gradient from 36 to 11 mm Hg. Mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.7 days. Complete variceal decompression after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement was identified endoscopically in all eight patients. The patient treated for hemorrhoids rebled and was treated successfully by transfemoral balloon expansion of the shunt diameter from 8 to 12 mm. All shunts were patent at 1 to 9 months (mean, 5 months) of follow-up. CONCLUSION.--Initial results suggest that transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is a safe and effective method of portal decompression for the treatment of variceal hemorrhage. 
Effects of dietary Ca2+ on erythrocyte Na(+)-transport systems in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 1. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of dietary Ca2+ intake on blood pressure and erythrocyte Na+ transport in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 2. Spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats were fed diets with three different Ca2+ contents, 0.1% (low-Ca2+ diet), 0.6% (normal-Ca2+ diet) and 4.0% (high-Ca2+ diet), between 6 and 20 weeks of age. At 20 weeks of age, the levels of erythrocyte Na+ efflux, as well as Na+ and K+ contents in erythrocytes, were measured. 3. On the low-Ca2+ diet, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed an enhancement of hypertension. Conversely, on the high-Ca2+ diet, they showed an attenuation of the increase in blood pressure. Spontaneously hypertensive rats had a lower erythrocyte Na+ content and increased activity of the Na+ pump at higher levels of dietary Ca2+. Passive Na+ permeability and Na(+)-K+ co-transport were similar in spontaneously hypertensive rats on the low-, normal- and high-Ca2+ diets. There were no significant differences in blood pressure and in Na+ pump activity in WKY on the three different diets. 4. It is concluded that dietary Ca2+ might affect the regulation of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats by changing the activity of Na+ pump in the cell membrane. 
Incidence and characteristics of preventable iatrogenic cardiac arrests We studied the contribution of iatrogenic illness to cardiac arrest among patients hospitalized in 1981 in a university teaching hospital. During this 1-year period, 28 (14%) of 203 arrests in which resuscitation was attempted followed an iatrogenic complication. Seventeen (61%) of the 28 patients died. The demographic characteristics of patients with iatrogenic arrest did not differ strikingly from those of other patients who arrested. However, patients with iatrogenic arrest were less likely to be in cardiogenic shock or to have suffered an acute myocardial infarction prior to arrest. They were more likely to survive to discharge from the hospital and to be taking digoxin or antiarrhythmic medication prior to arrest. Among the 28 cases of iatrogenic cardiac arrest, 18 (9% of all arrests) might have been prevented by stricter attention to the patient's history, findings on physical examination, and laboratory data. The most common causes of potentially preventable arrest were medication errors and toxic effects (44%) as well as suboptimal response by physicians to clinical signs and symptoms (28%), most frequently dyspnea and tachypnea. Rapid, appropriate response to abnormal drug levels, to electrocardiographic signs of adverse drug effects, and to signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure or toxic effects from digoxin might decrease the incidence of cardiac arrest among hospitalized patients. 
Nutritional support of patients with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. Malnutrition is extremely common in patients with malignant disease. Whereas the causes are multifactorial, the predominant factor is the imbalance between nutrient intake and host nutrient requirements. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that cachexia is related to abnormal changes in host intermediary metabolism induced by host-tumor interactions, and endogenous peptides such as TNF may be important mediators. The role of nutritional therapy in cancer patients remains to be defined. Clearly, patients with severe malnutrition benefit from nutritional intervention. However, the benefit of nutritional therapy in less severe cases of malnutrition as an adjuvant to oncologic therapy has yet to be established. 
Age-related normal values of signal-averaged electrocardiographic variables after acute myocardial infarction. The study examined standard time domain variables of a signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) in 328 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. The correlation of these variables with age and the influence of age on the prediction of postinfarction arrhythmic complication (sudden death [n = 12] or sustained ventricular tachycardia, or both [n = 14]) from the SAECG were investigated. Statistically highly significant correlations (p less than or equal to 0.00002) between age and SAECG variables were found. Compared with patients aged less than 60 years, the SAECG-based stratification of arrhythmic complications after myocardial infarction in patients greater than 60 years had lower sensitivity for the same values of specificity and lower specificity for the same values of sensitivity. 
Factors influencing the outcome of congenital heart disease detected prenatally. The diagnosis of structural heart disease before birth is associated with a poor prognosis. Of 222 continuing pregnancies seen in a 10 year period, there has been a 79% mortality. This is inconsistent with published results and current concepts of the outcome for children with cardiac malformation. Of the 222, death occurred in intrauterine life in 57, 87 died as neonates, and 31 in infancy or childhood. There are 47 survivors of whom only five have survived beyond 4 years. Factors influencing the outcome in these cases were examined further. A high mortality was associated with the presence of extracardiac anomalies in 71 (32%) and prenatal cardiac failure in 28 (13%). As many patients were referred for these reasons, referral methods preferentially select patients with a different range of heart disease from that seen postnatally. In addition, some forms of heart disease progress in severity during fetal life. Those involved in the management and counselling after diagnosis of heart disease in early pregnancy must be aware of the additional prenatal factors influencing prognosis and allow for them in making predictions of outcome. 
Proliferation of endocrine cells in the rat stomach caused by drug-induced achlorhydria. Time-related changes of serum gastrin levels, gastrin cell, and enterochromaffinlike cell densities, and proliferation kinetics of these cells have been examined in rats during treatment with the substituted benzimidazole BY 308 over a period of 73 days. Serum gastrin levels increased very rapidly from 74 +/- 6 pg/mL (controls) to 438 +/- 31 pg/mL (day 1) and 727 +/- 68 pg/mL (day 4). Thereafter, a steady increase was observed until day 70 (2097 +/- 208 pg/mL). Enterochromaffinlike cell density was unchanged until day 10, but then increased progressively without reaching a plateau (144% above control on day 73). The labeling index of these cells was enhanced shortly after drug application and remained on a constant elevated level from day 14 to day 73 (about 10-fold to 12-fold above controls from day 14 to day 70). The number of gastrin cells increased rapidly within the first week and reached a plateau after 17 days (96% increase above controls). In contrast to enterochromaffinlike cells, the labeling index did not change immediately but increased on day 7 by 37% and returned beneath control values after day 28. The results suggest that in drug-induced achlorhydria, the progressive increase of enterochromaffinlike cells is explained by an enhanced mitosis, whereas other factors in addition to proliferation are responsible for the augmentation of gastrin cells. 
Independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in French drinkers. The aim of this study was to assess whether markers of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection are independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in drinkers after adjustment for three known risk factors: cirrhosis, age and male sex. Among 2,015 consecutive drinkers admitted, hepatitis C virus antibodies were found by sensitive radioimmunoassay in 1,259. The following five factors have been identified and ranked as risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in unidimensional and regression analysis: cirrhosis (p less than 0.001), age (p less than 0.001), male sex (p less than 0.001), presence of HBsAg (p less than 0.001) and presence of hepatitis C virus antibodies (p less than 0.03). Among drinkers with cirrhosis, the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were older (64 +/- 11 yr vs. 56 +/- 9 yr; p less than 0.001), were more often male (93% vs. 65%; p less than 0.0001) and had higher prevalence of HBsAg (9% vs. 2%; p = 0.02) and hepatitis C virus antibodies (41% vs. 26%; p = 0.02). A simple algorithm permitted us to identify a high-risk population of drinkers: the male cirrhotic patient older than 50 yr. The relative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in this selected population was 17.7 (95% confidence interval = 9.0 to 37.5; p less than 0.0001). From a pragmatic point of view, the detection of HBsAg or hepatitis C virus antibodies, although independently associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, is not useful in increasing the diagnostic value of this algorithm because of the poor sensitivity of these tests. The weak relationships observed between hepatitis C virus antibodies and hepatocellular carcinoma needs confirmation by more accurate tests. 
Antiphospholipid antibodies in cerebral ischemia. In a 2-year prospective study of 146 patients with cerebral ischemia, we compared vascular risk factors for stroke with clinical and laboratory findings, particularly antiphospholipid antibodies. Ten patients (6.8%) were positive for at least one antiphospholipid antibody; one patient had systemic lupus erythematosus, one had rheumatoid arthritis, and the remaining eight fulfilled criteria for the diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome. These patients were predominantly male, not necessarily young, and 50% of them did not have any other vascular risk factors; there were no significant clinical or paraclinical differences between these patients and those without antiphospholipid antibodies. Outcome in the 10 patients was good, and platelet antiaggregating drugs proved to be useful in preventing further cerebrovascular ischemic events in our patients. 
Rectosigmoid varices and other mucosal changes in patients with portal hypertension. A prospective study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of anorectal varices and their clinical significance as well as to study other proctosigmoidoscopic changes in 75 patients with portal hypertension of diverse etiology. Sixty-seven patients (89.3%) had lower gastrointestinal varices with no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) in prevalence between cirrhosis (92.1%), noncirrhotic portal fibrosis (87%), and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (85.7%). The rectum was the most common site of lower gastrointestinal varices. External anal and sigmoid colonic varices almost always occurred in the presence of rectal and/or internal anal varices. There was no correlation between the presence of rectosigmoid varices and the severity of esophagogastric mucosal changes or portal hypertension. There was no suggestion that esophageal variceal sclerotherapy influenced the presence of anorectal varices. Seven patients (9.3%) had recent hematochezia, including three patients in whom it occurred in the absence of any upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Varices were the cause of bleeding in at least five patients. An abnormal mucosal vascular pattern in the form of telangiectasias or spiders was seen, irrespective of etiology of portal hypertension, in nine patients (12%). Hemorrhoids were present in 31 patients (41.3%) with an age-related difference (p less than 0.05) between patients with cirrhosis (55.3%) and extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (21.4%). 
Revascularization of infarcted myocardium. Effect on myocardial perfusion assessed with quantified Tl-201 SPECT technique. Myocardial perfusion was studied in 21 patients before and after revascularization of all graftable stenotic vessels following post-infarction anteroapical akinesia and minor dyskinesia. At preoperative and late postoperative evaluation, perfusion abnormalities in identified sectors were quantified with two methods, one (Q1) assessing the extent and the other (Q3) the severity of abnormal perfusion. The preoperative scores with both methods indicated permanent myocardial perfusion defects in all 21 patients and reversible defects, indicating myocardial ischemia, in 16 with Q1 and 14 with Q3. After bypass grafting there was overall reduction of myocardial perfusion defect and of abnormality scores: Notably, 13/21 patients (62%) had decreased permanent myocardial defect score, reflecting reactivation of 'hibernating myocardium'. The findings indicated that obstructed but graftable vessels supplying myocardium with loss of contractile function should be bypassed, since flow contribution to distant, viable myocardium is probable via preserved collateral circulation. This should be particularly relevant for the LAD, because of that artery's septal branches. 
Atrial fibrillation as an independent risk factor for stroke: the Framingham Study. The impact of nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac failure on stroke incidence was examined in 5,070 participants in the Framingham Study after 34 years of follow-up. Compared with subjects free of these conditions, the age-adjusted incidence of stroke was more than doubled in the presence of coronary heart disease (p less than 0.001) and more than trebled in the presence of hypertension (p less than 0.001). There was a more than fourfold excess of stroke in subjects with cardiac failure (p less than 0.001) and a near fivefold excess when atrial fibrillation was present (p less than 0.001). In persons with coronary heart disease or cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation doubled the stroke risk in men and trebled the risk in women. With increasing age the effects of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac failure on the risk of stroke became progressively weaker (p less than 0.05). Advancing age, however, did not reduce the significant impact of atrial fibrillation. For persons aged 80-89 years, atrial fibrillation was the sole cardiovascular condition to exert an independent effect on stroke incidence (p less than 0.001). The attributable risk of stroke for all cardiovascular contributors decreased with age except for atrial fibrillation, for which the attributable risk increased significantly (p less than 0.01), rising from 1.5% for those aged 50-59 years to 23.5% for those aged 80-89 years. While these findings highlight the impact of each cardiovascular condition on the risk of stroke, the data suggest that the elderly are particularly vulnerable to stroke when atrial fibrillation is present. 
Rubella susceptibility of an infertile population. The recent trend reported by the CDC reaffirms that rubella continues to be a health care issue and should be a concern particularly for those who care for women in the childbearing age group. Immunization of all susceptible women will not only offer them protection but reduce the pool of susceptible individuals that can transmit the disease. 
Analysis of the colonoscopic findings in patients with rectal bleeding according to the pattern of their presenting symptoms. Patients presenting with rectal bleeding were prospectively categorized according to the pattern of their presentation into those with outlet bleeding (n = 115), suspicious bleeding (n = 59), hemorrhage (n = 27), and occult bleeding (n = 68). All patients underwent colonoscopy and this was complete in 94 percent. There were 34 patients with carcinoma and 69 with adenomas greater than 1 cm diameter. The percentage of neoplasms proximal to the splenic flexure was 1 percent in outlet bleeding, 24 percent with suspicious bleeding, 75 percent with hemorrhage, and 73 percent with occult bleeding. Barium enema was available in 78 patients and was falsely positive for neoplasms in 21 percent and falsely negative in 45 percent. Colonoscopy is the investigation of choice in patients with suspicious, occult, or severe rectal bleeding. Bleeding of a typical outlet pattern may be investigated by flexible sigmoidoscopy. 
Long-term (2 year) beneficial effects of beta-adrenergic blockade with bucindolol in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Beta-adrenergic blockade represents a promising therapeutic approach to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Bucindolol, a new beta-blocker, showed favorable effects in a short-term (3 month) trial in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. To assess long-term response, 20 study patients (7 of 9 patients previously assigned to the placebo group and 13 of 14 patients previously assigned to bucindolol therapy) received long-term bucindolol therapy and were followed up for a mean of 23 +/- 4 months (range 17 to 30). The mean patient age was 49 years (range 29 to 66) and the median duration of disease was 11 months (range 1 to 190). Ten patients were in functional class II and 10 were in class III; 15 patients were men. At the end of the common follow-up time, all 20 patients were alive, 17 continued to receive bucindolol (mean dose 176 mg/day, range 25 to 200), and 2 underwent cardiac transplantation. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from a baseline value of 25 +/- 8% to 35 +/- 13% (n = 19 pairs, p less than 0.001). Functional class improved in 12, was unchanged in 5 and deteriorated in 3 (p = 0.056). Exercise time was maintained (9.4 +/- 3.1 versus 9.1 +/- 3.5 min, n = 19, p = NS), as was maximal oxygen uptake (19.2 +/- 4.9 versus 18.8 +/- 5.7 ml/kg per min, n = 19, p = NS). Thus, long-term bucindolol therapy leads to substantial increases in ejection fraction and to improved functional class while stable exercise performance is maintained. 
Free-tissue transfer in elderly patients. A retrospective survey was undertaken to evaluate the success of free-tissue transfer (free flap) in the elderly. During a 70-month period, 199 free flaps were performed in 151 patients at the Western Pennsylvania Hospital, 60 of these involving 47 patients over the age of 60. Primary coverage rates differed significantly between the elderly and younger age groups (68.5 versus 85.3 percent, respectively); however, eventual coverage rates (92.6 versus 96.3 percent), minor complication rates (34.0 versus 34.6 percent), mortality rates (2.1 versus 1.0 percent), flap revision rates (32 percent of patients versus 30 percent), and length of postoperative hospitalization (18.7 versus 18.8 days) were not significantly different in the two groups. Among the elderly, significant increases in flap loss rates were noted with the use of end-to-side arterial anastomosis, placement of the anastomosis within a zone of injury, and the use of the gracilis muscle donor site. Our data suggest that the primary cause of free-flap failure is construction of the anastomosis within a zone of injury. Free-tissue transfer is a valuable option in the repair of tissue defects in the elderly and should not be denied as a treatment because of patient age. 
Efficacy and toxicity of thromboxane synthetase inhibitor for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The efficacy and possible side effects of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthetase inhibitor in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were assessed for 24 patients who presented with grades I to IV of the Hunt and Hess classification. All patients underwent aneurysmal clipping within 48 hours after SAH. Postoperatively, TXA2 synthetase inhibitor, Cataclot [sodium (E)-3-[p-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)phenyl]-2-propenoate] was administered to 13 patients by continuous drip infusion at a dose of 1 microgram/kg/min for 8 to 14 days (group A). The remaining 11 patients did not receive this drug (group B). Of the 13 patients in group A, seven patients (54%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm after SAH. Four patients (31%) developed a transient deterioration of consciousness and/or motor disturbance. Three of these patients fully recovered, while one of them showed a mild neurological deficit on discharge. One patient (8%) developed permanent dysphasia and hemiparesis as a result of ischemic brain damage due to vasospasm. One patient (8%) died of the side effect. On the other hand, of the 11 patients in group B, only three (27%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm. One (9%) patient presented a transient neurological deficit but fully recovered upon discharge. Four patients (36%) showed permanent neurological deficits, although they all could lead an independent life after discharge. The three remaining patients developed a severe disturbance of consciousness caused by ischemia due to vasospasm, and two of them died within 1 month after the onset of SAH. In the group treated with Cataclot, two patients developed an epidural hematoma late during the administration of the drug. Of these two, one patient died of increased intracranial pressure that was accelerated by the complication. These results indicate that TXA2 synthetase inhibitor is effective in not only decreasing the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm but also reducing the neurological deterioration due to vasospasm after SAH. However, this drug has a hazardous side effect in that it may promote a tendency to bleed, which caused death in one of our patients. 
The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in women undergoing laparoscopy is influenced by the day of menstrual cycle. Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a major cause of postoperative morbidity. It can lead to increased recovery time, delaying patient discharge and an increase in hospital costs. Past studies have shown that postoperative nausea and vomiting is more frequent in women than men, appears to elevate around the time of menarche and is reduced around the time of menopause. This retrospective review of a one-year experience of laparoscopic tubal ligation at our institute examined the effect of menstrual cycle on postoperative nausea and vomiting. The anaesthetic and surgical techniques were consistent for all patients. Patient data included age, weight, last day of menstrual cycle, the length of anaesthetic, the dose of inhalational agent, the dose of narcotic, emesis on emergence and whether or not droperidol was used. Of the the 235 patients in the study, the incidence of nausea and vomiting was 28%. One hundred fifty-eight had had no preoperative antiemetic and 77 had received droperidol. These two groups were analyzed separately. The incidence in the group not receiving droperidol was 33.5% and in the droperidol group, 16.9% (P less than 0.01). The incidence of nausea and vomiting was higher on the first eight menstrual days (51.6 vs 21.6, P less than 0.001), was highest on day five of the menstrual cycle and lowest on days 18, 19, and 20 where there was no nausea and vomiting. Droperidol reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting but the variation in postoperative nausea and vomiting during the cycle persisted. 
Tunneled central venous catheter sepsis: risk factors in a pediatric hospital. All tunnelled central venous catheters (TCVC) placed at the Alberta Children's Hospital in Calgary, Alberta, between November 1984 and July 1987, were retrospectively reviewed to study the association of catheter infection with a number of factors including age, diagnosis, catheter use, and areas caring for children. One hundred children received 130 silastic catheters placed for a total of 17,861 days. Each catheter survived a median of 100 days. Thirty-one episodes of catheter sepsis were identified (one episode for each 576 days of catheter use). Children under 2 years of age had more than two times the risk of catheter infection (p less than 0.01). Children with malabsorption had a greater risk (45.7%) than did those with infection (25.0%) or cancer (15.5%). The use of catheters for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or for multiple purposes markedly increased the risk of catheter infection. The risk of infection of TCVC appears to be great in the young child, in particular, in those requiring TPN or multiple intravenous infusions. Use of TCVC in these children should be avoided if possible. 
Spinal intramedullary ependymal cyst. Report of three cases. Three cases of spinal intramedullary ependymal cyst, two at the thoracolumbar junction and one in the cervical spinal cord, are reported in women in their fifth to seventh decades. Neurological signs and symptoms were extremity dysesthesias, paresthesias, and weakness. Plain cervical and lumbothoracic x-ray films were normal for the patients' age. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a rounded cystic intramedullary mass at the thoracolumbar junction in two cases and at C3-7 in one case. The signal intensity of the cyst contents approximated that of cerebrospinal fluid on T1- and T2-weighted images. Upon administration of gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA), MR imaging showed no enhancement in the cyst wall or cavity. Myelotomy and cyst drainage were performed in each case, and the neurological status of each patient improved. The lining of the cyst was biopsied in one of the three patients undergoing surgery and was composed of a single layer of cuboidal cells supported by glial tissue. Periodic acid-Schiff staining of the tissue did not reveal a basement membrane. The findings in these cases suggest that the Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging appearance of intramedullary spinal ependymal cyst is consistent and allows for accurate preoperative diagnosis with or without biopsy. 
Incidence of abnormal RNA studies and dysrhythmias in patients with blunt chest trauma. The incidence and significance of myocardial contusion and subsequent cardiac complications have recently been debated. A prospective study of patients with blunt chest trauma was undertaken at a Regional Trauma Unit between January 1, 1989 and March 31, 1990. One hundred ninety-one patients were entered into the study; 72-hour Holter monitoring was performed in 183 patients, and radionuclide angiography (RNA) was performed on 163 patients. All patients had CPK levels (with CPK-mb fractions) measured, and serial electrocardiographs. There were seven patients with abnormal RNA studies; five of the seven abnormal studies were attributable to previously undiagnosed coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction. Nine patients were diagnosed as having atrial fibrillation, seven of whom were in atrial fibrillation on admission. Ventricular dysrhythmias were classified by the number of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) per hour or the presence of ventricular tachycardia. Twelve patients developed short runs of ventricular tachycardia, and clinically insignificant PVCs were common. Only one patient with ventricular dysrhythmias (frequent PVCs) was treated and there were no hemodynamically significant dysrhythmias. The incidence of clinically significant dysrhythmias or hemodynamically significant myocardial contusion appears to be low in this patient population. Aggressive investigation and monitoring solely for cardiac complications may not be indicated. 
Irreversible drop of systemic vascular resistances in patients implanted with a Jarvik total artificial heart. Maintenance of the body's perfusion by a total artificial heart (TAH) may result in physiological alterations to the circulatory system. Little has been said about modifications to systemic vascular resistances (SVR) during TAH assistance. This paper reports on two patients implanted with a Jarvik - 70 cc TAH, who died after 1 and 3 days, both with an irreversible drop of SVR related to a complete loss of vascular tone but not related to sepsis. Activation of multiple cascades of inflammation, triggered by the extracorporeal circulation (ECC), is maintained during TAH support. Desperately sick patients might not be able to face the vaso-active situations created by the inflammatory response. 
Phosphodiesterase III inhibition or adrenoreceptor stimulation: milrinone as an alternative to dobutamine in the treatment of severe heart failure. High levels of endogenous plasma catecholamines in patients with severe congestive heart failure induce a down-regulation of the myocardial beta-adrenoreceptors and thus cause adrenoreceptor agonists, such as dobutamine, to be less effective in the treatment of these patients. Phosphodiesterase III inhibitors work independent of adrenoreceptor activity and plasma catecholamine levels; thus these agents are likely to be more effective in the treatment of severe heart failure. The present study compares both the initial and late hemodynamic effects of dobutamine and milrinone during sequentially administered 24-hour infusions. Twenty patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association class III, n = 4; New York Heart Association class IV, n = 16) were investigated. Dobutamine could be administered at the prescribed maximum dose of 15 micrograms/kg/min for 24 hours in only 15 of 20 patients. In three patients the dose was reduced or dobutamine infusion completely stopped because of a drug-related increase in heart rate greater than 140 beats/min. Another 2 of 20 patients showed no hemodynamic improvement over 3 hours at the maximum dose of 15 micrograms/kg/min. Dobutamine administration was also discontinued in these patients on account of the existing unfavorable hemodynamic condition, and therapy with intravenous milrinone was started. All 20 patients responded to milrinone without side effects, although comparison of the hemodynamic effects during a 24-hour infusion was possible in only 15 patients. The 15 patients studied over both observation periods experienced an increase in heart rate from 88.8 to 105.6 beats/min (+ 1 hour; p less than or equal to 0.001) when receiving dobutamine but had no increase with milrinone. Stroke volume increased during dobutamine infusion from 19.3 to 28.9 ml/m2 (+49.6%) after 1 hour and then fell continuously to 25.2 ml/m2 after 12 hours; during milrinone therapy, stroke volume increased from 18.8 to 31.2 ml/m2 (+66%; p less than or equal to 0.001) and remained at this level until the end of the infusion (30.2 ml/m2). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) decreased (p less than or equal to 0.001) immediately during milrinone therapy from 26.5 to 16.2 mm Hg after 30 minutes and stabilized at 20.1 mm Hg after 24 hours. During dobutamine infusion PCWP showed a delayed decrease from 27.8 to 19.0 mm Hg after 6 hours and subsequently rose to 22.7 mm Hg after 24 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Prognostic indices of survival in patients supported with temporary devices (TAH, VAD). In an attempt to identify current indications and patient selection criteria for the use of mechanical circulatory support, we reviewed our experience in 83 patients who received a total artificial heart (TAH; n = 43), ventricular assist device (VAD) (n = 13), centrifugal pump (n = 17) or extracorporeal membrane oxigenation (ECMO) (n = 8) as a bridge to transplantation (Group I, n = 50) or for recovery from heart failure (Group II, n = 33). Comparing patients successfully transplanted (n = 20) or weaned (n = 9) who survived initial hospitalization, and those who died on mechanical support, there were no differences in preoperative renal, hepatic or pulmonary functions. Postoperative urinary output and bilirubin levels were the earliest variables affecting survival, and urinary output 24 hours after implant was discriminative in patients who survived (p less than 0.01). Age (above or below 40 years) and modality of terminal heart failure (acute versus chronic) were the most important factors affecting survival in the bridge to transplant group: 82% of young patients with acute decompensation were transplanted and 63% are long-term survivors while all patients over 40 years with chronic heart failure died on mechanical support (MS). In postcardiotomy patients, duration of cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) was significantly different comparing survivors with those who died in either bridge or recovery groups and all patients who had a CPB greater than 4 hours died on MS or after transplantation or weaning. In conclusion, preoperative indices indicating reversibility of multiple organ dysfunction remain to be identified. 
Two closely linked Drosophila POU domain genes are expressed in neuroblasts and sensory elements. We have characterized two Drosophila POU genes designated dPOU-19 and dPOU-28. These genes are transcribed as 3.1- and 2.2-kilobase mRNAs, respectively, which accumulate maximally during the first 12 hr of embryogenesis. The mRNAs encode 601- and 475-amino acid deduced proteins; their POU domains are most related to those of the human OCT1 and OCT2. Both genes give similar nervous system expression patterns and map to an indistinguishable site at 33F on the cytological map. Transcription of the genes is first observed in the cellular blastoderm. In the course of embryonic development, expression is observed in the neuroectoderm, with subsets of neuroblasts in the procephalic and germband central nervous system as well as a subset of peripheral nervous system elements. The expression patterns of the two POU genes suggest a possible functional role for these putative transcription factors in neurogenesis and neurospecification. 
5-Hydroxtryptamine1D receptor agonism predicts antimigraine efficacy. The interactions of four abortive anti-migraine agents and four prophylactic anti-migraine agents with 5-HT1D receptors in bovine brain were analyzed using radioligand binding techniques and adenylate cyclase assays. In bovine caudate, the affinities of abortive anti-migraine agents (i.e. 5-hydroxytryptamine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan) for 5-HT1D receptors range from 4.0-34 nM while the affinities of prophylactic anti-migraine agents (i.e. methysergide, amitriptyline, (-)propranolol, verapamil) range from 46-11,000 nM. In adenylate cyclase studies in bovine substantia nigra, all four abortive anti-migraine agents dose-dependently inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, a biochemical effect mediated by 5-HT1D receptors. No agonist effect on cyclase activity is observed with the four prophylactic anti-migraine agents. These data support the hypothesis that abortive anti-migraine agents are 5-HT1D receptor agonists and that this effect may underlie their anti-migraine efficacy. 
Serum bioactive and immunoreactive luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in women with cycle abnormalities, with or without polycystic ovarian disease. Serum steroid, gonadotropin, and alpha-subunit levels were assessed in 35 women with cycle abnormalities [11 with and 24 without polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) according to strict clinical and biochemical criteria] and 8 regularly cycling women in the early (cycle day 3 or 4) and mid (cycle day 7 or 8) follicular phase. LH and FSH levels were estimated using two immunological techniques [RIA and immunoradiometric assay (IRMA)] and in vitro bioassays (BIO), using mouse Leydig cells and rat granulosa cells, respectively. In PCOD patients mean alpha-subunit, free androgen index [FAI; testosterone x 100/sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)], androstenedione, estrone, and estradiol (E2) were significantly elevated compared to levels in the early follicular phase of control cycles and non-PCOD patients. In addition, in PCOD patients mean IRMA-LH and RIA-LH levels were distinctly increased (2.8- to 3.6 fold, respectively; both comparisons, P less than 0.001) compared to control values, but in the same order of magnitude (1.3- to 1.4-fold increments) as that in non-PCOD patients. However, the median BIO-LH level in PCOD patients was 5.9-fold higher than that in non-PCOD patients and 4.0-fold higher than the BIO-LH in the early follicular phase of control women. Consequently, the median BIO/IRMA-LH ratio was 4.8-fold higher in PCOD patients compared to non-PCOD patients. In women with cycle abnormalities, individual BIO/IRMA-LH ratios correlated with BIO-LH (rs = 0.48), FAI (rs = 0.39), free estrogens (E2/SHBG ratios; rs = 0 0.47), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (rs = 0.60) concentrations. Mean IRMA-, RIA-, and BIO-FSH levels and BIO/IRMA-FSH ratios were not significantly different when various groups were compared. Although RIA- and IRMA-LH levels showed good correlation (rs = 0.88), RIA-LH levels were consistently higher, resulting in distinctly higher RIA-LH/FSH ratios (mean, 4.5) compared to IRMA-LH/FSH ratios (median, 1.8) in PCOD patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Splenic vein aneurysm: MR appearance--a case report. A presumed pancreatic head mass by non-contrast CT examination, was proven to be a splenic vein aneurysm by enhanced CT, MRI, sonography and arteriography. Dangerous percutaneous aspiration was avoided. 
Study of experimental pain measures and nociceptive reflex in chronic pain patients and normal subjects. This study evaluates (i) the effect of heterotopic chronic pain on various experimental pain measures, (ii) the relationship between experimental pain measures and chronic pain symptomatology assessment, and (iii) the influence of the various pain aetiologies on experimental pain measures. Fifty-three chronic pain patients were compared to 17 pain-free subjects with the following psychophysical and physiological indices: pain threshold (PTh), pain tolerance (PTol), verbal estimation of intensity and unpleasantness (intensity scale, IS; unpleasantness scale, US), threshold for intensity and unpleasantness (ITh and UTh), lower limb RIII nociceptive reflex (RIIITh and RIII frequency of occurrence). Chronic pain syndromes included neuropathic pain (n = 12), iodopathic pain (n = 12), myofascial syndromes (n = 9), headache (n = 9), and miscellaneous pain (n = 11). Chronic pain symptomatology was assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS), a French MPQ adaptation (QDSA), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger State Trait Inventory (STAI) and Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). No significant difference was observed between chronic pain patients and pain-free control groups and between patient subgroups for PTh, PTol and RIIITh. No significant correlation was found between experimental pain measures and clinical pain, anxiety or depression scores. However, the chronic pain patients had a higher threshold for unpleasantness and judged the suprathreshold stimuli significantly less intense and less unpleasant than the control group. These results are discussed in relation to diffuse noxious inhibitory controls and the adaptation level theory of chronic pain experience. 
Not all that moves is tardive dyskinesia. OBJECTIVE: Because tardive dyskinesia and spontaneous dyskinesia appear the same, it is difficult to determine whether an individual patient's abnormal movements are induced by medication or have developed spontaneously. Therefore, estimates of the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia that are based on observations not adjusted for spontaneous dyskinesia are inflated. In addition, age is thought to be an important risk factor in the development of both tardive and spontaneous dyskinesias. The authors estimate the prevalence of both disorders for specific age groups. METHOD: The authors reviewed nine reports on dyskinesia prevalence that included history of neuroleptic treatment and related prevalence to age. A rating of 2 or more on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale or an equivalent score on another scale was considered an indication of dyskinesia. If the subject had taken neuroleptics for more than 3 months, the movement disorder was classified as neuroleptic-associated dyskinesia; other dyskinesias were considered spontaneous. The prevalence of tardive dyskinesia was defined as the rate of neuroleptic-associated dyskinesia minus the rate of spontaneous dyskinesia. RESULTS: The true rate of tardive dyskinesia was below 20% for all age groups except 70-79 years. The correlation between the rate of neuroleptic-associated dyskinesia and the rate of spontaneous dyskinesia was low. CONCLUSIONS: After age 40 the prevalence of spontaneous dyskinesia is sufficiently high to conclude that many patients with diagnoses of tardive dyskinesia have abnormal movements attributable to causes other than neuroleptics. 
Primary bile acid diarrhoea without an ileal carrier defect: quantification of active bile acid transport across the ileal brush border membrane. Unexplained bile acid malabsorption associated with diarrhoea that responds to cholestyramine was first described in 1973 but convincing evidence of the proposed mechanism--a defective active ileal bile acid transport--has never been substantiated. Active bile acid transport was quantified in vitro using brush border membrane vesicles prepared from terminal ileal biopsy specimens from 10 patients who fulfilled the criteria of idiopathic bile acid diarrhoea. They were recruited from 181 patients with bile acid malabsorption of various causes. Transport was quantified as in vitro Na+ dependent bile acid transport (INBAT), expressed as pmol taurocholate/mg brush border membrane protein/15 seconds, and in vitro Na+ dependent bile acid local transport capacity (INBALTC), expressed as pmol taurocholate/g ileal biopsy tissue/15 seconds. The lowest INBAT and INBALTC values in the 10 patients with idiopathic bile acid diarrhoea were well above the 10th centile values of a control group of 132 patients. Both INBAT (mean (range) 88 (30-136)) and INBALTC (158 (85-268)) values were significantly higher in the 10 patients than in the control group (INBAT: mean (range) 63 (1-244), INBALTC: mean (range) 98 (1-408)). Quantification of active ileal bile acid transport in these 10 patients with idiopathic bile acid malabsorption suggests that a genetic (carrier) defect is rare in adults. 
Significance of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence after lumpectomy. Breast cancer treatment trials from the US National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project have established breast-conserving operations as a replacement for radical mastectomy (NSABP B-04), and have shown that in terms of survival free from distant disease there was no significant difference between lumpectomy, lumpectomy plus breast irradiation, and total mastectomy (NSABP B-06). 9-year follow-up data from B-06 are used here to address the issue of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR) and the development of distant disease, a question with important clinical and biological implications. A Cox regression model on fixed co-variates (ie, features such as tumour type or size present at surgery and not subsequently alterable) and on IBTR, which is time dependent and not fixed, revealed that the risk of distant disease was 3.41 times greater after adjustment for co-variates in patients in whom an IBTR developed. IBTR proved to be a powerful independent predictor of distant disease. However, it is a marker of risk for, not a cause of, distant metastasis. While mastectomy or breast irradiation following lumpectomy prevent expression of the marker they do not lower the risk of distant disease. These findings further justify the use of lumpectomy. 
Use of the argon-pumped tunable dye laser for port-wine stains in children. The authors reported previously a new technique using a low power argon-pumped tunable dye laser at a wave-length of 577nm (yellow light) to treat port-wine stains in adults. The authors report their results using this same technique as a form of treatment for 92 children with facial port-wine stains. 
Histological grading of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis: a new scoring system. A system of histological grading based on retrospective analysis of 239 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is presented. A new scoring system with 4 histological grades was used. The results of this study confirm previous reports that penile cancer is usually a highly (50%) or moderately (29%) differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Poorly differentiated carcinomas and cancers of other types are very rare. The new grading system was found to be practical and a correlation between histological grade, clinical findings and prognosis was established. Patients with grade 1 tumours had an exceptionally favourable prognosis, with more than 80% being long-term survivors; for these patients, treatment with delayed side effects should be avoided and new forms of treatment should be explored. 
Left ventricular diastolic collapse. An echocardiographic sign of regional cardiac tamponade. BACKGROUND. Cardiac tamponade after cardiac surgical procedures is often associated with hemodynamically significant localized pericardial effusions. The localized collection of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period and the atypical presentation of cardiac tamponade limit the use of conventional clinical and echocardiographic signs usually seen with a circumferential pericardial effusion. Observation of left ventricular diastolic collapse in the echocardiogram of a patient with postoperative regional cardiac tamponade prompted us to explore the frequency of this sign in regional cardiac tamponade. METHODS AND RESULTS. We retrospectively analyzed the echocardiograms of 18 patients with postoperative cardiac tamponade for the following echocardiographic findings: right atrial collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse, left atrial collapse, and left ventricular diastolic collapse. Three of the 18 patients had circumferential pericardial effusion, and 15 had loculated pericardial effusion; in 10, the effusion was predominantly posterior, and in the other five, it extended laterally or inferiorly. The conventional echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade such as right atrial collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse, and left atrial collapse were present in only 3, 1, and 3 of these 15 patients, respectively, but all exhibited left ventricular diastolic collapse. Increasing pressure within the compartment of a loculated pericardial effusion reaching the limit of pericardial distensibility and consequent transient reversal of transmural left ventricular pressure during diastole are most likely the basis for diastolic collapse of the thick-walled ventricle in a setting of regional cardiac tamponade. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that left ventricular diastolic collapse is a frequent sign of regional cardiac tamponade and could be a useful marker of tamponade in postoperative patients. 
Effect of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunization on prolonged apnea or bradycardia in siblings of sudden infant death syndrome victims. To determine whether the incidence of apnea or bradycardia increased after the first diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) immunization in 100 subsequent siblings of victims of sudden infant death syndrome, we examined data obtained from floppy disk recordings attached to apnea-bradycardia monitors for episodes of apnea lasting 15 seconds or longer and episodes of bradycardia lasting 10 seconds or longer. The data were divided into three periods: (1) 10 days before the first DTP immunization was received (pre-DTP period), (2) 10 days immediately after the DTP (DTP period), and (3) 10 days after the DTP period (post-DTP period). Seventeen infants had at least one episode of prolonged apnea or prolonged bradycardia either before or after the 30-day study period (eight before only, eight after only, and one before and after). None of the infants had episodes of apnea lasting 15 seconds or more or bradycardia lasting 10 seconds or more during the pre-DTP or DTP period. One episode of apnea, 16 seconds long, and one episode of bradycardia lasting 11 seconds occurred in the post-DTP period. These results failed to confirm the clinical impression that DTP immunizations are associated with an increased frequency and severity of prolonged apnea. They also place in question the utility of assessing an infant's response to a DTP immunization to determine continued risk of apnea and bradycardia before home monitoring is discontinued. 
A phase II trial of high-dose cisplatin and dacarbazine. Lack of efficacy of high-dose, cisplatin-based therapy for metastatic melanoma. Cisplatin and dacarbazine are used widely in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. To evaluate high-dose cisplatin and dacarbazine, 32 patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 and dacarbazine 350 mg/m2 daily for three days repeated at 28-day intervals. Their median age was 43.5 years (range, 25 to 73 years), and their median Karnofsky performance status was 80% (range, 70% to 100%). Measurable and evaluable disease sites (number of patients) included lymph nodes (22), lung (17), soft tissue (16), liver (13), bone (seven), spleen (four), adrenal gland (three), skin (three), and other sites (five). Patients received a median of two cycles of therapy (range, one to eight cycles). Thirty patients were evaluable for response. No complete responses were observed. Five patients had a partial response (17%; 95% confidence interval, 3% to 30%) for 16+, 12+, 7, 6.5, and 3 months. Responding sites of disease included lymph nodes (five of 22), lung (three of 17), and soft tissue (two of 16). Hematologic toxicity (Grade greater than or equal to 3) included neutropenia (16 of 32 patients, 30 of 90 cycles), thrombocytopenia (eight of 32 patients, 12 of 90 cycles), and anemia (five patients). Nine episodes of neutropenia and fever were seen in four patients; two had bacteremia. Nonhematologic toxicity (Grade greater than or equal to 3) included hypotension (two patients), nausea and vomiting (four), neuropathy (two), ototoxicity (four), and hypomagnesemia (nine). The low objective response rate and severe toxicity of this regimen preclude its standard use in patients with metastatic melanoma. A review of cisplatin-based therapy in metastatic melanoma suggests that there is no dose-response relationship. The use of high-dose cisplatin (greater than 100 mg/m2) in the treatment of metastatic melanoma is not recommended. 
Circulatory abnormalities and compensatory mechanisms in heart failure. Knowledge of the basic alterations of central hemodynamics in congestive heart failure has failed to explain many aspects of this important syndrome. Increasing attention has recently been paid to compensatory and adaptive mechanisms occurring after the initial insult. Thus, new insights have been gained into the pathophysiology of contraction of hypertrophied myocardium and changes of adrenergic receptors in the myocardium due to chronically increased cardiac sympathetic tone. The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in early and advanced congestive heart failure has been further elucidated, and the role of the vasodilating atrial natriuretic peptide is undergoing further definition. New results further clarify the mechanisms leading to breathlessness and muscular fatigue in congestive heart failure, with emphasis shifting from the traditional concept of the importance of increased filling pressures to changes to the peripheral circulation and exercising muscles. Although progress has been made in understanding of the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure, many aspects are still poorly understood and await clarification. 
The eyes of child abuse victims: autopsy findings. The authors studied 77 pairs of eyes removed from children who had died of suspected child abuse. Forty-seven of the cases had retinal hemorrhages. Those showing retinal hemorrhages were younger children and had fewer other stigmata of child abuse. Hemorrhages are more likely to occur in cases where the child was shaken or swung than in those with severe direct head trauma. The authors recommend that examination of the eyes be included in the autopsies of all small children who died without an obvious cause of death. Experience in both processing and reading of ocular material is necessary for reliable results. 
Crossing failure in PTCA: mind the deflated balloon profile! An attempt to reposition an Integra PTCA balloon-on-a-wire failed although the whole stenosed segment could be crossed before inflation. After careful removal the device showed a grossly altered shape. Deflated balloon profiles, quite different from the initial shape, can determine the outcome both in dissections and in multilesion cases. 
Suprascapular nerve lesions at the spinoglenoid notch: report of three cases and review of the literature. Lesions of the suprascapular nerve can occur at the supraspinatus notch (SSN) or at the spinoglenoid notch (SGN). Electromyographic (EMG), evaluation of the infraspinatus, and especially the supraspinatus muscles distinguishes SGN from SSN lesions. Three cases of SGN lesions, which are more common than SSN lesions, are presented. 
Ifosfamide continuous infusion without mesna. A phase I trial of a 14-day cycle. Twenty patients received 27 courses of ifosfamide administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 14 days without Mesna. The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of ifosfamide that would be comparable to standard bolus or short-term infusions administered with Mesna. Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300, 400, 450, 500, and 550 mg/m2/d. Four patients developed transient microscopic hematuria at 400, 450, and 500 mg/m2/d. There were no instances of macroscopic hematuria. At 550 mg/m2/d, three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity; confusion (1), nausea (1), and Grade 2 leukopenia (1). The recommended dose of 500 mg/m2/d delivers a total dose of 7 g/m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short-term infusion. Because few patients received multiple courses over time, the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial. The frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential, adding Mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent hematuria. The protracted infusion schedule for ifosfamide permits convenient outpatient administration without Mesna and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to $890 per cycle. Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient, but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained. 
VpreB gene expression in hematopoietic malignancies: a lineage- and stage-restricted marker for B-cell precursor leukemias. We show here that analysis of VpreB gene transcription can be a specific way to identify acute leukemias of cells at very early stages of B-cell development. Northern blot analysis of RNAs from 63 leukemia samples showed that VpreB RNA was present in malignancies of precursor B cells, the expression being a feature of both common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (CD10+) and null ALL (CD10-). It was absent from malignancies of mature B cells (surface Ig positive), from acute leukemias of the T-cell lineage and granulocyte-macrophage lineages, and from normal tonsil B and T lymphocytes. Chronic myeloid leukemia blast crises of the B-precursor-cell type expressed the VpreB gene while myeloid blast crises did not. VpreB RNA was also expressed in the neoplastic cells of one of three patients with acute undifferentiated leukemias. These data show that VpreB RNA expression is a marker of the malignant forms of precursor B cells, and that it appears at least as early as cytoplasmic CD22 and CD19 in tumors of the B-cell lineage. 
Argon laser photocoagulation for neovascular maculopathy. Five-year results from randomized clinical trials. Macular Photocoagulation Study Group. With completion of follow-up of all patients enrolled in three randomized clinical trials of argon laser photocoagulation of extrafoveal choroidal neovascular membranes secondary to senile (age-related) macular degeneration, ocular histoplasmosis, or idiopathic causes, the Macular Photocoagulation Study Group has demonstrated that laser treatment of such lesions is beneficial in preventing or delaying large losses of visual acuity for at least 5 years. In eyes with senile (age-related) macular degeneration as the underlying cause, the relative risk of losing six or more lines of visual acuity from the baseline level among untreated eyes (n = 117) compared with laser-treated eyes (n = 119) was 1.5 from 6 months through 5 years after entry (P = .001). In addition, after 5 years, untreated eyes had lost a mean of 7.1 lines of visual acuity, while laser-treated eyes had lost 5.2 lines. Recurrent neovascularization had been observed in 54% of laser-treated eyes by the end of the 5-year follow-up period. Among eyes with ocular histoplasmosis, untreated eyes (n = 130) had 3.6 times the risk of laser-treated eyes (n = 132) of losing six or more lines of visual acuity (P less than .0001). Also, untreated eyes had lost a mean of 4.4 lines of visual acuity after 5 years, compared with only 0.9 lines lost by laser-treated eyes. Among laser-treated eyes, recurrent neovascularization had been observed in 26% by 5 years after enrollment. 
Classical conditioning of ventilatory responses in humans. A classical conditioning experiment, in which an auditory stimulus was paired with a hypoxic stimulus, was carried out on 34 normal subjects assigned to two groups (experimental and control). Each subject took part in one session divided into two phases, acquisition and test. In the acquisition phase, eight hypoxic and eight auditory stimuli were paired in the experimental group and unpaired in the control group. In the test phase, which was identical for the two groups, the hypoxic stimuli were suppressed and three purely auditory stimuli were presented. Significant differences between the two groups in ventilatory response to these auditory stimuli provided evidence for conditioning. In the control group, no significant changes were elicited by the auditory stimuli, whereas a conditioned increase in total cycle duration was observed in the experimental group. The conditioned response closely resembled the first component of the hypoxic response. Analysis of the pattern of the conditioned response, along with postexperimental interviews, strongly suggests that this response was not mediated by volitional factors. 
Peritoneal adhesion formation after lysis: inhibition by polyethylene glycol 4000. Peritoneal adhesions cause much long-term postoperative morbidity. This study evaluates the efficacy of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 in reducing adhesion reformation after lysis. Adhesions were induced, by abrasion, in 111 Sprague-Dawley rats at a first laparotomy. At a second operation, 10 days later, these adhesions were graded and lysed, after which the animals received one of the following solutions intraperitoneally: 5 per cent PEG 4000 (n = 21), 25 per cent PEG 4000 (n = 23), 32 per cent dextran 70 (n = 22) or isotonic saline (n = 25), or were left as an untreated control group (n = 20). When the reformed adhesions were graded after a further 10 days 5 per cent PEG 4000 was found to be the only solution that inhibited adhesion reformation. The adhesions that reformed in the other four test groups were significantly worse than when they were first graded (P less than or equal to 0.033 for all groups). Therefore 5 per cent PEG 4000 may be useful in clinical practice for the reduction of adhesion formation after lysis. 
The effect of preoperative therapy on the histologic features of Wilms' tumor. An analysis of cases from the Third National Wilms' Tumor Study. Preoperative chemotherapy is being used with increasing frequency in the US for the management of selected children with Wilms' tumor, despite relatively limited knowledge as to the effects of such therapy on tumor histologic features. The authors reviewed pathologic material from all preoperatively treated unilateral Wilms' tumors registered on the third National Wilms' Tumor Study. Preoperative therapy was associated with increased ambiguity of tumor stage. The prevalence of anaplasia in the 83 evaluable specimens was similar to, although slightly increased over, that in comparable high-stage untreated Wilms' tumors (11% versus 5% to 8%), and it appeared to retain its adverse connotations. These data also suggest that alterations of tumor character and distribution by therapy provide useful prognostic information. All 17 children whose residual viable tumor was limited to intrarenal sites at the time of resection were alive and disease-free at last follow-up. Extensive (greater than 90%) tumor necrosis, low mitotic activity, and high degrees of differentiation of residual tumor were also associated with favorable outcomes. Although careful utilization of preoperative chemotherapy can be of value in children with otherwise difficult-to-manage Wilms' tumors, the potential benefits of preoperative tumor bulk reduction must be weighed against the risk of overtreatment or undertreatment as a result of increased ambiguity of tumor stage. 
Efficacy of ampicillin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in a mouse model of lethal enterococcal peritonitis. Lethal enterococcal peritonitis in mice was used to compare trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) therapy with ampicillin therapy. Peritoneal fluid showed a 10(3)-CFU decrease in enterococci with ampicillin compared with TMP-SMX. Mortality of the untreated mice was 100%, compared with 40% for ampicillin and 95% for TMP-SMX, despite adequately measured levels in serum and peritoneal fluid. 
Respiratory complications and hypoxic episodes during inhalation induction with isoflurane in children. We have studied the incidence of respiratory complications and hypoxic episodes during inhalation induction with isoflurane in 75 healthy unpremedicated children. Problems occurred less frequently when 4% isoflurane in oxygen was used from the outset than with traditional techniques using nitrous oxide and a gradually increasing inspired vapour concentration. The improved results observed with the former method may be secondary to more rapid uptake of vapour so that the second stage of anaesthesia characteristic of anaesthetic ethers is shortened considerably. 
Resection and reconstruction of the carotid bifurcation with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts; operative technique. Preliminary results in 25 procedures and indications. Although carotid endarterectomy is the standard procedure, the purpose of this paper is to describe a new surgical technique and indicate its role in the surgery of cervical cerebrovascular disease. The technique consists of resection of the pathologic carotid artery bifurcation followed by its total replacement with a bifurcated thin-wall polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft constructed by the surgeon. Prosthetic graft reconstruction of the carotid bifurcation (PGRCB) was performed in 21 patients (25 procedures) from November 1984 to May 1987. Many patients were over 70 years old. The indications for surgery were transient ischemic attacks (TIA)'s in 10 patients (high-grade stenosis), established stroke with mild deficit in 3 patients (high-grade stenosis). Eight patients (high-grade stenosis) were asymptomatic and 4 had vertebro-basilar symptoms. In 11 procedures the indications were the same as for standard carotid endarterectomy (significant stenosis and/or ulcerated plaque). In 14 cases, the procedure was justified by extensive lesions involving a long segment of the internal carotid artery (2 restenoses, 12 calcified lesions). In the perioperative period, there were no deaths and no TIA's. The 25 procedures were assessed one month postoperatively by ultrasonic imaging and venous substraction angiography. All the grafts were patent with perfect restoration of the carotid bifurcation anatomy. Systematic follow-up study was carried out in 1987. Three patients had died of non-neurologic causes and one was lost to study. The remaining 19 procedures were evaluated with an average follow-up of 19 months (range 7 to 32 months). The patients were asymptomatic and all the grafts remained patent including one stenosis (greater than 50%) at the common carotid artery anastomosis. Because recent studies have documented a much higher rate of technical defects or recurrent stenosis after carotid endarterectomy, we believe that PGRCB merits consideration, particularly in difficult endarterectomies, and in recurrent carotid stenosis. Furthermore it seems acceptable to advocate PGRCB in aneurysms of the internal carotid artery and in post-irradiation arteritis. 
Effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on canine atrial flutter due to reentry: role of prolongation of refractory period and depression of conduction to excitable gap. Antiarrhythmic drugs prolong the effective refractory period and depress conduction. To determine the exact role played by these two electrophysiologic effects in the termination of reentry, the effects of disopyramide, flecainide, propafenone and E-4031, a new class III drug, were examined in a canine model of atrial flutter (cycle length 120 +/- 4 to 131 +/- 3 ms) caused by reentry. Atrial flutter was induced in 32 anesthetized open chest dogs after placement of an intercaval crush. The excitable gap ranged from 9 +/- 2% to 11 +/- 4% of the basic flutter cycle length. The effective refractory period in the reentrant circuit during atrial flutter was estimated by subtracting the excitable gap from the basic flutter cycle length. Prolongation of flutter cycle length by the test drugs was proportional to the interatrial conduction time (r = 0.87, p less than 0.001). Atrial flutter was terminated by each test drug in all dogs except for flecainide and propafenone in one dog each. E-4031 prolonged the refractory period during atrial flutter to 129 +/- 6 ms, which did not differ significantly from the flutter cycle length immediately before termination (134 +/- 4 ms). The refractory period during atrial flutter after injection of the other drugs was shorter than the flutter cycle length before termination of atrial flutter (for example, flecainide 126 +/- 5 vs. 179 +/- 11 ms, p less than 0.01). 
Phantom-related phenomena after rectal amputation: prevalence and clinical characteristics. Phantom sensations are well known and almost inevitable sequels to limb amputation, whereas similar phenomena are only rarely described after rectum amputation (phantom rectum). Our study attempted to assess the frequency and character of phantom rectum. All surviving patients (n = 22), who had undergone abdominoperineal surgical resection of the rectum in the period 1980-1986 at our clinic, were interviewed by a standard questionnaire and underwent a physical examination. Sixty-eight per cent of the patients experienced a sensation of a missing rectum (phantom rectum), and in 27% of these or 18% of all patients this sensation was painful (phantom pain). The most common symptoms were sensations of flatus and/or faeces in a normal rectum, phantom flatus or phantom faeces. The phantom pains were described as either pricking and shooting or like haemorrhoids or hard stools that would rupture the rectum. Neither age, sex, preoperative pain, the Duke classification of the tumour nor the healing of the perineal wound seemed related to the likelihood of phantom rectum. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying phantom-related phenomena following amputation have not yet been elucidated. This study describes a relatively unknown phantom-related clinical entity after amputation and may thus contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon. 
Induction of apoptosis during normal and neoplastic B-cell development in the bursa of Fabricius. The lymphoid cells of embryonic bursal follicles are engaged in rapid growth and preimmune diversification of immunoglobulin genes. Disruption of follicular architecture by mechanical dispersion of these cells in short-term tissue culture was accompanied by continued cell division and extensive cell death by apoptosis. Apoptosis was suppressed in parallel cultures of intact follicles. gamma Radiation also triggered extensive apoptosis in embryonic bursal follicles within a few hours. Preneoplastic bursal stem cell populations induced by a v-myc oncogene were hypersensitive to induction of apoptosis by follicular dispersion and radiation. In contrast, tumor progression in v-myc- and v-rel-initiated bursal neoplasms was accompanied by development of resistance to induction of apoptosis. A programmed cell death pathway can be activated during normal B-cell development in the bursa, and alterations in the expression of this pathway accompany neoplastic change in this system. 
Operations for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Forty-six patients with symptomatic tachycardia underwent operations to divide 55 atrioventricular accessory pathways. Mean age was 29 years (range 11 to 63). Ten patients (22%) had associated cardiac disease, including two with a congenital diverticulum of the coronary sinus and six (13%) who had concomitant surgical procedures. A bipolar hand-held electrode was used in 22 operations, and simultaneous multisite mapping in the last 24 operations. Ten patients (22%) had multiple accessory pathways. A modified endocardial approach was used. The overall patient success rate was 93% with 91% to 93% of accessory pathways successfully divided. The perioperative morbidity was 17%. There were two reoperations. There were no early or late deaths. Patients have been followed up for a mean of 16 months. There were five recurrences of preexcitation (two early, three late). Two of these patients (both with a congenital diverticulum of the coronary sinus) had reoperation. One patient had late recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Operation for the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome has a high probability of success with a low operative risk. 
Chronic perineal pain related to sacral meningeal cysts. Chronic perineal pain is an often encountered problem that is difficult to evaluate. Based on a series of 17 patients in whom urological, gynecological, and anorectal pathology was excluded, the authors compared magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with computed tomographic (CT) scan with myelography in the investigation of chronic perineal pain. After a clinical neurological examination, patients underwent radiodiagnostic imaging of both techniques. Thirteen patients (76%) had one or more sacral meningeal cysts (MC) on MRI scan, whereas CT scan with myelography of the lumbar and sacral region revealed 7 patients (41%) with sacral MC. Sacral MC may be the etiology of chronic perineal pain in many instances, and MRI scan appears to be superior to CT scan with myelography in demonstrating sacral MC. Ten patients with sacral MC were operated on with moderate to excellent results 6 months after operation. Early postoperative results are encouraging, but further follow-up and larger series are required. 
Epidural sufentanil for postoperative analgesia: dose-response in patients recovering from major gynecologic surgery. To determine the lowest effective dose of epidural sufentanil given for analgesia, 41 patients undergoing elective abdominal gynecologic surgery during continuous epidural anesthesia (lidocaine 2%) were randomly assigned to one of four postoperative treatment groups. Patients received an epidural bolus of either 25 (group A), 40 (group B), 55 (group C), or 70 micrograms (group D) sufentanil in 10 mL of saline. They were evaluated for the next 8 h using a 10-cm visual analogue scale. Except for two individuals in group A, all patients achieved a visual analogue scale score of 1 cm or less during the study interval. The onset of analgesia was most rapid in the two higher dose groups (A vs C and D; P less than 0.05). Pairwise comparison between groups showed a significant difference in the time needed to achieve maximum pain relief between the lowest and highest treatment groups (A vs D; P less than 0.05). Duration of analgesia was also significantly longer in groups C and D than in group A (208.0 +/- 21.1 and 224.0 +/- 14.7 vs 140.0 +/- 10.7 min; P less than 0.05). There were no differences among groups with regard to mean respiratory rate, level of sedation, 24-h narcotic requirements, or incidence of nausea, vomiting, and pruritus (P = NS). A single patient in group D suffered profound respiratory depression within seconds of administration. We conclude that, in patients recovering from lower abdominal surgery, a single 40-55-micrograms epidural bolus of sufentanil provides 3-3.5 h of effective analgesia, and that larger doses are not warranted. 
Venous thromboembolism after brain tumor surgery: a retrospective review. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence rate of clinical postoperative deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in 1703 patients undergoing initial craniotomy for meningioma, glioma, or cerebral metastasis. The incidence rate of clinical thromboembolic complications was 1.59% for all tumor groups within the first 4 weeks of surgery. Patients undergoing surgery for meningiomas had a statistically significant increased risk of thromboembolism despite fewer overall perioperative risk factors, when compared with the other tumor groups. The tumor-specific incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism for meningioma, glioma, and metastasis were 3.09%, 0.97%, and 1.03%, respectively. Whether this difference was a result of increased surgical time or an inherent property of meningiomas could not be ascertained. 
Tethered cord syndrome complicating spina bifida occulta. A case report. The insidious onset of back and/or leg pain, weakness and spasticity of the lower limb, sensory deficits and neurogenic bladder and bowel in a child with spina bifida might represent a tethered cord syndrome. A case report of a child with sudden neurologic deterioration describes this condition. The successful management in children and adults with tethered cord syndrome is improved with early recognition and careful monitoring. 
Diagnosis and cure of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias during a single electrophysiologic test BACKGROUND. We conducted this study to determine the feasibility of an abbreviated therapeutic approach to the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, in which the diagnosis is established and radiofrequency ablation carried out during a single electrophysiologic test. METHODS. One hundred six consecutive patients were referred for the management of documented, symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (66 patients) or the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (40 patients). All agreed to undergo a diagnostic electrophysiologic test and catheter ablation with radiofrequency current. No patient had had such a test previously. RESULTS. Among the 66 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, the mechanism was found to be atrioventricular nodal reentry in 46 (70 percent) (typical in 44 and atypical in 2), atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia involving a concealed accessory pathway in 16 (24 percent), atrial tachycardia in 2 (3 percent), and noninducible paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in 2 (3 percent). A successful long-term outcome was achieved in 57 of 62 patients (92 percent) with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in whom ablation was attempted and in 37 of 40 patients (93 percent) with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The only complications were one instance of occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery, leading to acute myocardial infarction, and one instance of complete atrioventricular block. The mean (+/- SD) duration of the electrophysiologic procedures was 114 +/- 55 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. The diagnosis and cure of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome during a single electrophysiologic test are feasible and practical and have a favorable risk-benefit ratio. This abbreviated therapeutic approach may eliminate the need for serial electropharmacologic testing, long-term drug therapy, antitachycardia pacemakers, and surgical ablation. 
Initial 5-fluorouracil trabeculectomy in uncomplicated glaucoma. The effectiveness of trabeculectomy with adjunctive low-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as the initial surgical procedure in uncomplicated glaucoma was evaluated retrospectively in a consecutive series of 52 patients (mean follow-up, 18.6 +/- 11.7 mos) and 74 control subjects. The cumulative 2-year success (intraocular pressure [IOP] less than 21 mmHg) was 100% in the 5-FU group and 78.9% in the control group (P = 0.01, Wilcoxon test). The 5-FU group had a mean postoperative IOP of 12.5 +/- 4.6 mmHg versus 17.4 +/- 5.7 mmHg in the control group at 2-year follow-up (P = 0.015, t test). Antiglaucoma medications were required in 5.8% of patients in the 5-FU group and in 41.9% of controls within 2 years (P less than 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). These results suggest that low-dose 5-FU at the time of initial trabeculectomy leads to a higher success rate, lower IOP, and less need for antiglaucoma medications postoperatively. 
Importance of the immune response to the Ro/La particle in the development of congenital heart block and neonatal lupus erythematosus. Previous studies have suggested a role for anti-Ro antibodies in the pathogenesis of neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE). We reexamined the role of the immune response to the Ro/La particle in the development of NLE using newer and more definitive assay techniques. All 15 infants with congenital heart block and NLE had both anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. Of 8 patients with cutaneous NLE alone, 2 had anti-Ro antibodies alone while the remaining 6 had both anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. One woman gave birth to 2 children; one had both Ro and La antibodies and developed congenital heart block, the other had only anti-Ro and anti-U1RNP antibodies and was clinically normal. Our study demonstrates that the presence of anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies define the immune response that is associated with the development of congenital heart block of NLE. 
Effects of nonionic versus ionic contrast media on complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. To evaluate the effect of contrast agents on percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) complications, 913 patients undergoing 1,058 separate PTCA procedures were prospectively randomized to receive either nonionic iopamidol (Isovue-370) [n = 507 PTCA procedures] or ionic contrast media, meglumine sodium diatrizoate (Renografin-76) [n = 551 PTCA procedures]. Angioplasty operators, technicians, nurses and patients were blinded to the agent used. All patients were pretreated with 0.6 mg of atropine sulfate intravenously before any contrast injections. Hypotension (mean arterial pressure less than 65 mm Hg associated with contrast injections) occurred during 8.5% of PTCA procedures in which the patients were receiving iopamidol and during 9.5% of the procedures in which the patients were given diatrizoate (difference not significant). Bradycardia (heart rate of less than 40 beats/min associated with contrast injections) developed during 5.7% of procedures when patients were given iopamidol and during 5.1% of procedures when patients were given diatrizoate (difference not significant). The need for additional atropine or temporary pacing during the procedure was similar for patients given iopamidol and diatrizoate. The overall incidence of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, or both, during the procedure occurred less frequently when iopamidol was used compared with diatrizoate (1 vs 2.5%, p = 0.045). These serious ventricular arrhythmias were attributable to contrast injections in 0.6% of the PTCA procedures when iopamidol was given and in 2.0% of the cases in which diatrizoate was the contrast agent (p = 0.09). Only 1 patient had an allergic reaction to the contrast agent, and this was in a patient who received iopamidol. 
Efficacy and safety of intravenous and oral propafenone in pediatric cardiac dysrhythmias. Propafenone was administered to 58 patients with a mean age of 3.2 years (range 0.1 to 16). Mean intravenous dose was 1.2 mg/kg body weight (range 0.3 to 1.5 mg). The final mean oral maintenance dose was 308 mg/m2 body surface area (range 200 to 600 mg/m2, 16.8 mg/kg body weight). After intravenous application, propafenone was effective in 21 of 36 patients; atrial flutter was converted in 1 of 5 patients, and reentry supraventricular tachycardia was controlled in 15 of 25 patients. Propafenone was partially or completely effective in 3 of 4 patients with chaotic atrial tachycardia. Junctional ectopic tachycardia was suppressed in 2 infants. Thirty-seven patients had oral treatment with a mean follow-up of 2.2 years. Propafenone was effective in 33 of 37 patients (89%); atrial flutter was controlled in 2 patients, ventricular ectopy was suppressed in 1 of 2 patients. In reentry supraventricular tachycardia, propafenone was effective in 25 of 28 patients. Chaotic atrial tachycardia (n = 3) and junctional ectopic tachycardia (n = 2) were controlled after successful intravenous therapy. Systemic side effects were rare. Two patients developed a proarrhythmic effect, and 1 patient with ventricular ectopy after repair of tetralogy of Fallot died suddenly during propafenone maintenance therapy. 
Serum ferritin: a tumor marker for renal cell carcinoma. Serum ferritin levels in 32 patients with renal cell carcinoma were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Serum ferritin concentration was significantly higher in renal cell carcinoma patients compared to controls (259.10 versus 61.30 ng./ml., p less than 0.001). Furthermore, there was a steady and statistically significant increase in serum ferritin levels with advancing disease stage, as well as a significant decrease in serum ferritin levels after nephrectomy for stages 1 and 2 disease. The intracellular content of ferritin as estimated by polyclonal antibody was dramatically increased in renal cancer tissue compared to normal parenchyma. Although serum ferritin regulation is complex and only partly understood, the present study suggests that serum ferritin may be a useful tumor marker for renal cell carcinoma. 
Post-traumatic syringomyelia following uncomplicated spinal fracture. Two cases of post-traumatic syringomyelia presenting 10 and 41 years after spinal injuries that had caused lumbar vertebral fractures but no lasting neurological deficits are reported. In both patients the caudal end of the syrinx cavities, as shown by MRI, corresponded to the level of the previous vertebral fractures. Patients presenting with post-traumatic syringomyelia after uncomplicated spinal fracture are very rare, and the significance of the past history of spinal trauma may be overlooked. 
Clonorchis-associated cholangiocarcinoma: a report of two cases with unusual manifestations. Two cases of Clonorchis-associated cholangiocarcinoma are described along with their cholangiographic features to illustrate the spectrum of pathology ascribed to the injurious effects of the flukes on the bile duct epithelium. This includes adenomatous hyperplasia, extensive fibrosis, and carcinoma. The first case was also complicated by hepatic abscesses, left hepatic lobar atrophy, gastrobiliary and biliarocutaneous fistulae. The second case features an unusually dilated pancreatic duct containing pancreaticoliths that was found later to consist of hyperplastic bile duct epithelium, presumably carried by worm migration in the biliary tree. Liver sections from both patients showed typical features of hepatic clonorchiasis with the cancer. A knowledge of the wide spectrum of clinical presentation of clonorchiasis, particularly cholangiocarcinoma, might aid Western physicians in averting this serious sequela through prompt eradication of the helminthic infection and early recognition and treatment of its complications. 
Comparison of human pain sensation and flexion withdrawal evoked by noxious radiant heat. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of flexion withdrawal magnitude as an indicator of pain sensation. In 10 healthy human volunteers, we compared the magnitude and latency of integrated biceps EMG with the subjects' rating of pain, using a visual analog scale, elicited by noxious radiant heat stimuli applied to the dorsal forearm. The magnitude and inverse latency of withdrawal, although variable, increased exponentially as a functions of stimulus temperature. The stimulus response functions for mean withdrawal magnitude and mean pain intensity were similar for lower stimulus temperatures, but at higher temperatures the withdrawal continued to increase exponentially whereas pain intensity reached a plateau. The pain intensity and withdrawal magnitude for each stimulus were poorly correlated. Under the conditions of this experiment, mean pain intensity and mean withdrawal magnitude were both well correlated with stimulus temperature, but the magnitude of withdrawal did not reliably reflect the intensity of pain sensation. 
Neuronal activity up-regulates astroglial gene expression. Neuronal gene expression is known to be modulated by functional activity. This modulation is thought to play a key role in determining the differentiation of developing neurons and regulating the operation of mature neurons. Here we describe a regulation of astroglial gene expression by neuronal activity. We report that intense neuronal activity (electrically induced seizures) in rat hippocampus leads to rapid and dramatic increases in mRNA for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astroglia-specific intermediate filament protein. GFAP mRNA levels increased at sites of stimulation as well as in areas that were synaptically activated by the resultant seizures. When seizures were induced repetitively for many days, levels of GFAP mRNA remained chronically elevated. However, GFAP mRNA returned to control levels within a few days after the cessation of stimulation. The coupling between astroglial gene expression and neuronal activity may be a mechanism through which neuronal activity modulates the function of supporting cells that are responsible for regulating the extracellular microenvironment of the brain. 
Hazards of mattresses, beds and bedding in deaths of infants. Of 52 infants who had died suddenly and were referred to autopsy, nine had lain on adult water beds for the first time; five had died as a result of accidents; two had died on water beds; two were in beds with widely spaced slats; and one had died as a result of strangulation. Three deaths were due to overlying. Three other infants had been placed on sheepskin rugs for the first time and were found dead shortly thereafter. These infants ranged in age from 2 to 9 months, except for a severely mentally retarded nine-year-old with spastic paraplegia. We believe that a general warning should be issued concerning water beds and that soft bedding should not be used for infants. Infants should not be placed unattended or left to sleep on water beds; only beds recommended for infants should be used. Overlying of a young infant is most likely to occur on a water bed, or if the parent is obese or has consumed alcohol. 
Intraperitoneal thrombolytic agents in relapsing or persistent peritonitis of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Urokinase or streptokinase was instilled intraperitoneally as an adjunct to the antibiotic therapy in 16 episodes of relapsing or persistent peritonitis in CAPD patients. In eight patients the combination of antibiotics and intraperitoneal thrombolytic agents resulted in clearing of the infection with no recurrences. The treatment failed in eight other patients, who had their peritoneal catheters removed. Six of the last eight patients had either abdominal wall abscesses or persistence of the bacteria on the wall of the peritoneal catheter. Elevated post-intraperitoneal instillation peritoneal fluid neutrophil counts and positive post-instillation peritoneal fluid cultures predicted failure of the intraperitoneal instillation of thrombolytic agents in most instances. Intraperitoneal instillation of urokinase or streptokinase may help cure approximately 50% of the episodes of relapsing for persistent peritonitis. Post-instillation peritoneal fluid cell counts and cultures should be monitored. Radiologic investigation for abdominal wall or intraabdominal abscesses is indicated if intraperitoneal instillation of urokinase or streptokinase fails to eradicate peritonitis. 
Hyperbaric treatment of cerebral air embolism sustained during an open-heart surgical procedure A case of cerebral air embolism sustained during replacement of the mitral valve resulted in postoperative coma and seizures. Hyperbaric treatment, begun 30 hours after the occurrence of the air embolism, resulted in good immediate and long-term recovery. Mild deficits of the left hemisphere were present at follow-up 53 days after the embolus was sustained, and lesser, minimal residua were present at 14-month follow-up. Hyperbaric treatment is the definitive therapy for cerebral air embolism. Although it is most effective when administered early, the outcome may be excellent even with late treatment. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma in Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii): evidence for association with hepatitis B-like virus infection. During studies of seasonal obesity, a high frequency of hepatic neoplasms was observed in Richardson's ground squirrels. Of 12 Richardson's ground squirrels examined thoroughly, 7 had mild or moderate degrees of chronic portal hepatitis and 6 (50%) had hepatocellular carcinoma. Serological tests for hepadnavirus surface antigen, anti-core antibody and virion DNA that recognize the ground squirrel hepatitis virus of California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) were uniformly negative. Southern blot analyses of EcoRI digests of liver cell DNA demonstrated 3.2 kb fragments that hybridized with a ground squirrel hepatitis virus-specific probe in nontumorous liver tissue from 6 of 10 ground squirrels and in hepatocellular carcinoma specimens from 2 of 5 squirrels indicating infection with a hepadnavirus related to ground squirrel hepatitis virus. Failure, however, to detect serum antibody to ground squirrel hepatitis core antigen suggested probable antigenic differences between the ground squirrel hepatitis virus of California ground squirrels and the putative Richardson's ground squirrel agent. Further studies are required to fully characterize the hepadnavirus of Richardson's ground squirrels and to determine its relationship to hepatocarcinogenesis in this species. 
Adenovirus E1a prevents the retinoblastoma gene product from complexing with a cellular transcription factor. The transforming proteins of several DNA tumour viruses, including adenovirus E1a and simian virus 40 large T antigen, complex with the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumour-suppressor gene product. This requires regions in these viral proteins necessary for transformation and is thought to inactivate the growth-suppressing properties of the Rb protein by disrupting its interaction with cellular targets. Indeed, regions of Rb required to form a complex with E1a and large T antigen are often mutated in transformed cells. The level at which the Rb protein regulates proliferation is unknown, although one possibility is transcription. We have previously characterized a sequence-specific transcription factor, DRTF1, the activity of which is downregulated as embryonal carcinoma stem cells differentiate. DRTF1 is found in several discrete protein complexes (a, b and c) which are of different sizes but have the same DNA specificity. We now show that one of these also contains the Rb protein and, further, that the adenovirus E1a protein causes the dissociation of the Rb protein from this complex. This requires conserved regions 1 and 2 of E1a that are known to be required for efficient transformation. These results demonstrate that the Rb protein forms a complex with a DNA-bound transcription factor, and suggests that the Rb protein might act by regulating transcription. 
Enhanced immunoglobulin levels correlate with infectious complications after surgery in esophageal cancer. Severe septic complications account for the high mortality of patients with esophageal cancer. We examined the levels of immunoglobulins and complements together with infection-related complications in a large number of patients. Enhancements of IgG, IgA, C3, C4, and CH50 were evident in patients with esophageal cancer and were more predominant compared to findings in cases of gastric cancer. Average levels of IgG and IgA immediately before surgery were significantly higher in esophageal cancer patients with postoperative septic complications than in those without such problems. Preoperative radiation therapy and total parenteral nutrition did not significantly alter the levels of immunoglobulins and complements. It would thus appear that the enhancement of IgG and IgA is associated with the occurrence of infectious complications following surgery for patients with esophageal cancer. 
Evaluating painful osteopenia in the elderly. Osteopenia is a frequent finding on radiographs of elderly patients. When the exam is performed for skeletal pain, this finding may be significant. The differential diagnosis for osteopenia is extensive, but individualizing the patient work-up begins with a careful clinical history and laboratory studies. Appropriate radiographic exams can then be requested. A plain radiograph is always the starting point, followed by--as indicated--a nuclear bone scan, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. 
Cerebrovascular malformation causing sudden death. Analysis of three cases and review of the literature. Three unusual cases of sudden death resulting from cerebrovascular malformation (CVM) are presented. CVMs are highly variable in location and morphology, and may be difficult to detect. Two of the patients discussed here had CVMs that involved the circle of Willis directly, and produced rapidly fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage at the base of the brain; both of these subjects were in their late 30s. One had a history of epilepsy; the other had been completely asymptomatic prior to the catastrophic event. The third was an asymptomatic 6 year old with a cerebellar CVM, who survived long enough for inconclusive neurosurgical intervention. In all three cases, the diagnosis was not made prior to autopsy; in one case, the circumstances of death were initially misleading. The relevant literature is reviewed and discussed, with emphasis on differential diagnosis, anatomic examination, and background investigation. 
Exercise testing in patients with microvascular angina. The widespread use of exercise testing for the detection of myocardial ischemia in patients suspected of having coronary artery disease led to the detection of ischemic changes in many subjects who subsequently were found to have angiographically normal epicardial vessels--the false positive response. Such a result is usually interpreted as indicating that the subject's chest pain is of noncardiac origin. For the past several years, we have studied the mechanism of pain resembling angina that occurs in patients with normal epicardial coronary arteries demonstrated by angiography; we believe these studies have shed some light on this problem. Patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries who present because of a history of angina-like pain and/or ischemic changes detected during exercise electrocardiogram testing were evaluated by measuring great cardiac vein flow (under baseline conditions and after cardiac pacing, with and without intravenous administration of ergonovine) and by radionuclide angiography before and during exercise. We found that a substantial number of these subjects showed inadequate coronary vasodilator reserve and had exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction suggestive of myocardial ischemia. We concluded from our results that there is a distinct clinical syndrome of myocardial ischemia caused by abnormal resistance responses of the prearteriolar coronary microvasculature. We now refer to this syndrome as microvascular angina. In a series of 115 patients with documented microvascular angina, we also found that only 10% had ischemic ST changes with exercise testing (2% of the men and 17% of the women developed ischemic ST segment changes). 
Breast cancer with bone-only metastases. Visceral metastases-free rate in relation to anatomic distribution of bone metastases. The medical records of 82 patients with breast cancer with bone-only metastases were reviewed. According to the distribution of the metastases by bone scan at the time they were first documented, the patients were divided into three groups: Group A (patients who had bone metastases exclusively cranial to the lumbosacral junction), Group B (patients who had bone metastases exclusively caudal to the junction), and Group C (patients who had bone metastases both cranial and caudal to the junction). Group A had a significantly higher visceral metastases-free rate than Groups B or C. Serial bone scans and radiographs of Group A patients revealed that bone lesions cranial to the junction rarely developed into visceral metastases and that bone lesions extending caudal to the junction frequently developed into visceral metastases. These results indicate that the presence of bone metastases caudal to the lumbosacral junction is predictive of visceral metastases. 
Effects of volatile anesthetics on response to norepinephrine and acetylcholine in guinea pig atria. The in vitro chronotropic and inotropic effects of norepinephrine and acetylcholine in isolated right and left guinea pig atria were examined in the absence and presence of halothane, isoflurane, and enflurane (0.6 and 1.2 MAC). All three anesthetics elicited dose-dependent reductions in contractile force and spontaneous pacemaker activity. The maximal developed tension observed in the presence of norepinephrine was not altered by the anesthetics and corresponding ED50 values increased only in the presence of 1.2 MAC halothane and 1.2 MAC isoflurane. The anesthetics did not affect (a) the maximal positive chronotropic effect of norepinephrine, (b) the ED50 values for its positive chronotropic effect, and (c) acetylcholine-induced negative inotropic and chronotropic actions and did not induce arrhythmic activity even in the presence of the maximally effective neurotransmitter concentrations. These findings indicate that in isolated guinea pig atria volatile anesthetics, in concentrations up to 1.2 MAC, do not alter the inotropic and chronotropic effects of norepinephrine or acetylcholine and do not induce arrhythmogenic action in the presence of the neurotransmitters. These data suggest that altered atrial responsiveness to adrenergic or muscarinic stimulation does not contribute to the development of anesthetic-induced cardiac arrhythmias. 
Stress-induced gastroduodenal lesions and total parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients: frequency, complications, and the value of prophylactic treatment. A prospective, randomized study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency, complications, and value of prophylactic treatment of stress-induced gastroduodenal lesions. DESIGNS: Patients were prospectively randomized to treatment with total parenteral nutrition, either alone, with sucralfate, or with ranitidine. SETTING: A multidisciplinary ICU from a tertiary care referral center. PATIENTS: Ninety-seven patients submitted to prolonged mechanical ventilation, with normal hepatic and renal function, in metabolic stress, and receiving total parenteral nutrition. INTERVENTIONS: On admission, we determined the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and the catabolic index score. We also performed an endoscopic examination on day 3, every 7 days subsequently, and whenever needed. Thirty patients received total parenteral nutrition alone. Twenty-four patients received total parenteral nutrition and sucralfate (1 g by nasogastric tube every 4 hrs). Nineteen patients received total parenteral nutrition and ranitidine (50 mg iv every 6 hrs). MAIN RESULTS: The overall occurrence rate of gastroduodenal mucosal damage was 29.6%. The overall frequency rate for stress ulcerations was 15.6% and was 6.2% for stress hemorrhage. There were no deaths secondary to stress hemorrhage. The difference in the frequency of stress-induced mucosal lesions and stress hemorrhage between the studied groups was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Additional prophylaxis to total parenteral nutrition in the form of sucralfate and ranitidine to prevent acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is not required in this group of ICU patients. 
Polyethylene wear from retrieved acetabular cups. Laboratory wear testing of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene from 12 Charnley acetabular cups, removed after periods of up to 17.5 years showed that the large patient-to-patient variations in clinical penetration rate cannot be explained by batch-to-batch variation in the wear resistance of the material. Nor was there any evidence of a time-dependent degradation in wear resistance of the material. 
The effects on plasma lipoproteins of a prudent weight-reducing diet, with or without exercise, in overweight men and women. BACKGROUND. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommends a low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol diet, with weight loss if indicated, to correct elevated plasma cholesterol levels. Weight loss accomplished by simple caloric restriction or increased exercise typically increases the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Little is known about the effects on plasma lipoproteins of a hypocaloric NCEP diet with or without exercise in overweight people. METHODS. We tested the hypothesis that exercise (walking or jogging) will increase HDL cholesterol levels in moderately overweight, sedentary people who adopt a hypocaloric NCEP diet. We randomly assigned 132 men and 132 women 25 to 49 years old to one of three groups: control, hypocaloric NCEP diet, or hypocaloric NCEP diet with exercise. One hundred nineteen of the men and 112 of the women returned for testing after one year. RESULTS. After one year, the subjects in both intervention groups had reached or closely approached NCEP Step 1 dietary goals and reduced their mean body fat significantly (range of reduction in mean fat weight, 4.0 to 7.8 kg). Weight loss on the NCEP diet alone did not significantly change HDL cholesterol levels in either the men or the women as compared with the subjects in the control group. Plasma levels of HDL cholesterol increased significantly more in the men who exercised and dieted (mean [+/- SE] change, +13 +/- 3 percent) than in the men who only dieted (+2 +/- 3 percent, P less than 0.01) or the men who acted as controls (-4 +/- 2 percent, P less than 0.001). HDL cholesterol levels remained about the same in the women who exercised and dieted (+1 +/- 2 percent); they were higher than in the women who only dieted (-10 +/- 3 percent, P less than 0.01), but not higher than in the controls (-3 +/- 3 percent). CONCLUSIONS. Regular exercise in overweight men and women enhances the improvement in plasma lipoprotein levels that results from the adoption of a low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol diet. 
Subperiosteal abscess in children: scintigraphic appearance. A subperiosteal abscess is an uncommon complication of osteomyelitis in childhood. Bone scanning is very sensitive for the detection of early skeletal infection; however, a subperiosteal abscess has a different and distinctive scintigraphic appearance. The usual increased tracer uptake of osteomyelitis is overshadowed by the presence of a "cold" lesion on the delayed views, probably due to interruption of the vascular supply of the bone. Early recognition of the condition is important, as surgery is indicated to prevent extensive bone necrosis and chronic osteomyelitis. In suspected osteomyelitis, a central photopenic area is highly suggestive of subperiosteal abscess; when such an area is seen, a computed tomographic (CT) scan can be helpful in planning the surgical approach for drainage. Plain radiographs may be unremarkable even when the bone scan and CT findings are dramatic. Five such cases are presented, and a recommended diagnostic approach is discussed that views the two procedures as complementary. 
The management of IIB osteosarcoma. Experience from 1976 to 1985. From 1976 to 1985, 75 IIB osteosarcomas have been treated out of a total of 98 osteosarcomas at the authors' institution. Because of the effective chemotherapy including high-dose methotrexate administered during this time period, the surgical management changed, and only ten patients out of the 75 IIB osteosarcomas required an amputation. The overall result of 76.7% of disease-free, three-year survival was equally distributed regardless of the surgical procedure. Endoprosthesis, resection with or without grafts, and rotationplasties, as well as amputations, revealed similar results. No negative influence from the limb-sparing surgery could be observed. 
Salivary secretion rate, yeast cells, and oral candidiasis in patients with acute leukemia. Stimulated salivary secretion rate was repeatedly determined in 29 patients with acute leukemia during two periods of cytotoxic treatment in myelosuppressive doses. For comparison, the salivary secretion rate was studied in 83 healthy persons and in three other groups of hospitalized patients without malignant disorders. At the start of cytotoxic treatment the secretion rate in the patients with leukemia was lower than in healthy persons. The rate fell significantly after 1 to 3 days and later rose to the level seen in the healthy persons. Several interacting factors may have contributed to the decrease in salivary secretion rate, but the most important factor was probably the use of antiemetic drugs during the first 3 days of the study periods. No relationship was found between salivary secretion rate and the number of gram-negative rods found in the mouth. Patients with low salivary secretion rates had high numbers of yeast cells and more often oral candidiasis. 
CSF monoamine metabolites, cholinesterases and lactate in the adult hydrocephalus syndrome (normal pressure hydrocephalus) related to CSF hydrodynamic parameters. Monoamine metabolites, cholinesterases and lactic acid in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were investigated on patients with the adult hydrocephalus syndrome (idiopathic normal pressure syndrome; AHS, n = 15), Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 14), multi-infarct dementia (MID, n = 13) and controls (n = 21). Patients had clinical and CSF hydrodynamic investigations. Monoamine concentrations were determined by reversed-phase liquid chromatography, cholinesterases and lactate were determined photometrically. In the AHS patients, CSF monoamine concentrations were not significantly different compared with controls, AD or MID patients. AHS and AD patients showed a similar reduction of CSF acetylcholinesterase activity compared with controls. Positive correlations were found in concentrations of CSF homovanillic acid, CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and CSF lactic acid versus CSF outflow conductance (that is, resistance against CSF outflow) in the AHS patients. A similar pattern was observed in a subgroup of MID patients characterised by dilated ventricles and disturbed CSF hydrodynamics. These data suggest that a low CSF outflow conductance may facilitate the clearance of acidic substances from the arachnoid space at the probenecid sensitive active transport site. Alternative explanations would be that a pathologically low CSF outflow conductance is accompanied by an inverse caudorostral flow of CSF or a compromised trans-ependymal diffusion. 
A prospective comparison of laser therapy and intubation in endoscopic palliation for malignant dysphagia. There is little objective long-term follow-up comparing laser therapy with intubation for palliation of malignant dysphagia. In a prospective, nonrandomized two-center trial 43 patients treated with the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser were compared with 30 patients treated by endoscopic intubation; the two groups were comparable for mean age and tumor position, length, and histology. Dysphagia was graded from 0 to 4 (0, normal swallowing; 4, dysphagia for liquids). Pretreatment mean dysphagia grades were similar: laser-treated group, 2.9 (SD, 0.6); intubated group, 3.2 (SD, 0.55). For thoracic esophageal tumors, the percentage of patients achieving an improvement in dysphagia grade by greater than or equal to 1 grade initially and over the long term was similar (laser, 95% and 77%; intubation, 100% and 86%). For tumors crossing the cardia, intubation was significantly better (laser, 59% and 50%; intubation, 100% and 92%, respectively; P less than 0.001). In patients palliated over a long period, however, the mean dysphagia grade over the remainder of their mean dysphagia grade over the remainder of their lives (mean survival: laser, 6.1 months; intubation, 5.1 months) was better in the laser group (1.6 vs. 2.0; P less than 0.01); 33% of laser-treated and 11% of intubated patients could eat most or all solids (P less than 0.05). For long-term palliation, laser-treated patients required on average more procedures (4.6 vs. 1.4; P less than 0.05) and days in the hospital (14 vs. 9; P less than 0.05). The perforation rate was lower in the laser-treated group (2% vs. 13%; P less than 0.02); no treatment-related deaths occurred in either group. For individual patients, the best results are likely to be achieved when the two techniques are used in a complementary fashion in specialist centers. 
Acinetobacter peritonitis in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Little is written on peritonitis caused by Acinetobacter species in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). A retrospective review of medical records, dialysis unit charts, and microbiology culture logbooks identified 18 such patients treated at our hospital. All cases were community-acquired, and no common epidemiologic link between cases was detected. The most common manifestations were abdominal pain or tenderness (13 patients) and cloudy dialysate (six patients); only two patients had fever. Peritonitis without localized intra-abdominal abscess formation occurred in all instances. Intraperitoneal aminoglycoside therapy for 3 to 14 days (mean 10.7 days) eradicated infection in 14 cases. Two patients were successfully treated with 4 days of intraperitoneal gentamicin followed by 8 days of oral ciprofloxacin; another was cured with 10 days of IV ceftriaxone. Tenckhoff catheter removal was necessary in only one patient. Unlike pseudomonal or fungal peritonitis associated with CAPD, infection due to Acinetobacter species is generally responsive to antimicrobials alone. 
The IPR inventory: development and psychometric characteristics. The purpose of this study was to develop, validate, and norm a measure of dimensions of interpersonal relationships that are salient to nursing: social support, reciprocity, and conflict. The selection of these concepts was guided by social exchange and equity theories. In the first phase of the study, 44 respondents were interviewed to provide narrative data from which to develop items so that items would be grounded in lived experience. Content validity of items was judged by a panel of 11 experts. The revised 39-item instrument was tested in successive steps with a total of 340 students, patients, and community residents for reliability and validity, including internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, factor analysis, and three forms of validity assessment (theory testing, contrasted groups, and multitrait-multimethod comparison). The three subscales of social support, reciprocity, and conflict demonstrated repeated internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Strong evidence of construct validity was demonstrated for the social support and the conflict subscales; validity of the reciprocity subscale was equivocal. 
Ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia in awake rats pretreated with capsaicin. Ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia were measured by indirect plethysmography in unanesthetized unrestrained adult rats injected neonatally with capsaicin (50 mg/kg) or vehicle. Such capsaicin treatment ablates a subpopulation of primary afferent fibers containing substance P and various other neuropeptides. Ventilation was measured while the rats breathed air, 12% O2 in N2, 8% O2 in N2, 5% CO2 in O2, or 8% CO2 in O2. Neonatal treatment with capsaicin caused marked alterations in both the magnitude and composition of the hypoxic but not hypercapnic ventilatory response. The increase in minute ventilation evoked by hypoxia in the vehicle-treated rats resulted entirely from an increase in respiratory frequency. In the capsaicin-treated rats the hypoxic ventilatory response was significantly reduced owing to an attenuation of the frequency response. Although both groups responded to hypoxia with a shortening in inspiratory and expiratory times, rats treated with capsaicin displayed less shortening of both respiratory phases. By contrast, hypercapnia induced a brisk ventilatory response in the capsaicin-treated group that was similar in magnitude and pattern to that observed in the vehicle-treated group. Analysis of the components of the hypercapnic ventilatory responses revealed no significant differences between the two groups. We, therefore, conclude that neuropeptide-containing C-fibers are essential for the tachypnic component of the ventilatory response to hypoxia but not hypercapnia. 
Late variation in ventricular function after myocardial infarction. To assess the possible role of variables not related to early infarct artery reperfusion in predicting late changes in ventricular function after infarction, paired early (mean 6.6 +/- 3.5 days after admission) and late (12.7 +/- 7.0 months later) cross-sectional echocardiograms from 54 infarction survivors were retrospectively reviewed. Ejection fraction was calculated from digitized biapical echocardiographic views on a graphics tablet. Changes of 0.10 or more in LVEF were correlated with 23 clinical variables. By stepwise regression analysis, Q-wave infarction and low early LVEF independently predicted late improvement in function. Early high LVEF and interval infarction were the only independent predictors of late declines in function. Overall, when patients were indexed by early left ventricular systolic function, a pronounced late "regression to the mean" was noted with initially high values tending to fall and low values to rise (r = -0.44, p less than 0.001). This effect must be accounted for in any acute intervention trial in myocardial infarction. The occurrence of Q-wave infarction does not exclude late improvement in ventricular function. 
Proliferation and cytolytic function of anti-CD3 + interleukin-2 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells following bone marrow transplantation. We evaluated the proliferation, cytolytic function, and phenotypic characteristics of anti-CD3 plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 44 patients with leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with multiagent chemotherapy or following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). BMT patients had decreased cell growth with only a 1.35 +/- 0.25 (autologous BMT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), 1.24 +/- 0.25 (autologous BMT for NHL), and 0.8 +/- 0.1 (allogeneic BMT for leukemia) mean fold increase by day 5 of culture compared with controls (4.0 +/- 0.4), P less than .001. Anti-CD3 + IL-2 activated cells from patients with ALL and NHL who had received autologous BMT and cells from patients with leukemia who underwent allogeneic BMT were more effective in lysing the natural killer (NK) sensitive target, K562, and the NK-resistant target, Daudi, compared with controls. In contrast, cytolysis of K562 and Daudi by cultured PBMCs from patients with ALL and NHL receiving multi-agent chemotherapy was similar to that of controls. Cultures from BMT recipients had a significant increase in CD16+ (autologous ALL 5.7 +/- 1.5%, P less than .01; autologous NHL 12.4 +/- 3.5%, P less than .001; allogeneic 14.3 +/- 2.9%, P less than .001) and CD56+ cells (autologous ALL 27.6 +/- 12.0%, P less than .01; autologous NHL 39.3 +/- 9.5%, P less than .001; allogeneic 42.7 +/- 7.4%, P less than .001) compared with controls (CD16+ 2.5 +/- 0.4%; CD56+ 6.9 +/- 0.9%). Stimulation of PBMCs with anti-CD3 + IL-2 is effective in generating cells with high cytolytic function post-BMT. 
Mesenteric infarction secondary to tumor emboli from primary aortic sarcoma. Guidelines for diagnosis and management. Primary aortic tumors are rare, difficult to diagnose, and often fatal. This case and a review of the literature identified aortic tumors as a potential source of emboli leading to acute mesenteric insufficiency. The case showed the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing and determining the extent and location of an aortic tumor. 
Tumor cell invasion inhibited by TIMP-2 The 72-kd type IV collagenase is a member of the collagenase enzyme family that has been closely linked with the invasive phenotype of cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that both normal cells and highly invasive tumor cells produce the 72-kd type IV procollagenase enzyme in a complexed form consisting of the proenzyme and a novel tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, TIMP-2. The balance between activated enzyme and available inhibitor is thought to be a critical determinant of the matrix proteolysis associated with a variety of pathologic processes, including tumor cell invasion. In the present study, we demonstrate that alteration of the metalloproteinase-metalloproteinase-inhibitor balance in favor of excess inhibitor blocks human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 tumor cell invasion of a reconstituted basement membrane. The HT-1080 cell line produces both the 72-kd and the 92-kd type IV collagenases. Alteration of the type IV collagenase-inhibitor balance was achieved by addition of free TIMP-2 or antibodies to 72-kd type IV collagenase. Native, purified TIMP-2 was inhibitory in the range of 1-25 micrograms/mL. Addition of specific antiserum against the 72-kd type IV collagenase, which did not cross-react with the 92-kd type IV collagenase, inhibited HT-1080 cell invasion to the same extent. These results suggest that metalloproteinases, in particular the 72-kd type IV collagenase, are critical for tumor cell invasion of the reconstituted basement membrane. Our findings demonstrate that addition of the endogenous inhibitor TIMP-2 is able to block invasion. Thus, we recommend initiation of in vivo studies of the therapeutic potential of TIMP-2 to block tumor cell invasion and intravasation into the circulation. 
Load dependence of the effective regurgitant orifice area in a sheep model of aortic regurgitation. Treatment of patients with aortic regurgitation with vasodilators reduces regurgitant volume, ventricular dilation and left ventricular mass. Although these effects are presumably due to afterload reduction, it is also possible that the aortic regurgitant orifice area is not constant. To test the latter hypothesis, aortic regurgitation was created in 10 open chest sheep by partial resection of the noncoronary leaflet under direct visualization. Regurgitant flow was measured with an aortic supravalvular electromagnetic probe; aortic and left ventricular pressures were measured with catheter-tipped micromanometer pressure transducers. The effective regurgitant orifice area was calculated by a modification of the continuity equation in a manner similar to the Gorlin equation. The regurgitant orifice area was measured three times: after aortic regurgitation was created, after mean arterial pressure was increased by 15 to 25 mm Hg with intravenous dopamine and after mean arterial pressure was reduced by 15 to 25 mm Hg with intravenous sodium nitroprusside. Comparison of regurgitant volumes and areas obtained after creation of aortic regurgitation and at the conclusion of the experiment in the absence of dopamine or sodium nitroprusside demonstrated no significant change over time. Dopamine administration was associated with an 86 +/- 81% increase in regurgitant volume (p less than 0.01) and a 38 +/- 44% increase in regurgitant orifice area (p less than 0.01). Sodium nitroprusside administration resulted in a 51 +/- 14% decrease in regurgitant volume (p less than 0.001) and a 28 +/- 21% reduction in regurgitant orifice area (p = 0.007). In this model of acute aortic regurgitation, the effective regurgitant orifice area was altered by increasing or decreasing the aortic transvalvular pressure gradient.
