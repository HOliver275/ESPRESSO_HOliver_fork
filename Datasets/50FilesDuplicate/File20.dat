5	Single polypoid cystitis cystica and glandularis presenting as benign bladder tumor. A case report of a ten-year-old boy with a benign polypoid bladder tumor is presented. The rarity of benign or malignant bladder tumors in children is reviewed, as well as the possible etiology of this unique lesion. 
5	Single versus double indicator dilution measurements of extravascular lung water. OBJECTIVE: To compare a simplified method of measuring extravascular lung water (EVLW) using only a single indicator (EVLW-SI) with the standard double indicator dilution technique (EVLW-DI). DESIGN: Direct comparison of EVLW-SI with EVLW-DI in 18 critically ill patients. SETTING: A general medical ICU in a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Nine men and nine women, ages 19 to 80 yr. Six patients were in shock (four from septic shock), and 11 were in respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS: EVLW-DI and cardiac output were measured in triplicate during injection of cold indocyanine green dye. Cardiac output was calculated both from pulmonary artery (COpa) and femoral artery (COfem-di) thermal dilution signals. EVLW-SI and COfem-si were also measured during three additional injections of cold saline using only thermal signals from the pulmonary and femoral arteries. Order of measurements was random. EVLW-SI was measured in ten patients while blood was withdrawn through the femoral catheter and in ten patients without blood drawn through the femoral catheter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 84 comparisons were made. Although the overall correlations were good (r2 = .86), EVLW-SI systematically overestimated EVLW-DI (p less than .05). This difference was greater when EVLW-SI was measured without blood withdrawal through the femoral catheter. In this subgroup, mean values for EVLW by the two methods were within 20% of one another in only two of ten patients, in contrast to the results in six of eight patients in which blood was withdrawn through the catheter. COfem-si and COfem-di also overestimated COpa. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretically, neither injection of green dye nor blood withdrawal should be necessary during measurements of EVLW-SI, making it a simpler technique for bedside use than EVLW-DI. However, significant discrepancies exist between the two techniques. Some of this difference is apparently due to technical factors related to catheter design. In any case, we cannot recommend use of the single indicator dilution technique at present to estimate EVLW. 
5	Delayed, exsanguinating pelvic hemorrhage after blunt trauma without bony fracture: case report. We present a case of a young man who developed a delayed, life-threatening hemorrhage after blunt pelvic trauma. He did not have a bony fracture. Successful management of the hemorrhage with angiographic embolization and the complex subsequent course are discussed. 
3	Neuromuscular function in polio survivors at one-year follow-up [published erratum appears in Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1991 Mar;72(3):213] Many polio survivors complain of progressive loss of strength, work capacity, endurance, and ability to recover from fatiguing activity. These variables were measured initially and one year later in the quadriceps muscles of 28 symptomatic and 16 asymptomatic persons who had polio and 38 control individuals. Peak knee extension torque was measured isokinetically and isometrically. Endurance, or the amount of time the subject could maintain isometric torque at 40% of maximal torque, was measured. Work capacity was determined as the product of isometric torque and endurance time. Recovery of strength was measured at regular intervals for ten minutes after the endurance test. Statistical analysis was done by repeated measures ANOVA. Although the initial measures showed significant deficits in mean peak torque, work capacity, and recovery of strength in symptomatic postpolio subjects, no significant changes were found one year later in any of the variables. We conclude that symptomatic postpolio subjects do not lose significant neuromuscular function in one year. 
4	Physical activity, opportunity for reinfection, and sibling history of heart disease as risk factors for Chagas' cardiopathy. A case-control study was conducted to examine whether physical activity, sibling history of heart disease (HHD), and length of residence in an area endemic for Chagas' disease were associated with the risk of developing Chagas' cardiopathy. Two hundred forty-seven cases of Chagas' heart disease and 345 seropositive subjects with normal ECG (controls) were selected in a population survey in Goiania, Brazil. Prevalence ratios for exposure variables were estimated for cases in relation to controls and for subgroups of seropositives with selected ECG abnormalities in relation to controls. Increasing age and male sex were consistently and significantly related to an increased risk of ECG abnormalities. HHD was significantly associated with ECG alterations in 3 of the 5 comparison subgroups (any ECG alteration, right bundle branch block, and left anterior hemiblock). No association was found between length of residence in an area endemic, physical activity, and ECG abnormalities. A sample of 529 seronegative subjects were also examined and the interaction between exposure variables and seropositivity was tested to assess whether the associations found were specific for seropositives. Males were at greater risk of any ECG alteration and left anterior hemiblock in relation to females if they were seropositive. An increasing risk of ventricular premature beats with age was clearer for seropositive than for seronegative subjects. Subjects with HHD were at an increased risk of ECG abnormalities and this was greater in those with a positive serological test (P less than 0.05). The findings suggest a possible geographical clustering or a familial aggregation of cases of Chagas' heart disease. 
5	Constipation: pathophysiology and treatment. Although many physicians consider constipation a trivial problem, it is one of the most frequent and chronic digestive disorders in the United States, affecting 4.53 million people and causing considerable morbidity. More than $200 million are spent for over-the-counter laxatives and untold millions of dollars are spent for prescription drugs and other medical services to manage this disorder. Successful management requires an appreciation of the magnitude of the problem, an understanding of colorectal function and a clear assessment of the causes. Careful examination of the patient's anorectal anatomy and improvement in the patient's dietary habits are the first steps in management. Therapeutic options include behavioral modification strategies, diet and lifestyle changes, pharmacologic therapy and, rarely, surgical intervention. 
2	Do life events or depression exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease? A prospective study. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether depressed mood or life events are associated with an exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. DESIGN: A prospective study of a consecutive sample of patients with relapsing inflammatory bowel disease, followed by monthly questionnaires and periodic office visits. SETTING: A referral-based gastroenterology clinic at a medical school. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 32 patients with inflammatory bowel disease who had had at least one relapse in a 2-year period after entry into the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Social Readjustment Rating Scale (measuring life events), the Beck Depression Inventory (a visual analog scale for depressed mood) and an inventory of intestinal symptoms were completed monthly by each subject with a 78% rate of compliance. A mean of 2.2 exacerbations was seen per subject during the study period. Life events were not temporally associated with changes in intestinal symptoms. Significant associations were found between intestinal symptoms and the two mood scales (P less than 0.05 for each), but no directionality in symptom occurrence could be detected in a time-lagged analysis. The results were similar when the months preceding exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease were analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS: Although these findings suggest that mood changed concurrently with exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, no evidence indicated that stressful life events or depressed mood precipitated exacerbations in this study group. 
1	Does increased detection account for the rising incidence of breast cancer? BACKGROUND: The incidence of breast cancer has been increasing over time in the United States. METHODS: To determine the role of screening in this increase, trends in the incidence of in situ and invasive carcinoma of the breast were evaluated using records of the metropolitan Atlanta SEER program between 1979 and 1986. From a sample of records, evidence of symptoms and mammographic screening prior to diagnosis was recorded. RESULTS: The average annual age-adjusted incidence of invasive disease rose 29 percent among Whites and 41 percent among Blacks. Incidence increased in all age groups. A trend towards earlier detection of invasive disease was found. Asymptomatic tumors accounted for only 40 percent of the increased incidence among whites and 25 percent of the increased incidence among blacks, with mammography as the principal contributing procedure. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that increased detection accounts for some but not all of the rising incidence of breast cancer in the United States. 
5	Bone mineral loss in young women with amenorrhoea. OBJECTIVE--To examine the impact of amenorrhoea on bone mineral density in women of reproductive age. DESIGN--Cross sectional study of 200 amenorrhoeic women compared with normally menstruating controls. SETTING--Teaching hospital outpatient clinic specialising in reproductive medicine. SUBJECTS--200 Women aged 16-40 with a past or current history of amenorrhoea from various causes and of a median duration of three years, and a control group of 57 age matched normal volunteers with no history of menstrual disorder. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Bone mineral density in the lumbar spine (L1-L4) as measured by dual energy x ray absorptiometry. RESULTS--The amenorrhoeic group showed a mean reduction in bone mineral density of 15% (95% confidence interval 12% to 18%) as compared with controls (mean bone mineral density 0.89 (SD 0.12) g/cm2 v 1.05 (0.09) g/cm2 in controls). Bone loss was related to the duration of amenorrhoea and the severity of oestrogen deficiency rather than to the underlying diagnosis. Patients with a history of fracture had significantly lower bone density than those without a history of fracture. Ten patients had suffered an apparently atraumatic fracture. CONCLUSIONS--Amenorrhoea in young women should be investigated and treated to prevent bone mineral loss. Menopausal women with a past history of amenorrhoea should be considered to be at high risk of osteoporosis. 
4	Regulation of fibrillar collagen types I and III and basement membrane type IV collagen gene expression in pressure overloaded rat myocardium. Left ventricular hypertrophy is based on cardiac myocyte growth. The hypertrophic process can be considered heterogeneous based on whether it also includes a remodeling and accumulation of fibrillar types I and III collagens that are responsible for impaired myocardial stiffness. In the heart, the messenger RNA (mRNA) for fibrillar collagen types I and III has been detected only in cardiac fibroblasts, whereas mRNA for basement membrane collagen type IV is present in both fibroblasts and myocytes. We studied the early and long-term expression of these collagenous proteins in rat myocardium after abdominal aortic banding with renal ischemia. Complementary DNA probes for rat pro-alpha 2 (I), mouse type III and mouse type IV collagens, and chicken beta-actin were used. Northern and dot blot analysis on total RNA extracted from left ventricular tissue indicated a sixfold increase in steady-state levels of mRNA for collagen type I on day 3 of abdominal aortic banding, which had declined to control levels by day 7 where it remained rather constant at 4 and 8 weeks. Type III collagen showed a similar pattern of gene expression after banding. mRNA levels for type IV collagen, on the other hand, were elevated on day 1 after banding, returning to control at day 7 and remaining constant. Actin mRNA levels also increased on day 1 of banding, followed by a rapid return to control levels. Monospecific antibody to types I and III collagens and immunofluorescent light microscopy on frozen sections of the myocardium revealed that at 1 week after banding, the distribution and density of these collagens were similar to those of control animals. 
3	Threat of unemployment and cardiovascular risk factors: longitudinal study of quality of sleep and serum cholesterol concentrations in men threatened with redundancy. OBJECTIVE--To assess whether the threat of unemployment affects risk factors for cardiovascular disease. DESIGN--Longitudinal study of a cohort of middle aged shipyard workers followed up for a mean of 6.2 (SD 1.9) years and a group of controls observed for the same period. The first investigation took place during a period of relative economic stability for the shipyard and the second during the phase of its closure. SETTING--An age cohort health screening programme in Malmo, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS--715 Male shipyard workers and 261 age matched male controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in 19 variables related to the risk of cardiovascular disease, and psychological variables, alcohol consumption, smoking, and dietary habits as assessed by questionnaire. RESULTS--Serum cholesterol concentrations increased more (mean 0.25 (SD 0.68) mmol/l v 0.08 (0.66) mmol/l) and serum calcium concentrations decreased less (-0.06 (0.10) mmol/l v -0.08 (0.09) mmol/l) in the shipyard workers than in the controls. A correlation was found between scores for sleep disturbance and changes in serum cholesterol concentration. In the whole series there was a greater increase in serum cholesterol concentrations among men threatened with unemployment (437/976; 44.8%) than among those who were not. In stepwise regression analysis the change in serum cholesterol concentration was correlated with changes in haemoglobin concentration, body weight, and serum triglyceride and calcium concentrations. A positive correlation was found between change in cholesterol concentration and change in blood pressure, indicating that the overall risk profile had worsened among men with increased serum cholesterol concentrations. CONCLUSIONS--Risk of unemployment increases the serum cholesterol concentration in middle aged men, the increase being more pronounced in those with sleep disturbance. The increase in serum cholesterol is related to changes in other established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These findings might partly explain the excessive mortality due to cardiovascular disease recorded among the unemployed and people with sleep disturbance. 
5	Morphological and biochemical changes in gastric mucosa of aging rats. Although previous data from this laboratory have indicated that aging is associated with increased gastric mucosal proliferative activity, no direct assessment of proliferative potential of the tissue has been made during aging. In order to assess this, and to determine whether changes in mucosal proliferative potential would be reflected in growth of the tissue, we have examined the labeling index (LI), height and morphology of the gastric mucosa in young (4-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) Fischer-344 rats. In addition, tyrosine kinase (Tyr-k) activity and the levels of phosphotyrosine proteins were determined to evaluate their relationship to mucosal proliferative activity. Histologic evaluation revealed a marked atrophy of the mucosal glandular component with 32% reduction in height in aged rats when compared with young animals. In aged rats, there was also a decrease in gland density, resulting in a reduction in the number of epithelial cells of all types with evidence of decreased secretory activity. Despite the occurrence of mucosal atrophy in aged rats, LI in these animals was significantly increased by 28%. This was associated with a parallel rise in mucosal Tyr-k activity, and a two- to threefold increase in the relative concentrations of seven phosphotyrosine membrane proteins with Mr of 120, 105, 90, 60, 55, 48 and 32 kDa. We conclude that (1) although aging is associated with increased gastric mucosal proliferative activity, this does not result in mucosal growth and that (2) Tyr-k and tyrosine phosphorylation of certain proteins play a role in the regulation of gastric mucosal cell proliferation during aging. 
2	Blood transfusion and recurrence of colorectal cancer: the role of platelet derived growth factors. Efforts to explain the possible effects of blood transfusion on the recurrence of colorectal cancer have been based entirely on the immunosuppressive effects of blood transfusion. However, the relationship between solid tumour development and the immune system is inconclusive. We have investigated an alternative mechanism involving the potential role of growth factors in this phenomenon. Using a human fibroblast: [125I]deoxyuridine uptake mitogenesis assay, the relative amounts of growth factor in the plasma of stored blood were measured. There was a progressive increase in mitogenesis from day 0 (n = 6) to day 28 (n = 6; P less than 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The effect of growth factors on the development of liver and intraperitoneal metastases was studied in Hooded Lister rats. Following an intraportal injection of 10(5) MC28 tumour cells, the experimental group (n = 25) received 2 ml of syngeneic serum intravenously for 4 days. Likewise, colonic anastomoses were performed on omentectomized rats and the peritoneal cavity seeded with 10(3) cells. The experimental groups (n = 20) received either 2 ml serum intravenously repeatedly or 3 ml serum intraperitoneally (n = 19). There was no significant increase in liver metastases or peritoneal disease following intravenous infusion of serum but serum delivered intraperitoneally resulted in a significant increase in tumour from 22 per cent in the controls to 89 per cent in the study group (P less than 0.01). Growth factors released from platelets following blood loss into the peritoneal cavity may be important in enhancing local recurrence of colorectal cancer. 
1	Enhanced modulation of antibodies coating guinea pig leukemic cells in vitro and in vivo. The role of Fc gamma R expressing cells. We have investigated the antigenic modulation induced by a number of antibody fragments and derivatives directed against the idiotype of the surface Ig of the L2C guinea pig B lymphoblastic leukemia, and studied the effects upon such modulation of the simultaneous presence of cells expressing Fc gamma receptors (FcR). In vitro studies confirmed previous work showing that antibody bivalency is required to induce modulation in vitro in simple systems. However, in the presence of isolated Kupffer cells, Fc-containing univalent antibodies were found to induce significant antigenic modulation, and the modulation induced by intact IgG was also found to be more rapid and extensive. Fragments that did not contain Fc regions behaved similarly in the presence or absence of Kupffer cells. Further investigations demonstrated that all three classes of human FcR can mediate modulation enhancement, and suggest that the mechanism involves indirect cross-linking of cell surface Ag via the antibody and effector cell FcR. In vivo studies showed that univalent antibody derivatives containing Fc regions did induce antigenic modulation, but that this was significantly reduced in comparison with bivalent antibodies, confirming their potential advantage for immunotherapy. 
1	Basement membrane of cervical adenocarcinoma: an immunoperoxidase study of laminin and type IV collagen. The basement membrane components type IV collagen and laminin were examined immunohistochemically in 14 cases of adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The patterns of staining in adenocarcinoma in situ, invasive adenocarcinoma, and early invasive adenocarcinoma were compared to see whether characteristic patterns could be delineated. Adenocarcinoma in situ had a uniform intact basement membrane, whereas the basement membrane of invasive adenocarcinoma was fragmented and irregular. Cases of early stromal invasion showed early gland buds and outpouchings with defective basement membrane staining. The degree of histologic differentiation of the tumor was not clearly related to the amount of basement membrane component staining. The concept of early stromal invasion in cervical adenocarcinoma, as supported by our immunohistochemical studies, is discussed as it relates to a possible pathogenic mechanism in early invasion and infiltration of adenocarcinoma of the cervix. 
1	Decreased expression of integrin adhesive protein receptors in adenocarcinoma of the breast. The integrin superfamily represents a major class of receptors mediating cell-substrate adhesion. Our recent study of the tissue distribution of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin, a cell-surface collagen receptor, revealed that high levels of receptor expression were associated with orderly, regulated epithelial cell proliferation. Those observations prompted the present investigation of alpha 2 beta 1 and other integrins in adenocarcinoma of the breast. The alpha 2 beta 1 integrin was highly expressed on the epithelium of the ducts and ductules of normal breast tissue. Normal or nearly normal levels of the receptor were expressed in fibroadenomas. In contrast, markedly decreased or undetectable alpha 2 beta 1 expression was typical of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. Well-differentiated lesions exhibited intermediate levels of expression. Similar, but less extensive, decreases in expression were observed for the alpha 5 beta 1 (fibronectin receptor) and alpha v beta 3 (vitronectin receptor). Significant expression of the beta 1 subunit on even poorly differentiated tumors suggests that the expression of other undefined members of the beta 1 family is not reduced to the same low level as alpha 2 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1. Expression of the alpha 2 beta 1 integrin was highly correlated with estrogen-receptor expression. Decreased expression of alpha 2 beta 1 and other integrin adhesive protein receptors probably contributes to the altered adhesive properties of tumor cells characteristic of the malignant phenotype. 
1	Normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells manifest differential sensitivity to inhibitory effects of c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides: an in vitro study relevant to bone marrow purging. The c-myb protooncogene is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells, and its encoded protein, Myb, is required for hematopoietic cell proliferation. To analyze the relative Myb dependence of normal and leukemic human hematopoietic progenitor cells, normal bone marrow cells, several types of leukemic blast cells, and 1:1 mixtures of normal and leukemic cells were cultured in the presence of c-myb sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; cell viability and cloning efficiency were then assessed. c-myb sense oligomers had negligible effects on normal and leukemic cells. In contrast, c-myb antisense oligomers strongly inhibited or completely abolished clonogenic growth of a T-cell leukemia line, 78% (18 of 23) of primary acute myelogenous leukemia cases examined, and 4 of 5 primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases in blast crisis. In three of the latter patients, polymerase chain reaction analysis of a 1:1 mixture of c-myb antisense-treated normal and CML cells revealed a complete absence of bcr-abl expression, suggesting that the CML clonogenic units had been completely eliminated from the cultures. At antisense doses that inhibited leukemic cell growth, normal hematopoietic progenitor cells survived. Thus, normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells show differential sensitivity to the toxic effects of c-myb antisense DNA. Perturbation of c-myb function with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides might eventually form the basis for a molecular approach to leukemia therapy, perhaps most immediately as ex vivo bone marrow purging agents. 
5	Drug fever. Remember to consider it in diagnosis. Drug fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with unexplained fever. Clues in the history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment can point to the diagnosis before extensive, costly, and potentially harmful investigations and therapies are begun. 
4	Cutaneous vasculitis associated with pheochromocytoma. We describe a patient who presented with constitutional symptoms, severe hypertension, and purpuric lesions over the knees, thighs, and penis. The patient was eventually diagnosed as having multiple endocrine neoplasia type II, with cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The cutaneous vasculitis persisted despite treatment with high-dose systemic corticosteroids, but rapidly resolved after the removal of bilateral pheochromocytomas. This case demonstrates cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis in association with pheochromocytoma. 
5	The neural substrate of memory impairment demonstrated by the intracarotid amobarbital procedure. The intracarotid amobarbital sodium (Amytal) procedure (IAP) was performed for 46 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (21 with left seizure foci; 25 with right seizure foci). After anteromedial temporal lobectomy, neuronal densities were established for hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, and CA3; the hilum; and the dentate granule cell layer. Intracarotid amobarbital procedure memory results were related to CA3 neuronal loss only. Patients who did not demonstrate memory after injection contralateral to the seizure focus had significantly fewer cells in CA3 than patients who did. Additionally, a significant correlation was observed between the intracarotid amobarbital procedure memory examination raw score after injection contralateral to the seizure focus and CA3 cell density. Using chi 2 analysis, significant differences were documented in the frequency with which memory was demonstrated after injection contralateral to the seizure focus for groups of patients classified by degree of CA3 neuronal loss. This finding supports prior research showing subfield specificity in some memory processes. 
1	Misdiagnosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome due to hyperlipidemia. Most authorities feel that diagnosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is established when the serum gastrin level is greater than 1000 pg/mL (1000 ng/L) in a patient with gastric acid hypersecretion and clinical manifestations consistent with the diagnosis. A patient with recurrent peptic ulcer disease is reported who was thought to have had the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome based on two serum gastrin level measurements greater than 1000 pg/mL (1000 ng/L). Subsequent evaluation revealed the gastrin elevation to be spurious because the sample was hyperlipidemic. Lipemic serum samples may yield falsely elevated serum gastrin determinations as determined by radioimmunoassay. 
3	Abnormal pattern detected in fragile-X patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The fragile-X syndrome is the most frequent inherited form of mental retardation, with an incidence of 1 in 1,500 males. It is characterized by the presence of a fragile site at Xq27.3 induced in vitro by folate deprivation or by inhibitors of deoxynucleotide synthesis. Its mode of inheritance is unusual for an X-linked trait, with incomplete penetrance in both males and females. Some phenotypically normal males transmit the mutation to all their daughters who rarely express any symptoms, but penetrance is high in sons and daughters of these carrier women. Genetic and physical mapping of the Xq27-q28 region has confirmed that the disease locus is located at or very near the fragile site. Hypotheses proposed to account for the abnormalities in the inheritance of the disease include sequence rearrangements by meiotic recombination or a mutation that affects reactivation of an inactive X chromosome during differentiation of female germ cells. To detect such rearrangements, or methylation changes that may reflect a locally inactive X chromosome, we used pulsed-field gel analysis of DNA from fragile-X patients with probes close to the fragile-X locus. The probe Do33 (DXS465) detected abnormal patterns in fragile-X patients, but not in normal controls or in non-expressing male transmitters. 
5	A simple stress test for the evaluation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during the first 6 months of life. In 33 normal infants, divided into 3 age groups (less than 1 month, 1-3 months, and 3-6 months) plasma cortisol was measured at 2230, 2300, and 2330 h. Baseline plasma cortisol at 2230 h. was, as expected, low in all infants, with mean +/- SEM values of 41 +/- 5, 72 +/- 14, and 97 +/- 17 nmol/L in each group, respectively. Thirty and 60 min after the painful stimulus of the venipuncture, plasma cortisol increased significantly (P less than 0.0005), reaching a maximum increase up to 458 +/- 50, 392 +/- 66, and 455 +/- 97 nmol/L in each age group, respectively. We conclude that in these infants the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was functionally intact and responded to the painful stimulus of the venipuncture by a significant increase in plasma cortisol. This test may be used as a simple procedure for the evaluation of the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis without the administration of pharmacological agents. Its usefulness, however, should be validated with patients having a disorder of the system. 
2	Injection or heat probe for bleeding ulcer. A prospective randomized trial was performed to compare the efficacy of endoscopic epinephrine injection and heat probe treatment in actively bleeding peptic ulcers. Emergency endoscopy in 1758 patients over an 18-month period identified 132 patients with active ulcer bleeding. They were randomized to receive either endoscopic epinephrine injection or heat probe treatment. After endoscopy, the patients were transferred to the surgical gastroenterology ward and were managed by surgeons unaware of the treatment option. Bleeding was initially controlled in 96% by epinephrine injection and in 83% by heat probe (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in outcome as measured by transfusion requirement (4.5 units vs. 3.8 units), emergency surgery (20% vs. 22%), hospital stay (8 days vs. 7 days), and mortality (2 vs. 4) between the injection group and the heat probe group. Two patients in the heat probe group experienced perforation. We conclude that both endoscopic epinephrine injection and heat probe treatment are effective in stopping bleeding from actively bleeding ulcers. Epinephrine injection is technically easier to perform and has a higher initial success rate. 
5	A bradykinin antagonist modifies allergen-induced mediator release and late bronchial responses in sheep. We assessed the role of bradykinin (BK) in allergen-induced early and late bronchial responses, airway inflammation, mediator release, and antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic sheep by studying the effects of the BK B2 receptor antagonist, NPC-567 (D-Arg-[Hyp3, D-Phe7]-BK), on these parameters. Antigen challenge was performed on two occasions greater than 3 wk apart, once with placebo (control) and once after high-dose (10 mg/ml) and low-dose (5 mg/ml) treatments with aerosol NPC-567. In the control trials (n = 14) antigen challenge resulted in an early and late increase in specific lung resistance (SRL). The early response was associated with increases (p less than 0.05) in prostaglandin (PG) D2, immunoreactive kinin, tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME)-esterase, and PGE2 in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The late response was associated with increases (p less than 0.05) in leukotrienes (LT) B4 and C4, thromboxane (TX) B2, 6-keto-PGF10, and PGE2. There was a significant influx of neutrophils in the BAL fluid during the late response, and airway hyperresponsiveness to carbachol aerosol was apparent 4 h after challenge. In six sheep the high-dose NPC-567 treatment (given before, during, and 4 h after antigen challenge) did not attenuate the early bronchoconstrictor response or the early release of mediators but caused a significant reduction in the late response (p less than 0.05). This protective effect was accompanied by reductions (p less than 0.05) in both the concentrations of all the mediators associated with the late response and the severity of the BAL neutrophilia. High-dose NPC-567 did not attenuate the airway hyperresponsiveness or the cellular inflammatory response seen 24 h after challenge. In eight sheep treated with the low dose of NPC-567 (given before, during, and 4, 8, and 24 h after challenge) the early response was not blocked but the late response was again inhibited, as were the mediators associated with the late response. At the low dose the drug did not prevent the airway inflammation at 8 or 24 h. The additional treatments did, however, prevent the 24 h hyperresponsiveness. These data suggest that kinin generation during antigen-induced airway anaphylaxis may be important for controlling the release of arachidonic acid metabolites from airway inflammatory cells that contribute to the development of the late response in the allergic sheep model. 
3	Pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsy due to midbrain infarction. Vasculopathic oculomotor nerve palsies with pupillary sparing are thought to be due to ischemic damage to the nerve in the subarachnoid space or the cavernous sinus. We present two cases of patients with isolated pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsies due to midbrain infarcts. Focal ischemic midbrain lesions should be considered in cases of pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsies. 
5	The role of gastric resection in the management of multicentric argyrophil gastric carcinoids. A patient with pernicious anemia, atrophic non-antral gastritis, hypergastrinemia, and widespread hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells and manifest enterochromaffin-like cell carcinoma was followed up during 39 months, including 15 months after gastric resection. In this case normalization of gastrin levels did not prevent the development of multiple gastric carcinoids in the fundic mucosa, suggesting that factors other than gastrin are of importance in the pathogenesis. 
1	Microdochectomy for discharge from a single lactiferous duct. Microdochectomy for persistent discharge from a single lactiferous duct was performed in 162 women. Invasive or in situ ductal carcinoma was diagnosed in 16 patients (10 per cent), none of whom had a palpable lump. The discharge was blood-stained in 14 of these women and in two it was clear. Mammography was performed in 15 of these 16 patients and was abnormal in only five. Three patients had atypical ductal hyperplasia, one of whom subsequently developed an invasive ductal carcinoma. Microdochectomy for persistent discharge from a single lactiferous duct is curative and gives a diagnosis of the cause. It remains the treatment of choice whether the discharge is blood-stained or clear. 
1	Subrenal capsule assay as a chemosensitivity test for primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The efficiency of the subrenal capsule assay (SRCA) was studied with fresh tissue of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The day-to-day changes in 10 carcinoma cases were evaluated for 9 days. The cancer cells continued to proliferate from the 3rd to the 7th day after the implantation and then decreased. The host reaction was recognized histologically from the 3rd or 4th day to the 9th day. However, the immune reaction did not significantly influence the evaluation of SRCA until the 7th day. The immunohistochemical staining with anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody revealed the existence of cancer cells at the DNA synthesizing stage (S stage) in the graft until the 7th day. In chemosensitivity test by SRCA, 21 patients were studied, and all were evaluable. 5-FU administration produced a response in 8/21 cases (38.1%), VDS in 8/21 (38.1%), and CDDP in 3/21 (14.3%). Used in combination, CDDP + VDS was effective in 7/18 cases (38.9%) and CDDP + BLM in 6/18 cases (33.3%). 
4	Influence of low osmolality contrast media on electrophysiology and hemodynamics in coronary angiography: differences between an ionic (ioxaglate) and a nonionic (iohexol) agent. It has recently been suggested that the addition of sodium to low osmolality contrast media may reduce the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and conduction disturbances during coronary angiography. In a randomized, double blind study of 30 patients undergoing coronary angiography we therefore examined the electrophysiological and hemodynamic effects of the two low osmolality contrast media-ioxaglate (with sodium) and iohexol (without sodium). Standard ECG, aortic blood pressure, and His bundle electrocardiogram were recorded. The contrast media were well tolerated and no serious arrhythmias were observed. Both induced a transient decrement in systolic blood pressure and reduction in heart rate 10 s following contrast injection (all P less than 0.01). Ioxaglate prolonged the QT interval at 10 s (P less than 0.01) and also when analysed for the whole observation period (120 s) (P less than 0.05), whereas iohexol did not cause any significant changes in the QT-interval. The AH-interval was prolonged by ioxaglate at 10 s (P less than 0.01), but not altered by iohexol. Thus, other factors than osmolality and sodium content might contribute to QT prolongation, since only the contrast agents with sodium (ioxaglate) induced QT prolongation in this study. 
3	A prospective, double-blind study of metoclopramide hydrochloride for the control of migraine in the emergency department STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of IV metoclopramide as sole therapy for relieving the pain of acute migraine in the emergency department. DESIGN: Prospective study. Fifty patients were divided randomly into subjects and placebo controls with blinding of the treating physician and the patient. PARTICIPANTS: Patients presenting to the ED with migraine requiring parenteral treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received 10 mg IV metoclopramide and controls received IV normal saline; patient assessment of relief was followed by means of a numerical scale. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent of subjects compared with 19% of controls had effective pain relief within one hour (P less than .001). Subjects achieved mean relief scores of 2.46 compared with 1.69 for controls (P less than .02). No significant side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: IV metoclopramide as a single agent is effective and safe therapy for migraine in the ED. 
1	Comparative investigation of c-erbB2/neu expression in head and neck tumors and mammary cancer. Normal tissues, primary tumors, and metastases of mammary and salivary glands and oral/laryngeal mucosa have been analyzed with Northern-blots employing 32P-labeled RNA probes for the expression of the neu oncogene. Neu oncogene expression of a mRNA species of 4.6 kilobases was found in all normal salivary (five) and mammary glands (four) as well as in two normal or inflamed samples of tongue mucosa. This expression was regarded as baseline activity of the neu gene for the respective tissues and was used as standard for the evaluation of benign and malignant tumors. None of 14 squamous cell carcinomas of the oral and laryngeal mucosa showed enhanced neu transcription level. Five fibroadenomas, one benign variant of phylloid tumor, one carcinosarcoma, and one of two proliferative fibrocystic diseases of the breast showed lacking or normal baseline expression of the neu oncogene, as did one monomorphous cystadenolymphoma of the parotid gland. In contrast, four parotid pleomorphic adenomas and one salivary gland adenocarcinoma showed enhanced neu expression. For mammary adenocarcinomas, increased neu oncogene expression concerned ten of 34 cases--all being variants of ductal carcinomas--and all metastases analyzed (six) deriving from three primaries. One adenoid cystic carcinoma also showed enhanced neu expression. Neu overexpression may reflect accidents of genomic reconstitutional events occurring regularly within the differentiation pathway of epithelial/myoepithelial cells. This assumption was supported by further immunohistochemical analysis which showed stainings of myoepithelial and myoepithelia-like cell populations in tumors, especially pleomorphic adenomas and adjacent normal-looking tissues. 
5	Protein turnover in uraemia in the rat. 1. The effect of uraemia on the rates of protein synthesis and protein degradation in liver, heart and vastus lateralis muscle were examined in the rat. Uraemia was induced by a five-sixths nephrectomy and the rates of protein turnover were compared with pair-fed sham-operated littermate controls. 2. The procedure produced plasma concentrations (means +/- SEM) of urea of 7.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/l in control and 39 +/- 2 mmol/l in uraemic rats, and of creatinine of 41 +/- 1 mumol/l in control and 133 +/- 7 mumol/l in uraemic rats. 3. Uraemia reduced the rates of protein synthesis in liver, heart and muscle by 35 +/- 5, 4.0 +/- 1.2 and 4.0 +/- 0.6%/day, respectively, compared with control rats (P less than 0.01). Since the reductions in tissue growth rate were too small to be accounted for by the reduction seen in protein synthesis alone, this implied that protein degradation was also reduced. Uraemia also caused an 18% reduction in the rate of growth as measured by the increase in tail length (P less than 0.01). 4. Uraemia reduced both protein synthesis and protein degradation. Protein synthesis exceeded protein degradation in all tissues. This would cause a reduced rate of protein accumulation in the uraemic compared with the control rats, and hence a reduced rate of growth. 
3	Relationship between body and brain temperature in traumatically brain-injured rodents. Recent work has shown that mild to moderate levels of hypothermia may profoundly reduce the histological and biochemical sequelae of cerebral ischemic injury. In the present study, the authors examined the effect of fluid-percussion injury on brain temperature in anesthetized rats and the effect of anesthesia on brain temperature in uninjured rats. The relationship between the brain, rectal, and temporalis muscle temperatures during normothermia, hypothermia, and hyperthermia was studied following a moderate magnitude of fluid-percussion brain injury (2.10 to 2.25 atmospheres) in rats. The results showed that mean brain temperature in 10 anesthetized injured rats, in 21 anesthetized uninjured rats, and in 10 unanesthetized uninjured rats was a mean (+/- standard error of the mean) of 36.04 degrees +/- 0.20 degrees C, 36.30 degrees +/- 0.08 degrees C, and 37.95 degrees +/- 0.09 degrees C, respectively. There was no significant difference in temperature under general anesthesia between injured and uninjured rats (p greater than 0.05). In the absence of brain injury, mean brain temperature was significantly lower in anesthetized rats than in unanesthetized rats (p less than 0.001). In anesthetized brain-injured rats, temporalis muscle temperature correlated well with brain temperature over a 30 degrees to 40 degrees C range, even when brain temperature was rapidly changed during induction of hypothermia or hyperthermia (r = 0.9986, p less than 0.0001). In contrast, rectal temperature varied inconsistently from brain temperature. These observations indicated that: 1) brain injury itself does not influence brain temperature in this model; 2) anesthesia alone decreases brain temperature to levels producing cerebral protection in this model; and 3) external monitoring of temporalis muscle temperature can provide a reliable indirect measure of brain temperature in the course of experimental brain injury. The authors believe that it is essential to monitor or control brain temperature in studies of experimental brain injury. 
5	Peroxisomal disorders. Although peroxisomes were once considered a vestige, their importance in cellular metabolism is clearly established by the many inherited diseases that have been described in the past two decades. Unfortunately there is no definitive treatment for the various disorders, but based on the recognition of the biochemical abnormalities, prenatal testing and appropriate genetic counseling can be provided. It is essential for clinicians to be aware of this group of diseases, as diagnosis and further study of these patients are essential in understanding the basic etiologic mechanisms underlying these complex groups of disorders. Clearly, there is much to be learned about the relationship between biochemical abnormalities and the phenotypic variability of the peroxisomal disorders. 
3	Characterization of "peak E," a novel amino acid associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Epidemiologic studies strongly associate eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) with ingestion of tryptophan containing a contaminant ("peak E"). Prior reports have suggested that peak E is the di-tryptophan N alpha-animal of acetaldehyde. Spectral and chemical studies now demonstrate that peak E is 1,1'-ethylidenebis[tryptophan]. This novel amino acid may be the etiological agent responsible for EMS, or it may be a marker of a still unidentified causal agent. 
3	Analgesic use: a study of treatments used by patients for migraine prior to attending the City of London Migraine Clinic. Eighty-three unselected patients attending the City of London Migraine Clinic for the first time were asked about their drug intake and use of alternative treatment. Thirty-one of those questioned took regular daily doses of medication. Fifteen were taking a combination of drugs bought 'over the counter' (OTC) and drugs prescribed by their GP; eleven took OTC drugs only; and 5 took prescription drugs only. It was noticeable that those taking drugs prescribed both by the GP and obtainable over the counter were more likely than the other groups to be taking several drugs rather than a single type. Thirty five of the 83 (42.2%) had tried alternative treatments for their attacks. 
1	Testicular calcifications and neoplasia in patient treated for subfertility. A subfertile male with a history of left cryptorchism underwent scrotal ultrasound that revealed stippled calcifications, without associated mass, in the right testicle. Six months later, while on a regimen of clomiphene citrate, a testicular tumor became palpable. This was sonographically confirmed to be surrounding the calcifications. Testicular calcifications are most commonly associated with benign conditions. We review the literature regarding their relationship to neoplasms and the significance of the ultrasonic findings. Furthermore, this is the sixth reported case of testicular tumor developing during hormonal treatment for oligospermia. Although these cases may be circumstantial, closer surveillance and screening ultrasound may be indicated for subfertile males taking clomiphene citrate. 
5	Role of histamine in natural killer cell-mediated resistance against tumor cells. The formation of lung metastases by i.v.-injected B16 melanoma (F1 and F10 strain) cells in Swiss albino, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice was reduced by a single dose of histamine given 24 h before tumor cell inoculation. The antimetastatic effect of histamine was specifically mediated by histamine H2-receptors (H2R): it was blocked by the H2R antagonist ranitidine and mimicked by dimaprit, a specific H2R agonist but not by an H2R-inactive structural analog of this compound, nor-dimaprit, or the H1R agonist 2-thiazolyl-ethylamide. A single dose of any of the H2R antagonists ranitidine, tiotidine, famotidine, or cimetidine drastically augmented metastasis. Effects of H2R-interactive compounds on B16 metastasis required intact NK cells, as judged by the inability of histamine or ranitidine to affect B16 metastasis after NK cell depletion in vivo using antibodies to asialo-GM1. NK-cell-mediated lysis of YAC-1 lymphoma cells in vivo was enhanced by histamine and reduced by ranitidine within 4 h after inoculation of tumor cells. The antimetastatic effect of IL-2 was potentiated by histamine; in some experiments, combined treatment with a low dose of IL-2 (6000 U/kg) and histamine completely eliminated metastasis, whereas concomitant treatment with ranitidine abrogated antimetastatic effects of IL-2; animals treated with ranitidine and IL-2 displayed the same level of enhanced metastasis as those treated with ranitidine alone. The presented data are suggestive of an earlier unrecognized role for histamine in NK cell-mediated resistance against metastatic tumor cells. 
5	Learning disabilities in epilepsy: neurophysiological aspects. Subclinical generalized spike-wave discharges are often accompanied by transitory cognitive impairment, demonstrable by psychological testing during EEG recording. Transitory cognitive impairment is demonstrated most readily by difficult tasks and during generalized regular spike-wave bursts lasting for more than 3 s, but can also be found during briefer and even focal discharges. That this is not simply a consequence of global inattention is shown by the fact that focal discharges exhibit some specificity: left-sided focal spiking is more likely to produce errors on verbal tasks, for instance, whereas right-sided discharges are more often accompanied by impairment in handling nonverbal material. Both learning difficulties in general and specific abnormal patterns of cognitive functioning are well documented in children with epilepsy and are most pronounced in those with frequent interictal discharges. However, there is now evidence that intermittent cognitive impairment due to the discharges themselves contributes significantly to such neurophysiological abnormalities. The significance of transitory cognitive impairment accompanying subclinical EEG discharges for everyday functioning is uncertain, but there is experimental evidence that subclinical discharges may be accompanied by disruption of educational skills in children or by impairment of driving performance in motorists. In some individuals, suppression of discharges by antiepileptic drugs has demonstrably improved psychological function, but further work is required to determine the indications for such treatment. 
3	Reconstruction of the chronically insufficient anterior cruciate ligament with the central third of the patellar ligament. The results of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with the central third of the patellar ligament as a free, autogenous, non-vascularized graft were retrospectively reviewed at our institution. Eighty reconstructions in seventy-nine patients were evaluated after a minimum of two years. In forty-eight (60 per cent) of the knees, the reconstruction was augmented with an extra-articular lateral sling of iliotibial band. The patients were evaluated with a physical examination, a KT-1000 arthrometer, radiographs, a subjective questionnaire, and a revision of the scale of The Hospital for Special Surgery for rating ligaments. Postoperatively, seventy-six (95 per cent) of the eighty knees no longer gave way, and the pivot-shift test was negative in sixty-seven (84 per cent) of the knees. The average score on the ligament-rating scale was 93 points. All of the patients who had clinical instability at the time of the most recent follow-up had associated ligamentous instability that had not been appreciated or addressed at the time of reconstruction. Arthrometric evaluation revealed that the laxity differed by three millimeters or less from that of the untreated knee in sixty (76 per cent) of the treated knees. In the patient who had bilateral reconstruction, the laxity was the same in both knees. Seventeen patients, who had more than three millimeters of translation, also had additional related ligamentous instability, most commonly posterolateral instability and insufficiency of the medial collateral ligament. We think that major associated ligamentous instability predisposes the reconstruction to failure and should be corrected in conjunction with the reconstruction. 
1	99mTc-anti-CEA radioimmunoscintigraphy of lung adenocarcinoma. Anti-carcinoembryonic antigen radioimmunoscintigraphy (anti-CEA RIS) in colorectal adenocarcinoma has been reported to allow a better estimation of the local tumor extension than other radiologic methods. This study evaluated the clinical feasibility of a 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (BW 431/26, Behring Institute, FRG) in 11 patients for staging of primary adenocarcinoma of the lung. The primary tumor size ranged from 3 to 8 cm with a mean of 4 cm. Mediastinal and hilar nodes were present in four patients, intrapulmonary metastases were present in two patients, and pleural and liver metastases were present in one patient each. The CEA levels were in the range of 2 to 265 ng/ml and elevated (greater than 5 ng/ml) in six patients. Planar scintigraphy was performed at 6 h and 24 h post injection (pi). Analog and digitized images were interpreted by two observers. One patient was imaged twice and experienced serum sickness due to human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) after the second study, which showed marked unspecific tracer uptake in liver, spleen, and bone marrow, but no specific uptake by the tumor and was excluded from further analysis. Visual interpretation identified the primary tumor clearly in seven patients. No tumor imaging was observed in two patients. Two patients were classified as having questionable imaging due to a poor separation of tumor uptake from mediastinal blood pool. The primary tumor could be clearly delineated in both patients after comparison with the chest radiograph. Thus, the overall sensitivity for imaging of the primary tumor was 82 percent. The average target/background ratio was 1.31 +/- 0.17:1 at 6 h pi, and 1.30 +/- 0.16:1 at 24 h pi. Hilar and mediastinal nodes were correctly suspected in three patients, but the cardiac blood pool hampered a clear interpretation. Intrapulmonary and pleural metastases were diagnosed in all cases. The single liver metastasis was missed because of the high unspecific tracer uptake. Planar anti-CEA RIS with 99mTc BW 431/26 was superior to computed tomography (CT) in one case with subtotal tumor resection. We summarize that at present, planar anti-CEA RIS with 99mTc BW 431/26 cannot be advised as a routine staging procedure in adenocarcinoma of the lung, but it may be helpful in the detection of residual or recurrent tumor tissue. 
2	Peritoneal blastomycosis. Blastomycosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis. Involvement of the peritoneum is unusual, with only two previously reported cases that occurred in association with disseminated disease. A single case of histopathologically proven blastomycosis involving the peritoneum is presented, as well as a short overview of previously published cases on gastrointestinal and peritoneal blastomycosis. The case is unique in that chronic peritonitis was the only manifestation of disease. The diagnosis was made by laparoscopy. 
5	Changes in plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol and phospholipid in acute viral hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice. Forty-four male and female subjects aged 22-57 years were studied. Thirteen patients had acute viral hepatitis, and eleven patients had cholestatic jaundice due to carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Twenty healthy volunteers who served as controls were also included. In hepatitis patients, the mean plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-phospholipid/phospholipid (HDLPL/PL) ratio were reduced, and HDL-cholesterol (HDLC), HDL-phospholipid (HDLPL) and the phospholipid/total cholesterol (PL/TC) ratio were normal, while total phospholipid (PL) levels and the HDLC/TC ratio were significantly increased compared to the control values. In patients with cholestatic jaundice the mean plasma total cholesterol, phospholipid and HDLC levels were elevated, and HDLPL/PL, HDLPL, HDLC/TC and PL/TC remained normal compared to the control values. A comparison within the patient groups showed that plasma TC, PL and HDLC levels were significantly increased in cholestatic jaundice when compared with the corresponding levels in hepatitis patients. The mean plasma levels of HDLPL, HDLC/TC and PL/TC did not show any significant variation within the patient groups. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) correlated positively with TC, and total protein correlated negatively with TC and HDLPL, while albumin correlated negatively with TC, HDLC and HDLPL in cholestatic jaundice. Alanine amino-transferase (ALAT) also correlated positively with PL in cholestatic jaundice, while albumin correlated positively with TC in hepatitis. The results suggest that lipoproteins might be metabolized differently in these two forms of cholestasis. 
3	Temporal arteritis with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rates presenting as occipital neuralgia. A retrospective review of 46 patients with biopsy-proven giant cell (temporal) arteritis revealed 8 (17%) whose initial presentation was occipital pain. The most likely etiology of occipital pain in these patients was occipital artery inflammation. A Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate less than 40 mm/hour was noted at presentation in 6 of these 8 patients. Giant cell arteritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of elderly patients who present with occipital pain and demonstrate a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate. 
4	Life events and difficulties preceding stroke. Life events and difficulties were recorded for the year before stroke, using a standardised semi-structured interview, in 113 surviving patients seen after their first ever in a lifetime stroke. An age and sex-matched control group (n = 109) was also interviewed about the preceding year. The stroke patients reported fewer non-threatening events and events with only a short-term threat, while difficulties were reported with equal frequency by the two groups. However, events which were severely threatening in the long-term were significantly more common in the stroke patients (in the 52 weeks before stroke 26% versus 13%, odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.9). The increased rate was apparent throughout the year and not just in the weeks immediately before stroke onset. The number of stroke patients experiencing severe events in the follow up year fell to the level found in the control group. Recognised risk factors for stroke were found equally in those patients with and without severe events before onset, except that hypertension was rather less common in the patients who had experienced a severe event. It therefore appears that severe life events may be one of the determinants of stroke onset. 
1	Morphine-induced transactivation of HIV-1 LTR in human neuroblastoma cells. Infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is followed in many cases by a clinically quiescent or latent phase that appears to continue as long as host antiviral defense is intact. This has raised the possibility that certain host susceptibility factors (i.e., environmental cofactors) might influence the progression of the disease. In this study we demonstrate that morphine can function to activate HIV/LTR-CAT fusion gene (HIV-long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) when transfected into undifferentiated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The stimulatory effect of morphine is amplified in SH-SY5Y cells that have been induced to differentiate first with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and is much less in cells differentiated with retinoic acid (RA). Morphine does not appreciably activate HIV/LTR-CAT expression in human MOLT-3 and other T cells. Morphine activation of HIV/LTR-CAT in the SH-SY5Y cells is not reversible by naltrexone and appears to involve a Fos/Jun signaling system. Our results suggest that narcotics such as morphine may lead to activation of latent HIV infection. This may be particularly important in tissues, such as brain, which can host latent HIV infection and which is uniquely damaged in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as evidenced by neuronal degeneration and dementia. We also predict that these findings may have important implications for the pathogenesis of AIDS, particularly in opiate drug abusers. 
3	Intraputaminal infusion of nerve growth factor to support adrenal medullary autografts in Parkinson's disease. One-year follow-up of first clinical trial. Experimental studies in rodents show that beta-nerve growth factor can increase the survival, neurite outgrowth, and functional effect of grafts of adrenal chromaffin cells to the basal ganglia. We, therefore, have begun to investigate whether treatment with nerve growth factor might also increase the functional effect of autografts of adrenal medullary tissue in patients with Parkinson's disease. Previous studies have shown that stereotactic implantation of adrenal tissue pieces produces a transient functional improvement that lasts for a few months. This report describes a trial of grafting of adrenal chromaffin tissue into the putamen, supported by infusion of nerve growth factor. The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a 19-year history of Parkinson's disease, now complicated by on-off phenomena and drug-induced hyperkinesia, despite optimized medical management. The left adrenal gland was removed, and the medulla was dissected into 1- to 2-mm3 pieces in a solution containing nerve growth factor purified from mouse submandibular gland. Pieces were implanted in six tracts 3 to 4 mm from a previously placed cannula in the left putamen. Through the cannula, nerve growth factor was infused for 23 days for a total dose of 3.3 mg. Clinical assessment consisted of global ratings for rigidity and/or hypokinesia and for drug-induced hyperkinesia. Measures of gait and fine-motor control were also made. The motor readiness potential and auditory evoked potentials were recorded. 
5	Flexion osteotomy of the femur for genu recurvatum after poliomyelitis. We report the results of 21 femoral osteotomies performed in 18 patients for genu recurvatum and flattening of the femoral condyles after poliomyelitis. Before operation the average angle of recurvatum was 31 degrees and all the limbs required bracing. After a mean follow-up of four years there has been partial recurrence in only one case. Nine patients (10 limbs) needed no orthosis and the others had less discomfort and an improved gait. Complete remodelling of the femoral and tibial epiphyses was noted in two of the younger patients. 
2	Adult immunization in a network of family practice residency programs. A substantial proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with vaccine-preventable diseases occurs among adults. Teaching residents about disease prevention is mandated in the curriculum guidelines for family practice programs. A cooperative study among the Kansas City family practice residency programs was begun to look at immunization behaviors in these teaching programs. A retrospective audit of medical records and a prospective survey of residents and faculty were performed. From the medical records of 400 patients seen for health maintenance examinations, the frequency of tetanus-diphtheria immunizations recorded was 4.75%. The pooled immunization rate recorded for pneumococcal vaccine was 25%, and for influenza vaccine, 24%. Although 93% of respondents knew patients need tetanus-diphtheria immunization every 10 years, on a written questionnaire giving clinical examples, they were less likely to elect to immunize older patients eligible for tetanus-diphtheria vaccine. The following immunization criteria were listed by respondents: for pneumococcal vaccine, age over 65 years (86%); for influenza vaccine, age over 65 years (85%), chronic diseases (69%), residence in a chronic care facility (7%), and being a health care worker (28%). Educational interventions stressing the appropriate criteria and involvement of the patient are planned at the separate programs. 
4	Management of aortic insufficiency in chronic aortic dissection. From January 1980 to December 1988, 44 patients with chronic aortic dissection and aortic insufficiency underwent operation. This group of patients was analyzed to evaluate the outcome of those in whom the aortic valve was preserved compared with those having valve replacement. The overall preoperative characteristics of the two groups were similar except for the incidence of Marfan's syndrome. Valve replacement was the elected procedure in patients with valve degeneration or annuloaortic ectasia. In patients with leaflet prolapse with or without an enlarged annulus, a plastic procedure was used. In 48% of the patients, it was possible to preserve the valve. There were five hospital deaths (11%): three were due to low-output syndrome, one was due to bleeding, and one was due to neurological complications. There were two late deaths (5%). Follow-up of the 37 surviving patients ranged from 2 to 108 months (mean follow-up, 18 months). Seventy-eight percent of the survivors were in functional class I and the others were in class II. Two patients in whom the aortic valve was preserved had mild aortic insufficiency. Three patients with bioprostheses underwent reoperation because of prosthetic valve dysfunction. One patient who had aortoplasty and an aortic valve plastic procedure was seen with redissection and aortic insufficiency after 60 months and was reoperated on using the Bentall technique. The actuarial survival curves showed that patients who underwent valvoplasty had higher, but not significantly higher, survival rates than the valve replacement patients. 
4	A perspective on reducing salt intake. Epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidence links excessive salt consumption to hypertension; there appears to be no evidence that it is beneficial. I conclude that it should be public policy to advise and help Americans to reduce their salt intake. Because even mild hypertension increases risk, the overall problem does not appear to be amenable to treatment, although treatment for those with clinical hypertension will always be needed. There appears to be little likelihood that identification of those "at risk" will be successful, nor does it appear that we have the capacity at this time to conduct successful preventive field trials. It is difficult for the individual to modify his diet alone. The successful strategy is to modify the food supply by changing public demand. The public responds to dietary advice if acceptable and identifiable products are available. Because most of the salt is in commercially prepared foods and because their consumption will increase in the future, the major responsibility for lowering salt consumption will fall on the food manufacturers. They are beginning to respond, and there appears to be ample opportunity for them to reduce the salt content of foods markedly. Our temporary objectives, however, should be modest, because unrealistic objectives only discourage those who attempt to follow them. 
4	Immediate preoperative phlebotomy with autologous blood donation for aortic replacement. The preferential use of autologous blood provided by phlebotomy can reduce the need for homologous blood transfusion in patients undergoing extensive elective operations. This blood is usually provided either by intraoperative isovolemic hemodilution or phlebotomy one to two weeks preoperatively. To minimize the intraoperative time delay or preoperative period between phlebotomy and operation required in these patients, we performed preoperative isovolemic hemodilution in 69 patients one to two days prior to elective aortic replacement for infrarenal aneurysmal disease. Patients underwent phlebotomy a mean of 0.57 +/- 0.01 liter of whole blood; volume was replaced with lactated Ringer's solution. Hematocrit levels decreased from a mean value of 42.9 +/- 0.4 per cent to 33.7 +/- 0.3 per cent. Mean intraoperative blood loss was 1.2 +/- 0.05 liters. Hemodynamic parameters (blood pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, oxygen delivery and systemic vascular resistance) remained stable throughout the perioperative and intraoperative time periods. In addition, we evaluated the technical modification of exclusion aneurysmorrhaphy (n = 50) versus open aneurysmorraphy (n = 19) on reduction of intraoperative homologous blood transfusion in these patients. Seventy-two per cent (36 of 50) of patients whose aneurysms were excluded received no homologous blood intraoperatively. Blood loss was decreased in the excluded versus open aneurysmorraphy group, 920 +/- 90 milliliters versus 2,030 +/- 250 milliliters, as were homologous blood transfusion requirements, 175 +/- 35 milliliters versus 570 +/- 119 milliliters. Two patients died (2.9 per cent mortality rate), and there was no increase in morbidity. Surgical treatment of large aortic aneurysms is frequently performed on an urgent basis; thus, provision of autologous blood for this operation in a short period of time may be beneficial. Isovolemic hemodilution performed during the immediate preoperative period can reduce homologous blood requirements and be safely performed without adverse effects on mortality, morbidity and myocardial performance. Exclusion aneurysmorrhaphy may further reduce dependence on homologous blood. 
4	Direct measurement of skeletal muscle fatigue in patients with chronic heart failure. Skeletal muscle function was measured as force production and fatigue in both the quadriceps (a large locomotive muscle) and adductor pollicis (a small intrinsic hand muscle) in five healthy volunteers, five patients with mild chronic heart failure, and five patients with severe chronic heart failure. The quadriceps of patients with chronic heart failure had a reduced muscle cross sectional area, a reduced maximum isometric force production, and an increased tendency to fatigue. Isometric force production and fatigue of the adductor pollicis, however, were not significantly different between the three groups under control conditions. But during circulatory occlusion fatigue in the adductor pollicis increased more in the patients with severe chronic heart failure. These differing findings in quadriceps and adductor pollicis suggest that skeletal muscle atrophy and reduced isometric force production are not a necessary consequence of chronic heart failure per se, because they were only present in the large locomotive muscle. The normal values for muscle fatigue observed in adductor pollicis in patients with chronic heart failure imply that skeletal muscle blood flow must increase normally during muscle activation when only a small muscle mass is used. These results are not compatible with the concept of a generalised impairment of normal vasodilatation within active skeletal muscle. In contrast, activation of a large muscle, such as quadriceps, results in the rapid onset of fatigue in patients with severe chronic heart failure. This fatigue may be related to the inability of the cardiovascular system to provide the required blood flow for the activation of a large muscle mass. 
4	HIV-associated myocarditis. Pathology and immunopathology. Autopsy studies of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) patients showed a high incidence of myocarditis. To attain a better understanding of the pathogenesis, the pathology and immunopathology of nine endomyocardial biopsies with active myocarditis from 18 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients were systematically characterized. These were compared with 17 biopsies with active myocarditis from patients without AIDS risk factors. In both groups, the myocarditis consisted of either multifocal or interstitial infiltrates of small lymphocytes and isolated myocyte necrosis. The lymphocytes consisted of T cells (CD2+, CD3+) and cells not identified by the usual markers. B cells, monocytes, CD4+ cells, and natural killer (NK) cells were only rarely observed. All of the HIV-positive patients but only 7 of 17 non-HIV patients had CD8+ lymphocytes in the infiltrates (P less than 0.01). The arteriolar endothelium demonstrated induced class I (HLA-A, B, C) and II (HLA-DR) antigens in both groups. In situ hybridization for HIV-1 failed to identify the virus in the specimens. The immunopathology is consistent with a cell-mediated injury to the myocytes in HIV-positive patients and is similar to a subgroup of myocarditis in the non-HIV group. 
5	Late relapse with nodular lymphoma after treatment for diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Histologic conversion from a low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) into a more aggressive histologic pattern is a common, well-documented event in NHL. The converse phenomenon, appearance of a low-grade, follicular NHL after treatment for diffuse, intermediate, or high-grade NHL, has only recently been recognized. The clinical, morphologic, and immunologic features of a patient in whom relapse with an indolent nodular lymphoma was noticed after combination chemotherapy for diffuse lymphoma are presented. Immunologic markers at presentation and relapse were similar. Other previously reported cases are reviewed. Implications for diagnosis and therapy as well as the pathogenesis of this unique form of conversion are discussed. 
5	Sudden infant death syndrome in infants of substance-abusing mothers. A population-based study was performed to determine whether substance abuse during the perinatal period may be a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The incidence of SIDS was studied in 2143 infants of substance-abusing mothers (ISAM) born in Los Angeles County during 1986 and 1987 who were reported to the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services because of a history of drug exposure or positive urine test results in the mother, infant, or both. By comparing the ISAM birth reports with records of autopsy-proven SIDS in Los Angeles County, we found 19 SIDS cases in the population of 2143 ISAM, a SIDS rate of 8.87 cases per 1000 ISAM (95% confidence interval 5.3 to 13.8). This was significantly higher than the SIDS rate for the non-ISAM general population: 396 SIDS deaths among 325,372 live births, an incidence rate of 1.22 cases per 1000 births, p less than 0.00001. The age of ISAM at death was 99 +/- 63 (mean +/- SD) days compared with 91 +/- 52 days for the non-ISAM population (not significant). The incidence of SIDS was significantly greater in male infants, during the winter months, in black infants, and in non-Hispanic white infants in the non-ISAM population. Such differences were not observed in the ISAM group. A greater incidence of symptomatic apnea was reported before SIDS for the ISAM than for the non-ISAM population (22% vs 5.4%, p = 0.022). We conclude that ISAM have a higher incidence of SIDS than the non-ISAM general population. However, it was not possible to separate maternal substance abuse from other confounding variables that may also have had an impact on SIDS risk in the ISAM group. 
2	Risk of gastric cancer after gastric surgery for benign disorders. The objective of this review was to evaluate published evidence for the association between gastric resection for benign disorders and subsequent cancer of the gastric remnant. We searched the literature through Medline (1970 to 1988) and through the references of relevant articles. Fifty-eight studies consisting of case series, uncontrolled surveys, and case control or cohort analyses were identified and critically assessed using defined methodological criteria. There were no consistent differences between the expected and observed number of cancers occurring within 15 years after gastric resection. However, all case control studies and seven of the eight cohort analyses, in which the prevalence of cancer was stratified by time since gastric resection, indicated a twofold to fourfold increase in the risk of gastric cancer in patients who survived 15 or more years after gastric surgery. We conclude that most studies of the association of gastric surgery with subsequent gastric cancer have relatively weak designs. Still, the repetitive demonstration of this association by different investigators using different research designs supports the hypothesis that gastric resection increases the risk of cancer in the gastric remnant. 
4	Aspirin reduces the growth of medial and neointimal thickenings in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. We analyzed the effect of Aspirin on the growth of experimentally induced vascular thickenings in rat carotid arteries. Vascular thickenings were induced by denudation of the endothelium in the left carotid artery with a balloon catheter. Administration of Aspirin-rich food (17.4 g/kg body wt/day) was started 1 week before and continued 2 weeks after injury. Nine rats were used. A control group of equal size received normal food. Sizes of the tunica media, the neointima, and the open vessel lumen were measured on cross sections of carotid segments with the aid of a videomorphometry system. The results show that in the Aspirin group, neointimal lesions are significantly smaller than in the control group (0.14 mm2 versus 0.23 mm2; p less than 0.5). Thickenings of the tunica media are also reduced (0.11 mm2 versus 0.12 mm2; p less than 0.5). It is suggested that Aspirin reduces both medial hypertrophy and neointimal outgrowth in injury-induced atherosclerosis. 
4	Buerger's colour. Cyanosis of the hands and feet in Buerger's disease is known as 'Buerger's colour'. This characteristic skin colour is produced by the subpapillary venous plexus. The reactions of the subpapillary venous plexus in patients with Buerger's disease were observed by analysing the fractional blood volume of tissue using a visible light reflective spectrophotometer. Capillary morphology was investigated using an intravital video-microscopic system. Twenty-seven subjects, comprising 13 normals and 14 patients with Buerger's disease, were studied. In the nailbeds of patients with Buerger's disease, an increase in the number of loops, cyanotic colour change and dilatation were observed. In this condition there was incompetence of venular tonus and regurgitation at venular valves. Buerger's colour is probably due to excessive congestion of venous blood in the subpapillary venous plexus which is produced by these mechanisms. 
5	Hypercapnic respiratory failure due to L-tryptophan-induced eosinophilic polymyositis. A 24-year-old man presenting with fever, rash, and myalgias subsequently developed hypercapnic respiratory failure and severe limb muscle weakness. Muscle biopsy revealed eosinophilic myositis, due to the ingestion of large quantities of L-tryptophan as a dietary supplement. Complete recovery occurred with corticosteroid administration. Significant involvement of the respiratory muscles can be a predominant feature of this newly described disease entity. 
1	Vastus lateralis myocutaneous flap for reconstruction of defects around the groin and pelvis. We present our experience using the vastus lateralis myocutaneous flap for the repair of defects around the groin and pelvis. It is a relatively new technique, with many advantages over other flaps used in this area, though it has limitations. The history, anatomy and surgical technique of raising the flap are described and clinical cases are discussed. The importance of patient selection is highlighted. 
2	Clostridium difficile--a common and costly colitis. Clostridium difficile infection manifests as a self-limiting diarrhea, protracted colitis, or toxic pseudomembranous colitis. The incidence of C. difficile in a 514-bed community hospital was studied retrospectively; 155 patients of a total 18,262 admitted during 1988 were identified with C. difficile as an admitting or subsequent diagnosis. The method of diagnosis, mode of therapy, and related costs were analyzed. We have determined that education, with an emphasis on pathogenesis and prevention, is necessary to reduce the incidence in the hospital and the cost to the patient. 
5	Infective dermatitis of Jamaican children: a marker for HTLV-I infection In Jamaican children infective dermatitis is a chronic eczema associated with refractory nonvirulent Staphylococcus aureus or beta-haemolytic streptococcus infection of the skin and nasal vestibule. 14 children between the ages of 2 and 17 years with typical infective dermatitis, attending the dermatology clinic at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Jamaica, were tested for antibody to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). All were seropositive, whereas 11 children of similar age with atopic eczema were all negative. In 2 of 2 cases of infective dermatitis, the biological mother was HTLV-1 seropositive. None of the 14 patients showed signs of adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma, though experience with previous cases of infective dermatitis indicates the possibility of such progression. 
4	Thromboxane A2 and development of genetic hypertension in the Lyon rat strain. To determine whether the increased renal biosynthesis of thromboxane A2 observed in young genetically hypertensive rats of the Lyon strain could be involved in the development of their hypertension, Lyon hypertensive female rats received either thromboxane synthetase inhibitors (Dazmegrel or OKY 046) or a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist (AH 23848) during their prehypertensive stage. Treatment from 5 to 9 weeks of age with Dazmegrel failed to reduce systolic blood pressure. When given from 3 to 9 weeks of age, Dazmegrel and OKY 046 induced a similar progressive and specific reduction (60%) in the urinary excretion of thromboxane B2 that was associated with a transient decrease in blood pressure level with Dazmegrel and a longer lasting blood pressure-lowering effect with OKY 046. AH 23848, given according to the same schedule, normalized the blood pressure level. This effect persisted 1 week after the cessation of the treatment. Interestingly, active doses of thromboxane synthetase inhibitors or of thromboxane A2 receptor blocker required a 3-week delay to exhibit their antihypertensive properties. It is concluded that 1) the elevated production of thromboxane A2 observed in young Lyon hypertensive rats is likely to participate actively in their blood pressure regulation and 2) this effect may be independent of its direct vasoconstrictor properties. 
5	Serum and tissue magnesium concentrations in patients with heart failure and serious ventricular arrhythmias. OBJECTIVE: To compare magnesium concentrations in serum and tissue from patients with heart failure. Two groups of patients were compared, those with or without serious ventricular arrhythmias. DESIGN: Consecutive enrollment. Blinded laboratory analyses. SETTING: Referral inpatient service of the cardiology division of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and mild to moderately severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV) were divided into two groups: 9 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardias and 14 patients without serious ventricular arrhythmias (control). INTERVENTIONS: Medications for heart failure were withdrawn 12 hours or more before study. Antiarrhythmic therapy was continued throughout the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients had skeletal muscle biopsies, myocardial biopsies, and blood sampling for the analysis of magnesium concentrations. No statistically significant differences in the mean magnesium concentrations in serum, circulating mononuclear cells, skeletal muscle, and myocardium were found when the 9 patients with ventricular arrhythmias were compared with the 14 control patients without serious ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: In a general, ambulatory sample of patients with heart failure, magnesium depletion in serum and tissue does not appear to occur more commonly in patients with serious ventricular arrhythmias than in patients without serious ventricular arrhythmias. 
2	Changes in anal canal sensation after childbirth. Obstetic trauma predisposes to faecal incontinence. Anal canal sensation is impaired in incontinent patients. To assess the effect of childbirth on anal canal sensation anal mucosal electrosensitivity was measured in 122 primiparous patients in the immediate postnatal period and in 74 at 6 months postpartum. There were 35 normal vaginal deliveries, 36 forceps deliveries, 20 ventouse extractions, ten vaginal breech deliveries and 21 caesarean sections. Sensation was impaired in the lower, mid and upper anal canal immediately after delivery in those patients who had a normal vaginal delivery or a forceps delivery when compared with controls or with those delivered by caesarean section. Women who had ventouse deliveries had impaired sensation immediately after delivery in the mid anal canal compared with controls and those undergoing caesarean section. By 6 months there were no differences between any group. Patients who sustained a division of the external anal sphincter at delivery had impaired sensation which persisted in the upper anal canal at 6 months. 
5	Long-term postthoracotomy pain. We used a pain questionnaire to evaluate the prevalence and functional significance of long-term postthoracotomy pain. Data on 56 patients who were at least 2 months postsurgery were analyzed. Thirty patients (54 percent) with a median follow-up of 19.5 months had persistent pain; 26 others were pain free at a median of 30.5 months postthoracotomy. Pain was reported in 24 of 44 patients (55 percent) who were more than one year after surgery, 13 of 29 patients (45 percent) more than two years, six of 16 (38 percent) more than three years, and three of ten patients (30 percent) greater than four years postthoracotomy. Pain intensity was low, but 13 patients stated that pain "slightly" or "moderately" interfered with their lives. Five of 56 patients had sufficiently severe chronic pain to require either daily analgesic use, nerve blocks, relaxation therapy, acupuncture, or referral to a pain clinic. We conclude that long-term chest wall pain is common postthoracotomy. It is generally not severe, but a small proportion of patients may experience persistent, moderately disabling pain. 
5	Ileocolic nipple valve anastomosis for preventing recurrence of surgically treated Crohn's disease. Long-term follow-up of six patients. To prevent coloileal reflux after ileocecal resection, an ileocolic nipple valve anastomosis was constructed in six patients with Crohn's disease. The patients were observed for more than 7 years and were compared with 21 Crohn patients in whom conventional end-to-end ileocolic anastomosis was performed during the same period. The outcome was more favorable in the group with nipple valve anastomosis, i.e., longer interval between surgery and symptomatic relapse, and tendency to less frequent recurrence and re-resection. An association was found between radiologically preserved nipple valve and remission, and two patients with intact valve at long-term follow-up remained symptom-free. The observations implied that protection of the terminal ileum from coloileal reflux after ileocecal resection for Crohn's disease may favorably influence the prognosis. 
5	Diagnoses of acute lower respiratory tract infections in children in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan. A hospital-based inpatient and outpatient study of 1,492 cases of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) was conducted from November 1986 to March 1988 in two hospitals in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan. Specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were processed for viral studies in all cases; blood cultures were performed in 1,331 cases; and urine was obtained for detection of bacterial antigen in 378 cases, but 227 of these samples had bacterial contamination and were discarded. Respiratory syncytial virus was identified in 33% of cases, and Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were identified in 9.6% and 9.9% of cases, respectively. Nonencapsulated H. influenzae accounted for 32% of the Haemophilus isolates, and type b was the only encapsulated H. influenzae strain identified. Of the S. pneumoniae serotypes isolated, 31% are not included in the currently available polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. No clinical characteristic was demonstrated to be a reliable indicator for bacterial ALRI. 
5	Acquired benign esophagorespiratory fistula: report of 16 consecutive cases. Sixteen cases of acquired benign esophagorespiratory fistula were treated in a 20-year period. A delay in diagnosis was usual, and most patients were first seen with a pulmonary infection already developed. Contrast esophageal x-ray studies established the diagnosis in all patients. There were seven esophagotracheal and nine esophagobronchial fistulas. A fistula between the esophageal diverticulum and a bronchus considered to be of inflammatory origin developed in 7 patients. A fistula as the consequence of trauma developed in 9 patients, and these fistulas were situated at a higher level of the respiratory tree. All patients underwent surgical treatment; in 12 it was definitive, and in 4 temporary gastrostomy was performed to improve nutrition before definite repair. The definitive repair consisted of eventual diverticulectomy, division of the fistula, and suture of both esophageal and respiratory defects. Two patients required esophageal resection and later reconstruction with colon interposition. One patient died, creating an operative mortality of 8.3% in the definitive-repair group. The remaining 11 patients had a gratifying long-term result. There were two deaths in the gastrostomy group due to an extremely poor condition of patients and debilitating pulmonary infection. Early diagnosis of this rare condition is necessary if severe pulmonary complications are to be avoided. Early direct repair gives excellent results. 
1	Cecal diverticulitis presented as a cecal tumor. Seven patients diagnosed as having acute appendicitis were operated on and a cecal wall mass due to cecal diverticulitis was found. In two patients the mass could not be separated from the cecal wall and right colectomy was performed. In five patients, in whom the mass could be separated from the cecum, conservative operations (three diverticulectomies and two wedge resections) were performed, thus avoiding needless, more extensive surgery. 
5	Digoxin for atrial fibrillation: a drug whose time has gone? For over 200 years digitalis compounds have been used to treat atrial fibrillation. The rapid ventricular response to atrial fibrillation is frequently treated with digoxin to produce a controlled heart rate. Digoxin has also been proposed as a treatment for terminating recent-onset atrial fibrillation, for maintaining sinus rhythm after an episode of atrial fibrillation, and as prophylactic therapy in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to prevent excessive tachycardia during a paroxysm. Perhaps because it has been used for so long, few of these indications have been studied scientifically until recently. Studies now suggest that in patients with atrial fibrillation, digoxin is a poor drug for controlling heart rate during exertion, has little or no effect in terminating the arrhythmia, and may occasionally aggravate paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Despite adequate digitalization, the heart rate at the onset of a paroxysm of fibrillation in patients receiving the drug does not differ from the heart rate in patients not receiving it. This article discusses the current role of digoxin in the management of patients with chronic, recent-onset, or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 
3	Treatment of status migrainosus: the American experience. Dependence upon a variety of drugs--ergotamine, analgesics, benzodiazepines, corticosteroids--is a major reason for patients to enter an intractable phase of their migrainous disorders. Repeated dosing of dihydroergotamine has proven to be remarkably effective in stabilizing the mechanism of migraine, allowing these patients to make the transition to a more reasonable as well as more specific form of therapy. 
3	Comparison of vastus medialis obliquus: vastus lateralis muscle integrated electromyographic ratios between healthy subjects and patients with patellofemoral pain. The purpose of this study was to compare vastus medialis obliquus:vastus lateralis muscle (VMO:VL) integrated electromyographic (IEMG) ratios of healthy subjects and patients with unilateral patellofemoral pain (PFP) under isotonic and isometric quadriceps femoris muscle contraction conditions. Subjects ranging in age from 18 to 35 years (mean = 28.06, SD = 5.97) were assigned to one of three groups on the basis of type of knee condition. In group 1, which consisted of seven healthy control subjects with no history of knee pathology, both knees were tested. In group 2, which consisted of nine patients with unilateral PFP, only the painful knee was tested. In group 3, which consisted of the same nine patients who comprised group 2, only the nonpainful knee was tested. Nonnormalized and normalized VMO:VL IEMG ratios were computed for ascending stairs, descending stairs, submaximal isometric contraction, and maximal isometric contraction (nonnormalized only). A two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures indicated VMO:VL ratios for isotonic stair-climbing activities were significantly greater than VMO:VL ratios for isometric contractions. Nonnormalized VMO:VL ratios in group 1 were significantly greater than nonnormalized VMO:VL ratios in the other two groups. Patients with PFP may have abnormal VMO:VL activation patterns, and isotonic quadriceps femoris muscle exercise may elicit more favorable muscle activation patterns than isometric exercise for patients with PFP. 
5	Postinduction repression of the beta-interferon gene is mediated through two positive regulatory domains. Virus induction of the human beta-interferon (beta-IFN) gene results in an increase in the rate of beta-IFN mRNA synthesis, followed by a rapid postinduction decrease. In this paper, we show that two beta-IFN promoter elements, positive regulatory domains I and II (PRDI and PRDII), which are required for virus induction of the beta-IFN gene are also required for the postinduction turnoff. Although protein synthesis is not necessary for activation, it is necessary for repression of these promoter elements. Examination of nuclear extracts from cells infected with virus reveals the presence of virus-inducible, cycloheximide-sensitive, DNA-binding activities that interact specifically with PRDI or PRDII. We propose that the postinduction repression of beta-IFN gene transcription involves virus-inducible repressors that either bind directly to the positive regulatory elements of the beta-IFN promoter or inactivate the positive regulatory factors bound to PRDI and PRDII. 
3	A retrospective outcome study and review of hypnosis as treatment of adults with sleepwalking and sleep terror. Hypnosis has been described anecdotally to be effective in the treatment of sleepwalking and sleep terror, potentially dangerous parasomnias. The authors report the use of hypnosis in the treatment of 27 adult patients with these disorders. A total of 74% of these individuals reported much or very much improvement when followed over substantial periods after instruction in self-hypnotic exercises that were practiced in the home. Hypnosis, often preferred over pharmacotherapy by patients, required one to six office visits (mean = 1.6). This represents a very cost-effective and noninvasive means of treatment, especially when constrasted with lengthy psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. 
1	Menopausal estrogen replacement therapy and breast cancer We conducted a meta-analysis of the literature concerning breast cancer and estrogen replacement therapy. The overall relative risk of breast cancer associated with this therapy was 1.07. However, the variation of the estimated risks among the studies was far greater than could plausibly be explained by chance alone. To explain this variation, we looked at the effects of type, duration, and dosage of treatment. Overall, women who took 0.625 mg/d or less of conjugated estrogens had a risk of breast cancer that was 1.08 times that of women who did not receive this therapy (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96 to 1.2). The relative risks from these individual studies of low-dosage therapy did not differ significantly from each other. Women who took 1.25 mg/d or more of conjugated estrogens had a breast cancer relative risk of 2.0 or less in all studies. However, the variation in observed risks at this higher dosage was significant. This implies that other risk factors varied among these studies, making it difficult to estimate the overall risk associated with this dosage. The relative risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen replacement therapy among women with a history of benign breast disease was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.5). The combined results from multiple studies provide strong evidence that menopausal therapy consisting of 0.625 mg/d or less of conjugated estrogens does not increase breast cancer risk. 
1	Xeroderma pigmentosum lesions related to ultraviolet transmittance by clothes. Xeroderma pigmentosum is associated with severe actinic degeneration of the skin. Our patient with xeroderma pigmentosum showed increasing actinic damage in some areas covered by clothes. We therefore performed a complete evaluation of the patient's exposure to ultraviolet radiation. This included transmission measurements of the patient's clothes, glasses, and car windows. The transmission of UVB (280 to 320 nm) by the clothes varied from none to 17.8%. The transmitted UVB radiation was proportional to the clinical manifestations of xeroderma pigmentosum. The patient's wardrobe was changed, and UVA-blocking film was applied to the windows of the car and house. A decline in manifestations was seen after 18 months of improved ultraviolet protection. 
5	Hepatocellular carcinoma presenting with pyrexia and leukocytosis: report of five cases. In the past 26 years we have encountered five patients with primary liver malignancy clinically characterized by high remittent fever and leukocytosis mimicking liver abscess. Two patients underwent exploratory laparotomy, and drainage was carried out in another. The clinical courses went rapidly downhill. The liver was cirrhotic in two patients. The interior of the main mass was almost totally necrotic in four cases. Histologically, the malignant cells in the main portion resembled sarcoma, but in some areas cells appeared epithelial with eosinophilic cytoplasm and were in a trabecular arrangement, except for one case not subjected to autopsy in which histological study was inadequate because of extensive necrosis. It seems that these neoplasms were very poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas rather than combinations of sarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. These patients, therefore, may represent a distinct clinicopathological type of hepatocellular carcinoma that is very rare in Japan but perhaps more common in South Africa, where similar cases have been clinically described in larger numbers. 
4	Logistic discriminant analysis improves diagnostic accuracy of exercise testing for coronary artery disease in women. BACKGROUND. Diagnostic accuracy of the exercise electrocardiogram in women has been shown to be limited for the detection of coronary artery disease. New diagnostic methods based on computer analysis of the exercise electrocardiogram and multivariate analysis have improved the diagnostic value of exercise testing in male subjects. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the diagnostic value of exercise testing can be enhanced in women by using multivariate analysis of exercise data. METHODS AND RESULTS. Between 1978 and 1984, 135 infarct-free women underwent exercise testing and coronary angiography. Significant coronary artery disease was present in 41% of the patients. In this first group, maximal exercise variables were submitted to a stepwise logistic analysis. Work load, heart rate, and ST60X were selected to build a diagnostic model. The model was tested in a second group of 115 catheterized women (significant coronary artery disease in 47%) and of 76 volunteers. We compared the present model with conventional analysis of the exercise electrocardiogram, with ST changes adjusted for heart rate, and with a previously described analysis. In both groups, sensitivity was better with the present model (66% and 70%) than by conventional (68% and 59%) and by the previously described analysis (57% and 44%) without a loss of specificity (85% and 93%). Receiver-operator characteristic curves showed also a better diagnostic accuracy with the present model. CONCLUSIONS. In women, logistic analysis of exercise variables improves the diagnostic value of exercise testing. It yields a significantly better sensitivity without a loss of specificity. 
3	The dynamic flexometer: an instrument for the objective evaluation of spasticity. Anesthesiologists may care for patients who have spasticity in the operating room or pain clinic. A number of therapeutic modalities for treatment of spasticity exist, but there are few simple objective methods for evaluating their effect. We describe one instrument, the Dynamic Flexometer, that measures the force required to move the limb passively through its maximum range of motion. The data presented validate the instrument's reliability. Two clinical cases presented here demonstrate the instrument's utility. This device may be of value to anesthesiologists involved in the care of patients with spasticity. 
3	Prospective observations of 100 high-risk neonates by high-field (1.5 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system. II. Lesions associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. One hundred neonates determined prospectively to be at risk for neurologic handicap underwent magnetic resonance imaging with a high-field (1.5 T) imager. Thirty-three demonstrated a total of 37 lesions consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, including periventricular leukomalacia (n = 12), basal ganglia hemorrhage (n = 5), multicystic encephalomalacia (n = 5), and focal parenchymal hemorrhage (n = 15). Diagnoses by ultrasonography and computed tomography were compared with those by magnetic resonance imaging in 29 and 17 infants, respectively. Ultrasonography agreed more frequently with magnetic resonance imaging than did computed tomography. Ultrasonography detected 79% of lesions demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging whereas computed tomography detected only 41%. Periventricular leukomalacia was seen most often in preterm infants, basal ganglia hemorrhage and multicystic encephalomalacia primarily occurred in term infants, and focal parenchymal hemorrhage occurred at all gestational ages. Basal ganglia hemorrhage and multicystic encephalomalacia were strongly associated with histories of perinatal asphyxia, seizures, and early abnormal neurological status. All infants with basal ganglia hemorrhage (5/5) and multicystic encephalomalacia (5/5) and the majority with periventricular leukomalacia (9/12) and focal parenchymal hemorrhages (9/15) had developmental abnormalities at discharge. 
1	Pelvic lipomatosis associated with cystitis glandularis and adenocarcinoma of the bladder. Pelvic lipomatosis is a rare condition characterized by an overgrowth of normal fat in the perivesical and perirectal spaces. Cystitis glandularis, cystica or follicularis has been observed in 75% of the patients with pelvic lipomatosis. Although cystitis glandularis is widely regarded as premalignant few reports have documented its transition to adenocarcinoma. We describe a 41-year-old man with pelvic lipomatosis in whom primary adenocarcinoma of the bladder developed 6 years after a histological diagnosis of cystitis cystica and glandularis was established. To our knowledge this is the second case reported of pelvic lipomatosis associated with proliferative cystitis and adenocarcinoma of the bladder, indicating that intestinal metaplasia of the urothelium may be a precursor of malignancy in these patients. 
5	Referral of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis for liver transplantation. All patients with primary biliary cirrhosis referred to this unit for consideration for transplantation between April 1981 and January 1989 were analysed retrospectively to assess whether disease stage at referral affects the outcome after grafting and whether greater awareness of the benefits of the procedure means that patients are now being referred at an earlier stage. Seventy of the 107 patients have been grafted, with an overall one year actuarial survival of 62%. A better prognosis at the time of referral, as assessed by both serum bilirubin concentration and a mathematically derived prognostic index, was associated with a greater probability of survival after grafting. Patients in the tertile with the best prognosis (median serum bilirubin concentration at referral 84 mumol/l and estimated survival in the absence of transplantation of more than nine months) had a 78% one year actuarial survival after transplantation, whereas those in the tertile with the worst prognosis (median serum bilirubin concentration 467 mumol/l and estimated survival of less than four months) had a one year actuarial survival of only 50%. No trend towards earlier referral of patients, however, was shown using either of these two markers. This retrospective analysis suggests that many patients are being referred too late for an optimal outcome. We recommend that patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who are potential candidates for liver grafting should be referred to a transplant centre before the serum bilirubin concentration approaches 150 mumol/l. 
2	Surgical options in postgastrectomy syndromes. The various operations performed for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease can lead to a variety of iatrogenic disorders collectively referred to as the "postgastrectomy syndromes." Although the etiology of most of these disorders remains unclear, loss of vagal innervation and bypass, ablation, or destruction of the pylorus clearly are involved in the pathogenesis of most, if not all, of these disorders. Unfortunately, there often is also a poorly understood psychological element involved in the pathogenesis. Of all ulcer operations, proximal gastric vagotomy results in the fewest physiologic abnormalities and the mildest postoperative symptoms. The continued popularity of this operation should effect a marked reduction in the incidence of disabling postgastrectomy syndromes. Fortunately, symptoms severe enough to necessitate remedial operation are uncommon, and conservative medical management is always indicated and usually suffices. When disabling symptoms are refractory, a thorough evaluation of the patient and an accurate classification of the syndrome are essential to guarantee a satisfactory result from surgical intervention. Although numerous surgical procedures have been developed to deal with the different syndromes, with varied results, the Roux-en-Y procedure has emerged as the operation of choice for most, if not all, postgastrectomy syndromes. However, the Roux-en-Y procedure has not been universally successful, and this operation can itself lead to the recently recognized postgastrectomy state of Roux-en-Y stasis syndrome. Prevention therefore remains the best form of therapy, and remedial operation should not be undertaken until adequate time has elapsed since the original operation and all forms of conservative treatment have failed. 
5	Femoral arteriovenous fistula as a complication of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. A report of five cases. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) associated with invasive and diagnostic angiographic procedures is rare. The incidence is increased with procedures such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) but is still quite low. We report five cases of AVF within a 17-month period, representing 0.15 per cent of all cardiac catheterizations and 0.87 per cent of PTCAs. All five patients presented with groin bruits. There were two associated pseudoaneurysms and one patient with deep vein thrombosis. All patients underwent uneventful division of the fistula. A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the femoral triangle is necessary in order to avoid this complication. That all fistulas were in the superficial or profunda femoris arteries emphasizes the importance of avoiding a low groin puncture. Early angiography and surgical intervention are recommended for optimal results. 
1	The glucose transporter and blood-brain barrier of human brain tumors. The glucose transporter of the human brain has been localized to endothelial cells expressing the blood-brain barrier, but little is known regarding its mechanism of induction or whether its expression is exclusively linked with restricted vascular permeability. We investigated glucose transporter expression by vessels in human astrocytic tumors and pulmonary metastases to the brain using immunohistochemical techniques. Vessels in 9 of 10 low-grade astrocytomas and 8 of 10 anaplastic astrocytomas were positive for glucose transporter. Glioblastoma vessels were transporter-positive in only 2 of 10 specimens. Vessels in all three metastatic tumors were negative for the glucose transporter. The decrease in transporter expression observed in higher-grade tumors occurred independently of increases in vascular permeability. In low-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas transporter expression and contrast enhancement were inversely related, but vessels in 6 of 9 anaplastic astrocytomas were transporter-positive despite contrast enhancement. These findings suggest that separate mechanisms induce the glucose transporter and the permeability restrictions of the human blood-brain barrier. They also have potential implications for the therapy and prognosis of astroglial neoplasms. 
3	Transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials as a prognostic indicator for motor recovery in stroke patients. Transcranial electrical motor evoked potentials (MEP) were examined in 33 patients within three days after stroke. Normal values for MEP and motor central conduction time (CCT) were obtained in 46 healthy controls whose MEPs were evaluated during slight voluntary muscle contraction and at rest. Two months later 23 patients were re-examined clinically and electrophysiologically. Motor function change was correlated with MEP results. Two months after stroke the patients with normal or prolonged CCT had an improved motor function compared with those with absent CCT. MEP may be a valuable prognostic indicator in the acute stage of paralytic stroke for recovery of motor function. 
1	Pulmonary blastomas. Pulmonary blastoma is a rare lung tumor composed of immature mesenchyme and/or epithelium that morphologically mimics embryonal pulmonary structure. The prognosis of these tumors is poor, and the clinical course is not readily predicted from histologic appearance. In this report, the clinical, gross, microscopic, and immunopathologic features of 52 cases are described, and prognostically important correlates are determined. Twenty-eight patients were women, and 24 were men. There was a unimodal age peak in the fourth decade; only two patients were younger than 10 years old, and both had biphasic blastomas. Forty-one percent of patients were asymptomatic. Chest radiography typically showed a peripheral or midlung mass without predilection for any lobe. Microscopically, tumors could be divided into two classes: those composed solely of malignant glands of embryonal appearance (well-differentiated fetal adenocarcinomas [WDFA], 28 cases) and those with a biphasic appearance (24 cases). The malignant epithelium contained cytokeratin, carcinoembryonic antigen, milk fat globulin, and often chromogranin; vimentin, actin, and less frequently desmin and myoglobin were present in malignant stromal cells. More often WDFA was a smaller tumor (less than 5 cm) than biphasic tumors (P less than or equal to 0.001). It was more likely to be asymptomatic (P less than or equal to 0.001), and it was less likely to show pleural effusion by chest radiography (P less than or equal to 0.01) or giant or bizarre tumor cells (P less than or equal to 0.001) or frequent (greater than or equal to 30 mitoses/10 high-power fields) mitoses in the microscopic sections (P less than or equal to 0.01). Only 14% of patients with WDFA died of their tumor; 52% of patients with biphasic tumors died (mean follow-up, 97 months and 49 months, respectively). For patients with WDFA, the presence of thoracic adenopathy by chest radiography (P less than or equal to 0.001) and metastasis at initial presentation (P less than or equal to 0.001), followed by tumor recurrence (P less than or equal to 0.01), were the factors most highly correlated with poor prognosis. For patients with biphasic tumors, tumor recurrence (P less than or equal to 0.001) was the most significant indicator of poor prognosis, followed by metastasis at initial presentation (P less than or equal to 0.05) and gross size of the tumor (greater than or equal to 5 cm) (P less than or equal to 0.05). These findings support the idea that histologic class and gross and clinical findings can be of prognostic value in pulmonary blastoma. 
5	Obstructive sleep apnea presenting with nocturnal angina, heart failure, and near-miss sudden death. An obese woman with a one-year history of episodic nocturnal chest pain was admitted because of shock and pulmonary edema. A clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock was made. She was ventilated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequent investigations showed no evidence of cardiac dysfunction or coronary disease, but sleep study confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We suggest that the nocturnal angina and heart failure in this patient might have resulted from extreme hypoxemia produced by OSAS. This case raised the possibility that the high cardiovascular mortality rate reported in OSAS might not necessarily relate to underlying coronary artery disease. Further investigations are required to delineate the true incidence of coronary disease in patients with OSAS. 
5	Central adenoid cystic carcinoma of the mandible. A patient with adenoid cystic carcinoma arising centrally within the mandible, a rare location for this malignant salivary gland tumor, is described. Current concepts regarding the etiology, diagnosis, histology, and treatment of central intramandibular salivary gland tumors are discussed and the literature is reviewed. 
5	Expression of HLA-DR and secretory component antigens and lymphocyte infiltration in human gastric nonmalignant and malignant tissues: an immunohistochemical study. The relation between HLA-DR and secretory component (SC) expression and the degree of lymphocyte infiltration was immunohistochemically examined in human gastric mucosa with or without intestinal metaplasia and gastric carcinoma tissues. Gastric mucosa without obvious inflammation showed neither expression of HLA-DR or SC nor remarkable lymphoid infiltration. In contrast, gastric mucosa with chronic inflammation, tissues with incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia, and carcinoma demonstrated both HLA-DR and SC in almost the same area and also prominent lymphoid infiltration in the surrounding stroma. This simultaneous expression of HLA-DR and SC was not observed in complete type of intestinal metaplasia. The results indicate a close relationship between expression of HLA-DR and SC and the presence of lymphocyte infiltration in gastric mucosa, areas of incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia and in gastric carcinomas. 
1	Elevated expression of the c-fes proto-oncogene in adult human myeloid leukemia cells in the absence of gene amplification. Expression of the 93-kd tyrosine kinase encoded by the human c-fes proto-oncogene (also known as FES) is restricted to mature hematopoietic cells of the granulocytic and monocytic lineages, suggestive of a function essential to normal myeloid differentiation. However, recent studies have shown that c-fes can transform fibroblasts if sufficient levels of gene expression are achieved. These findings indicate that strict regulation of the c-fes gene is critical to normal myeloid development, whereas elevated c-fes expression may contribute to malignant transformation. In the present study, we compared the c-fes messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in leukemia blasts from patients with myeloid or lymphoid leukemia with those of peripheral monocytes from a normal donor with the use of a quantitative ribonuclease protection assay. The presence of c-fes mRNA was readily detected in both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, but c-fes mRNA was present in low levels or was absent in lymphoid leukemia cells. The leukemia cells of two of five AML patients and four of four CML patients expressed more c-fes mRNA than monocytes from a normal donor, with more than a threefold elevation in the cells of one CML patient. No evidence of amplification or rearrangement of the c-fes gene was detectable by Southern blot analysis of myeloid leukemia DNA, suggesting that the variation in c-fes mRNA levels are related to differences in transcriptional activity and/or message stability. These results indicate that elevated c-fes expression is a common feature of myeloid leukemia cells that could potentially contribute to the leukemia phenotype. 
4	Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in hypertensive crises in pregnancy. Twenty-four patients first seen with hypertensive crises during pregnancy were studied by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for a period of 24 hours to detect the presence of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Three patients were excluded from analysis because of low serum potassium levels. Thirteen of the remaining 21 patients had ventricular tachycardia on subsequent analysis of the electrocardiogram. These arrhythmias subsided after induction of anesthesia when blood pressure control was optimal. This finding may be implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary edema and sudden death in these patients. 
5	Lateral temporal bone resections. Eighteen consecutive patients underwent a lateral temporal bone resection for the treatment of tumors originating in the auricle, the external auditory canal, the periauricular skin, or the parotid and were retrospectively analyzed. The different lateral temporal bone resections performed have been categorized into four types. The type I resection consists of the removal of the tympanic bone and the external auditory canal lateral to the tympanic membrane. The type II resection consists of the removal of the entire tympanic bone, the tympanic membrane, the incus, and the malleus, preserving the facial nerve and the inner ear. Type III resections remove, in addition to the those structures removed in type II resections, the distal facial nerve and fallopian canal, the mastoid tip, the styloid process, and the stylomastoid foramen. The type IV resection consists of the removal of only the mastoid tip and the inferior portion of the tympanic bone. When the techniques of lateral temporal bone resection are used appropriately, adequate surgical treatment of patients with selected advanced and recurrent malignant tumors of the external ear, the periauricular skin, and the parotid is possible with low morbidity and a high probability of local regional control. 
5	The Oxford knee replacement. A review from an independent centre. We present a study of 67 Oxford bicompartmental total knee replacements performed at a district general hospital. In this general orthopaedic unit, 57 of the knees (85%) had significant relief of pain with a mean flexion range of 95 degrees and a mean flexion deformity of only 9 degrees. There was a noticeable difference between osteoarthritic and rheumatoid knees. Poor results could be directly related to an avoidable postoperative complication. The results of this independent assessment may be compared favourably with the previously published series from the specialist centre at which the prosthesis was designed. 
1	Enhanced hepatic drug clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis. To examine whether hepatic drug metabolism is altered in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), we evaluated the pharmacokinetics of three model pharmacologic substrates (antipyrine, a marker of hepatic oxidative metabolism; lorazepam, a marker of hepatic glucuronosyltransferase activity; and indocyanine green (ICG), a marker of hepatic blood flow and biliary secretion) in 14 patients with CF (14.6 to 29.2 years of age) and in 12 children and adolescents with cancer (7.2 to 19.4 years of age), which was treated with only surgery and radiation. Each study subject received a single intravenous dose of the combined model substrates (0.03 mg/kg lorazepam, 10 mg/kg antipyrine, and 0.5 mg/kg ICG) for 5 minutes, followed by repeated blood sampling (n = 10) during a 24-hour postinfusion period. Patients with CF had a significantly greater plasma clearance of lorazepam (56.5 +/- 5.2 vs 25.9 +/- 1.9 ml/min/m2) and ICG (892.5 +/- 176.4 vs 256.5 +/- 41.7 ml/min/m2) but not of antipyrine (27.2 +/- 3.8 vs 20.7 +/- 2.0 ml/min/m2) in comparison with control subjects. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution for lorazepam, ICG, and antipyrine was significantly higher in the patients with CF (2.0-, 3.1-, and 1.4-fold, respectively) than in control subjects. Clearance of the model substrates did not correlate with standard biochemical markers of hepatic function. Similarly, no significant relationships were observed between the clearance or steady-state volume of distribution of the compounds and the National Institutes of Health prognostic scores for the patients with CF. These data demonstrate that the plasma clearance of lorazepam and ICG is increased in patients with CF and suggest that hepatic glucuronosyltransferase activity and biliary secretory capacity are enhanced in this disease. 
3	Genetics of cerebrovascular disease. Stroke is a complex disease, with both genetic and environmental factors having a role in its pathogenesis. A review of past studies shows some evidence of genetic influences in the development of stroke. This is supported by studies of cardiovascular disease, which indicate major genetic influences at several levels including the development of risk factors. New approaches to phenotypic classifications, patient ascertainment, and genetic analysis will stimulate research into the role of genetics in cerebrovascular disease. 
5	Temporary cardiac pacing using a new, steerable, balloon-tipped pacing catheter. A new balloon-tipped, flow-directed, steerable pacing catheter for unipolar temporary ventricular pacing is presented. It was successfully and uneventfully tested in 25 patients with acute myocardial infarction in the coronary care unit. The main advantage of the new catheter is the ease with which a stable contact may be achieved between the pacing electrode and the endocardium. 
5	Clinical-physiologic correlations in acute asthma of childhood. Seventy-one patients who presented to the emergency room with acute asthma were evaluated to determine the relationship between common clinical signs and spirometric and transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) measurements. Prior to treatment, a physical examination was performed, a clinical score assigned, and pulmonary function and SaO2 were measured. Although forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and SaO2 had strong correlation with the overall clinical score (r2 = .47, .49 respectively), many patients with low clinical scores and apparent mild clinical disease had low FEV1 values (as low as 20% predicted). Of the individual components of the clinical score (ie, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulsus paradoxus, accessory muscle use, dyspnea, and wheezing), the degree of accessory muscle use correlated most closely with lung function followed by the degree of dyspnea and wheezing. Similarly, the degree of accessory muscle use correlated most closely with SaO2 followed by dyspnea and respiratory rate. Significant correlation (r2 = .59) was found between SaO2 and FEV1, although the range of SaO2 value for a given FEV1 was wide and some patients with low FEV1 values had normal SaO2 values. These results show that although clinically apparent severe disease and hypoxemia were always associated with low FEV1, their absence does not exclude the presence of airflow obstruction. It is concluded that for the optimal evaluation of acute asthma in children in the emergency room, clinical evaluation should be used in conjunction with objective laboratory measurements. 
4	Myocardial amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations in patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. Myocardial amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentrations were measured at multiple sites in the explanted heart in four patients who underwent cardiac transplantation. Patients were taking amiodarone, 200 to 400 mg/day (mean 300 +/- 115), for 88 to 428 days (mean 229 +/- 148). The mean cumulative dose was 58 +/- 21.3 g. Plasma amiodarone concentration in three subjects was 204, 312 and 419 ng/ml and desethylamiodarone concentration was 268, 513 and 880 ng/ml, respectively. Significant interindividual variability in myocardial concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone was observed (p less than 0.05). Mean myocardial amiodarone concentration ranged from 4 +/- 1.0 to 29 +/- 17.2 micrograms/g (p less than 0.05); mean desethylamiodarone concentration ranged from 22 +/- 8.8 to 141 +/- 102.5 micrograms/g (p less than 0.05). At each site, save for fat, myocardial desethylamiodarone concentration was higher than amiodarone concentration. Greater intraindividual variability was observed in myocardial desethylamiodarone compared with amiodarone concentration particularly in septal and scar tissue (p = NS). No significant relation was found between myocardial concentration and duration of treatment. In patients with significant ventricular disease, usefulness of plasma amiodarone and desethylamiodarone concentration to estimate myocardial concentration is limited by intra- and interindividual variability. 
5	A comparison of surfactant as immediate prophylaxis and as rescue therapy in newborns of less than 30 weeks' gestation BACKGROUND. Exogenous pulmonary surfactants are administered into the trachea either to prevent respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants or to treat it. In a randomized, multicenter trial, we compared the results of surfactant therapy initiated as prophylaxis with the results of rescue therapy with surfactant. METHODS. Before birth, 479 infants with an estimated gestational age of less than 30 weeks were randomly assigned to receive surfactant as prophylaxis (n = 235) or rescue therapy (n = 244). The infants in the prophylaxis group received a 90-mg intratracheal dose of an exogenous calf-lung surfactant extract at the time of delivery, whereas the infants in the rescue-therapy group received 90 mg of the surfactant several hours after delivery if the fractional inspiratory oxygen concentration was at least 0.40 or if the mean airway pressure was at least 0.686 kPa (7 cm of water), or both. Infants in both groups received additional doses of surfactant at intervals of 12 to 24 hours if these criteria were met. RESULTS. The proportion of infants surviving until discharge to their homes was significantly higher in the prophylaxis group than in the rescue-therapy group (88 vs. 80 percent, P = 0.028). This difference was due primarily to the longer survival of very premature infants (less than or equal to 26 weeks' gestation) in the prophylaxis group than in the rescue-therapy group (75 vs. 54 percent, P = 0.006). According to proportional-hazards regression analysis, the distribution of survival times was better for all infants in the prophylaxis group (P = 0.007) and for the subgroup of infants in the prophylaxis group who were delivered at 26 weeks' gestation or earlier (P = 0.0048). Infants in the prophylaxis group who were delivered at 26 weeks' gestation or earlier had a lower incidence of pneumothorax than similar infants in the rescue-therapy group (7 vs. 18 percent, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS. We found a significant advantage to the administration of the initial dose of surfactant as prophylaxis rather than as rescue therapy in very premature infants. 
1	Leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and residential proximity to industrial plants. The risks of developing leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from living near industrial facilities were evaluated among men from Iowa and Minnesota in a population-based, case-control study. We found a statistically significant increase in the risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR = 1.4) and a slight, nonsignificant excess for leukemia (RR = 1.2) among individuals who lived .8-3.2 km (1/2-2 miles) from a factory. Risks were greater for certain histologic types: follicular lymphoma (RR = 1.5), acute lymphocytic leukemia (RR = 5.4), and acute myelocytic leukemia (RR = 2.2). For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (but not for leukemia), the relative risks for those living within .8 km (1/2 mile) of a factory were similar or slightly larger than for those living .8-3.2 km (1/2-2 miles) from a factory. Risks did not increase with duration of residence near a factory. The elevated risks of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were particularly associated with residing near stone, clay, or glass industry facilities. The risk of developing leukemia was greater among persons who resided near chemical and petroleum plants. These preliminary findings raise the possibility that general environmental exposure associated with certain industrial activities may elevate the risk of developing leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Evaluation of data on proximity to industrial plants from studies in other geographic locations is needed to determine whether our results represent a meaningful association. 
5	Hepatic histological findings after transplantation for chronic hepatitis B virus infection, including a unique pattern of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Long-term follow-up of 27 patients with hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver disease treated by transplantation showed that 23 had hepatitis B virus recurrence. In 13 patients late changes in the grafts were similar to those described in other series: minor abnormalities in five cases, chronic active hepatitis in five cases and non-hepatitis B virus-related graft dysfunction in three cases. Three patients had incomplete histological follow-up. Analysis of the histological changes and viral antigen expression in six cases revealed a distinct and novel pattern termed fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Development of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis was associated with rapidly progressive graft dysfunction. It is postulated that this pattern of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis develops because of a high cytoplasmic expression of viral antigens, including HBsAg. The remaining case had some features of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. The main histological features of this unique syndrome include thin, perisinusoidal bands of fibrosis extending from portal tracts to surround plates of ductular-type epithelium; prominent cholestasis; ground-glass transformation; and ballooning of hepatocytes with cell loss and mild mixed inflammatory reaction. 
5	Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: an initial report. Sixty consecutive patients underwent an elective attempt at laparoscopic cholecystectomy between March 15 and July 31, 1990 at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. Fifty-two patients had successful completion of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy (87%). The reasons for conversion to open cholecystectomy were acute cholecystitis (four patients), inability to define the cystic duct-common duct junction (three patients), and one patient with an unexpected choledochal cyst variant. Forty patients (77%) were discharged on the first post-operative day, and the remaining 12 patients on the second post-operative day. Thirty-three patients (63%) required only oral pain medication, and 11 patients (21%) needed no pain medication post-operatively. Fifty-one patients (98%) had resumed normal activities by the seventh post-operative day. Cholecystectomy remains the treatment of choice for biliary colic. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy minimizes length of stay in the hospital, lessens post-operative pain, allows quicker return to normal activities, and has a superior cosmetic result. 
5	A prognostic system for transient ischemia or minor stroke. OBJECTIVE: To build a prognostic system for patients with carotid transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. DESIGN: Inception cohort study with 2-year follow-up. SETTING: Urban community teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Eligible patients (n = 142), identified on a carotid ultrasound roster, had been hospitalized between 1984 and 1987 within 30 days of a first carotid transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. MEASUREMENTS: Stroke or death within 2 years. MAIN RESULTS: Three factors were associated with stroke or death: age of more than 65 years, diabetes, and hypertension. Based on regression coefficients, age of more than 65 years was assigned 3 points; diabetes, 3 points; and hypertension, 2 points. An initial prognostic system comprised risk groups 1 (0 points), 2 (1 to 5 points), and 3 (6 to 8 points). Outcome rates in the three groups were 2%, 31%, and 54% (P less than 0.0001), respectively. In an independent test sample, the corresponding outcome rates for the initial system were 12%, 21%, and 31% (P = 0.04). A final prognostic system, including two additional predictors (coronary heart disease [1 point] and the distinction between stroke and transient ischemic attack for the baseline event [2 points]), comprised risk groups 1 (0 to 2 points), 2 (3 to 6 points), and 3 (7 to 11 points). Corresponding outcome rates were 3%, 27%, and 48% (P less than 0.001) in the original cohort and 10%, 21%, and 59% (P less than 0.001) in the test cohort. CONCLUSION: For selected patients with carotid transient ischemia or minor stroke, five clinical features can be combined to stratify effectively the risk for a subsequent stroke or death. 
5	Multimodal therapy for the management of primary, nonmetastatic Ewing's sarcoma of bone: a long-term follow-up of the First Intergroup study. A total of 342 previously untreated eligible children were entered into the first Intergroup Ewing's Sarcoma Study (IESS) between May 1973 and November 1978. In group I institutions, patients were randomized between treatment 1 (radiotherapy to primary lesion plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, dactinomycin, and Adriamycin [doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH] [VAC plus ADR]) or treatment 2 (same as treatment 1 without ADR), and group II institutions randomized patients between treatment 2 or treatment 3 (same as treatment 2 plus bilateral pulmonary radiotherapy [VAC plus BPR]). The percentages of patients relapse-free and surviving (RFS) at 5 years for treatments 1, 2, and 3 were 60%, 24%, and 44%, respectively. There was strong statistical evidence of a significant advantage in RFS for treatment 1 (VAC plus ADR) versus 2 (VAC alone) (P less than .001) and 3 (P less than .05) and also of treatment 3 versus 2 (P less than .001). Similar significant results were observed with respect to overall survival. Patients with disease at pelvic sites have significantly poorer survival at 5 years than those with disease at nonpelvic sites (34% v 57%; P less than .001). Among pelvic cases, there was no evidence of differing survival by treatment (P = .81), but among nonpelvic cases, there was strong evidence of differing survival by treatment (P less than .001). The overall percentage of patients developing metastatic disease was 44%; the percentages by treatments 1, 2, and 3 were 30%, 72%, and 42%, respectively. The overall incidence of local recurrence was 15%, and there was no evidence that local recurrence rate differed by treatment. Patient characteristics related to prognosis, both with respect to RFS and overall survival experience, were primary site (nonpelvic patients were most favorable) and patient age (younger patients were more favorable). 
1	Single cell levels of hypothalamic messenger ribonucleic acid encoding luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone in intact, castrated, and hyperprolactinemic male rats. We have examined the changes that occur in neuronal expression of LHRH mRNA in response to castration and hyperprolactinemia in male rats. Single cell levels of LHRH mRNA were determined by quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry using an 35S-labeled synthetic 48-base oligodeoxynucleotide probe and quantitative autoradiography. Nine days postcastration, a 10.4-fold increase in mean plasma LH titers was observed which was associated with significantly increased LHRH mRNA in rostral hypothalamic neuronal cell bodies. Both increases were blocked in rats rendered hyperprolactinemic by the presence of the 7315a PRL-secreting pituitary tumor. The location and number of neurons expressing LHRH mRNA were unchanged, indicating that these differences were attributable to amounts of mRNA expressed per neuron. Experimental differences occurred in LHRH perikarya situated throughout the rostral hypothalamus from the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis to the caudal extent of the medial preoptic nucleus. These results suggest that gonadal steroids and PRL are involved, either directly or indirectly, in regulating the biosynthesis of LHRH in the rostral hypothalamus. 
5	Pivotal role of early and sustained infarct vessel patency in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction unequivocally has improved short- and long-term mortality. The fundamental goal of therapy for evolving myocardial infarction is early and sustained infarct vessel recanalization. The mechanisms linking an open artery with improved long-term survival and other clinical outcomes are presented with use of data from extensive clinical trials. 
1	Rapid diagnosis of lung cancer from palpable metastases by needle thrust. This study encourages the use of percutaneous FNB to diagnose and stage advanced lung cancer in patients with palpable metastases in supraclavicular lymph nodes or soft tissues. Percutaneous FNB of metastases is much easier to learn than transthoracic needle aspiration: the superficial target is anchored and sampled with multiple passes using a short needle grasped directly in the fingers. It is fast, accurate, economical and nearly free of risk and pain. The technique saves time and money because it is the only procedure needed by many patients with palpable disease in stage IIIB and IV. Bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle aspiration and open surgical biopsy thus can be avoided in most patients with palpable metastases. Prompt diagnosis by FNB of metastases speeds palliation for patients with urgent need. Tumor cell type from FNB correlated with cytologic findings from sputum samples, bronchoscopy specimens and autopsy results. 
5	An extracorporeal perfusion system to bridge pediatric liver transplant candidates. An extracorporeal liver perfusion system was designed to maintain cadaver livers in an oxygenated, normothermic state for bridging procedures for hepatic transplantation. Nonpulsatile high flow and pulsatile low flow blood are supplied to the portal venous (PV) and hepatic arterial (HA) circulations. Controlled low blood flow (5-10 cc/kg [patient]/min) is exchanged between the high flow extracorporeal perfusion circuit (1 cc/g [liver]/min) and the patient. The system was evaluated in perfusions of fresh, excised pig livers (n = 5). The average oxygen consumption was 9 +/- 3 microliters/g/min, and bile production averaged 4.7 microliters/g/hr. Perfusion pressures and flows were normal in both the HA and PV circulations for about 4 hr. Pressures then gradually rose, especially in the HA circulation, causing flow to decrease, with subsequent mottling and discoloration of the liver. Red blood cell, platelet, and white blood cell counts fell continuously. Maintenance of liver function was assessed by clearance of an 80 mg taurocholic acid challenge. An average of 56% of injected acid was cleared from the perfused livers (n = 5) in the first half hour, compared with 90% and 25% for the in situ (n = 3) and unperfused (n = 3) control livers, respectively. The system consistently maintained livers in a moderately well functioning state through the first 4 hr of perfusion. Adequate support of animals with induced hepatic failure must now be demonstrated. 
1	Immune-competent cells of regional lymph nodes in colorectal cancer patients: II. Immunohistochemical analysis of Leu-7+ cells. Distribution of Leu-7+ cells in cancer tissues and regional lymph nodes was immunohistochemically examined to estimate the role of NK cells in colorectal cancer patients. Leu-7+ cells were rarely observed both in the primary and distant metastatic lesions, but the number of these cells was large in the germinal center of the lymph nodes. Studies of Leu-7+ cell population in the lymph node indicated that intermediate nodes in n0 and n1 groups showed significantly higher values than those in the control group. Comparative study of the population in identical patients revealed a significantly higher rate in the intermediate nodes than in the paracolic nodes both in n0 and n1 groups. These data suggest that Leu-7+ cells might be related to the defense mechanism of regional lymph nodes against tumor. 
4	From the parallel group design to the crossover design, and from the group approach to the individual approach. The consequences of heterogeneity in response to antihypertensive drugs for the clinical development programs of new antihypertensive drugs and for the care of the individual hypertensive patient have not previously been sufficiently recognized. They play a role in the inappropriate choice of too-high daily doses of some antihypertensive drugs at the end of extensive international development programs. They are also implicated in the insufficient control of blood pressure observed in the long-term multicenter trials in hypertension, where some patients have been treated for several years with drugs that were not the most appropriate for their disease and which did not adequately control their blood pressure. In addition to the parallel group studies, the use of double-blind two-period or multiple period crossover designs can provide valid data for the dose-finding of new antihypertensive drugs and their comparative evaluation. At the end of the trial, these designs also offer each patient the opportunity to be treated with the right dose of the drug most appropriate for his or her disease. 
4	Relation between sodium intake, renal function, and the regulation of arterial pressure. The long-term regulation of arterial pressure requires the maintenance of a balance between sodium and water intake and sodium and water excretion. Normal salt and water balance leads to stable body fluid volumes and the maintenance of normal renal function is critical to establishing extracellular fluid volume homeostasis. This review focuses on the role of the kidney in the long-term control of salt and water balance with particular emphasis on the relations between sodium intake, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, renal sympathetic nerve activity, and the regulation of arterial pressure via renal sodium and water excretion. The accumulation of evidence in recent years demonstrates that low level elevation of renin release, circulating angiotensin II or aldosterone, or activation of renal sympathetic outflow may alter renal function such that normal natriuretic and diuretic responses to arterial pressure are significantly impeded. Under these circumstances, the maintenance of normal sodium and water excretion requires a significant elevation of arterial pressure. Thus, compromised renal function leads to elevation of arterial pressure to maintain adequate sodium and water balance during periods of increased sodium intake. The resultant chronic elevation of arterial pressure then becomes a compromise that is used by the kidneys to maintain normal extracellular body fluid volumes. 
3	Orbital intramuscular schwannoma. In an 8-year-old girl with asymptomatic proptosis, computed tomographic scans showed a large medial orbital mass that contoured the globe anteriorly, bowed the optic nerve laterally, and extended posteriorly to the orbital apex. T1-weighted coronal magnetic resonance images showed the mass to be a diffusely enlarged medial rectus muscle. Histopathologic examination of a medial rectus muscle biopsy specimen disclosed a multinodular, intramuscular schwannoma, separating and infiltrating normal skeletal muscle fibers. The intramuscular location and multinodular configuration of this tumor, together with its occurrence in a child, distinguish it from previous orbital schwannomas. 
5	Progression of human papillomavirus type 18-immortalized human keratinocytes to a malignant phenotype. We have developed a model system for progression of human epithelial cells to malignancy, using a human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV-18)-immortalized human keratinocyte cell line. Cells of cell line FEP-1811 were nontumorigenic in athymic mice through at least 12 passages in culture, but after 32 passages were weakly tumorigenic, producing tumors that regressed. After 62 passages they produced invasive squamous cell carcinomas that grew progressively. The progression to malignancy was associated with an increase in the efficiency of forming colonies in soft agar and with altered differentiation properties. In an organotypic culture system, FEP-1811 cells at passages 12 and 32 exhibited features typical of premalignant intraepithelial neoplasia in vivo, and cells at passage 68 exhibited features consistent with squamous cell carcinomas. No change in copy number of the transfected HPV-18 genome or in the level of expression of the viral transforming gene products E6 and E7 was detected between tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells. Cytogenetic analysis of cells at early, middle, and late passage levels and cells cultured from tumors revealed that several chromosomal abnormalities segregated with the tumorigenic cell populations. 
5	Results of treatment of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. The records of 48 patients with persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) were reviewed. Approximately 17% had vision of 20/100 or better after surgery, contact lens fitting, and amblyopia therapy. Only eyes with a purely anterior presentation had successful visual outcomes. Lensectomy alone prevented glaucoma, but a membranectomy as well was required to ensure a successful visual result. Eyes with a posterior PHPV had poor visual results because of posterior pole abnormalities. I recommend that an attempt be made to visually salvage eyes with an anterior presentation. Eyes with a posterior or a combination anterior-posterior PHPV can be successfully treated for glaucoma, but the visual results will be poor. 
3	Tumor necrosis factor and severe malaria. To investigate the relation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) to Plasmodium falciparum infection, plasma TNF alpha concentrations were measured in Zairian children with severe malaria, mild malaria, or other illnesses. The initial geometric mean plasma concentration of TNF alpha among 61 children with P. falciparum infection, (71 pg/ml) was higher than the level in 26 severely ill, aparasitemic children (10 pg/ml; P less than .001). Among 29 parasitemic children, initial geometric mean TNF alpha levels decreased from 77 to 5 pg/ml (P less than .001) at day 7. TNF alpha levels increased with parasite density and were associated with hyperparasitemia, severe anemia, hypoglycemia, and young age but not with cerebral malaria or fatal outcome. However, TNF alpha levels were elevated equally in children with cerebral malaria and with other signs of severe malaria. With multiple linear regression, TNF alpha levels were elevated independently in children with hyperparasitemia (P = .001) and severe anemia (P = .04). In this study, high TNF alpha levels were associated with several manifestations of severe malaria and were not specific to cerebral malaria. 
4	Relation of central obesity and insulin resistance with high diabetes prevalence and cardiovascular risk in South Asians. The hypothesis that the high mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) in South Asians settled overseas compared with other populations is due to metabolic disturbances related to insulin resistance was tested in a population survey of 3193 men and 561 women aged 40-69 years in London, UK. The sample was assembled from industrial workforces and general practitioners' lists. In comparison with the European group, the South Asian group had a higher prevalence of diabetes (19% vs 4%), higher blood pressures, higher fasting and post-glucose serum insulin concentrations, higher plasma triglyceride, and lower HDL cholesterol concentrations. Mean waist-hip girth ratios and trunk skinfolds were higher in the South Asian than in the European group. Within each ethnic group waist-hip ratio was correlated with glucose intolerance, insulin, blood pressure, and triglyceride. These results confirm the existence of an insulin resistance syndrome, prevalent in South Asian populations and associated with a pronounced tendency to central obesity in this group. Control of obesity and greater physical activity offer the best chances for prevention of diabetes and CHD in South Asian people. 
3	Arterial abnormalities of the hand in athletes. Vascular lesions of the hand may be seen in athletes exposed to repetitive blunt trauma. Thirteen athletes seen from 1983 to 1988 experienced symptoms related to hand ischemia. Nine were professional baseball catchers. The majority of patients complained of chronic symptoms, including cold hypersensitivity (four patients), finger numbness (one), finger coolness (three), and finger blanching (three). Two patients had acute symptoms with sudden posttraumatic hand ischemia with finger and palmar pain. Diagnosis was established by history and physical examination and confirmed by noninvasive testing. Testing included use of Doppler examination and cold tolerance examination with thermistors. Two athletes required angiographic evaluation because of severe ischemia and continuous pain. All patients in this group were managed nonoperatively. Those with chronic complaints were counseled regarding cold avoidance and instructed to increase their glove padding. The two patients with acute symptoms required vasodilator (papaverine chloride) infusion, followed by intravenous heparin and dextran. All baseball catchers returned to their sport with dissipation of symptoms. 
5	Comparison of epidurally administered sufentanil, morphine, and sufentanil-morphine combination for postoperative analgesia. Postoperative analgesia provided by epidurally administered sufentanil and/or morphine was evaluated in 45 patients recovering from major gynecologic surgery. At the first complaint of pain in the Postanesthesia Care Unit, patients received a single epidural bolus of 30 micrograms sufentanil (group A), 5 mg morphine (group B), or 30 micrograms sufentanil plus 3 mg morphine (group C) in a randomized blinded fashion. Analgesic efficacy was assessed throughout the 24-h study period with 10-cm visual analog scales. The need for additional postoperative analgesia (patient-controlled analgesia, 1 mg of morphine every 6 min as necessary) and the incidence of adverse effects were also assessed. Patients receiving sufentanil (groups A and C) had significantly faster onset of analgesia than did patients given morphine alone (group B, P less than 0.05). Group B subjects experienced the longest duration of analgesia (B vs A and C, P less than 0.05) and required significantly less patient-controlled analgesia (morphine) than patients in group A (P less than 0.05). No patient developed clinically significant respiratory depression or excessive sedation, and there were no intergroup differences in incidence of pruritus or nausea (P value not significant). The data indicate that a mixture of sufentanil and morphine provides either a more rapid onset of epidural analgesia or reduced patient-controlled analgesia narcotic requirement than respective doses of each agent administered alone. 
5	Isolated ventral pancreatitis in a patient with pancreas divisum. A previously healthy 22-yr-old woman was found to have chronic pancreatitis restricted to the ventral pancreas in association with pancreas divisum. When conservative treatment failed, sphincteroplasty of both papillae was performed with good results. This well-documented case represents a clear exception to the commonly held concept that obstruction of the dorsal duct is the essential pathogenic factor in the development of pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum. The importance of visualizing both the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts to direct therapy for patients with idiopathic pancreatitis is discussed. Theories of the pathogenesis of concomitant pancreatitis and pancreas divisum are reviewed. 
1	Surgical strategy in thyroid disease. Over the past 8 years, 311 patients have undergone surgical treatment by the senior authors for thyroid disease. Over 80% of the cases were performed by the head and neck surgical service at Olive View County Hospital, Sylmar, Calif, with the remainder performed at UCLA-affiliated institutions. This service is an important source of thyroid surgical training for UCLA head and neck residents who rotate through this major affiliate. The purpose of this communication is to review our experience with these cases; to describe our overall surgical strategy; and to detail the specifics of our surgical procedure, which we have developed to safely train residents in the treatment of these challenging cases. This article deals with the specific problems of preservation of the recurrent nerve, the parathyroid glands, and the techniques for reimplantation of injured parathyroid glands; the management of larger, substernal thyroid glands; and our techniques for partial thyroid surgery. In addition, the difficult decisions in the management of thyroid cancer, such as completion thyroidectomy; the management of lymph node mestastases; and how tracheal, esophageal, or laryngeal invasion should be managed are discussed. An initial section describing the general preoperative examination of these patients is also included, so that the proper surgical strategy can be developed prior to entering the operating room. 
4	Bronchial hyperreactivity in patients with mitral valve disease. To elicit the mechanism of bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in chronic heart failure (CHF), a methacholine inhalation test, pulmonary function test, and cardiac catheterization were performed in 19 patients with mitral valve disease (MVD), and the change of severity of BHR before and after mitral valve replacement (MVR) was also examined in seven of 19 patients with MVD. Sixteen of 19 patients with MVD showed significant increase in respiratory resistance in methacholine inhalation test, while all normal subjects did not. The maximal expiratory flow at 25 percent of vital capacity (Vmax25), a parameter of small airway disease, correlated significantly with log cumulative dose producing a 35 percent decrease in respiratory conductance (PD35Grs) (r = 0.536) and the duration of symptoms (r = -0.682). There was a significant correlation between log PD35Grs and mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (r = -0.466). After MVR, log PD35Grs was significantly improved in all seven operated-on patients, although six patients retained BHR. We conclude that patients with long-term MVD have marked BHR and that BHR in long-term MVD is related to peripheral airway narrowing with organic remodeling, which was not ameliorated with MVR procedure, in addition to pulmonary congestion. 
3	Cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism in patients with vascular dementia of the Binswanger type. We performed clinical and neuroradiologic studies, including positron emission tomography, in five patients with vascular dementia of the Binswanger type. The clinical features of these cases consisted of slowly progressive dementia, together with vascular risk factors such as hypertension and often a history of minor stroke, and characteristic white matter lesions on brain computed tomograms or magnetic resonance images. Digital subtraction angiography of the cervical and intracranial arteries demonstrated no occlusive lesion in any patient. Both cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were markedly reduced in the white matter (54-77% of control values), and both were decreased in the parietal (73% of control), frontal (74-80%), and temporal (74-83%) cortices, where no abnormalities were detected by brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. We conclude that vascular dementia of the Binswanger type may be caused by disconnection between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures due to ischemic damage in the white matter. 
1	Trends in primary breast cancer management. Where are we going? The treatment of cancer during any period has been based not on the whim of a clinician but on the therapeutic consequences of the dominant biologic model of the disease. Until the 1960s, the dominant model of breast cancer was of a disease that spread centrifugally along anatomic pathways, with time being the only determinant of prognosis. An alternative model, that of biologic determinism, posits that the outcomes of treatment are determined by the extent of microscopic dissemination that occurred before the tumor became detectable. This model, too, has flaws, and the author suggests that it is time for a Kuhnian paradigm shift. Breast cancer exhibits a heterogeneity of phenotypes resulting from one or perhaps two mutations. The multiple prognostic variables may be epiphenomena, expressing different degrees of amplification of a limited domain of the genome. 
5	Precipitated abstinence in orally dosed benzodiazepine-dependent dogs. The ability of graded doses of flumazenil (2, 6, 18, 36 and 72 mg/kg) and a lactose placebo to precipitate abstinence was studied in dogs treated chronically with diazepam, nordiazepam, flunitrazepam, alprazolam, oxazepam, halazepam and lorazepam by oral dosing. A scale comprised of 10 precipitated abstinence signs, the Benzodiazepine Precipitated Abstinence Scale, was developed, which yielded linear flumazenil log-dose response lines with significant slopes in dogs dependent on diazepam, nordiazepam and flunitrazepam. The effects of 18, 36 and 72 mg/kg of flumazenil in otherwise drug naive dogs were studied. In naive dogs, the most prominent effect of flumazenil was to reduce activity. All benzodiazepines studied produced dependence that was characterized by signs of precipitated abstinence; however, the intensity and quality of abstinence varied from one benzodiazepine to another. Precipitated abstinence in dogs treated chronically with diazepam and flunitrazepam was characterized by a dose-related increase in clonic convulsions and Benzodiazepine Precipitated Abstinence Scale scores. This pattern differed from that seen in nordiazepam- and alprazolam-dependent dogs, which showed a comparable flumazenil dose-related increase in clonic convulsion but only a modest increase in Benzodiazepine Precipitated Abstinence Scale scores. Oxazepam and lorazepam produced dependence that was less intense than that seen with the other benzodiazepines. Plasma levels of the benzodiazepines and their metabolites were repeatedly determined after single doses and during addiction cycles. Nordiazepam accumulated in diazepam- and nordiazepam-dependent dogs and alpha-OH alprazolam accumulated in alprazolam-dependent dogs. Other drugs and metabolites did not. These observations suggest that: 1) different benzodiazepines or their metabolites produce different types of physical dependence, suggesting that they or their metabolites have different mechanisms and sites of action; 2) plasma cumulation of the benzodiazepines or their active metabolites is an important factor in the genesis of physical dependence; and 3) metabolism of benzodiazepines plays an important role in their dependence-producing capacity, and because of differences in the way species metabolize benzodiazepines, the type of dependence produced in different species may differ. 
5	"Spontaneous sump syndrome": Successful treatment by duodenoscopic sphincterotomy. "Sump syndrome" is a rare complication of side-to-side choledochoenterostomy operations which develops in the distal, nonfunctioning limb of the common bile duct where lithogenic bile, gastrointestinal contents, and debris accumulate. We report here a patient who developed spontaneous sump syndrome as a result of the formation of choledochoduodenal fistula, and who presented with multiple pyogenic liver abscesses. The patient's symptoms and liver abscesses resolved completely after treatment by endoscopic sphincterotomy and antibiotics. This case demonstrates that sump syndrome may occur spontaneously, that it can be a cause for pyogenic liver abscess formation, and that it may be treated effectively by endoscopic sphincterotomy. 
2	Gastric lesions secondary to long-distance running. Gastrointestinal disorders have been reported during long-distance running. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of prolonged exercise on the upper digestive tract. Seven subjects were submitted to a standard endoscopic examination of the upper digestive tract before and after long-distance running (range 18-50 km). Mucosal biopsy specimens were taken during all endoscopies. After running, all runners had histologically pathological features in the stomach. Vascular lesions were present in the chorion in six subjects after running, with the intensity of the lesions ranging from congestion to hemorrhage. Postexercise histological examination also showed a decrease in mucosal secretion. These lesions secondary to prolonged exercise indicate the presence of hemodynamic perturbations in the upper digestive tract. 
3	Misdiagnosis in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To confirm our impression that a high percentage of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are initially misdiagnosed, we reviewed records of 33 patients with a definitive diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis seen over 10 years. Fourteen patients (43%) were initially misdiagnosed. Mean time to correct diagnosis was significantly greater for the misdiagnosed group (16.0 +/- 9.3 months) than for the rest of the patients (7.6 +/- 4.1 months). Two of three patients with an initial symptom of dyspnea were misdiagnosed. Three patients underwent laminectomies because of misdiagnosis. Age, stage of disease, and unusual presenting symptoms were not identified as causes of misdiagnosis. Most likely causes were physicians' failure to consider the diagnosis and lack of familiarity with the common clinical presentations of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Earlier diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may help prevent medical mismanagement and may benefit patients both medically and psychologically. 
3	Reversed lateralization of cognitive functions in right handers. Exceptions to classical aphasiology. Most current and past research on the cerebral organization of cognitive functions has presupposed certain specialized hemisphere operations. At least for right handers, language and praxis are to be organized in the left hemisphere, while affective prosody, configurational spatial capacity, and global attention are lateralized in the right hemisphere. Deviations from these presuppositions, as in crossed aphasics and perhaps left handers, are generally considered to be 'exceptions' and either to disprove the rules or to be irrelevant to the rule. We report 4 very 'exceptional' cases, right handers with almost entirely reversed lateralization of functions. Analysis of the intrahemispheric relationships between functions suggests that there may be a specific neurobiology to the interrelationships between and among cognitive functions, handedness, and the intrahemisphere localization of the function. 
1	Management of recurrent malignant pleural effusion in the United Kingdom: survey of clinical practice. Malignant pleural effusions are often symptomatic and tend to recur after simple aspiration. Pleurodesis may prevent recurrence of the effusion; many agents and techniques have been described. A questionnaire was sent to 448 clinicians in the United Kingdom to determine how pleurodesis is performed in practice. There was a 56% overall response, with replies from 101 respiratory physicians, 88 general physicians, 29 thoracic surgeons, and 35 general surgeons. General surgeons saw few cases of malignant pleural effusion and rarely performed pleurodesis. A patient with recurrent malignant pleural effusion would usually be managed with pleurodesis by 76 (76%) respiratory physicians, 26 (30%) general physicians, and 23 (81%) thoracic surgeons; a further 29 (33%) general physicians would refer such patients to another specialist. Most medical pleurodesis were performed by junior staff, whereas consultant thoracic surgeons were more likely to be concerned with the procedure. All the thoracic surgeons used an intercostal tube drain, usually with suction. An intercostal tube drain was used routinely by only 54 (54%) of the respiratory physicians and 28 (32%) general physicians. Thoracic surgeons preferred talc for pleurodesis whereas physicians most commonly used tetracycline. The variety of methods in use supports the need for randomised, controlled studies to determine the most effective technique of pleurodesis. 
5	Influence of prosthetic design on durability of the Liotta porcine valve in the mitral position. From March 1979 to December 1984, the Liotta low-profile porcine bioprosthesis was employed for mitral valve replacement in 71 patients to avoid potential left ventricle-prosthesis mismatch occasionally observed with the standard, high-profile, Hancock porcine xenograft. Follow-up of 61 operative survivors showed at 10 years an actuarial survival of 67% +/- 7%, freedom from thromboemboli of 96% +/- 2%, freedom from structural deterioration of 63% +/- 11% and freedom from all Liotta bioprosthesis-related complications of 53% +/- 10%. Complications related to excessive protrusion of the stent into the left ventricular cavity were eliminated with the Liotta bioprosthesis; the peculiar stent configuration, however, was responsible for an increased rate of structural deterioration requiring reoperation in 10 patients (2.8% +/- 0.9%/patient-year) at a mean interval of 76 +/- 18 months after mitral valve replacement (range, 45 to 106 months). Common findings in all explants were cusp prolapse, cusp tears, and commissural rupture related to various degrees of tissue calcification, constantly leading to severe prosthetic incompetence. As also shown experimentally, such structural changes have been attributed to increased systolic stresses on the closed cusps, favored by excessive reduction of the stent height. Our experience shows that the Liotta bioprosthesis used for mitral valve replacement does not provide any clear-cut advantage over standard porcine bioprostheses and that its long-term durability appears affected by the unique prosthetic design. 
5	Fetal death due to nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide poisoning. Fetal death due to acute carbon monoxide poisoning is rarely reported in the medical literature. Of the eight cases found in literature review, only one documented the fetal carboxyhemoglobin concentration. This paper reports a fetal death due to accidental nonlethal maternal carbon monoxide intoxication in which both maternal and fetal carboxyhemoglobin concentrations were obtained. The corrected carboxyhemoglobin concentration was 61% at the time of death in utero, while the maternal carboxyhemoglobin was measured at 7% after one hour of supplemental oxygen. The authors review the mechanisms of fetal death and emphasize the different carbon monoxide kinetics in the fetal circulation. 
4	Renal angioplasty for renovascular disease: a reappraisal. The exact role of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of renal artery stenoses (RAS) remains unclear. Therefore we analysed the outcome of unselected renal artery PTA in 30 subjects with angiographically proven unilateral RAS (Group I) compared with that of 19 who had RAS but were treated medically (Group II) and 21 who had essential hypertension but who underwent angiography (Group III). Good blood pressure control was achieved in all three groups but those who underwent PTA had a small but significant fall in their requirement for antihypertensive medications (p less than 0.05). However, no patient was "cured" of hypertension and blood pressure was able to be controlled in both Group II and Group III subjects without an increase in their number of antihypertensives. Serum creatinine did not improve significantly during follow-up in those who underwent PTA and was not different from that of Group II subjects at follow-up. Although unselected renal artery PTA for RAS may make blood pressure control easier it does not delay or prevent further deterioration in renal function and should not be used for this purpose. 
5	Management of aortobronchial fistula with graft replacement and omentopexy. Massive hemoptysis due to a recurrent aortobronchial fistula after repair of a thoracic aortic aneurysm developed in a 64-year-old woman. The infected aortic tissue was resected and replaced with an in situ Dacron graft covered by omentum. The patient is alive and well 15 months later. 
1	Multiple granular cell tumors associated with giant speckled lentiginous nevus and nevus flammeus in a child. We describe an 11-year-old girl in whom multiple cutaneous granular cell tumors were associated with a giant speckled lentiginous nevus and an extensive nevus flammeus. An association between granular cell tumors and pigmented skin lesions has been reported twice previously and supports a neural origin for these tumors. An abnormality of neural crest development is proposed to explain the coexistence of three uncommon and unusually extensive cutaneous disorders in this patient. This case may represent a further variant of phakomatosis pigmentovascularis. 
4	Platelet-activating factor: evidence against a role in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. The mechanism of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) remains unknown. The platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist WEB 2086 attenuated HPV in the isolated lung model of the rat. We evaluated the effect of WEB 2086 on HPV in an intact animal. Pigs were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and had their hemodynamic variables monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter and arterial line. Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution. Initial studies determined that PAF (0.03 to 1.0 micrograms) injected iv dose-dependently increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) with a 262 +/- 58% increase in PVR 5 min after a dose of 1.0 microgram. WEB 2086 (25 mg/kg iv) completely blocked the increase in PVR caused by iv PAF. Additionally, indomethacin (2 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg.h iv) treatment of the animals attenuated the PAF-induced increase in PVR. To evaluate the effect of WEB 2086 on HPV, animals were alternately ventilated with 21% oxygen and 10-min periods of 10% oxygen to induce HPV. After three initial control episodes of hypoxic ventilation, WEB 2086 (25 mg/kg) was injected iv and two more episodes of ventilation with 10% oxygen were given. During the three control HPV episodes the increases in PVR were 80 +/- 10%, 108 +/- 10%, and 107 +/- 22% (n = 5). After WEB 2086, the increase in PVR during two episodes of hypoxia were 96 +/- 28% and 99 +/- 19%, respectively, which was not significantly different from the control response to hypoxia. We conclude that iv PAF dose dependently increases PVR in pigs, and can be blocked by WEB 2086, that its effect is partially mediated through cyclooxygenase products, and that PAF does not appear to mediate HPV in this species. 
4	Lovastatin decreases coenzyme Q levels in humans. Lovastatin is clinically used to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia and successfully lowers cholesterol levels. The mechanism of action of lovastatin is inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol from acetyl-CoA. Inhibition of this enzyme could also inhibit the intrinsic biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), but there have not been definitive data on whether lovastatin reduces levels of CoQ10 as it does cholesterol. The clinical use of lovastatin is to reduce a risk of cardiac disease, and if lovastatin were to reduce levels of CoQ10, this reduction would constitute a new risk of cardiac disease, since it is established that CoQ10 is indispensable for cardiac function. We have conducted three related protocols to determine whether lovastatin does indeed inhibit the biosynthesis of CoQ10. One protocol was done on rats, and is reported in the preceding paper [Willis, R. A., Folkers, K., Tucker, J. L., Ye, C.-Q., Xia, L.-J. & Tamagawa, H. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 8928-8930]. The other two protocols are reported here. One involved patients in a hospital, and the other involved a volunteer who permitted extraordinary monitoring of CoQ10 and cholesterol levels and cardiac function. All data from the three protocols revealed that lovastatin does indeed lower levels of CoQ10. The five hospitalized patients, 43-72 years old, revealed increased cardiac disease from lovastatin, which was life-threatening for patients having class IV cardiomyopathy before lovastatin or after taking lovastatin. Oral administration of CoQ10 increased blood levels of CoQ10 and was generally accompanied by an improvement in cardiac function. Although a successful drug, lovastatin does have side effects, particularly including liver dysfunction, which presumably can be caused by the lovastatin-induced deficiency of CoQ10. 
4	A randomized controlled trial of allopurinol in coronary bypass surgery. A plethora of experimental evidence indicates that allopurinol reduces the formation of cytotoxic free radicals during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of allopurinol on cardiac performance and early mortality after coronary bypass surgery. Allopurinol (n = 89) or placebo (n = 80) was administered to 169 patients before surgery. Randomization produced groups evenly matched for surgical risk factors. Hospital mortality rate in the placebo group was 14 of 80 (18%) in the allopurinol group 4 of 89 (4%), p = 0.014. Cardiac performance, scored by cardiac index and the need for ionotropic or mechanical support, was significantly better in the allopurinol group. More nonfatal complications occurred in the allopurinol group. When either a complication or death is termed an event, the proportion of events was equal in the two groups. No side effects were identified. We now administer allopurinol to all patients who are undergoing bypass surgery unless specifically contraindicated. 
4	Left ventricular diastolic function in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction due to coronary artery disease and effect of nicardipine. To assess the effect of nicardipine on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function independent of concurrent effects on loading conditions in patients with LV systolic dysfunction due to coronary artery disease, equihypotensive doses of intravenous nitroprusside and nicardipine were administered to 12 patients with congestive heart failure due to previous myocardial infarction (LV ejection fraction less than 0.40). LV micromanometer pressure and simultaneous radionuclide volume were obtained during a baseline period, during nitroprusside infusion, during a second baseline period and during nicardipine infusion. Mean systemic arterial pressure decreased an average of 21 mm Hg with nitroprusside and 19 mm Hg with nicardipine. A greater decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure was observed with nitroprusside (29 +/- 2 to 15 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) than with nicardipine (29 +/- 2 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). There was a decrease in the time constant of relaxation during nitroprusside but not during nicardipine infusion. There was enough overlap in LV volumes in the baseline and nitroprusside periods to compare diastolic pressure-volume relations over a common range of volumes in 4 patients, and enough overlap in the baseline and nicardipine periods in 11 patients. The relation was shifted downward in 3 of 4 patients taking nitroprusside and in 6 of 11 patients taking nicardipine. The relation between end-diastolic pressure and volume was not shifted with nicardipine. 
4	Progress of patients with pulmonary atresia after systemic to pulmonary arterial shunts. Between February 1980 and June 1987, 42 shunts were placed in 39 infants with pulmonary atresia: 33 were modified Blalock-Taussig shunts with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and 9 were classic Blalock-Taussig shunts. There were four hospital deaths not related to the shunts. The remaining 35 patients were followed up for 1.6 months to 6.3 years (mean, 24.7 +/- 18 months). Repeat cineangiocardiographic studies revealed stenosis or distortion of the pulmonary arteries related to the site of the shunt in 11/22 patients (50%) with PTFE shunts and in 1/6 (17%) with classic Blalock-Taussig shunts; the stenosis was severe in only 1 patient. Mean increase in the pulmonary arterial index in the group with classic Blalock-Taussig shunts was 117 +/- 52 mm2/m2 (not significant) and in the group with PTFE shunts, 158 +/- 21 mm2/m2 (p less than 0.001). Late shunt occlusion occurred in 1 patient 23 months postoperatively. Thereafter, shunt patency rate remained at 94% +/- 6%. At the end of 1 year 81% +/- 7% of patients were judged to have adequate palliation, but between 2 and 3 years, only 60% +/- 10%. Univariate analysis showed that after 2 years the ranking order for successful palliation was classic Blalock-Taussig, 5-mm PTFE, and 4-mm PTFE shunts, but differences did not achieve statistical significance. 
3	Prognosticating study for cervical myelopathy using evoked spinal cord potentials. One hundred twenty-three cases of cervical spondylotic and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) myelopathy cases with long tract signs subjected to surgical treatment were studied to identify the most important factors having an influence on postoperative outcome using evoked spinal cord potentials (ESCP). Disappearance and positive wave changes of these potentials at the level of responsible lesions and slow conduction velocity under 40 m indicated an unsatisfactory outcome. Localized-lesion cases diagnosed by ESCPs had excellent results, significantly more so than extensive-lesion cases, regardless of operative methods. In 123 cases, 76% were found to have localized lesions, while the other 24% showed extensive lesions. Concerning the difference between CSM and OPLL, 54% of OPLL and only 14% of CSM demonstrated extensive lesions. 
4	Biohistory of slavery and blood pressure differences in blacks today. A hypothesis. Genetic factors are known to play an important role in the variations in blood pressure levels. However, genetic factors that explain the higher average blood pressure levels of western hemisphere blacks when compared with African blacks have not been seriously considered. Because the genetic makeup of a population is largely determined by biological and ecological forces in the past, an examination of the biohistory of blacks, specifically the slavery era, was conducted. An overview of the salient findings of that investigation is included in this article. The published historical evidence on the transatlantic slave trade and New World slavery (from the 16th century to the 19th century) reveals that conditions existed for "natural selection," and therefore, genetic changes were virtually inevitable in the slave populations. During this period of history, mortality was extremely high, and fertility (or reproductive success) was so low among the survivors that most plantation societies in the western hemisphere depended on a constant importation of captives (over 12 million) from Africa for the viability of the plantation communities. Because the major causes of death were salt-depletive diseases such as diarrhea, fevers, and vomiting, it is argued that individuals with an enhanced genetic-based ability to conserve salt had a distinct survival advantage over others and were, therefore, more likely to bequeath their genotype to subsequent generations of Western hemisphere blacks. Thus, it is predicted that blacks in the Americas have a greater frequency of individuals with an enhanced genetic-based ability to conserve salt than African blacks. 
5	Arterial oxygen desaturation during gastrointestinal endoscopy This prospective study evaluated the incidence and severity of arterial oxygen desaturation during gastrointestinal endoscopy. Following pulmonary function testing, 115 male patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy, or colonoscopy followed by EGD, with continuous recording of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). Most patients (80/115, 70%) showed arterial oxygen desaturation (greater than 4% decrease from baseline SaO2); severe arterial oxygen desaturation (SaO2 less than or equal to 85%) reflecting hypoxemia (PaO2 less than or equal to 50 mm Hg) was noted in one-third of patients overall (37/115, 32%). Severe arterial oxygen desaturation occurred in 9/62 EGD patients (15%), 23/46 colonoscopy patients (50%), and 4/7 patients having colonoscopy followed by EGD (57%). Arterial oxygen desaturation occurs frequently during gastrointestinal endoscopy and is often severe. These data support the concept that continuous monitoring of SaO2 should be standard procedure during all gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. 
1	Epirubicin cardiotoxicity: a study of 135 patients with advanced breast cancer. The cardiotoxicity of epirubicin (EPI) was evaluated clinically, radiologically, with ECG, and with multiple ECG-gated radionuclide determination of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) during rest in 135 patients with advanced breast cancer. The EPI doses were 60 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 4 weeks or 45 mg/m2 plus vindesine 3 mg/m2 on the same schedule. The median cumulative dose of EPI was 500 mg/m2 (range, 47 to 1,563). Eight of the 135 patients developed congestive heart failure (CHF). Of 67 patients treated with EPI less than 500 mg/m2, none developed CHF. Among 48 patients treated with doses between 500 and 1,000 mg/m2, one had CHF (2%; 95% confidence limits, 0.1 to 11.1). Among 20 patients who received EPI from 1,000 to 1,563 mg/m2, seven developed CHF (35%; 95% confidence limits, 15.4 to 59.2). Four patients died due to cardiotoxicity. The risk of EPI cardiotoxicity at the present schedule is considerable at doses above 1,000 mg/m2. At doses between 500 and 1,000 mg/m2 the risk of CHF decreases, and at doses below 500 mg/m2, it is negligible. For all patients, the prevalence of CHF was 6% and the sensitivity of LVEF high (95%), mainly due to the low incidence of CHF. Among the 20 patients who received EPI at more than 1,000 mg/m2, the prevalence of CHF was 35% and the sensitivity only 64%. The specificity was maximally 62%. Our results suggest that LVEF is of no value as a predictor for CHF. 
5	Post-traumatic bile fistulae. Bile leakage after liver injury has been reported to be a complication associated with significant mortality. In a prospective study of 306 patients with liver injuries 13 (4%) developed a bile leak. There appear to be two groups of patients, those with a major bile duct injury (three patients) and those with a more peripheral injury (ten patients). Bile leaks may present either as bile peritonitis (six patients) or as a bile leak through a drain site (seven patients). All but one bile leak closed spontaneously at a median of 33 days (range, 3-110 days). There was no mortality but patients incurred a median of four complications each (range, 1-5). This may reflect the severity of the initial injury rather than the bile leak. Respiratory failure and/or infection and sepsis were the most common complications whilst abnormalities of liver function, although common, were seldom of clinical significance. 
5	Surgeons, surgery, and immunomodulation. With the definition over the past 15 years of the altered immune state of surgical patients as a result of disease itself and surgical therapy, there have been multiple approaches to the modulation of immune status in experimental or clinical situations, but with conflicting or unhelpful results. The variable that has never been assessed is the significance of the surgeon as an immunomodulator. The expediency and the quality of the surgical act in a variety of surgical diseases have a positive effect on the immune system. Indeed, the data indicate that correction of shock, drainage of infection, excision or drainage of necrotic material, restoration of body composition, and solid basic care all have a positive influence on patients' immune responses. An immunomodulator might get credit if the role of surgical care is not properly assessed. A framework for the study of immunomodulators with the integration of clinical behavior is outlined. 
4	Indirect revascularization of the lower extremity by means of microvascular free-muscle flap--a preliminary report. We describe the treatment of a patient with end-stage peripheral vascular disease and ischemic ulceration of the lower extremity in whom an obliteration of the distal arterial bed precluded conventional arterial reconstruction. A nonhealing dorsal foot ulcer was debrided, and soft tissue reconstruction was accomplished by the free microsurgical transfer of a muscle flap to the distal lower extremity. Arterial inflow to this free flap was provided by a contralateral reversed saphenous vein graft from the proximal arterial tree of the leg. This procedure resulted in a healed wound, stable coverage, and limb salvage. The patient also noted complete relief of rest pain and improvement in his claudication symptoms. A follow-up arteriogram was done 2 months after surgery. Contrast injection directly into the artery of this flap showed new blood vessel growth from the muscle flap into the foot with anastomoses of these "new vessels" to the patient's native circulation. This experience suggests that limb salvage may be possible by the free microvascular transplantation of a muscle flap onto the limb in selected patients whose limbs are deemed "nonreconstructible.". 
5	Deletion of chromosome 4: 46,XY, del(4) (q31.3) after gamete intrafallopian transfer and in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. It seems that assisted reproduction technology does not increase the rate of chromosome abnormalities, and up to now, a few cases have been reported. The case we describe here is the first one of monosomy 4q31 in a full-term liveborn after a combined GIFT-IVF procedure. Once more, this case raises the question of whether pregnancies resulting from IVF should be monitored for chromosome abnormalities or not. 
2	5-Aminosalicylic acid is a potent inhibitor of interleukin 1 beta production in organ culture of colonic biopsy specimens from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Interleukin 1 beta in biopsy specimens from inflamed colonic mucosa of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease was studied. Compared with normal colonic mucosal biopsy specimens, a significantly greater amount of interleukin 1 beta was present in rectal mucosa before (median (range) 4.3 (2.0-11.8) v 119.2 (30.1-286.8) pg/mg; p less than 0.01) and produced during organ culture (39.1 (9.4-106.8) v 97.6 (28.2-991.6) pg/mg; p less than 0.01). Values of interleukin 1 beta after culture correlated with concentrations of thromboxane B2. Organ culture of inflamed biopsy specimens in the presence of 5 aminosalicylic acid and dexamethasone reduced the amount of interleukin 1 beta detected. At the doses studied, 5 aminosalicylic acid also reduced the amount of leukotriene B4 detected after culture. 
5	Current management of varicoceles. In spite of all that has been written about the varicocele, it is still not clear who will benefit from occlusion of the spermatic vein or why improvement in semen takes place in some patients but not in others. Because fertility is usually assessed in the framework of a couple who are trying to establish a pregnancy, it is important to evaluate both partners before making any recommendations regarding therapy. If the man is found to have a varicocele and semen analyses that indicate deficits in either the quantity or quality of the sperm, surgical ligation or transvenous occlusion should be considered as one appropriate form of therapy. Varicocele ligation and embolotherapy both can be performed as an outpatient procedure with minimal morbidity and equal effectiveness regarding pregnancy outcome. The cost, if the procedures are done in an outpatient facility, should be approximately equal. The obvious benefits of the percutaneous technique are a slightly lower recurrence rate and a more rapid return to full physical activity. The surgical procedure described by Marmar and associates appears to have a similar rate of recurrence and short postoperative period of recovery. Greater experience by more urologists using this technique needs to be gained to compare it adequately with the other methods described. Varicocele ligation by the inguinal or retroperitoneal routes is familiar to most urologists and does not require the operating microscope or other special instruments. With greater understanding of the venous anatomy and with careful dissection, the persistence and recurrence rate can be acceptably low and the postoperative recovery relatively rapid and smooth. 
5	Evaluation of 13C-urea breath test in the detection of Helicobacter pylori and in monitoring the effect of tripotassium dicitratobismuthate in non-ulcer dyspepsia Sixty nine patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia have been studied with endoscopy, biopsy, quick urease (CLO) test, Helicobacter pylori culture, and the 13C-urea breath test before and after treatment with tripotassium dicitratobismuthane (DeNol) two tablets twice daily for four weeks. Symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia were recorded using a standard questionnaire. Using H pylori culture as the gold standard, the sensitivity of the 13C-urea breath test was 90%, the specificity 98.6%, and the accuracy 94.8% with a positive predictive value of 98.2% and a negative predictive value of 92.5%. Conversion rate from H pylori positive to negative status after treatment with tripotassium dicitratobismuthate was 17.9%. Symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia improved appreciably after treatment irrespective of H pylori status. The 13C-urea breath test is an accurate research tool suitable for serial testing and population surveys. 
5	Pulmonary involvement in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. We describe the cases of three women with pulmonary involvement in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The illness was characterized by elevated peripheral blood eosinophil counts, myalgias, fatigue, and dyspnea. Two of three patients had bilateral infiltrates on chest roentgenograms. All three had markedly decreased carbon monoxide diffusing capacities and pulmonary hypertension. High-dose prednisone therapy provided only partial resolution of the pulmonary symptoms. Open lung biopsy specimens showed chronic interstitial and perivascular infiltrates in two of the patients and moderate fibrointimal hyperplasia of pulmonary vasculature in the third. High-dose prednisone therapy prior to the biopsies may have modified the original histologic features. 
1	Nevus flammeus. Discordance in monozygotic twins. Nevus flammeus has been described as an inherited vascular anomaly. We report two cases of nevus flammeus, each appearing in one of two monozygotic twins. This finding supports the idea that nevus flammeus results from embryologic mishap rather than genetic transmission. 
5	Late results of the left subcostal approach for automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation. A left subcostal surgical approach was used to implant an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) in 48 patients with a history of nonfatal cardiac arrest or documented ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. Electrophysiologic studies before surgery yielded induction of monomorphic or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 40 patients, whereas 8 were noninducible. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 58 +/- 12 years. Mean ejection fraction was 33 +/- 16%. Thirty patients (63%) had documented coronary artery disease; 14 patients (29%) had previous coronary bypass surgery. The mean intraoperative defibrillation threshold was 13.8 +/- 6.6 J. In 6 patients, an adjunctive right minithoracotomy was used to position 1 patch over the right atrium and thus optimize the defibrillation threshold. Patients with prior exposure to amiodarone and previous coronary bypass surgery had higher defibrillation thresholds at implantation. Two perioperative deaths occurred. There were no infections. Long-term follow-up yielded a 1- and 5-year survival of 0.88 and 0.58, respectively, and a freedom from sudden cardiac death of 1.0 and 0.97, respectively. The nonthoracotomy, left subcostal surgical approach is safe and effective, provides adequate defibrillation thresholds in most patients, and yields long-term survival comparable to other implantation techniques. 
1	Cytotoxic effects of high energy shock waves in different in vitro models: influence of the experimental set-up. High energy shock waves (electromagnetically generated, Siemens Lithostar) were studied for their effects in vitro on different (tumor) cell types. Cells were exposed to the shock waves as a single cell suspension or as a cell pellet on the bottom of a test tube. In both cases, a dose dependent direct cytotoxicity, established by trypan blue dye exclusion, was observed after treatment with 1000 or 2000 shock waves. Also, the antiproliferative capacity as determined by clonogenic potential (double layer soft agar) and growth rate (plastic) were affected in this way. However, comparing the results after treatment in suspension or pellet, a discrepancy was evident. The cell lines showed a different susceptibility in pellet vs. suspension. Also the differential sensitivity of the cell types varied in these two treatment models. Furthermore the outcome depended on the cell concentration; direct cytotoxicity in a cell suspension was more pronounced at higher cell concentrations, while in a pellet this was increased by decreasing the number of cells. Finally, no shock wave induced cytotoxicity could be seen after fixation of cells in gelatine or by placing the pellet on a bottom layer of gelatine. Pressure measurements revealed no adequate explanation for this phenomenon. These results indicate that in vitro effects depend on the way cells are exposed to the shock waves and can be greatly influenced by changing the conditions of the microenvironment. Therefore, precise descriptions of the experimental set-up and careful interpretations of their outcome are obligatory. 
5	Initial failure of surgical exploration in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. To determine the causes of failures of cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism, we reviewed 892 patients operated on by one surgeon from 1953 to 1990. Twenty-seven patients (3%) remained hypercalcemic or developed hypercalcemia within 6 months of surgery. Of these, five patients had one adenoma removed initially; at reoperation, three patients had a second adenoma that was successfully removed, whereas the other two patients had hyperplasia and required subtotal parathyroidectomies. No enlarged parathyroid glands were identified in 22 patients. Eventually, six patients became normocalcemic spontaneously, seven patients underwent re-exploration with a successful outcome in all but one case, two patients had ectopic hyperparathyroidism associated with carcinoma elsewhere, and seven patients refused reoperation and remain hypercalcemic. The failure rate of surgical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism can be reduced by systematically exploring all four parathyroid glands. All abnormal parathyroids should be removed with histologic verification. When no abnormal glands are found, localization studies should be performed before re-exploration. 
5	Triggers of transient myocardial ischemia: circadian variation and relation to plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis in stable coronary artery disease. The phenomenon of transient myocardial ischemia is common in patients with stable coronary disease and appears to be due both to increases in myocardial demand and to episodic coronary vasoconstriction. The circadian variation of transient ischemic episodes closely parallels the circadian variation of acute coronary syndromes associated with plaque rupture, such as myocardial infarction and sudden death. These concordant temporal patterns of transient ischemia, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death probably represent independent manifestations stemming from the consequences of increased sympathetic activity. 
5	Identification of lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor in multiple sclerosis lesions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) brain tissue, spleen, and PBMC were studied using immunocytochemistry and FACS for immunoreactivity for lymphotoxin (LT) and TNF. Both cytokines were identified in acute and chronic active MS lesions but were absent from chronic silent lesions. LT was associated with CD3+ lymphocytes and Leu-M5+ microglia cells at the lesion edge and to a lesser extent, in adjacent white matter. TNF was associated with astrocytes in all areas of the lesion, and with foamy macrophages in the center of the active lesion. In acute lesions, immunoreactivity for TNF in endothelial cells was noted at the lesion edge. No LT or TNF reactivity was detected in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease brain tissues but was present at lower levels in central nervous system (CNS) tissue from other inflammatory conditions, except for adrenoleucodystrophy which displayed high levels of LT in microglia. No increase in LT and TNF reactivity was detected in spleen and PBMC of MS patients suggesting specific reactivity within the CNS. These results indicate that LT and TNF may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of MS, and can be detected in both inflammatory cells and cells endogenous to the CNS. 
5	Percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy for acute complicated cholecystitis in elderly patients. We report our experience with percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy in 10 elderly patients with acute cholecystitis, complicated by empyema formation. Most of these patients has severe underlying disease, rendering them at high risk for surgical intervention. In all patients, the percutaneous procedure was followed by a rapid regression of clinical symptoms and of radiologic abnormalities. Six were considered inoperable. Three of these remain free of biliary symptoms, respectively 22, 10, and 7 months after percutaneous cholecystostomy. Three others died of nonbiliary disease 1-4 months after cholecystostomy. Three patients underwent successful elective cholecystostomy 1-5 wk after percutaneous cholecystostomy. In one patient, cholecystectomy had to be performed because of recurrence of hydrops, 1 wk after catheter removal. In our opinion, percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of elderly patients with acute complicated cholecystitis. It can be followed by elective cholecystectomy in good surgical candidates, or by an expectant conservative management in high surgical risk patients. 
1	Activated protooncogenes in human lung tumors from smokers. Fourteen primary human lung tumor DNAs from smokers were analyzed for transforming activity by two DNA transfection assays. Activated protooncogenes were detected in 3 of 11 tumor DNAs by the NIH 3T3 focus assay, whereas activated protooncogenes were detected in 11 of 13 tumor DNAs by the NIH 3T3 cotransfection-nude mouse tumorigenicity assay. K- or NRAS genes activated by point mutation at codons 12 or 61 were detected in a large cell carcinoma, a squamous cell carcinoma, and 5 adenocarcinomas. An HRAS oncogene activated by a different mechanism was detected in an epidermoid carcinoma. One adenocarcinoma was found to contain an activated RAF gene. Two unidentified transforming genes were detected in a squamous cell carcinoma DNA and two adenocarcinoma DNAs. Eight of 10 lung adenocarcinomas that had formed metastases at the time of surgery were found to contain RAS oncogenes. No significant increase in metastasis was observed in the lung adenocarcinomas that contained one or more 6-kilobase EcoRI alleles of the LMYC gene. Overall, 12 of 14 (86%) of the lung tumor DNAs from smokers were found to contain activated protooncogenes. RAS oncogenes appear to play a role in the development of metastases in lung adenocarcinomas. 
4	Early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in rabbit cardiac Purkinje fibers recovering from ischemic-like conditions. Role of acidosis. BACKGROUND. The mechanisms underlying repetitive activity during reperfusion of ischemic myocardium are thought to include triggered responses elicited at short pacing cycle lengths. The potential to generate repetitive responses at longer pacing cycle lengths under similar conditions, however, has not been explored. Thus, the present study examined the role of cycle length on the cellular electrical changes produced during recovery from ischemic-like conditions and identified the major component precipitating nondriven, repetitive activity. METHODS AND RESULTS. Transmembrane potentials were recorded in vitro from isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers exposed to hypoxia (defined as PO2 less than 30 mm Hg, high [K+]o, and zero glucose) plus lactic acidosis (pH 6.7) for 45 minutes and during recovery in normal Tyrode's solution (pH 7.4). Compared with control, action potential duration (90% repolarization) during recovery increased transiently by 40.9 +/- 11.8 and 241.0 +/- 51.1 msec at respective basic cycle lengths of 1,000 and 3,000 msec (both p less than 0.005). In 81% of preparations, action potential prolongation was accompanied by early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity generated from low (positive to -40 mV) or high (negative to -40 mV) membrane potentials. In 62% of experiments, brief periods of abnormal automaticity also occurred. Triggered responses were 1) unaffected by 1 microM ryanodine, 2) abolished by pacing at short basic cycle lengths or by exposing tissues to 2.5 micrograms/ml lidocaine, and 3) more easily induced at long basic cycle lengths or by superfusing 2.5 micrograms/ml quinidine. When tissues were conditioned with hypoxia alone (pH 7.4), action potential prolongation on recovery was comparatively small, and nondriven responses did not develop. Conversely, addition of 10-20 microM amiloride to the hypoxic, acidic test solution augmented recovery-induced action potential prolongation. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that acidosis, as a component of ischemia, plus slow pacing frequencies may mediate the genesis of early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in Purkinje fibers on recovery, long after extracellular pH has been restored to normal. These data may have clinical relevance to the mechanisms of reperfusion arrhythmias in the intact human heart. 
4	Thiazide diuretics and the risk of hip fracture. Results from the Framingham Study. Thiazide diuretics may preserve bone mass and prevent elderly women's osteopenic fractures, but studies have not distinguished between thiazide preparations or examined former users. We performed a case-control study looking at thiazide use and subsequent hip fracture in postmenopausal female members of the Framingham Study cohort. Cases who had experienced a first hip fracture (n = 176) were compared with age-matched controls (n = 672). Results showed a modest protective effect of any recent thiazide use (not significant). However, recent pure thiazide users experienced significant protection against fracture (adjusted odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.88), whereas recent users of combination drugs containing thiazides experienced no protection (adjusted odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 3.05). Combination drugs generally contained only 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, suggesting that the small amount of thiazide was insufficient to preserve bone mass. Former thiazide users were not protected against fracture. In sum, recent pure thiazide use in women protects against hip fracture. 
5	The flail mitral valve: echocardiographic findings by precordial and transesophageal imaging and Doppler color flow mapping. To determine the echocardiographic and Doppler characteristics of mitral regurgitation associated with a flail mitral valve, precordial and transesophageal echocardiography with pulsed wave and Doppler color flow mapping was performed in 17 patients with a flail mitral valve leaflet due to ruptured chordae tendineae (Group I) and 22 patients with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation due to other causes (Group II). Echocardiograms were performed before or during cardiac surgery; cardiac catheterization was also performed in 28 patients (72%). Mitral valve disease was confirmed at cardiac surgery in all patients. By echocardiography, the presence of a flail mitral valve leaflet was defined by the presence of abnormal mitral leaflet coaptation or ruptured chordae. Using these criteria, transesophageal imaging showed a trend toward greater sensitivity and specificity than precordial imaging in the diagnosis of flail mitral valve leaflet. By Doppler color flow mapping, a flail mitral valve leaflet was also characterized by an eccentric, peripheral, circular mitral regurgitant jet that closely adhered to the walls of the left atrium. The direction of flow of the eccentric jet in the left atrium distinguished a flail anterior from a flail posterior leaflet. By transesophageal echocardiography with Doppler color flow mapping, the ratio of mitral regurgitant jet arc length to radius of curvature was significantly higher in Group I than Group II patients (5.0 +/- 2.3 versus 0.7 +/- 0.6, p less than 0.001); all of the Group I patients and none of the Group II patients had a ratio greater than 2.5. 
2	Advanced assessment of the abdomen and gastrointestinal problems. There are many unique physical assessment findings that are associated with specific gastrointestinal disorders. The detection of these findings enables the nurse to manage gastrointestinal emergencies on the patient unit in a timely fashion, preventing deterioration and maintaining the safety of the patient. These skills build well on the traditional, detailed, and comprehensive assessments the nurse makes when using the nursing process. Specific abdominal assessments include detection of signs associated with appendicitis such as rebound tenderness and McBurney's, Rosvig's, and Aaron's signs. The nurse must always be alert to the possibility of peritonitis and the urgency of early detection and treatment. The patient with cirrhosis of the liver presents a distinct clinical picture. There is a need for subtle evaluation of mental status to detect early signs of hepatic coma. Another extra-abdominal assessment of this complication is asterixis. Finally, the assessment of the patient is enhanced when the nurse is able to help identify the location of bleeding. Improving abdominal and gastrointestinal system assessment leads to early detection of nursing problems and appropriate interventions. 
1	Interstitial irradiation and hyperthermia for the treatment of recurrent malignant brain tumors. Between June 1987 and June 1989, 29 recurrent malignant gliomas or recurrent solitary brain metastases in 28 patients were treated in a Phase I study of interstitial irradiation and hyperthermia. Patient age ranged from 18 to 65 years, and the Karnofsky Performance Status scores ranged from 40 to 90%. There were 13 glioblastomas, 10 anaplastic astrocytomas, 3 melanomas, and 3 adenocarcinomas. Catheters were implanted stereotactically after computed tomography-based preplanning. Hyperthermia was administered before and after brachytherapy, using one to six 2450- or 915-MHz helical coil microwave antennas and one to three multisensor fiberoptic thermometry probes. The goal was to heat as much of the tumor as possible to 42.5 degrees C for 30 minutes. Within 30 minutes after the first hyperthermia treatment, implant catheters were afterloaded with high-activity iodine-125 seeds delivering tumor doses of 32.6 to 61.0 Gy. Most patients had no sensation of heating. Complications included seizures in 5 patients, reversible neurological changes in 9 patients, a scalp burn in 1, and infections in 3. Of 28 evaluable 2-month follow-up scans, 11 showed definite improvement in the radiological appearance of the tumor, 4 were slightly improved, 7 were stable, and 6 showed tumor progression. Ten patients underwent reoperation for persistent tumor and/or necrosis. Eleven of 28 patients are alive 40 to 97 weeks after treatment. Thirteen patients died of a brain tumor, 2 died of extracranial melanoma metastases, 1 died of new brain melanoma metastases, and 1 died of a pulmonary embolus. The median survival was 55 weeks overall. Median survival has not yet been reached for the anaplastic astrocytoma subgroup. We conclude that interstitial brain hyperthermia using helical coil microwave antennas is technically feasible. The level of toxicity is acceptable, and the computed tomographic response rate is encouraging. 
1	The dichotomous distribution of gastrinomas. Our experience with 47 sporadic gastrinomas suggests that no less than 85% of these tumors are located to the right of the superior mesenteric artery. This finding is unexpected because approximately 75% of insulinomas and glucagonomas are located to the left of the superior mesenteric artery. All of our extrapancreatic gastrinomas have been located to the right. These observations prompted us to determine if other extrapancreatic gastrinomas were also predominantly located to the right side. We searched the world's literature and found 10 cases of ovarian gastrinomas and one case of a renal gastrinoma. Nine of these remote extrapancreatic gastrinomas were located on the right side. This distribution of remote extrapancreatic gastrinomas is similar to our experience with peripancreatic gastrinomas. This unexpected right-sided preponderance of both remote and peripancreatic gastrinomas suggests a common origin for both. 
5	Myocardial revascularization for the third time. Clinical characteristics and follow-up. Twenty-five patients presenting for a third revascularization procedure were retrospectively reviewed at Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL. This represents 0.5 percent of the total revascularization cases over a five-year period extending from 1985 through 1989. Perioperative mortality was none, and seven complications occurred in six patients. Internal mammary arteries were used for revascularization in 60 percent of this group. Follow-up reveals that only one patient has died secondary to an arrhythmia. All patients except one are symptomatically improved, and 18 patients remain angina free at a mean follow-up of 22.3 months. It is therefore concluded that patients are clinically improved with a third revascularization, and this procedure should be offered as an effective means of treatment. 
5	Menstrual state and exercise as determinants of spinal trabecular bone density in female athletes. OBJECTIVE--To study the effects of amenorrhoea and intensive back exercise on the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine in female athletes. DESIGN--Cross sectional study comparing amenorrhoeic with eumenorrhoeic athletes and rowers with non-rowers. SETTING--The British Olympic Medical Centre, Northwick Park Hospital. PATIENTS--46 Elite female athletes comprising 19 rowers, 18 runners, and nine dancers, of whom 25 were amenorrhoeic and 21 eumenorrhoeic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Trabecular bone mineral density of the lumbar spine measured by computed tomography. RESULTS--Mean trabecular bone mineral density was 42 mg/cm3 (95% confidence interval 22 to 62 mg/cm3) lower in the amenorrhoeic than the eumenorrhoeic athletes; this difference was highly significant (p = 0.0002). Mean trabecular bone mineral density was 21 mg/cm3 (1 to 41 mg/cm3) lower in the non-rowers than the rowers; this was also significant (p = 0.05). There was no interaction between these two effects (p = 0.28). CONCLUSION--The effect of intensive exercise on the lumbar spine partially compensates for the adverse effect of amenorrhoea on spinal trabecular bone density. 
4	Nd:YAG laser with sapphire tip combined with balloon angioplasty in peripheral arterial occlusions. Long-term results In 167 patients with complete occlusion (greater than 3 cm) of the femoropopliteal artery, percutaneous transluminal laser angioplasty (PTLA) was performed after an unsuccessful attempt at crossing with a guide wire and was immediately followed by balloon dilatation. An Nd-YAG laser and an optical fiber delivery system with a sapphire tip serving as a contact probe were used for PTLA. In 132 of 167 (79%) patients, the occluded segment was successfully reopened. Clinical symptoms improved in 126 of 167 (75%) patients. PTLA was unsuccessful in 35 patients, and in 15 of these, injury of the vessel wall occurred. In one patient, surgical drainage of a large hematoma became necessary. All patients in whom recanalization had been achieved were randomized to receive long-term treatment with either phenprocumarol or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) plus dipyridamole to prevent rethrombosis. At 36 months of follow-up, the cumulative patency rate (CPR) was 63%. A complete reobstruction in 32 patients (24%) and a partial reobstruction in 15 patients (11%) were found angiographically. The CPR after 36 months was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in patients younger than 60 years of age (54%) than in patients older than 60 (68%); it was also significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in patients with reduced peripheral runoff (55%) due to obstructed arteries of the lower leg than in patients with unaffected runoff (73%). The CPR was 65% in recanalized segments shorter than 7 cm and was 62% in recanalized segments longer than 7 cm. 
5	Pinch-off syndrome: a complication of implantable subclavian venous access devices. Implantable central venous access devices placed via the subclavian vein may become obstructed by thrombosis, impingement against a vein wall, or compression between the clavicle and first rib. The latter has been termed pinch-off syndrome (POS). Eleven patients with POS were studied, including one whose catheter had fractured and one whose catheter had fragmented. They were compared with 22 matched control patients and 100 consecutive routine clinic patients. Each catheter was graded: 0 = normal, 1 = abrupt change in course with no luminal narrowing, 2 = luminal narrowing, and 3 = complete catheter fracture. POS was present in most (eight of 11) cases within 3 weeks after placement. A grade 1 catheter was common (33%) among control subjects, but grades 2 and 3 were uncommon (1%). Catheter fracture or fragmentation was seen in two of five cases with long-term (greater than 3 weeks) pinching (grade 2 catheter). The following conclusions were reached: Grade 2 represents significant catheter compression and the potential for serious complications. Grade 1 is of uncertain clinical significance, due to its high prevalence in control subjects. 
1	Lack of prognostic value of nucleolar organizer region enumeration in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Enumeration of silver-stained nucleolar organizer regions is of limited use in grading transitional cell tumors of the bladder. We attempted in this article to establish whether or not such a technique would be helpful in predicting the prognosis of such tumors within rather than between grades. In the study population of 11 high-grade transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder, no correlation was found between clinical outcome and mean nucleolar organizer region count. 
4	Predictive value of lipoprotein (a) and other serum lipoproteins in the angiographic diagnosis of coronary artery disease. To determine the relation among lipids in predicting coronary artery disease (CAD), 213 patients undergoing diagnostic angiography for suspected CAD were prospectively studied. Twenty-one patients had normal coronary arteries and 192 had CAD in 1 to 3 arteries at arteriography with measurements obtained with digital calipers. Lipoproteins were measured and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] was also assayed in a subset of 98 patients with CAD. Statistical analysis was performed using uni- and multivariate techniques to test the association among age, gender, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, family history, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and apo B, ratio of apo A-I to apo B, and ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol, to Lp(a) and to CAD. All factors except gender, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking were univariate predictors of CAD. Multivariate predictors were, in decreasing order of significance, family history, age, HDL/total cholesterol ratio and apo B. When Lp(a) was included, multivariate predictors were age, family history, apo B and Lp(a), in that order. Lipid parameters alone showed that the HDL/total cholesterol ratio and that Lp(a) provide the best predictive tests for the detection of CAD in this referral population and may ultimately become important screening tests for CAD. 
5	Hageman factor-dependent kinin activation in burns and its theoretical relationship to postburn immunosuppression syndrome and infection. Burn injury and intradermal injection of bradykinin or histamine cause permeability changes visualized as dye-release lesions in the skin of guinea pigs injected intravenously with Evans blue dye. Antihistamine pretreatment ablates the histamine but not the effect of thermal injury or bradykinin. Bradykinin is generated via activation of Hageman factor in a two-step reaction. Steps 1 and 2 can be inhibited by corn trypsin inhibitor and soy bean trypsin inhibitors, respectively. Dye-release lesions were reduced from thermal injury and bradykinin injections when these substances were injected into the skin first. Angiotensin-converting enzyme deactivates bradykinin by degrading it. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor neutralizes angiotensin-converting enzyme. Dye-release lesions from both thermal injury and bradykinin injection were enhanced because of continued bradykinin build-up when these treatments were preceded by subcutaneous injections of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Thus bradykinin is generated in thermal injury via the Hageman factor-dependent pathway. Hageman factor sits at the apex of a series of interrelated cascade systems, all of which impinge on the animal's immune status. Uncontrolled Hagemen factor activation in thermal injury may be the link among all the events collectively known as the "post thermal injury immunosuppression syndrome.". 
3	Excipients in valproic acid syrup may cause diarrhea: a case report. A 5-year-old child receiving valproic acid syrup for seizure control developed diarrhea probably from the excipient ingredients. Each 5 mL of valproic acid syrup contains sucrose 3 g, glycerin 0.75 g, and sorbitol 0.75 g, providing daily amounts of 36, 9, and 9 g of sucrose, glycerin, and sorbitol, respectively. The diarrhea resolved when the child was switched to another valproic acid product. Clinicians should be aware of potential problems that may occur from excipient ingredients in pharmaceutical products when evaluating adverse effects of medications. 
1	Alternative therapies, 1990. An overview. The availability of alternative therapies for many health problems is a well-documented historical fact. Alternative therapies are generally understood to be those therapies outside of the usually accepted medical therapies for disease processes, such as cancer, arthritis, diabetes, psoriasis, lupus, and AIDS. Some other descriptive terms utilized include questionable, unproven, dubious, unorthodox, and unconventional. These alternative therapies vary from active involvement in promotion of one's own health (exercise, diet) to quackery. In today's society, with emphasis on self-involvement with individual health, metabolic therapies have become the most widely practiced alternative therapy. In an antiestablishment, anti-intellectual climate, with an increasingly mobile, rootless population, alternative therapies are in somewhat of a renaissance. Some confusion exists regarding clinical trials and alternative therapies in the general population and in the noninvolved health profession. Various studies indicate that from 10% to 50% of cancer patients use some alternative therapy, with national expenditures ranging as high as $10 billion annually. Better-educated patients with higher-than-average income are more likely to choose alternative therapies and are frequently supported by a physician in this choice. Most cancer patients continue under a physician's care and continue usual therapy while pursuing alternative methods. Approximately 5% of cancer patients abandon appropriate therapy and pursue potentially harmful alternative methods. A variety of sociomedical questions are brought forth by studies of the use of alternative therapies. A great need for public and professional education regarding this subject is evident. 
1	Pedunculated giant lipoma of the esophagus. A patient with a giant lipoma of the esophagus presented with progressive dysphagia and odynophagia, fever, and recurrent melena. Two years previously, when the symptoms were less pronounced, it had been misdiagnosed as achalasia. After surgical removal of the lipoma, the patient became symptom free. 
5	Dilatation in the duplex kidney: 3 unusual cases. Dilatation in the upper limb of a duplex ureter is usually secondary to obstruction and may be associated with a ureterocele. By contrast, vesicoureteric reflux is the usual cause of a dilated lower moiety ureter. We report 3 cases in which unusual or complex causes of dilatation of 1 limb of a duplex ureter were demonstrated. 
5	Cytogenetic evidence of clonality in a case of pigmented villonodular synovitis. Pigmented villonodular synovitis is an uncommon benign lesion that is characterized by diffuse synovial proliferation. Based on animal models, this lesion has been conjectured previously to be reactive in nature. In this report, the authors present the histologic and cytogenetic findings for a pigmented villonodular synovitis that was excised from the right knee of a 47-year-old man. Trisomy 7 was observed in 24 of 75 (35%) metaphases obtained from short-term culture of cells from this tumor. These findings suggest that some cases of pigmented villonodular synovitis represent clonal, neoplastic proliferations. 
5	Focal myositis. A new cause for the pediatric neck mass. Focal myositis is an inflammatory pseudotumor of skeletal muscle that may involve the head and neck. It can closely mimic either a neoplastic or infectious process. We present the case of a 7-year-old boy with a 2-week history of a painful, unilateral neck swelling, fever, and torticollis. He failed to respond to antibiotic therapy and required an open neck exploration. An incisional biopsy of the indurated, inflammatory tissue adherent to his sternocleidomastoid muscle showed focal myositis. Focal myositis is an unusual, but important possibility in the differential diagnosis of any neck mass and especially one in a child. Although its cause is unknown, it is a self-limited disease and neither excisional biopsy nor radical resection is justified. 
1	Adenotin and adenotin-like proteins coexist with adenosine receptors in mammalian tissues. The relationship of adenotin, a low-affinity adenosine-binding protein, to adenosine receptors was examined in two human tissues and two mammalian cultured cell lines. An adenosine A2 receptor exists in the membranes from platelets, PC-12 cells, and JAR cells as shown by a stimulation of adenylate cyclase related to 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) or a NECA-related increase in intracellular cAMP levels. In contrast, binding studies with tritiated NECA revealed typical adenotin-like low-affinity binding sites on the membranes from the sources studied with agonist potencies as follows: NECA greater than 2-chloroadenosine greater than R-PIA. No evidence was found of coupling to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. Solubilization of platelet and placental membranes and precipitation with polyethylene glycol separated adenotin or the adenotin-like protein from a second adenosine binding site in each tissue. The pharmacologic properties of the precipitated binding sites were compatible with an adenosine A2 receptor in platelets and an adenosine A1 receptor in placenta. Our observations indicate that adenotin-like proteins exist outside the placenta. In addition, adenotin and adenotin-like proteins coexist with the adenosine A1 or A2 receptor in a number of cells and tissues and do not couple to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein and stimulate adenylate cyclase. Therefore, adenotin is pharmacologically distinct from adenosine receptors, and its function remains to be discovered. 
2	Coccidioidomycosis during human immunodeficiency virus infection. A review of 77 patients. Through a retrospective review, we identified 77 previously unreported cases of coccidioidomycosis during HIV infection. Patients were classified into 1 of 6 categories based on their primary clinical presentation: 20 had focal pulmonary disease (Group 1), 31 had diffuse pulmonary disease (Group 2), 4 had cutaneous coccidioidomycosis (Group 3), 9 had meningitis (Group 4), 7 had extrathoracic lymph node or liver involvement (Group 5), and 6 has positive coccidioidal serology without a clinical focus of infection (Group 6). Coccidioidal serologies were positive on initial testing in 83% of the patients in whom such serologic testing was performed. Sera from 39% of patients were positive for TP antibodies while 74% had CF antibodies. Eleven of 12 seronegative patients had pulmonary disease (Group 1 or 2). Serologic results of other patients sent to a single reference laboratory were similar, with 26% positive for immunodiffusion TP antibodies and 79% positive for immunodiffusion CF antibodies. For the 77 patients in this study, the CD4-lymphocyte count was below 0.250 X 10(9) cells/L in 46 of the 55 patients who had this test performed, and a low CD4 count was significantly associated with mortality (p less than 0.01). At the time of follow-up, 32 of the 77 patients (42%) had died. There were significantly more deaths in those with diffuse pulmonary disease (Group 2) than in other groups (p less than 0.001). Amphotericin B, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole were all used as antifungal therapies. Outcome could not be related to the therapy used. Of note, 3 patients developed coccidioidomycosis while receiving ketoconazole for other conditions. 
5	Induction of transforming growth factor beta 1 resistance by the E1A oncogene requires binding to a specific set of cellular proteins. Transforming growth factors beta (TGF-beta s) are potent inhibitors of epithelial cell growth in culture and might play a similar role in vivo. Several studies have suggested that acquisition of TGF-beta resistance is an important step in epithelial tumor development. Here, we show that resistance to TGF-beta 1 growth inhibition can be induced by transformation of keratinocytes with the E1A, but not the ras, oncogene. Mutational analysis revealed that these effects closely correlate with the ability of E1A proteins to bind to the retinoblastoma gene product (p105) as well as to three other cellular proteins (p60, p107, and p300). Only partial resistance to TGF-beta 1 growth inhibition was elicited by E1A mutants that bind to a subset of proteins, whereas complete resistance was induced by E1A mutants that bind to all four proteins together. Total protection against TGF-beta growth inhibition was also induced by concomitant introduction into cells of an E1A mutant binding to the p60/p105/p107 proteins and one binding to p300. In parallel with these effects, epidermal transglutaminase, a marker of keratinocyte differentiation, was induced by TGF-beta in control but not in E1A-transformed cells. TGF-beta 1 receptor levels were only partially down-modulated by an intact E1A gene and not significantly affected by the various truncated mutants. Thus, the ability of E1A to induce TGF-beta resistance depends on its ability to bind, and presumably inactivate, several cellular proteins that may be involved in transmission of the TGF-beta signal and seem to act downstream from its receptor(s). 
1	Induction chemotherapy with a new regimen alternating cisplatin, fluorouracil with mitomycin, hydroxyurea and bleomycin in carcinomas of nasopharynx or other sites of the head and neck region. Sixty-six patients with locally advanced (Stages III and IV) carcinoma of the head and neck were treated with three cycles of induction chemotherapy, consisting of cisplatin, fluorouracil (FU) infusion, bleomycin, mitomycin, and hydroxyurea, followed by radiotherapy and/or surgery. There were 48 men and 18 women with a median age of 55 years (range, 18 to 75 years) and Karnofsky performance status of 80 (range, 40 to 90). Primary site was nasopharynx (28 patients), followed by larynx (12) and others (26). Forty-one (62%) patients were presented with Stage IV disease. The response rate to induction chemotherapy was 27% complete response, 50% partial response, 20% stable disease, and 3% progressive disease. There was no significant difference in response rate between patients with cancer of nasopharynx or other sites (P greater than 0.1). Survival was 61% at 24 months. Patients with cancer of nasopharynx had a better survival than those with other primaries (P = 0.033). Toxicities from chemotherapy included alopecia (73%), nausea/vomiting (66%), leukopenia (54%), stomatitis (36%), anemia (32%), thrombocytopenia (16%), and diarrhea (9%). Grade IV toxicity was not observed. Induction chemotherapy with this new regimen resulted in a high response rate but may not be superior to cisplatin and FU alone. It can be safely combined with radiotherapy as a potentially curative therapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy may yield survival similar to radical surgery in laryngeal and other head and neck cancers. 
1	In situ hybridization of prostate-specific antigen mRNA in human prostate. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization utilizing a 428 base pair [35S]-labelled cDNA probe from the 3' noncoding region of the PSA gene. Thirty six fresh surgical specimens were collected from patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy for carcinoma of the prostate. Quantitative analysis of the levels of PSA mRNA in both the benign and malignant tissues was performed using an IBAS 2000 Image Analysis System. The results of this study demonstrated that there is a significant decrease in the expression of PSA mRNA in the carcinoma tissue when compared to the benign epithelium. The average binding (number of silver grains/1 x 10(4) microns. 2) for 20 specimens of malignant epithelium was 475 +/- 161 and 586 +/- 140 for 16 specimens of benign epithelium (p less than 0.05). Eleven patients had both benign and malignant tissue from the same surgical specimen available for study. From these paired specimens, the PSA mRNA expression was also significantly reduced in the malignant epithelium when compared to the benign epithelium, 445 +/- 162 and 588 +/- 135 respectively (p less than 0.005). The PSA protein was detected using a monoclonal antibody to PSA with an immunohistochemical staining technique. The PSA protein expression paralleled the expression of the PSA mRNA in the majority of the tissue sections. Many of the tumor specimens showed a heterogeneous expression of PSA, whereas all of the benign epithelium had a uniform high level of PSA expression. In conclusion, PSA mRNA and protein are located only within the glandular epithelial tissue, the expression of PSA protein parallels that of the PSA mRNA, and both the PSA protein and PSA mRNA are significantly decreased in the malignant epithelium when compared to benign prostatic epithelium. 
4	Improved results with combined donor-specific transfusion (DST) and sequential therapy protocol. A combined DST-sequential CyA therapy protocol has been described that results in optimum graft survival for 1- and 2-haplotype mismatched living related donor-recipient combinations. In addition to the excellent graft survival obtained through 4 years, lower prednisone and CyA dosage levels are achieved with significantly decreased infection rates during the posttransplant period. 
2	Chronic alcoholic gastritis. Roles of alcohol and Helicobacter pylori. We assessed the relative roles of alcohol and infection with Helicobacter pylori in the pathogenesis of chronic gastritis in alcoholic patients. Helicobacter pylori was found in 14 of 18 alcoholics with dyspepsia and was associated with chronic antral gastritis. Gastric biopsy specimens were normal in four H pylori-negative alcoholics. Studies were repeated 3 to 4 weeks after controlled abstinence. There was no change in histologic findings during this period, indicating that alcohol itself was not the major causative agent. We then eliminated H pylori in 10 subjects by giving triple therapy (bismuth subsalicylate, amoxicillin, and metronidazole). Treatment for H pylori was associated with almost complete normalization of histologic findings. Four control subjects who received antacids alone showed no improvement. Dyspeptic symptoms in H pylori-positive patients significantly improved after elimination of this organism, whereas there was no change with antacid treatment. 
4	Baroreflex sensitivity and electrophysiological correlates in patients after acute myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. Several studies have identified transient disturbances of autonomic function during the acute and recovery phases of myocardial infarction, and it has recently been suggested that survivors of acute myocardial infarction with depressed vagal tone may be at increased risk of sudden or arrhythmic death. METHODS AND RESULTS. To investigate this hypothesis, parasympathetic function was assessed by arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) testing (using the phenylephrine method) and by heart rate variability (HRV) analysis from 24-hour Holter recording in 68 patients at day 7-10 after infarction. The relation between autonomic tone and markers of arrhythmic propensity, including programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) and late potentials in addition to other clinical variables, was examined. BRS for the whole group was 7.0 +/- 4.7 msec/mm Hg and was inversely correlated with age (r = 0.53, p less than 0.001) but not with left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.035, p = NS). In those patients in whom sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) was induced, BRS was significantly reduced (p = 0.001) as was HRV (p = 0.007) and left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.022). The strongest association between any variable (including HRV, BRS, late potentials, left ventricular ejection fraction, exercise testing, Q waves, and infarct site) and the induction of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was depressed BRS with a relative risk of 36.28 (95% confidence interval, 5-266). CONCLUSIONS. This study confirms that depressed BRS identifies a subgroup at high risk for arrhythmic events after myocardial infarction and that programmed ventricular stimulation may be safely limited to this group without any loss of predictive accuracy. 
1	Clinical evaluation of plasma abnormal prothrombin (des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin) in hepatobiliary malignancies and other diseases. Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), a protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) was measured in the plasma of patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma and those with various other hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. DCP levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay (E-1023), using an anti-DCP monoclonal antibody. Forty-two of the 91 patients (46.2%) with hepatocellular carcinoma had abnormally elevated levels of DCP, whereas only one of the 24 patients with hepatic cirrhosis showed a slight increase. An increase was also observed in some patients with obstructive jaundice. There was no correlation between plasma levels of DCP and those of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). In most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, plasma DCP levels normalized after curative surgical resection. Plasma DCP levels were not related to the plasma concentration of vitamin K in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Plasma DCP determination may be useful in the diagnosis and postoperative monitoring of the response of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
4	Renal dysfunction after angiography; a risk factor analysis in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Angiography is required for a detailed anatomical investigation before reconstructive surgery or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty can be performed. Although angiography is a safe procedure, it is associated with renal dysfunction, usually transient, in about 10% of the cases. This study concentrates on the evaluation of renal dysfunction induced by "conventional" (i.e. film-screen) Seldinger angiography and a consecutive series of 396 angiographic procedures have been evaluated. Induced Renal Dysfunction was defined as an increase of more than 10% in the serum creatinine after angiography. To identify "risk factors" for Induced Renal Dysfunction we have studied whether clinical and angiographical variables were associated with the occurrence of Induced Renal Dysfunction. These variables included: age, hypertension, the use of antihypertensive drugs, diabetes mellitus, technique of angiography, site of contrast injection and type and quantity of contrast medium. Induced Renal Dysfunction was found in 21 cases (5.7%) and appeared to be associated with age above 70, hypertension, administration of more than 150 ml contrast medium and the presence of renal disease prior to angiography. More than 95% of the 21 patients with dysfunction had two or more of these "risk factors". The presence of diabetes was not clearly associated with Induced Renal Dysfunction and haemodialyses was not required in any of the patients. The incidence of Induced Renal Dysfunction after angiography was 5.7% which is low but not negligible. However, renal dysfunction was always transient and never severe. Furthermore, the identification of "risk factors" allows the prompt identification of patients at risk before angiography, which may help to reduce the incidence of Induced Renal Dysfunction. 
4	Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the patient with cancer. The records of 114 cancer patients suffering cardiopulmonary arrests (CPA) during a 3-year period at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were retrospectively reviewed to identify variables predicting final outcome in these patients. Although 65.7% of the patients were successfully resuscitated, only 12 (10.5%) were discharged alive from the hospital. Median survival after discharge was 150 days. By univariate and multivariate analysis, the only variable predicting the likelihood of a patient's being discharged alive after a CPA was the performance status of the patient at the time of admission to the hospital. Thus, a patient spending more than 50% of the time in bed at the time of admission had only a 2.3% chance of being discharged alive after CPA. A thorough discussion of these findings between physicians and patients and their families is strongly recommended at the time of admission to spare cancer patients unnecessary invasive resuscitative procedures. 
3	The comportmental learning disabilities of early frontal lobe damage. Two adult patients are described who suffered bilateral prefrontal damage early in life and who subsequently came to psychiatric attention because of severely aberrant behaviour. A battery of developmental psychology paradigms (not previously used to assess neurologically impaired individuals) showed that social and moral development of these 2 patients was arrested at an immature stage. In comparison with other types of brain damage which disrupt cognitive development, frontal damage acquired early in life appears to provide the neurological substrate for a special type of learning disability in the realms of insight, foresight, social judgement, empathy, and complex reasoning. 
5	Polyneuropathy syndromes associated with serum antibodies to sulfatide and myelin-associated glycoprotein. We studied a series of 64 patients with sensory +/- motor peripheral neuropathies by comparing clinical and physiologic features to serum antibody reactivity against compounds containing sulfated carbohydrate moieties. We determined antibody reactivity by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified glycolipids and glycoproteins as antigens, and we used high-performance thin-layer chromatography and Western blotting to test the specificity of results. Twelve patients with high titers of IgM antibodies directed against the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) had sensory-motor polyneuropathies with physiologic evidence of demyelination. IgM antibody reactivity to MAG was associated with an IgM serum M protein in five patients. Eight other patients, most with sensory greater than motor polyneuropathies, had high titers of antibody reactivity to sulfatide but not of IgM to MAG. Two had an associated IgM paraprotein. None of the patients with selective serum antisulfatide activity had predominantly demyelinating features on physiologic testing. We conclude that (1) high ELISA titers of antibodies to MAG may be more common than previously suspected in patients with chronic demyelinating sensory-motor neuropathies, and (2) the presence of high titers of antisulfatide antibodies in serum may provide clues to the pathogenesis of otherwise idiopathic, axonal, predominantly sensory neuropathies. 
1	Survey of Alabama physicians' use of mammography, 1989. In early 1989 we surveyed by questionnaire Alabama primary care physicians (N = 1800) concerning their attitudes toward and use of mammography. There were 681 respondents (37.8%). The majority (83%) recommend mammograms for their patients according to the American Cancer Society guidelines and obtain baseline studies in asymptomatic women between the ages of 35 and 40 years. It appears that the cost of mammograms is decreasing in Alabama; a screening study was available for $50 or less to 34% of responding physicians. Almost one half (48%) of the physician respondents believe that more than 50% of their patients have had at least one mammogram. 
3	Microsaccadic flutter. Microsaccadic flutter is a rare symptomatic saccadic oscillation that has been reported only twice previously. Here we describe 5 patients with this disorder. The oscillation is horizontal, has a frequency of 15-30 Hz, an amplitude of 0.1-0.5 degrees, and cannot be seen with the unaided eye. It is usually not associated with any underlying neurological disorder. We hypothesize that microsaccadic flutter is due to malfunction of the brainstem omnipause neurons. 
5	The effects of epidural anesthesia on the Doppler velocimetry of umbilical and uterine arteries in normal and hypertensive patients during active term labor. To study the effects of epidural anesthesia on uterine and umbilical artery blood flow in preeclampsia, we observed 25 patients in active labor at 36 or more weeks' gestation. Seven had preeclampsia, eight had chronic hypertension, and ten had no complications. Doppler velocimetry of the uterine and umbilical arteries was performed before and after intravenous fluid loading and at 30 and 60 minutes after epidural blockade. Maternal vital signs and fetal heart rate were monitored continuously. After epidural block, mean maternal blood pressure fell significantly in all groups, but no maternal hypotension was observed. Mean maternal and fetal heart rates were unchanged. After epidural block, mean uterine artery systolic-diastolic (S-D) ratios did not change in the chronic-hypertension and normal groups, but fell significantly in the preeclamptic group to values similar to those of the normal group. Umbilical artery S-D ratios did not change in any group. In preeclamptic pregnancy, epidural anesthesia may help to reduce uterine artery vasospasm and may benefit intrapartum fetal well-being. 
4	Edge detection versus densitometry for assessing coronary stenting quantitatively. The optimal method used to analyze quantitatively the immediate angiographic results of coronary stenting in the coronary arteries has not been studied. Accordingly, minimal luminal cross-sectional area was determined by 2 methods, edge detection and densitometry, in 19 patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and then coronary stent implantation for symptomatic coronary stenoses. The correlation coefficient, 0.73 before angioplasty, decreased to 0.59 after coronary angioplasty and then increased to 0.83 after stent implantation. The mean differences between edge detection and densitometric determinations of minimal luminal cross-sectional area were 0.31 +/- 0.51 mm2 before PTCA, -0.38 +/- 1.22 mm2 after angioplasty and 0.35 +/- 0.79 mm2 after coronary stenting. It is concluded that, although the correlation and variability in the measurement of minimal luminal cross-sectional area between edge detection and densitometry deteriorate after PTCA, they are improved after stenting, probably because of smoothing of the vessel contours by the stent and remodeling of the stented segment into a more circular configuration. Therefore, in the stented coronary artery, edge detection and densitometry are equally acceptable methods of analysis. 
1	Enterogenous cyst of the cerebellopontine angle cistern: case report. A case of an enterogenous cyst located in the cerebellopontine angle cistern is presented. These cysts have usually been found in the spinal canal, and their intracranial occurrence is exceptional. In the present case, the cyst was lined histologically by a single epithelial layer of cuboidal cells with some glandular structures resembling the fundic glands of the stomach. The unusual location of the cyst and its histological features are discussed. 
4	Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass after failed femoropopliteal reconstructions. Deep femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass is a reconstructive technique occasionally applicable when more conventional attempts at revascularization of the distal portion of the leg have failed. Three such patients, in whom the anterior tibial was the only distal patent branch of the popliteal artery, had severe symptoms of arterial insufficiency. Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass was done using autogenous The distal portion of the deep femoral artery was exposed through an anteromedial distal thigh approach. The three patients have been followed up for a mean of 20.3 months, and each maintains graft patency and marked symptomatic improvement. 
4	Dynamic cardiomyoplasty in chronic Chagas' heart disease: clinicopathological data. We report a 44-year-old man with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy who underwent latissimus dorsi dynamic cardiomyoplasty and died 4 months later. The clinicopathological findings are discussed, and the literature is reviewed. 
5	Prosthetic above-knee femoropopliteal bypass for intermittent claudication. There is no consensus about the most appropriate management of the patient with intermittent claudication due to a superficial femoral artery occlusion. To evaluate the natural history of prosthetic above-knee femoropopliteal (AKFP) bypass, 200 operations for intermittent claudication were reviewed. One hundred AKFP bypasses were done with PTFE and 100 with dacron. In the 30 day postoperative period, four PTFE and three dacron grafts occluded without consequence and only one patient died. Analysis of results by the life-table method demonstrated statistically similar primary graft patency rates at five years (PTFE 65% SE +/- 6.5, dacron 57% +/- 6.2) and ten years (PTFE 31% +/- 18/9, dacron 32% +/- 13.2) (p greater than 0.10). Redo procedures (e.g., thrombectomy, angioplasty) were necessary on 21 grafts (12 PTFE, 9 dacron) and "secondary" patency rates at five years were 76% PTFE and 62% dacron; no grafts which required a redo procedure were patent at ten year follow-up. Major amputations during ten year follow-up were necessary in 16 (8%) patients; all amputations were in diabetic patients. Survival rates were 79% at five and 42% at ten years. An anticipated, the leading cause of death was cardiac related (25 patients); 28 (14%) patients underwent aortocoronary bypass during follow-up. A prosthetic AKFP bypass graft is a safe and durable operation which provides relief from the symptoms of intermittent claudication while allowing for the preservation of the saphenous vein for use later in the coronary or infrapopliteal circulations, should the need arise. These results indicate that the risk of amputation after AKFP is no greater than the natural history of untreated claudication; however, AKFP offers a significant improvement in life-style. 
5	A controlled trial of psychological treatment for the irritable bowel syndrome. One hundred two patients with irritable bowel syndrome were studied in a controlled trial of psychological treatment involving psychotherapy, relaxation, and standard medical treatment compared with standard medical treatment alone. Patients were only selected if their symptoms had not improved with standard medical treatment over the previous 6 months. At 3 months, the treatment group showed significantly greater improvement than the controls on both gastroenterologists' and patients' ratings of diarrhea and abdominal pain, but constipation changed little. Good prognostic factors included overt psychiatric symptoms and intermittent pain exacerbated by stress, whereas those with constant abdominal pain were helped little by this treatment. This study has demonstrated that psychological treatment is feasible and effective in two thirds of those patients with irritable bowel syndrome who do not respond to standard medical treatment. 
4	Successful surgical treatment of subaortic stenosis caused by an accessory mitral valve. A 22-month-old boy with subaortic stenosis was found to have relatively mature mitral valve tissue beneath the aortic valve, associated with a hypertrophic and prominent interventricular septum. This tissue caused obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract and resulted in a pressure gradient of 70 mmHg between the aorta and the left ventricle. Surgical treatment was successfully performed to excise the tissue and part of the hypertrophic ventricular septum. Results of microscopic examination of the resected specimen are shown and discussed. 
1	Social environment and social support. Research on the relevance of social support to cancer has been plentiful since the first American Cancer Society workshop on methodological issues in behavioral and psychosocial science. Nonetheless, critical shortcomings continue to characterize the attempt empirically to establish such things as the extent to which social support predicts adjustment to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Prominent among these is the failure to adequately address large elements of the social structure, such as social class and urbanization, and to investigate how they shape the well being of persons with or at risk for cancer and their caregivers. We recommend that more psychosocial research on the link between social support and cancer be conducted within populations beset by poverty and without adequate access to health care. Funding is needed for the training and maintenance of multidisciplinary and multicultural teams of researchers working within community-based organizations and hospitals serving the underserved. 
5	The long-term prognosis of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest but no inducible ventricular tachycardia. The long-term prognosis of patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest who do not have acute precipitating factors and in whom ventricular arrhythmias cannot be induced during baseline electrophysiologic testing is controversial. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term risk of recurrent sudden death and determine the clinical, angiographic, hemodynamic, and electrophysiologic predictors of recurrent cardiac arrest in such patients. Twenty-six (37%) of 71 consecutive patients with a single episode of aborted sudden death did not have inducible ventricular arrhythmias (less than 7 intraventricular responses) during baseline drug-free electrophysiologic study and they form the basis of this report. Their mean age was 54 +/- 13 (mean +/- SD) years and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.47 +/- 0.17. After a mean follow-up period of 16 months, 11 patients (42%) had a recurrent cardiac arrest (fatal in 10 patients). The actuarial incidence of recurrent cardiac arrest was 30 +/- 10% at 1 year and 55 +/- 13% at 3 years. Patients with LVEF less than or equal to 0.40 had a significantly higher occurrence of recurrent cardiac arrest than those with LVEF greater than 0.40 (p = 0.02; 1-year actuarial incidence of 57 +/- 17% versus 13 +/- 19%). Patients with recurrent sudden death had a significantly greater incidence of dilated cardiomyopathy (55% versus 7%; p = 0.02) and baseline frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs greater than 10/hr; 64% versus 17%, p = 0.036) or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (36% versus 0%; p = 0.37) than patients without these characteristics. 
1	The presence of human papillomavirus type 16 in squamous cell carcinoma of the proximal finger and reconstruction with a bilobed transposition flap. In a 71 year old white female a clinically diagnosed keratoacanthoma on the dorsum of the right third finger was removed using Mohs micrographic surgery and histologically diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma. It was shown by dot blot hybridization to have HPV type 16 DNA in the tumor. The wound was reconstructed with a bilobed transposition flap. 
2	A tongue force measurement system for the assessment of oral-phase swallowing disorders. A computer-aided measuring system using a highly sensitive beam transducer has been developed to provide a quantitative, reliable measure of tongue strength. This tool has application in both the diagnosis and treatment of dysphagic patients with oral-stage dysfunction. The device is customized to comfortably adapt to each individual. Audiovisual feedback is used to enhance subject interest and motivation. The device has proven reliable in measurements of upward and side tongue thrust in six able-bodied subjects measured during five separate sessions. It has also been used with two dysphagic patients. 
3	Comparison of symptom characteristics of indwelling ureteral catheters. The signs and symptoms produced by 4 different types of 7F double pigtail catheters, including Cook polyurethane pigtail stent, Surgitek Silitek Uropass, Cook C-Flex and Van-Tec Soft stent, were analyzed prospectively. The stents were placed in 45 men and 28 women ranging in age from 23 to 72 years old. A total of 44 catheters had a suture attached to the bladder end of the catheter, which exited from the urethral meatus to facilitate removal. The remaining 29 catheters had no suture attached. Symptoms were evaluated at 2 and 6 days after insertion and 1 week following removal of the catheter, and included urinary frequency, nocturia, hematuria, flank pain, suprapubic pain, dysuria and pain on removal of the catheter. Frequency and nocturia were evaluated in minutes, pain was graded on a subjective scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain), and dysuria and hematuria were assessed qualitatively. There were no significant differences among the 4 types of catheters in terms of frequency, nocturia, hematuria, flank pain, suprapubic pain and dysuria. In addition, there was no significant difference in urinary symptoms between catheters with and without a suture at either 2 or 6 days after insertion nor was there any difference in pain on removal of catheters with (mean 3.9) and without (mean 5.0) suture. We found that catheter composition and use of suture to facilitate removal did not significantly affect patient morbidity. 
1	Premalignant lesions and cancers of the skin in the general population: evaluation of the role of human papillomaviruses. To evaluate the role of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in the development of premalignant lesions and cancers of the skin in the general population, 314 biopsies obtained from 227 patients with benign neoplasms, premalignant lesions, and cancers of the skin and from 25 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lip were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. DNA probes specific for various cutaneous and genital HPV types were used in hybridizations conducted under nonstringent or stringent conditions. HPV DNA sequences were only detected in eight specimens obtained from six patients: HPV 34 in one case of periungual Bowen's disease, HPV 36 and an as yet uncharacterized HPV in two cases of actinic keratosis, HPV 20 in one case of basal cell carcinoma, an as yet unrecognized HPV in one case of squamous cell carcinoma, and HPV 16 in one case of squamous cell carcinoma of the lip. None of the specimens of cutaneous horn and keratoacanthoma contained detectable HPV DNA. In contrast, HPV DNA sequences, mostly HPV 16, were detected in 13 of 23 cases of anogenital Bowen's disease and invasive Bowen's carcinoma. HPV DNA sequences were not detected in 90 cutaneous samples further analyzed by the polymerase chain-reaction technique, using amplification primers that contain conserved sequences among the genomes of HPV. These results strongly suggest that the known HPV types play only a minor role, if any, in skin carcinogenesis in the general population. 
3	Corticosteroid-responsive dominantly inherited neuropathy in childhood. We describe three children with corticosteroid-responsive inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy from families with dominantly inherited neuropathy. There were atypical clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic characteristics that suggested a coexistent inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy and that should alert the clinician to the possibility of an associated acquired, potentially treatable disorder. 
5	Axial rotation of the lumbar spine and the effect of flexion. An in vitro and in vivo biomechanical study. A series of experiments were performed on eight whole, cadaveric lumbar spines and on eight male volunteers to determine whether axial rotation changed with subjects bending forward compared with being in a neutral posture and whether rotation was affected by articular tropism. Kirschner wires were inserted into the spinous processes of the eight cadaveric lumbar spines, and the axial rotation of the wires was measured while the spine was rotated in a torsion apparatus. Similarly, Steinmann pins were inserted into the spinous processes of L3, L4, and L5 of the eight volunteers, and the axial rotation of the pins was measured while the subjects rotated in a torsion apparatus. Axial rotation was found to be less when combined with forward flexion, and articular tropism did not influence the amplitude of rotation. 
1	Studies evaluating antioxidants and beta-carotene as chemopreventives. Cancer chemoprevention research takes leads from epidemiologic and laboratory research and develops them through in vitro and in vivo preclinical research and initial human studies into randomized controlled clinical trials. At present, the chemoprevention program is sponsoring 21 human efficacy studies. These trials are testing the potential of agents (beta-carotene, folic acid, 13-cis retinoic acid, 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide, vitamins C and E, and minerals) as inhibitors of a variety of cancers in humans (colon, lung, esophagus, cervix, bladder, and skin). Endpoints in these studies include overall incidence of cancer, incidence of specific cancers, rate of regression or progression of preneoplastic changes, and changes in cellular or biochemical parameters. Study participants include volunteers from the general population; populations at high risk for cancer because of occupation, lifestyle, or place of residence; persons with previously treated cancers; and persons with preneoplastic lesions. Study designs include single agent randomization, combination of agents and complete factorial designs. 
1	Catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy in multiple endocrine neoplasia. A histologic, ultrastructural, and biochemical study. A catecholamine-induced dilated cardiomyopathy is reported in a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 3. A histologic and ultrastructural study has been undertaken in cardiac biopsy samples, together with determination of myocardial Ca++ and cellular membrane fatty acids. Contraction band necrosis of cardiocytes with supercontraction of sarcomeres progressing to myofibrolysis and increased levels of myocardial Ca++ have been found as morphologic and biochemical abnormalities, respectively. No lipoperoxidation of cellular membranes or an alpha-adrenergic mediated reduction of coronary supply could be recognized in the study. We indicate a receptor-mediated intracellular Ca++ overload as the main abnormality responsible for myocardial impairment. 
2	Pharynx: value of oblique projections for radiographic examination. The utility of oblique views for augmenting standard posteroanterior and lateral double-contrast radiography of the pharynx was examined. Over an 8-month period, two oblique views were added to the standard posteroanterior and lateral views of the pharynx during routine upper gastrointestinal studies in 102 patients divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 81 patients without suspected pharyngeal or esophageal disease who demonstrated what was considered to be normal anatomy on all radiographic views. Group 2 consisted of 21 patients who were known or suspected to have pathologic abnormality of the pharynx. The members of this latter group each demonstrated various abnormal pharyngeal anatomy on the standard views. In just over half of these cases the oblique projection contributed significant information not obtained with conventional views. Therefore, the authors conclude that oblique images are a beneficial addition to the diagnostic evaluation of patients highly suspected of having pharyngeal disease. 
1	The pathology of nonpalpable breast cancer. A principal goal of mammographic screening is the early detection of breast cancer. We reviewed records of 125 women who were referred because of nonpalpable, suspicious abnormalities on mammogram, which subsequently proved to be cancer, requiring mammographic localization biopsy and subsequent surgery for therapy. We found that 72 (57.6%) had invasive tumors, 15 (12%) showed evidence of microinvasion and 38 (30.4%) were noninvasive. A total of 115 patients had lymphadenectomy as part of their definitive surgery. Nine (12.7%) of the patients with infiltrating tumors had between one and 10 malignant nodes on histologic section. None of the patients with noninvasive or microinvasive tumors were found to have involved nodes. The mammographic abnormalities which led to biopsy in our series were: calcifications in 74 (59.2%) patients, mass lesions in 39 (31.2%), mass lesions with calcifications in 11 (8.8%), and asymmetry in one (0.8%). Of the nine patients with nodal metastases, seven (77.8%) had a mass with or without calcifications as the indication for biopsy. Increasing tumor size was found to correlate with invasive tumors on histopathologic examination and the incidence of lymph node metastases. Thirty-seven (54.4%) of the patients with infiltrating tumors had a tumor size greater than 1 cm. Further, seven (77.8%) of the nine lymph node positive patients had tumors between 1 and 3 cm in size. Of note, however, is that two (22.2%) patients with microscopic tumors had involved nodes. The 4-year actuarial survival in patients with infiltrating tumors was 85.2 per cent, while that for patients with noninvasive or microinvasive tumors was 100 per cent (median follow-up of 20 months). 
5	Surgery or radiation for early cervical cancer. In summary, neither radiation nor surgery is clearly superior. The benefits of surgery include: 1) emotional satisfaction that the tumor has been removed, 2) accuracy of surgical staging, 3) preservation of the ovaries, 4) no secondary uterine cancer (a very uncommon problem), and 5) complications that are more readily correctable. Radiation offers the major advantages of being useful in most patients regardless of age or medical condition and is the choice for large cancers. Because stage IB cervical cancer is a very diverse pathological entity with a number of potential prognostic factors (including cell type, depth of invasion, tumor volume, lymphatic space involvement, and occult lymph node metastases), and because patients present with a number of other conditions (including excess weight, advanced age, prior pelvic surgery or infection, and severe medical illness), we are fortunate to have two good methods for treating cervical cancer. Prospective randomized studies will be necessary in the future to better define specific advantages in the various clinical settings. But, in general, the following have proven most expedient: 1) class I hysterectomy, for microinvasive cancer of 3 mm invasion or less without lymphatic space involvement, 2) modified, extended hysterectomy (class II) and pelvic lymphadenectomy for lesions of 3 mm and lymph vascular space involvement or when the lesion seems to just exceed 3 mm and for very early adenocarcinoma, 3) an extended hysterectomy (class III) and pelvic lymphadenectomy for larger IA2, IB, and IIA lesions that are less than 4 cm, particularly for the pregnant or younger patient, and when ovarian conservation is desired, 4) radiation therapy is used for lesions over 4 cm and for women with severe medical illness making extended hysterectomy too hazardous, 5) combination therapy and chemotherapy are now reserved for study in poor prognosis patients with very large lesions (greater than 6 cm), occult metastases, and unfavorable histologic criteria (Table 2). 
1	Misinterpretation of the upper parathyroid adenoma on thallium-201/technetium-99m subtraction scintigraphy. Pre-operative thallium-technetium subtraction scintigraphy of 50 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, which was subsequently proven on histology to be due to an adenoma, was compared with operative findings. Six scans were negative and seven uninterpretable. Of the remaining 37 patients, 34 had correct scan prediction of the anatomical locations of the adenomas. On examination of the origins of the adenomas, all six scintigraphic predictions of upper adenomas corresponded to tumours arising from the upper gland found at operation. Of the 25 lower predictions, there was one false positive and 16 were correct, i.e. of lower gland origin, but eight were found to originate from the upper gland. This misinterpretation is though to be due to the prolapse of an adenoma arising from the upper gland towards the lower pole of the thyroid, thereby mimicking a lower lesion on the scan. 
2	Role of laparoscopy in the evaluation of patients with suspected hepatic or peritoneal malignancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of laparoscopy in patients with suspected hepatic or peritoneal malignancy and a normal computerized tomograph (CT). Twenty-five consecutive patients with a normal liver and no peritoneal lesions on CT were evaluated. Patients with a documented primary neoplasm or a positive ascitic fluid cytology were excluded. At laparoscopy, malignancy was documented by biopsy in 12 patients for an incidence of 48%. Of the patients with exudative ascites, 75% had peritoneal metastases. In addition seven patients had benign liver disease documented by laparoscopic biopsy. Liver enzymes were not helpful in distinguishing benign and malignant disease in this group of patients. This study indicates that a negative CT does not exclude liver or peritoneal malignancy. Laparoscopy has a significant yield in patients with a negative CT suspected of having hepatic or peritoneal malignancy and is the procedure of choice in evaluating these patients. 
5	Posthypoxic glucose supplement reduces hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in the neonatal rat. We evaluated the effect of posthypoxic glucose supplement in a neonatal hypoxic-ischemic animal model. Seven-day-old rats underwent bilateral ligation of the carotid arteries, followed by exposure to an 8% oxygen atmosphere for 1 hour. The extent of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage was assessed histologically 72 hours later. Glucose load immediately after the end of the hypoxic exposure reduced the volume of neocortical infarction to 37% of the unsupplemented value, and attenuated ischemic damage in the striatum and the dentate gyrus. At the end of the hypoxic exposure, the brain level of glucose was 0.3 mmol/kg and the level of lactate 9 mmol/kg. Glucose supplement produced a rapid rise in brain glucose level to 3 to 5 mmol/kg over the next 2 hours. Lactate in both brain and plasma gradually fell toward the baseline level during the first hour of recovery. Posthypoxic glucose supplement slightly retarded lactate restitution. At any period of this neonatal model, brain lactate levels did not exceed the toxic level, which is postulated to be responsible for cerebral infarction in adult ischemic models. These results illustrate the important role of glucose in the development of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and the fact that full cortical infarction can develop even if brain lactate levels are low. 
4	Modification of atrioventricular node transmission properties by intraoperative neodymium-YAG laser photocoagulation in dogs. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd-YAG) laser photocoagulation of the atrioventricular (AV) node to control the ventricular rate during rapid atrial rhythms without creating AV block. In 12 dogs on normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, short laser pulses were delivered to an area between the coronary sinus orifice and the site of the most proximally recorded His deflection until second degree AV block occurred at a paced atrial rate of 200 beats/min. Long-term effects on AV node function were followed up for 3 months. Three animals developed chronic high grade AV block. In nine animals with preserved 1:1 conduction, the mean (+/- SEM) critical atrial cycle length resulting in AV node Wenckebach periodicity increased from 183 +/- 6 to 261 +/- 24 ms (+43%), the mean RR interval during induced atrial fibrillation increased from 248 +/- 14 to 330 +/- 27 ms (+32%) and the shortest RR interval during atrial fibrillation increased from 215 +/- 11 to 275 +/- 20 ms (+28%). Laser effects were not reversed by isoproterenol infusion. Histologic examination of the irradiated area showed fibrotic changes in the AV node and fatty metamorphosis. This study suggests that 1) graded Nd-YAG laser photocoagulation of the AV node region in dogs results in long-term modification of anterograde AV node transmission properties; 2) 1:1 conduction during sinus rhythm usually remains preserved, but ventricular rate during rapid atrial rhythms is chronically reduced; and 3) progression to high grade AV block occurs in a minority of animals. 
3	New approaches in the rehabilitation of the traumatic high level quadriplegic. The use of noninvasive alternatives to tracheostomy for ventilatory support have been described in the patient management of various neuromuscular disorders. The use of these techniques for patients with traumatic high level quadriplegia, however, is hampered by the resort to tracheostomy in the acute hospital setting. Twenty traumatic high level quadriplegic patients on intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) via tracheostomy with little or no ability for unassisted breathing were converted to noninvasive ventilatory support methods and had their tracheostomy sites closed. Four additional patients were ventilated by noninvasive methods without tracheostomy. These methods included the use of body ventilators and the noninvasive intermittent positive airway pressure alternatives of IPPV via the mouth, nose, or custom acrylic strapless oral-nasal interface (SONI). Overnight end-tidal pCO2 studies and monitoring of oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) were used to adjust ventilator volumes and to document effective ventilation during sleep. No significant complications have resulted from the use of these methods over a period of 45 patient-years. Elimination of the tracheostomy permitted significant free time by glossopharyngeal breathing for four patients, two of whom had no measurable vital capacity. We conclude that noninvasive ventilatory support alternatives can be effective and deserve further study in this patient population. 
3	Resistance to atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade in patients with intractable seizure disorders treated with anticonvulsants. Previous studies have demonstrated that, with the exception of atracurium, resistance to the neuromuscular blocking effects of various muscle relaxants develops in patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy. We studied the effects of 0.5 mg/kg IV atracurium in 53 neurosurgical patients: 21 nonepileptic patients receiving no anticonvulsant therapy (MED = 0); 14 epileptic patients treated with carbamazepine for years (MED = 1); and 18 epileptic patients treated with carbamazepine plus either phenytoin or valproic acid for years (MED = 2). The evoked compound electromyogram of the adductor pollicis brevis was recorded, and results were analyzed using analysis of covariance, with weight and age as covariables. The onset time was not significantly different among the three groups. Times for recovery of baseline and train-of-four responses to stimuli were significantly shorter in the MED = 1 and MED = 2 groups than in control patients (MED = 0). The recovery index (time between 25% and 75% recovery of baseline electromyogram values) was progressively shorter in the three groups (MED = 0: 8.02 min; MED = 1: 5.93 min; MED = 2: 1.96 min; P less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that atracurium, when used on epileptic patients requiring long-term (that is, years of) anticonvulsant therapy, has a shorter duration of action than when used in nonepileptic patients. 
1	Is local recurrence of minor importance for metastases in soft tissue sarcoma? The authors analyzed the relationship between treatment, local recurrence, and metastases in a population-based series of 375 patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and the trunk wall. Treatment was inadequate (marginal excision alone) in 107 patients, local recurrence occurred in 112, and 128 patients developed metastases. Local recurrence was 3.5 times more common after inadequate treatment than after adequate and 2.5 times more common in patients with metastases than in those without. However, metastases were only 1.2 times more common after inadequate treatment than after adequate. Of the 128 patients who developed metastases, 63 had local recurrence and 65 had not. In these two subgroups the timing of metastases and the distribution of clinicopathologic factors--age, sex, tumor size, localization, depth, histotype, and malignancy grade--were similar. These findings indicate that local recurrence is of minor importance for development of metastases in soft tissue sarcoma. The increased local recurrence rate in metastatic tumors may be an expression of the aggressiveness of the primary tumor; highly malignant tumors combine a potential both for local and distant spread. 
1	Macrophage colony-stimulating factor activity in malignant pleural effusions. Its augmentation by intrapleural interleukin-2 infusions. The activity of endogenous colony-stimulating factor (CSF) in malignant pleural effusions of lung cancer patients before and during daily intrapleural infusions of recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) was measured quantitatively by colony-forming bioassay and radioimmunoassay (RIA). Before therapy, malignant pleural effusions had various levels of CSF activities, and this CSF activity was neutralized almost completely by anti-M-CSF antibody. RIA also showed that the effusions contained various amounts of M-CSF. Daily intrapleural infusion of recombinant IL-2 caused significant increase in the CSF activities and M-CSF levels in pleural effusions. These results indicate that in vivo treatment with IL-2 induces production of endogenous M-CSF. 
1	Ki-B5: a monoclonal antibody unrelated to CD45 recognizes normal and neoplastic human B cells in routine paraffin sections. In the search for immunoreagents appropriate for the histopathologic diagnosis of malignant B-cell lymphomas in routinely processed paraffin sections, a new monoclonal antibody, Ki-B5, was generated using a high-grade B-cell lymphoma as the immunogene. Ki-B5 is a mouse IgG1/kappa that recognizes five protein fractions of about 84, 82, 55, 48, and 27 Kd after biosynthetic radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation. Protein fractions with the molecular weights of approximately 84 and 82 Kd were expressed on the cell surface and show that Ki-B5 is probably unrelated to CD45. It was possible through electron microscopy to visualize the membrane-bound portion of Ki-B5. Extensive immunohistologic studies on normal human tissue and various neoplasias demonstrated the high specificity of Ki-B5 to normal human B cells and a minor subgroup of plasma cells. Except for ML-2, which is a myelomonocytic human cell line, Ki-B5 exclusively recognized the B-cell lineage, including EB-3, BALL-1, and NALM-1. All carcinomas, sarcomas, and malignant melanomas tested with Ki-B5 were negative. Although normal granulocytes and monocytes were constantly negative, three of eight myelomonocytic leukemias coreacted with this antibody. Eight of the 57 T-cell lymphomas studied were positive to Ki-B5. Five were classified as lymphoblastic, two represented T8-CLL, and one was classified as immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Only 3 of 126 cases of B-cell lymphoma, including rare types not considered in the current classifications, were negative to Ki-B5. Plasmacytomas were also negative, except for one case. Irrespective of the cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma and plasmacytoma, Ki-B5 represents a new monoclonal antibody appropriate for the diagnosis and immunophenotyping of malignant lymphomas in routinely processed paraffin sections. 
3	Headache. Public health problem. Headache is, and apparently always has been, a frequent pain syndrome. It is reported in American and Western European societies in very high percentages of the population. Headache, and specifically severe headache, have also been reported as prevalent from a variety of societies worldwide, although prevalence rates have varied (they are very low, for example, in the People's Republic of China). Whether prevalence varies with different socioeconomic groups remains uncertain. Severe headache and specifically migraine is, for reasons still unknown, much more common in women, and, in most studies, is reported to decrease in prevalence in older age groups. Positive family histories are common, but the precise role of genetics is unknown. A major problem in the epidemiologic studies remains the difficulty of uniform definition of headache syndromes. 
4	Ventricular load optimization by unloading therapy in patients with heart failure. The effects of unloading a depressed heart were assessed in terms of optimal coupling between the ventricle and arterial system. To assess the effects of preload on ventricular load coupling, preload was reduced with a lower body negative pressure of -20 mm Hg. Nitroprusside was used to evaluate the effects of afterload on the coupling under the condition that preload reduction was comparable to that with lower body negative pressure. In 13 patients with heart failure (ejection fraction 32 +/- 3%, mean +/- SE), direct arterial pressure was simultaneously recorded with the left ventricular echocardiogram as the pressure was elevated by phenylephrine. Left ventricular contractile properties were defined by the slope (Ees) of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation. The effective arterial elastance (Ea) was expressed by the slope of the end-systolic pressure-stroke volume relation. Left ventricular external work, end-systolic potential energy and work efficiency, defined as external work per pressure volume area (external work + potential energy), were determined. Baseline ventricular load coupling in these patients was characterized by an increase in the ratio of arterial elastance to ventricular elastance (Ea/Ees) (1.96 +/- 0.31). This ratio decreased significantly, to 1.45 +/- 0.22, with nitroprusside, and increased to 2.37 +/- 0.34 with lower body negative pressure. Therefore, end-systolic potential energy was decreased by nitroprusside but was unaltered by lower body negative pressure while external work was comparably decreased by both manipulations, indicating that work efficiency was significantly augmented with nitroprusside but declined with lower body negative pressure. 
2	Serial prothrombin time as prognostic indicator in paracetamol induced fulminant hepatic failure. OBJECTIVE--To find out whether changes in the daily prothrombin time are of prognostic importance in patients with paracetamol induced fulminant hepatic failure. DESIGN--Retrospective study. SETTING--The Liver Unit, King's College Hospital, London. PATIENTS--150 Consecutive patients with paracetamol induced fulminant hepatic failure admitted between October 1986 and February 1989. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death. RESULTS--Of the 150 patients, 72 (48%) died. In all, 34 of the 37 (92%) patients with a peak prothrombin time of greater than or equal to 180 seconds died as did 20 of the 41 (49%) with a time of 130-179 seconds, nine of the 25 (36%) with a time of 90-129 seconds, and nine of the 47 (19%) with a time of less than 90 seconds. Of the 42 patients with a continuing rise in prothrombin time between days 3 and 4 after overdose, 39 died (93%) compared with 21 of the 96 (22%) in whom the prothrombin time fell. CONCLUSIONS--These data indicate that a continued increase in prothrombin time on day 4 after overdose and a peak prothrombin time of greater than or equal to 180 seconds identify at an early stage those patients with a less than 8% chance of survival. Liver transplantation should be considered in patients meeting either of these criteria. 
2	Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli elaborate a heat-stable enterotoxin demonstrable in an in vitro rabbit intestinal model. Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) have been associated with persistent diarrhea in young children, but little is known about its pathogenesis. We assayed for enterotoxic activity in culture filtrates (CF) of EAggEC strains in Ussing chambers mounted with rabbit ileal mucosa. CF from strain 17-2, a prototype Chilean EAggEC strain, caused a greater rise in potential difference and short circuit current (SCC) than that seen in HB101 control, and this effect was abolished by protease pretreatment and partially stable after heat treatment. Ultrafiltration of 17-2 CF preparations localized the active moiety to the 2-5 kD Mr size range. CF from HB101 transformed with the 17-2 plasmid showed Ussing chamber activity. less than 10-kD CF fractions from five of six other EAggEC strains screened in Ussing chambers gave SCC responses of similar magnitude to 17-2. The 17-2 CF activity was not neutralized after pretreatment with polyclonal anti-STa antibody. Additionally, all of the seven EAggEC strains studied were nonreactive by heat-stable enterotoxin variant STa ELISA, were negative in the suckling mouse assay, and failed to hybridize with heat-stable enterotoxin variant STh and STp DNA probes. In summary, our data indicate that 17-2 produces a low molecular weight, partially heat-stable, protease-sensitive enterotoxin which appears to be plasmid associated, and genetically and immunologically distinct from E. coli STa. Preliminary screening suggests that this tox+ phenotype may be common among EAggEC. 
1	Carcinoma of female urethra. Manitoba experience: 1958-1987. Fourteen female patients with primary urethral carcinoma were treated at the Manitoba Cancer Foundation in the last twenty-nine years. The relationship of natural history to the stage, location, and therapeutic modality has been reviewed. A higher stage and length of urethral involvement affected prognosis negatively, whereas lower stage had a positive prognostic effect and location of tumor had no prognostic influence. Two patients with Stage C, who failed to received inguinal node radiotherapy, died of disease recurring in the inguinal area. Patients who received inguinal radiation (3 patients Stages B, C, and D1) had no regional recurrence. It is suggested that, for all female urethral carcinoma, bilateral ilioinguinal nodes be included in the radiation field. For radical treatment, iridium 192 insertion in combination with external beam treatment is recommended. 
2	Bile acids in human plasma interfere with cholecystokinin bioassay using dispersed pancreatic acini. A bioassay using dispersed pancreatic acini was used to measure fasting plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations in 105 patients with various kinds of gastrointestinal diseases, 17 patients with diabetes mellitus, and 6 healthy volunteers. High plasma CCK bioactivities were observed in patients with obstructive jaundice, choledocolithiasis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. Twenty-three samples with high CCK bioactivities were assayed by the same bioassay after the addition of a specific CCK antagonist and by a CCK radioimmunoassay in order to determine whether the high CCK-like bioactivity was due to circulating CCK or other factors. High CCK bioactivities were partially inhibited by the specific CCK antagonist, CR-1409, but the activities were not totally abolished. The residual bioactivities (not inhibited by CR-1409) correlated with plasma bile acid concentrations. The inhibitable CCK bioactivities correlated with plasma CCK levels obtained by radioimmunoassay. Although the bioassay using dispersed pancreatic acini has several advantages for measuring plasma CCK, this method overestimates CCK bioactivities in patients with high plasma bile acid concentrations. 
4	Arterial vasodilator effects of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist amlodipine alone and in combination with verapamil in systemic hypertension. The arterial vasodilator properties of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist amlodipine were compared with the effects of vascular muscle cyclic guanosine monophosphate production by sodium nitroprusside and with the effects of a combined infusion of amlodipine and the nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist verapamil in 8 untreated patients with primary hypertension. Arterial vasodilation was assessed by measurement of changes of forearm blood flow by mercury in Silastic strain-gauge plethysmography during brachial artery drug infusions. Forearm blood flow increased during amlodipine infusions (0.4 to 45 micrograms/min/100 ml forearm tissue) from 2.9 +/- 1.7 to a maximum of 23.6 +/- 7.6 ml/min/100 ml (687%), while sodium nitroprusside caused an increase from 3.0 +/- 1.8 to 16.2 +/- 5.4 ml/min/100 ml (449%), attesting to the importance of transmembrane calcium influx for the maintenance of vascular tone. The addition of verapamil 40 micrograms/min/100 ml to an infusion of amlodipine 44.5 micrograms/min/100 ml resulted in a further increase of forearm blood flow, from 23.6 +/- 7.6 to 34.4 +/- 9.8 ml/min/100 ml (p less than 0.05). The precise mechanisms of this finding have yet to be elucidated but may be due to interactions of the effects of the binding of these 2 chemically and pharmacologically different calcium antagonists to distinct binding sites at calcium channels. The clinical relevance of this observation for the treatment of coronary artery disease and systemic hypertension needs further study. 
5	Teflon versus thyroplasty versus nerve transfer: a comparison. Surgical rehabilitation of the paralyzed larynx is currently performed by Teflon injection, thyroplasty, and reinnervation techniques. Proponents of the two newer techniques maintain that they are preferred to Teflon injection because superior phonatory quality is achievable. This paper was written in an attempt to dissect the issues regarding this question. Teflon remains the quickest and least expensive procedure, but further experience with stroboscopic and other voice analyses reveals that the other procedures demonstrate some superiority in phonatory quality over Teflon. In this author's hands, the nerve transfer offers the best opportunity to achieve a normal phonatory voice. In addition, it is the only one of the three procedures that leaves the vocal cord entirely undisturbed--important in the event one of the other two procedures becomes necessary. 
5	Mapping of the locus for X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria (Barth syndrome) to Xq28. X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria is clinically characterized by congenital dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, recurrent bacterial infections, and growth retardation. We analyzed linkage between the disease locus and X-chromosomal markers in a family with seven carriers, four patients, and eight unaffected sons of carriers. Highest lod scores obtained by two-point linkage analysis were 2.70 for St14.1 (DXS52, TaqI) at a recombination fraction of zero and 2.53 for cpX67 (DXS134) at a recombination fraction of zero. Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum lod score of 5.24 at the position of St35.691 (DXS305). The most distal recombination detected in this family was located between the markers II-10 (DXS466) and DX13 (DXS15). These data indicate the location of the mutated gene at Xq28. 
1	Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. Twenty-four patients underwent biopsy or resection of the liver for focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1978 to 1988. Twenty-two of the patients were women. The mean age was 35 years. A history of antecedent oral contraceptive or conjugated estrogen (Premarin) use was obtained in 18 of 21 women. There were two men, aged 26 and 37 years; neither gave a history of hormone use. Most of the tumors were solitary (22 of 24) and located in the left lobe of the liver (17 of 22). Fifteen of the patients had a prior or simultaneous malignant lesion and six had other benign tumors. Most of the tumors were resected with a wedge or subsegment of liver (13 of 24). Four patients underwent segmentectomy and five required lobectomy for removal of the tumors. Two patients had an intraoperative biopsy only. The patients in whom the tumor was diagnosed preoperatively underwent computed tomography and arteriography routinely. Scintigraphy of the liver with sulfur colloid was obtained in only three patients, despite its distinct potential for nonoperative diagnosis of FNH. 
5	Inactivation of human alpha-globin gene expression by a de novo deletion located upstream of the alpha-globin gene cluster. Synthesis of normal human hemoglobin A, alpha 2 beta 2, is based upon balanced expression of genes in the alpha-globin gene cluster on chromosome 16 and the beta-globin gene cluster on chromosome 11. Full levels of erythroid-specific activation of the beta-globin cluster depend on sequences located at a considerable distance 5' to the beta-globin gene, referred to as the locus-activating or dominant control region. The existence of an analogous element(s) upstream of the alpha-globin cluster has been suggested from observations on naturally occurring deletions and experimental studies. We have identified an individual with alpha-thalassemia in whom structurally normal alpha-globin genes have been inactivated in cis by a discrete de novo 35-kilobase deletion located approximately 30 kilobases 5' from the alpha-globin gene cluster. We conclude that this deletion inactivates expression of the alpha-globin genes by removing one or more of the previously identified upstream regulatory sequences that are critical to expression of the alpha-globin genes. 
4	Maternal and uteroplacental hemodynamic effects of chronic captopril in the hypertensive, term-pregnant rat. The chronic effects of captopril on maternal hemodynamics and organ perfusion were investigated in 10 untreated and 10 captopril-treated pregnant spontaneously hypertensive rats by means of the radioactive-labeled microsphere technique. The normal decrease in blood pressure during gestation was prevented by reduction of litter size to two conceptuses on day 7 of gestation. Captopril (approximately 10 mg/kg/day) or drug vehicle (50% ethyl alcohol) was administered intraperitoneally by an osmotic pump from day 7 to 21. At term mean arterial pressure was 23% lower in the captopril-treated group as the result of a 29% decrease in total peripheral resistance without a significant change in cardiac output. The decrease in total peripheral resistance was primarily caused by a decline in splanchnic and skin resistances. Maternal organ and uteroplacental perfusion were not significantly altered. We conclude that administration of captopril during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy in the hypertensive rat effectively lowers maternal blood pressure without adverse effects on organ and uteroplacental perfusion. 
4	Critical care transportation medicine: new concepts in pretransport stabilization of the critically ill patient. Regionalization of health care for trauma has become commonplace, and the same concept for critically ill medical/surgical patients is developing. Recent evidence suggests that current stabilization measures used by transport teams can be inadequate for this critically ill patient population. In trauma, speed has been considered a necessity to get the patient to a facility which cannot be carried out to the field, eg, an operating room. For acute medical illnesses, critical care transport teams can bring intensive care technology to the patient. Accumulating evidence supports the premise that speed of transport is not as important as stabilization before transport, knowledge of hemodynamics during transport, and early use of critical care monitoring systems. Other reports identify the need for initial evaluation and stabilization of critically ill patients by physicians at the critical care level of expertise. Accordingly, critical care transportation teams have evolved, creating new notions of pretransport stabilization not applicable to previous transport systems. 
4	Coronary artery pattern and outcome of arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries. A successful outcome of an arterial switch operation (ASO) for dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) depends in large part on the transfer of the coronary arteries to the neoaorta without distortion or narrowing. However, the origins and distribution of the coronary arteries are quite variable in D-TGA; therefore, the entire experience with ASO at the Children's Hospital in Boston was reviewed. From 1983 through November 1989, 314 patients underwent surgery for D-TGA with the intent to perform an ASO. An ASO was actually performed in 290 patients, and 20 patients died, with 12 deaths (4.2%) clearly related to problems with the coronary arteries (CA deaths). The ASO was aborted to a Senning operation in 24 patients (7.6%), primarily due to coronary anatomy. Eight coronary patterns were identified and related to the outcome of the ASO. In 182 patients with the "usual" coronary pattern for D-TGA (i.e., anterior descending and circumflex arteries from the left sinus and right coronary artery from the right sinus), five CA deaths occurred, and two patients had Senning operations. Sixty-seven patients had right coronary and circumflex arteries from the right sinus and anterior descending arteries from the left sinus. Three CA deaths occurred, and one patient had a Senning operation. Single right coronary artery was found in 14; 12 had ASOs with three CA deaths (25%); and two had Senning operations. One late death was due to diffuse narrowing of the single right coronary artery. Single left coronary artery occurred in 11 patients, and seven had ASO with no early but one late "sudden" death, whereas four had Senning operations. 
5	Recurrent subacute torsion: prospective study of effects on testicular morphology and function. A prospective study was done on 43 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of recurrent subacute testicular torsion. All patients underwent full examination, hormonal assays and seminal fluid analysis before scrotal exploration, bilateral testicular biopsy and fixation. Seminal fluid analysis and hormonal assays were repeated 3 months postoperatively. Of the patients 36 were cured of recurrent pain, 35 of whom had a horizontally lying testis. No hormonal abnormalities were found preoperatively or postoperatively. Three patients had abnormal seminal fluid analysis. Testicular biopsies, including Johnsen scores, were abnormal in these 3 patients and normal in the other 33. It is concluded that patients with recurrent subacute torsion can be identified accurately and treated satisfactorily. There is little evidence that these patients suffer testicular damage as a result of this subacute torsion or that any pre-existing cellular abnormality exists to explain the oligospermia that frequently is seen in patients who have acute testicular torsion. 
5	Ichthyosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, growth retardation, and metaphyseal dysplasia (Shwachman syndrome). Report of a case with extensive skin lesions (clinical, histological, and ultrastructural findings). The Shwachman syndrome comprises exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, growth retardation, and bone marrow hypoplasia resulting in neutropenia. Clinical, morphological, and ultrastructural studies, as well as hair analysis, were performed in a patient with Shwachman's syndrome and severe ichthyosis. Clinical findings were lamellar ichthyosiform desquamation on the extremities. The hair was scanty and short on the scalp, in the eyelashes, and in the eyebrows. The nails were hyperkeratotic. Morphologic findings were slight, regular acanthosis and severe diffuse hyperkeratosis with variable parakeratosis. The granular layer was thickened. The papillary dermis showed very slight perivascular lymphocyte infiltration. The most prominent ultrastructural finding was the presence of solitary or multiple droplets of varying size in the cytoplasm of the keratinocytes. Hair analysis revealed no abnormalities; the cystine concentration in hair specimens was normal. 
5	Hypersensitivity reactions to epipodophyllotoxins in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of hypersensitivity reactions to teniposide (VM-26), etoposide (VP-16), or both were determined in 108 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with a contemporary regimen of intensive multiagent chemotherapy. Fifty (46%) of the 108 patients had one or more hypersensitivity reactions. The risk of any child having an initial reaction over the cumulative dose range studied was 52% (95% confidence limits, 41% and 63%) for VM-26, compared with 34% (95% confidence limits, 24% and 44%) for VP-16. The risk of having an initial reaction to VM-26 or VP-16 was clearly related to the cumulative dose. This risk peaked at 1500 to 2000 mg/m2 for VM-26 and at 2000-3000 mg/m2 for VP-16. All reactions were Type 1 reactions according to the Gell and Coombs classification, characterized by urticaria, angioedema, flushing, rashes, or hypotension, and 86% of reactions were of Grade 1 or 2 severity according to standard criteria. There was no evidence of increasing clinical severity on repeated rechallenge with premedication, and no deaths occurred. The findings suggested that hypersensitivity reactions to epipodophyllotoxins in children with ALL are more common than previously reported, but only rarely constitute dose-limiting toxicity. 
1	Ultrasonographic assessment of placental abnormalities. Current ultrasonographic techniques offer a novel approach for the identification of a wide variety of placental abnormalities usually described postnatally by the pathologist. Placental vascular lesions, placental tumors, and abnormal placentation are potentially associated with perinatal complications and their diagnosis in utero may influence the pregnancy management. An ultrasonographic classification of placental lesions that is based on their location, size, echogenicity, and number is proposed. Repeated ultrasonographic examination, together with biologic investigations, is important for the prenatal differential diagnosis of most these lesions and for full understanding of their pathophysiologic characteristics and significance. 
5	Morphological and histopathological aspects of aneurysms after patch aortoplasty for coarctation. Repair of coarctation of the aorta by synthetic patch grafting has been complicated by late aneurysm formation. These aneurysms differ macroscopically from atherosclerotic thoracic aortic dilatations. Specimens for microscopic examination were taken from 14 of 20 patients undergoing aneurysm resection. Histological analysis of the specimens showed medionecrosis in 13 patients of the specimens showed medionecrosis in 13 patients (93%), foreign body reaction in 11 patients (78%), and intimal thickening in 3 patients (21%). The three layers of the aortic wall could be identified in the aneurysms. On the basis of these results, we discuss the etiologic factors and pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of these aneurysms. 
2	The effect of long-acting somatostatin analogue on enzyme changes after endoscopic pancreatography. The effect of the long-acting somatostatin analogue, octreotide acetate (Sandostatin) on enzyme elevation after endoscopic pancreatography was studied in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. Sixty-three consecutive patients undergoing ERCP were randomly allocated to two group. In the control group, 34 patients received isotonic sodium-chloride, and in the treated group 29 patients received 0.1 mg of octreotide acetate subcutaneously before the pancreatography. After the endoscopy, amylase levels increased to pathological range in 15 of the controls and in 3 of the treated patients, whereas lipase levels showed a pathological rise in 17 of the controls and in 5 of the treated patients. A significant difference (p less than 0.01) was observed in the amylase and lipase changes between the two groups at 90 and 180 min after pancreatography. The enzyme levels showed at 90 min, mean +/- SD amylase: controls 540 +/- 185 units/liter, treated patients 261 +/- 108 units/liter; lipase: controls 304 +/- 98 units/liter, treated patients 198 +/- 88 units/liter. These findings suggest that the use of long-acting somatostatin analogue ameliorates the enzyme increases in the serum after endoscopic pancreatography. 
3	Dual task performance and processing resources in normal subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. In recent years, there has been a growing consensus among investigators that the presence or absence of external cues guiding behaviour and attention is an important factor in determining whether or not deficits are found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In an earlier study, the authors suggested that the pattern of impaired and intact performance could be explained in terms of differential resource demands of the tasks, combined with depleted levels of central processing resources in PD patients. Two experiments are reported, both employing dual-task paradigms. The first assessed, in normal subjects, the relative processing demands of a cued and an uncued version of the Stroop task. The results supported the proposal that the noncued task made greater demands on the subject's limited processing resources. Further, performing a resource demanding secondary task concurrently with the Stroop test produced, in normal subjects, the same pattern of impaired performance as that reported previously in PD patients. In the second experiment the same dual-task paradigm was employed with a group of PD patients and normal aged-matched controls. Only the patients showed an increase in reaction time on the Stroop task when performing a resource demanding secondary task. The patients also showed an interfering effect with concurrent foot tapping but not with an articulatory suppression task. The results were taken to support the hypothesis that PD patients have depleted central processing resources. In considering the present data, alternative explanations for the results are considered, in particular the possibility that they represent a deficit in switching processing resources between two tasks as the combined demands outweigh available resources. 
3	Treatment of fulminant hepatic failure with insulin and glucagon. A randomized, controlled trial. Insulin and glucagon are among the therapeutic modalities that have been investigated in the treatment of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). We have completed a randomized, controlled trial of insulin and glucagon in 38 patients with FHF from either viral or toxin exposure. The control and treatment groups consisted of 21 and 17 patients, respectively, and did not differ significantly in etiology or admission laboratory values. Mortality was not significantly different between control and treatment groups and was 67% and 82%, respectively. Time from randomization to death or discharge was not significantly different between the two groups. Peak levels of alpha-fetoprotein were statistically higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors (P less than 0.01). We conclude that even though a type-2 error may exist, the combination of insulin and glucagon is not useful in the treatment of FHF. 
5	Manual stretch: effect on finger movement control and force control in stroke subjects with spastic extrinsic finger flexor muscles. This study evaluated the effects of manual stretch of extrinsic finger flexor muscles on finger extension movement control and force control in 16 spastic hemiparetic subjects. These subjects were randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group. A group of able-bodied subjects also participated. A joint-movement tracking test (JMTT) quantified control of active finger extension movement at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger within the available range of active movement, and a force tracking test (FTT) quantified control of isometric finger extension force at the same joint within the subject's available force range. Electromyographic activity was monitored in the extensor digitorum and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles during both tracking tests. Manual stretch was applied to the extrinsic finger flexor muscles of the experimental group between the pretest and posttest tracking tests. The JMTT performances of both control (p less than .025) and experimental (p less than .05) groups were significantly subnormal on the pretest as were FTT performances of controls (p less than .01) and study subjects (p less than .03). The JMTT improvement on posttest was significantly greater (p less than .05) in subjects than in controls. However, the change in FTT performance was not significantly different between the two groups. Manual stretch treatment, properly applied to extrinsic finger flexor muscles, is an effective method of temporarily improving the control of finger extension movement in spastic hemiparetic subjects. 
1	Epidermoid tumors of the 4th ventricle: report of seven cases. Epidermoid tumors occur very rarely in the 4th ventricle. We discuss the history, clinical course, and the surgical results for seven patients. One patient had a remittal of symptoms, probably due to the emergence of the tumor from the 4th ventricle into the cisterna magna. Total removal of the capsule was possible only in the youngest patient. At present, four patients (mean follow-up, 6 years) enjoy good general and neurological health. 
3	Artificial urinary sphincter insertion in congenital neuropathic bladder. A series of 44 patients with neuropathic bladder dysfunction due to congenital myelodysplasia underwent implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS); in 26 patients a reconstructive procedure was performed at the same time. Five patients who initially had AUS implantation alone developed detrusor hyper-reflexia and required a clam cystoplasty. Forty patients (90%) are continent, 2 are occasionally damp and 2 are wet and awaiting further surgery; 66% of patients who underwent AUS insertion and reconstruction were found to have significant residual urine and they perform intermittent self-catheterisation (ISC). In patients with a good bladder capacity and normal compliance and detrusor hyper-reflexia controlled by anticholinergic drugs, cystoplasty is not necessary at the time of AUS insertion. 
3	Compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots. A mechanical or biological problem? Pathophysiologically, nerve root pain production is a complex issue. For many years, mechanical compression has been regarded as the sole cause for such pain. There are indications, however, that other factors, such as intraneural inflammation, may be of importance in this context. In this article, four cases are presented in which nerve root related pain gradually resolved without any proven change in the mechanical deformation of the involved nerve root. The data presented here suggest that mechanical compression, per se, may not always be the sole cause of radicular pain and dysfunction. These findings suggest that improvement is needed in our understanding of the pathophysiology of nerve root compression and inflammation. 
5	Effects of common illnesses on infants' energy intakes from breast milk and other foods during longitudinal community-based studies in Huascar (Lima), Peru. To assess the effects of common infections on dietary intake, 131 Peruvian infants were observed longitudinally. Home surveillance for illness symptoms was completed thrice weekly, and food and breast-milk consumption was measured during 1615 full-day observations. Mean (+/- SD) energy intakes on symptom-free days were 557 +/- 128 kcal/d (92.4 +/- 26.5 kcal.kg-1.d-1) for infants aged less than 181 d and 638 +/- 193 kcal/d (77.7 +/- 25.7 kcal.kg-1.d-1) for infants aged greater than 180 d. Statistical models controlling for infant age, season of the year, and individual showed significant 5-6% decreases in total energy intake during diarrhea or fever. There were no changes with illness in the frequency of breast-feeding, total suckling time, or amount of breast-milk energy consumed. By contrast, energy intake from non-breast-milk sources decreased by 20-30% during diarrhea and fever, and the small decrements in total energy consumption during illness were explained entirely by reduced consumption of non-breast-milk foods. 
4	A giant renal artery aneurysm diagnosed post partum. We report a case of a 5.8 cm. right renal artery aneurysm diagnosed intact 8 weeks post partum. Rupture of a renal arterial aneurysm during pregnancy is a rare but well described catastrophic event. There are no previous reports of an intact renal artery aneurysm diagnosed either ante partum or post partum. To our knowledge, this also represents the largest reported renal artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was repaired successfully with kidney salvage and closure of the fistulous connection to the renal vein. 
5	Respiratory input impedance in anesthetized paralyzed patients. Respiratory impedance (Zrs) was measured between 0.25 and 32 Hz in seven anesthetized and paralyzed patients by applying forced oscillation of low amplitude at the inlet of the endotracheal tube. Effective respiratory resistance (Rrs; in cmH2O.l-1.s) fell sharply from 6.2 +/- 2.1 (SD) at 0.25 Hz to 2.3 +/- 0.6 at 2 Hz. From then on, Rrs decreased slightly with frequency down to 1.5 +/- 0.5 at 32 Hz. Respiratory reactance (Xrs; in cmH2O.l-1.s) was -22.2 +/- 5.9 at 0.25 Hz and reached zero at approximately 14 Hz and 2.3 +/- 0.8 at 32 Hz. Effective respiratory elastance (Ers = -2pi x frequency x Xrs; in cmH2O/1) was 34.8 +/- 9.2 at 0.25 Hz and increased markedly with frequency up to 44.2 +/- 8.6 at 2 Hz. We interpreted Zrs data in terms of a T network mechanical model. We represented the proximal branch by central airway resistance and inertance. The shunt pathway accounted for bronchial distensibility and alveolar gas compressibility. The distal branch included a Newtonian resistance component for tissues and peripheral airways and a viscoelastic component for tissues. When the viscoelastic component was represented by a Kelvin body as in the model of Bates et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 61: 873-880, 1986), a good fit was obtained over the entire frequency range, and reasonable values of parameters were estimated. The strong frequency dependence of Rrs and Ers observed below 2 Hz in our anesthetized paralyzed patients could be mainly interpreted in terms of tissue viscoelasticity. Nevertheless, the high Ers we found with low volume excursions suggests that tissues also exhibit plasticlike properties. 
5	West syndrome associated with hyperlexia. Two patients are reported with West syndrome associated with hyperlexia. They had peculiar linguistic and psychosocial development and autistic behavior, yet began to read Japanese and Chinese characters, numbers, Roman alphabet letters, and trademark letters at 3 years of age. Neuropsychologic, electroencephalographic, and radiologic studies were performed at 11 years of age in Patient 1 and at 10 years of age in Patient 2. Although they were able to read fluently with correct intonation, their comprehension was significantly impaired. The neuropsychologic evaluation of both patients demonstrated selective, excellent ability in auditory memory in contrast to impairment of associational abilities, visual retention, and visual constructional abilities. These findings suggest that the functions in the nondominant hemisphere were also impaired. Although children with West syndrome frequently have associated mental retardation, patients with West syndrome associated with hyperlexia have never been reported. A neuropsychologic investigation of epileptic children with mental retardation is necessary for the detection of hyperlexia. 
4	IgD immune complex vasculitis in a patient with hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever. We describe a 27-year-old Dutch woman with the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome. During febrile attacks she occasionally presented with skin lesions on the distal parts of her upper and lower extremities, with the histologic picture of a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Clear perivascular deposits of IgD and C3 were presented in early lesional skin on immunofluorescence investigation. Circulating IgD immune complexes were demonstrated on several occasions, both during and in between clinical attacks. These findings are consistent with an IgD immune complex-mediated pathogenesis for the skin lesions. In 10 patients with other forms of immune complex vasculitis of the skin, minimal perivascular deposits of IgD were found in four cases. In these cases, however, IgD was never found as the solitary immunoglobulin class. 
4	Course of diabetic retinopathy following cataract surgery Five patients with mild to moderate retinopathy to both eyes underwent complication-free cataract surgery in one eye. Within three months of surgery deterioration of the retinopathy was observed in the operated eye only. In four patients there was an increase of intraretinal haemorrhages and hard exudates, accompanied by clinically significant macular oedema manifested as retinal thickening and extensive fluorescein leakage from both the macular and the peripapillary capillary networks. Of these four patients one also developed retinal ischaemia, evident ophthalmoscopically by flame-shaped haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots and angiographically by areas of capillary non-perfusion. The fifth patient showed proliferation of new blood vessels and vitreous haemorrhage. Diabetic patients scheduled for cataract surgery should undergo a thorough preoperative evaluation of any existing retinopathy. Postoperatively they should be followed up at close intervals so that any progression of retinopathy can be promptly detected and considered for laser treatment. 
5	Dexamethasone increases plasma levels of albendazole. Therapy of neurocysticercosis with cysticidal drugs is frequently complicated by the exacerbation of symptoms that follows the inflammation triggered by the acute destruction of cysticerci. Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective. However, it has been shown that dexamethasone lowers the plasma levels of praziquantel, thus reducing its cysticidal efficacy. We measured plasma levels of albendazole, another strong cysticidal drug, when dexamethasone was given simultaneously. We found that dexamethasone increased the plasma levels of albendazole by about 50% (P less than 0.002); hence, it seems that cysticercosis and the ensuing inflammation can be treated simultaneously with albendazole and dexamethasone without diminishing the efficacy of the cysticidal drug. 
1	Sensitivity of urinary quantitative immunocytology with monoclonal antibody 486 P3/12 in 241 unselected patients with bladder carcinoma. We investigated the sensitivity of quantitative immunocytology with our monoclonal antibody 486 P3/12 in 241 unselected patients with transitional cell carcinoma. Immunocytology yielded a sensitivity of 91.8%, 89.4% and 92.9% for grade 1, 2 and 3 tumors, respectively. Standard cytology was positive in 59.2%, 63.8% and 84.7%, respectively. Deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry, used in the first 69 patients, was positive in only 27.7%, 48.6% and 57.1%, respectively. 
1	Cutaneous malignant melanoma in Rochester, Minnesota: trends in incidence and survivorship, 1950 through 1985 In Rochester, Minnesota, 107 incidence cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma (in 46 male and 61 female patients) were diagnosed during the years 1950 through 1985. Overall crude incidence rates were 6.0 and 6.6 per 100,000 males and females, respectively. Evaluation of trends in 9-year periods showed that the rates increased from 3.2 to 8.9 for males (P = 0.015) and from 4.4 to 11.7 for females (P less than 0.001). Age-specific rates suggested that the highest incidence occurs in the age-groups 50 to 59 years and 70 years or older for males and 40 to 49 years and 70 years or older for females. Lesions were most common in the head and neck area among males (P = 0.044) and on the lower extremities among females (P = 0.018). The most frequent histologic type was superficial spreading melanoma (61%). Five-year survival was diminished overall for patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma--0.72 in comparison with 0.88 expected for the general population. Statistically significant risk factors for survival were depth of invasion of the lesion (Clark level), thickness of the lesion, histologic type, and age of the patient. 
2	A clinicopathologic study of the eyes in familial adenomatous polyposis with extracolonic manifestations (Gardner's syndrome). The eyes of a 51-year-old woman with familial adenomatous polyposis and extracolonic manifestations (Gardner's syndrome) were obtained postmortem and studied by light microscopy and by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. We found a generalized abnormality in melanogenesis of the retinal pigment epithelium and at least three types of pigmented lesions. The histologic findings in one type of lesion were consistent with congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium or benign pigmented nevus of the retinal pigment epithelium. The other two types of lesion were most consistent with hamartomatous malformations of the retinal pigment epithelium featuring cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and rarely retinal invasion and formation of a minute mushroom-shaped tumor. These histopathologic findings indicate a generalized effect of the familial adenomatous polyposis gene on the retinal pigment epithelium. This oncogene, which is responsible for tumor formation in the gastrointestinal tract, soft tissues, bone, and other locations in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, also leads to a generalized defect in melanogenesis and focal lesions of the retinal pigment epithelium. 
4	Leukocyte counts and activation in spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats The etiology for the progressive organ injury in hypertension is largely speculative. Recent studies have shown that leukocytes play a key role in several cardiovascular diseases. As an initial step toward investigating the role of leukocytes in hypertension, we measured leukocyte counts and spontaneous activation of granulocytes of freshly drawn unseparated blood samples in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in their normotensive counterpart, Wistar-Kyoto rats. The animals were derived from one breeder in the United States and from two breeders in Europe. Total leukocyte counts in young, mature, and old hypertensive rats were 50-100% above the controls. The number of granulocytes in mature and old spontaneously hypertensive rats in more than 100% elevated compared with control rats. In young hypertensive rats the mean granulocyte count was only slightly elevated. The number of spontaneously activated granulocytes, as detected by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, increases with age in both species; in mature spontaneously hypertensive rats, it is more than 300% above the values in the controls. Furthermore, in mature hypertensive rats the number of monocytes, activated monocytes, and the lymphocyte count are also significantly elevated over the values in the normotensive controls. It is proposed that these elevated leukocyte counts may constitute an enhanced risk for organ injury in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. 
3	Parathyroid hormone-related peptide in lactation and in umbilical cord blood. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is expressed in lactating rat mammary glands after suckling, as a result of increases in prolactin rather than suckling per se. In addition, PTHrP produced in the fetal parathyroid glands and placenta may be responsible for stimulation of placental calcium transport. In the current study, we used a radioimmunoassay for human PTHrP to measure levels of the peptide in (1) human breast milk, cow's milk, and two infant formulas; (2) sequential plasma samples in prepartum and postpartum lactating women; (3) women with pathologic hyperprolactinemia; and (4) human umbilical cord blood. In normal subjects, plasma PTHrP levels ranged from less than 2 to 5 pmol/liter. In contrast, human breast milk contained substantially increased levels of immunoreactive PTHrP. Similar elevations were found in cow's milk and in one infant formula. Column chromatography of breast milk demonstrated that PTHrP immunoreactivity included a region of adenylate cyclase stimulating activity, consistent with the presence of biologically active PTHrP. Plasma prepartum PTHrP values did not differ from corresponding postpartum values in lactating women. Women with hyperprolactinemia had a mean plasma PTHrP value in the high-normal range. Umbilical cord blood had considerably suppressed parathyroid hormone values but PTHrP levels that were indistinguishable from those in normal human plasma. Thus, PTHrP is present in high concentrations in breast milk but apparently does not gain access to the maternal circulation in significant amounts. In addition, women with pathologic hyperprolactinemia seem not to have increased levels of circulating PTHrP. 
5	Continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs for filling and lining the post-exenteration pelvis. Pelvic exenteration has a high complication rate due, in large part, to the extensive raw surfaces and dead space it creates. Numerous techniques have been used to control this space and line these surfaces, but none, to date, has proven to be a reliable solution. We investigated the use of continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs as a new "flap" to fill and line the pelvis in 17 patients, and found that our historical complication rate of 44% for pelvic exenteration was reduced to 18%. These reservoirs appear to be an improved method of managing the post-exenteration pelvis. 
5	Intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil. An unusual complication of a Hickman catheter. Venous access devices (VAD) have become an important tool in the management of patients with cancer. Multiple complications can occur as a consequence of insertion of a VAD. The authors report a case of a Hickman catheter perforating the wall of the superior vena cava into the pericardium, resulting in accidental intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias developed, but the patient did not have cardiac tamponade. She recovered from the event without apparent chronic cardiac dysfunction. 
5	Long-term cardiopulmonary bypass by peripheral cannulation in a model of total heart failure. The decompression of the left heart through a percutaneous helical spring positioned within the lumen of the tricuspid and pulmonary artery valves. We performed long-term closed-chest cardiopulmonary bypass in an animal model of total heart failure (induced ventricular fibrillation). The extracorporeal system included a venous reservoir, a roller pump, a membrane lung, and a blood pulsator system. We cannulated the right external jugular vein for venous drainage and the right subclavian artery for arterial return. To decompress the left heart we passed by percutaneous cannulation a special helical spring mounted on a Swan-Ganz catheter (Baxter Edwards Divisions, Irvine, Calif.) and positioned it to rest within the pulmonary artery and tricuspid valves, which rendered them partly incompetent. After induced ventricular fibrillation, blood flow was raised to keep the central venous pressure at baseline values. The lungs were ventilated with 5% carbon dioxide in room air. During bypass, mean pulmonary artery pressure was 10.0 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, mean wedge pressure 11.9 +/- 1.8 mm Hg, and mean blood pressure 95.2 +/- 5.6 mm Hg. After 2 days (four animals) and 3 days (two animals) the hearts were defibrillated. There was immediate ejection from both sides of the heart. All sheep were weaned from bypass within 29 +/- 11 minutes and their lungs were ventilated with room air within 42 +/- 34 minutes. At autopsy hearts and lungs grossly appeared normal. We conclude that the percutaneous helical spring resting within right heart valves provided excellent decompression throughout the study, with full recovery of heart and lung function on defibrillation. 
2	Improved water and sodium absorption from oral rehydration solutions based on rice syrup in a rat model of osmotic diarrhea. Rice syrup solids, rice protein, and casein hydrolysate were added to experimental oral rehydration solutions in various combinations and tested in a rat intestinal perfusion system. Chronic osmotic diarrhea was induced in juvenile rats by supplying the cathartic agents, magnesium citrate and phenolphthalein, in their drinking water for 1 week. The experimental oral rehydration solutions were compared with standard oral rehydration solutions containing 20 gm/L or 30 gm/L of glucose and with each other to determine if there were significant differences in net water, sodium, or potassium absorption. An oral rehydration solution containing 30 gm/L of rice syrup solids had a net water absorption rate significantly higher than that of the standard 20 gm/L glucose-based oral rehydration solution (2.1 +/- 0.62 versus 1.5 +/- 0.48 microliters/[min x cm], p less than 0.05). Casein hydrolysate did not significantly affect net water absorption. However, combinations of 30 gm/L rice syrup solids and 5 gm/L casein hydrolysate significantly increased (p less than 0.05) net sodium and potassium absorption compared with the 20 gm/L glucose-based oral rehydration solution but not versus rice syrup solids alone. Oral rehydration solutions containing 30 gm/L rice syrup solids plus 5 gm/L rice protein, and 30 gm/L rice syrup solids plus 5 gm/L casein hydrolysate, had net water absorption rates significantly higher than the rate of a 30 gm/L glucose-based oral rehydration solution (2.5 +/- 0.36 and 2.4 +/- 0.38, respectively, versus 0.87 +/- 0.40 microliters/[min x cm], p less than 0.05). Rice protein and casein hydrolysate, however, did not significantly affect net water, sodium, or potassium absorption when added to rice protein glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. An inverse correlation between osmolality and net water absorption was observed (r = -0.653, p less than 0.02). The data suggest that substitution of rice syrup solids for glucose in oral rehydration solutions will improve water absorption and that rice syrup solids in combination with protein hydrolysates may, in addition, promote better sodium and potassium uptake. 
1	Adjunctive surgery after chemotherapy for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors: recommendations for patient selection. One hundred eighty-five patients who underwent surgery within 6 months of completing chemotherapy were identified from 360 patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT) treated with Memorial Hospital front-line cisplatin- or carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy protocols between 1979 and 1988. Clinical, pathologic, and radiologic features were correlated with the pathologic findings at surgery. The size of a residual retroperitoneal mass, the degree of shrinkage that occurred with chemotherapy, and the presence of teratomatous elements in pretreatment pathology specimens were each correlated with the pathologic findings of retroperitoneal resections after chemotherapy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis of those undergoing retroperitoneal resections identified the size and shrinkage of the residual mass and the prechemotherapy lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alphafetoprotein (AFP) levels as the best predictors of finding only necrotic debris. No factors could be found, however, that could selectively exclude patients who had residual viable malignancy or teratoma in the retroperitoneum. Of 39 patients with residual retroperitoneal masses measuring less than or equal to 1.5 cm in maximal diameter, three had residual malignancy and five had teratoma resected. No factors were identified for residual lung or mediastinal masses that could be used to select a group of patients who could safely avoid surgery. If serum markers have normalized after chemotherapy for NSGCT, resection of all residual abnormalities on imaging studies of the retroperitoneum, lungs, and mediastinum is recommended. In addition, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) is recommended for all patients with initial bulky metastases (greater than or equal to 3 cm in diameter) in the retroperitoneum, irrespective of the findings of postchemotherapy computed tomography (CT). 
1	Remission induction and continuation therapy in children with their first relapse of acute lymphoid leukemia. A Pediatric Oncology Group study. Between January 1979 and April 1983, 113 children undergoing their first relapse of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) at any site were registered in Pediatric Oncology Group study 7834; 98 were eligible and evaluable. In addition to radiotherapy administered to sites of local relapse, induction consisted of vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VAP) chemotherapy. Continuation therapy consisted of triple-drug intrathecal therapy and regimens of 6-thioguanine and cytarabine alternating with vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and cytarabine. Randomization in continuation was between VAP pulses or no pulse, regardless of the site of relapse. This report provides long-term follow-up of these patients. Thirty-two of 39 children with bone marrow involvement achieved a complete response (CR). Only one of these is alive in an unmaintained remission, a child who did not have an initial CR. Thirty-four of 36 evaluable children with central nervous system involvement as the site of relapse achieved CR. Of these ten are alive; eight are in continuing CR. Nineteen of 20 boys with testicular relapse achieved CR. Of these, 14 are still alive and not receiving therapy, although only one half received treatment in compliance with the protocol described. These results illustrate the possibility of cure of patients who have relapsed with ALL when it is (1) confined to a meningeal or gonadal site and (2) treated vigorously with radiotherapy and a new regimen of systemic chemotherapy. The results reconfirm the need to prevent an initial relapse at any site. 
5	L-tryptophan induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. We describe the spectrum of clinical and histologic abnormalities of 11 women with L-tryptophan induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The illness is characterized by musculoskeletal symptoms including myalgias, arthralgias and paresthesias. The physical findings consist of muscle tenderness, neuropathies, rash, peripheral and periorbital edema. Electroneurography performed in 10 patients demonstrated a neuropathy in 5 and myopathic changes in 3. Skin and muscle biopsies showed fascial edema, inflammation and perivascular infiltrates in the skin, whereas perineural infiltrates and venulitis were identified in muscle. Seven patients were treated with prednisone; eosinophilia disappeared promptly although myalgias and neuropathy persisted. 
5	Unruptured intracranial aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations: frequency of intracranial hemorrhage and relationship of lesions. Among 91 patients with unruptured intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVM's), 16 patients had 26 unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms. An actuarial analysis showed the risk of intracranial hemorrhage among patients with coexisting aneurysm and AVM to be 7% per year at 5 years following diagnosis compared to 1.7% for patients with AVM alone. The difference in length of survival free of hemorrhage was significant (log-rank, p less than 0.0007). Several angiographic and clinical parameters were investigated to better understand the relationship of these lesions. The aneurysms occurred in similar percentages in patients with small, medium, and large AVM's. Twenty-five aneurysms were on arteries feeding the malformation system, almost equally distributed proximally and distally. Eleven aneurysms were atypical in location, and all arose from primary or secondary branch feeders to the malformation; 24 were on enlarged feeding arteries. Eleven (16%) of the 67 patients with high-flow AVM's had associated aneurysms, compared with five (21%) of the 24 patients with low-flow AVM's. Four (16%) of 25 low-shunt malformations and 12 (18%) of 65 high-shunt malformations had associated aneurysms. All five aneurysms associated with low-shunt malformations were on a direct arterial feeder of the malformation. These data suggest that the intracranial AVM's predispose to aneurysm formation within AVM feeding systems and that the mechanism is not simply based upon the high blood flow or high arteriovenous shunt in these systems. 
5	Peripheral arterial occlusive disease: prospective comparison of MR angiography and color duplex US with conventional angiography. Conventional angiography, two-dimensional inflow magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, and color duplex ultrasound (US) were performed on 12 patients in a blinded, prospective study. The ability to grade arterial lesions and plan revascularization interventions were compared. Arterial lesions were categorized as nonsignificant (0%-49% diameter reduction) or significant (50%-100% diameter reduction). Determination of nonsignificant and significant lesions with MR angiography was in agreement with that at conventional angiography in 100 of 140 lesions (71%). Agreement between results of conventional angiography and color duplex US occurred with 114 of 123 infrainguinal lesions (93%). Twenty-one vascular interventions were planned by using conventional angiography; there was agreement with color duplex US in 11 cases and MR angiography in five. Color duplex US performed well in the assessment of infrainguinal disease but was limited in the evaluation of iliac segments because of nonvisualization. The iliac region was visualized in more patients with MR angiography than with color duplex US, but image quality with MR angiography was inconsistent. Strategies to improve MR angiography of the peripheral vasculature merit further study. 
5	Identification and characterization of a regulated promoter element in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. We have identified a 36-base-pair proximal element (-112 to -77 relative to the AUG translation initiation codon) in the epidermal growth factor receptor 5' region that functions as a promoter; mediates inductive responses to epidermal growth factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and cyclic AMP; and acts in an orientation-independent manner. This region functions as an enhancer when transferred to a heterologous promoter containing a TATA box. Mutations within the 36-base-pair region alter function as assayed by reporter gene expression in recipient cells. A protein has been identified that demonstrates appropriate binding specificity to mutant DNA sequences that correlates with promoter activity observed in vivo. On the basis of DNA binding characteristics and size, the identified protein appears distinct from several previously identified transcription factors known to bind to G+C-rich regions. 
3	Bacterial meningitis in the United States, 1986: report of a multistate surveillance study. The Bacterial Meningitis Study Group. A prospective, laboratory-based surveillance project obtained accurate data on meningitis in a population of 34 million people during 1986. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis (45%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18%), and Neisseria meningitidis (14%). Rates of H. influenzae meningitis varied significantly by region, from 1.9/100,000 in New Jersey to 4.0/100,000 in Washington state. The overall case fatality rates for meningitis were lower than those reported in several studies from the early 1970s, suggesting that improvements in early detection and antibiotic treatment may have occurred since that time. Concurrent surveillance was also performed for all invasive disease due to the five most common causes of bacterial meningitis. Serotypes of group B streptococcus other than type III caused more than half of neonatal group B streptococcal disease and mortality, suggesting that an optimal vaccine preparation must be multivalent. Of the organisms evaluated, group B streptococcus was the second most common cause of invasive disease in persons greater than 5 years old. 
2	Adrenergic control of the internal anal sphincter is abnormal in patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence. There is histological and functional evidence that the internal anal sphincter is abnormal in patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence. The in vitro responsiveness of the internal anal sphincter to noradrenaline (an important sympathetic neurotransmitter) and electrical field stimulation (known to stimulate the intrinsic innervation) has been studied. Muscle strips from eight patients with incontinence undergoing postanal repair and five controls undergoing resection for low rectal carcinoma were studied. The contraction-response curves for noradrenaline were significantly different, and the EC50, the concentration required to produce 50 per cent of maximum contraction, was higher in incontinent patients (P less than 0.001). Electrical field stimulation produced initial contractions in four of the control group which were blocked by phentolamine. This contraction was not present in the incontinent patients (P less than 0.01). These results indicate an abnormality in the adrenergic innervation of the internal anal sphincter in patients with idiopathic faecal incontinence. 
2	Effect of omeprazole and high doses of ranitidine on gastric acidity and gastroesophageal reflux in patients with moderate-severe esophagitis Thirty to fifty percent of patients with reflux esophagitis fail to heal after treatment with conventional doses of H2-receptor antagonists, whereas omeprazole administration induces more than 90% healing. To investigate the effect of omeprazole and higher-than-presently-recommended doses of H2-blockers, we evaluated gastric acidity and gastroesophageal reflux in 17 patients with severe-moderate esophagitis before and after treatment with 300 mg ranitidine twice daily or 20 mg omeprazole once daily. Three pH-metric studies were performed, in a cross-over design, before and after 8 days of treatment with omeprazole or ranitidine. Both drugs significantly reduced intragastric acidity (p less than 0.001) during both night and day hours. Median hourly 24-h intragastric pH was 1.8 in the basal study, 2.9 after ranitidine, and 3.4 after omeprazole. Intragastric acidity fell from 84.0 mmol/L in the basal study to 14.2 mmol/L (79% inhibition) with ranitidine and 9.3 mmol/L (84% inhibition) with omeprazole. Patients with esophagitis were significantly more exposed to acid than healthy subjects, in both the supine and upright position (p less than 0.01). The time with esophageal pH less than 4 dropped from 23.9% in the basal study to 8.5% with ranitidine and to 7.2% with omeprazole (p less than 0.001). Both drugs significantly reduced esophageal exposure to acid in both the supine and upright positions (p less than 0.001), whereas neither had any effect on esophageal acid clearance. 
2	Provision of gastrointestinal endoscopy and related services for a district general hospital. Working Party of the Clinical Services Committee of the British Society of Gastroenterology. (1) The number of endoscopic examinations performed is rising. Epidemiological data and the workload of well developed units show that annual requirements per head of population are approaching: Upper gastrointestinal 1 in 100 Flexible sigmoidoscopy 1 in 500 Colonoscopy 1 in 500 ERCP 1 in 2000 (2) Open access endoscopy to general practitioners is desirable and increasingly sought. For a district general hospital serving a population of 250,000, this workload entails about 3500 procedures annually, performed during 10 half day routine sessions plus emergency work. (3) High standards of training and experience are needed by all staff, who must work in purpose built accommodation designed to promote efficient and safe practice. (4) The endoscopy unit should be adjacent to day care facilities and near the x ray department. There should be easy access to wards. (5) An endoscopy unit needs at least two endoscopy rooms; a fully ventilated cleaning/disinfection area; rooms for patient reception, preparation, and recovery; and accommodation for administration, storage, and staff amenities. (6) The service should be consultant based. At least 10 clinical sessions are required, made up of six or more consultant sessions and two to four clinical assistant, hospital practitioner, or staff specialist sessions. Each consultant should be expected to commit at least two sessions weekly to endoscopy. Extra consultant sessions may be needed to provide an efficient service. (7) A specially trained nursing sister (grade G or H) and five other endoscopy nurses are needed to care for the patients; their work may be supplemented by care assistants. (8) A new post of endoscopy department assistant (analogous to an operating department assistant) is proposed to maintain and prepare instruments, and to give technical assistance during procedures. (9) A full time secretary should be employed. Records, appointments, and audit should be computer based. (10) ERCP needs the collaboration of an interventional radiologist working with high quality x ray equipment in a specially prepared radiology screening room. This facility may need to serve more than one hospital. (11) A gastrointestinal measurement laboratory can conveniently be combined with the endoscopy unit. In some hospitals one or more gastrointestinal measurement technicians may staff this laboratory. (12) An endoscopy unit is a service department analogous to a radiology department. It needs an annual budget. 
5	Human central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor expressing nerve growth factor receptors: CHP707m. A primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) presented as a cerebral hemispheric mass in a 33-year-old man. Bone marrow metastases were discovered 11 months later. A cell line (CHP707m) was derived from these metastases. In culture, the cells showed features of neuronal differentiation, forming short neurites and synthesizing low-molecular-weight neurofilament protein. Northern blotting showed the tumor cells express nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor messenger RNA, and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting demonstrated NGF receptors on the cell surface. Western blotting showed CHP707m NGF receptors are truncated. The receptors are functional; they bind iodine 125-labeled mouse NGF with an affinity of 1.6 x 10(-9) M, and short-term treatment with NGF induces expression by the tumor cells of the proto-oncogene, c-fos. Although CHP707m is the first central nervous system PNET cell line proven to express NGF receptors, immunohistological survey of tissue sections prepared from human central nervous system PNETs showed that 13 of 35 contained NGF receptor-positive tumor cells. Thus, more than one-third of such tumors might be responsive to the effects of NGF. 
5	Coronary morphology after percutaneous directional coronary atherectomy in humans: autopsy analysis of three patients. The morphologic basis of angiographically successful percutaneous directional atherectomy and subsequent restenosis in human coronary arteries is unknown. The clinical and pathologic features of three patients who died after coronary atherectomy are described. Tissue fragments obtained with atherectomy demonstrated atheromatous and fibroproliferative intima, media and adventitia. At autopsy, treated vascular segments (from the left anterior descending artery in two patients and a vein graft in one patient) demonstrated discrete defects in the vascular wall. Defects extending into atheroma, media or adventitia corresponded with the presence of these tissues in the atherectomy specimens. Tissues were otherwise not disrupted in the manner associated with balloon angioplasty. Acute mural thrombus deposition was evident in the resection zone in one patient. Late findings included fibroproliferative intimal tissue extending from the resected areas into the vascular lumen. In one patient intimal hyperplasia was sufficient to narrow the vascular lumen by 82% and was implicated in subsequent myocardial ischemia and infarction. The study indicates that 1) the vascular injury associated with atherectomy is distinct from that associated with balloon angioplasty, 2) acute mural thrombus deposition may occur even with resection limited to the intima, and 3) intimal hyperplasia may develop in regions treated with atherectomy and may be associated with late myocardial ischemia and infarction. 
4	Analysis of side-effects of medium- and low-dose cyclosporin maintenance therapy in psoriasis. The side-effects of long-term cyclosporin A (CyA) treatment in 26 patients with severe psoriasis were evaluated. These patients had a mean PASI score of 30.2 and were treated with CyA for between 7 and 37 months (mean 19.5 months). There were three groups according to the dose of CyA, less than 2 mg/kg per day, 2-3 mg/kg per day and greater than 3 mg/kg per day. In all three groups, CyA was found to be equally effective. Treatment with CyA was discontinued in 12 of the 26 patients because of nephrotoxicity and/or development of hypertension. One was in the less than 2 mg/kg per day group, three were in the 2-3 mg/kg per day group and eight in the greater than 3 mg/kg per day group. There was no hepatotoxicity with CyA treatment. One patient developed two squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. 
1	Intrapericardial pheochromocytoma. In a 34-year-old man with hypertension and increased urinary catecholamine excretion for 12 years, an m-[131I]iodobenzylguanidine scan and chest computed tomography located an intrapericardial pheochromocytoma in the left atrium. The tumor was excised through a left thoracotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest. At 34-month follow-up, blood pressure and urine catecholamine levels were normal. In the 15 cases of intrapericardial pheochromocytoma treated by resection reported in the literature, all 11 survivors were symptom-free except 1 who had residual left atrial tumor and multiple skeletal metastatic lesions. Computed tomography directed by the m-[131I]iodobenzylguanidine scan can be used for detailed location of the tumor. Appropriate surgical approach and use of cardiopulmonary bypass are critical in the resection of these highly vascular tumors. 
4	Improved survival and reduced myocardial necrosis with cardiopulmonary bypass reperfusion in a canine model of coronary occlusion and cardiac arrest. STUDY QUESTION: Does cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) improve resuscitation rates and limit infarct size after cardiac arrest and acute myocardial infarction? DESIGN: Controlled randomized trial with all animals undergoing left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and subsequent ventricular fibrillation and resuscitation. All animals were supported for four hours after resuscitation in an intensive care setting. INTERVENTION: Group 1 (eight) was resuscitated with standard external CPR and advanced life support. Group 2 (eight) was resuscitated with CPB. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Group hemodynamic, resuscitation variables, number resuscitated, and number of four-hour survivors were compared. Ischemic and necrotic myocardial weights were determined with histochemical staining techniques in four-hour survivors. Infarct size was measured as the ratio of necrotic weight to ischemic weight. Significantly fewer dogs were resuscitated in group 1 (four of eight) than in group 2 (eight of eight) (P less than .05). Group 2 survivors required significantly less epinephrine and lidocaine than group 1 survivors (P less than .05) and higher aortic diastolic and coronary perfusion pressures after CPB (P less than .001). The ratio of myocardial necrotic weight to ischemic weight at four hours was 0.82 +/- 0.25 in group 1 and 0.22 +/- 0.25 in group 2 (P less than .05). However, collateral blood flow was not measured in this study. CONCLUSION: This pilot study further substantiates the improvement in resuscitation rates obtainable with CPB. CPB may also limit infarct size during the postresuscitation period and requires further study. 
5	The diagnosis and management of aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is a severe disease. Most untreated patients with types I and II (proximal) dissection and over half of those with type III (distal) dissection die within 1 year. Most of the deaths occur within 2 weeks and are caused by rupture, aortic insufficiency, and branch vessel obstruction. Aortic dissection is suspected in patients with anterior chest and back pain that progresses downward. Diagnosis is confirmed by computed tomography, aortography, or echocardiography. Appropriate medical treatment and corrective surgery, including total aortic replacement, performed in the acute and chronic stages, are now successful in over 90% of the cases; long-term results of treatment are steadily improving and are expected to exceed 50% at 10 years. The keys to a successful outcome are being aware of the symptoms of dissection, early diagnosis, and prompt application of appropriate treatment; diligent follow-up includes controlling blood pressure, decreasing the velocity of left ventricular contraction, monitoring the size of the residual aorta, and taking appropriate action if redissection, aneurysmal formation, or rupture occurs. 
3	Neurofibromatosis type 2: report of a family and review of current evaluation and treatment. Significant advances during the past decade have greatly improved our understanding of neurofibromatosis type 2, a genetic disease which results in bilateral acoustic neuromas. The emergence of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging has allowed early detection of minute intracanalicular eighth-nerve tumors, less than 1 cm in diameter. Recombinant DNA studies have clarified the genetics that underlie neurofibromatosis type 2 and separate it from a variety of related conditions, such as von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis. Early diagnosis and surgical removal of these tumors may offer the only hope of preserving hearing and facial nerve function. A report of the evaluation and treatment of a family with multiple affected individuals will exemplify these conclusions. 
5	Effect of epinephrine and lidocaine therapy on outcome after cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. One hundred ninety-nine patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest persisted in ventricular fibrillation after the first defibrillation attempt and were then randomly assigned to receive either epinephrine or lidocaine before the next two shocks. The resulting electrocardiographic rhythms and outcomes for each group of patients were compared for each group and also compared with results during the prior 2 years, a period when similar patients primarily received sodium bicarbonate as initial adjunctive therapy. Asystole occurred after defibrillation with threefold frequency after repeated injection of lidocaine (15 of 59, 25%) compared with patients treated with epinephrine (four of 55, 7%) (p less than 0.02). There was no difference in the proportion of patients resuscitated after treatment with either lidocaine or epinephrine (51 of 106, 48% vs. 50 of 93, 54%) and in the proportion surviving (18, 19% vs. 21, 20%), respectively. Resuscitation (64% vs. 50%, p less than 0.005) but not survival rates (24% vs. 20%) were higher during the prior 2-year period in which initial adjunctive drug treatment for persistent ventricular fibrillation primarily consisted of a continuous infusion of sodium bicarbonate. The negative effect of lidocaine or epinephrine treatment was explained in part by their influence on delaying subsequent defibrillation attempts. Survival rates were highest (30%) in a subset of patients who received no drug therapy between shocks. We conclude that currently recommended doses of epinephrine and lidocaine are not useful for improving outcome in patients who persist in ventricular fibrillation. 
5	Interferon system and natural killer cell activity in myasthenia gravis. The autoimmune response in myasthenia gravis is well characterized, but little is known about the mechanisms initiating it. We have studied the interferon system and natural killer cell activity in 25 patients with myasthenia gravis and compared them to 68 healthy subjects and 96 patients with acute viral infections. Forty-four per cent of patients had circulating interferon (greater than 16 mu/ml), and in a similar proportion their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were in an antiviral state, i.e., showed low levels of viral replication when infected by vesicular stomatitis virus. Spontaneous in vitro interferon production by patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also common (greater than 10 mu/ml, 32 per cent), while the response to the alpha-interferon inducer poly I:C was lower than expected, possibly reflecting the already high state of activation of the interferon system. These results were essentially similar to those obtained in patients with viral illnesses and differed significantly from healthy controls. In many myasthenia gravis patients (16 of 22, 73 per cent), a markedly deficient natural killer cell activity was found, with a median cytotoxicity of 6.5 per cent compared to 29 per cent in healthy subjects (p less than 0.005). Thus, many patients with myasthenia gravis have evidence of an activated interferon system and defective natural killer cell activity, suggesting an occult viral infection or reflecting nonspecific stimulation which may nevertheless contribute to the pathogenesis of the autoimmune response. 
5	Monomicrobial nonneutrocytic bacterascites: a variant of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is diagnosed when (a) the ascitic fluid culture is positive, (b) the ascitic fluid neutrophil count is greater than or equal to 250 cells/mm3 and (c) there is no evident intraabdominal surgically treatable source for infection. Few details are available regarding the variant of ascitic fluid infection in which the culture grows bacteria (pure growth of a single type of organism), but the neutrophil count is less than 250 cells/mm3. In this prospective study of 138 episodes of culture-positive spontaneously infected ascites detected in 105 patients, 44 (31.9%) were episodes of "monomicrobial nonneutrocytic bacterascites" compared with 94 (68.1%) episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Seventeen patients had both types of infection. The infection-related mortality and hospitalization mortality were similar between the two groups. Patients with bacterascites appeared to have less severe liver disease. In 62% of bacterascites episodes in which a second paracentesis was performed before any treatment the fluid spontaneously became sterile without development of ascitic fluid neutrocytosis. Thirty-eight percent of patients with bacterascites (who underwent a second paracentesis before treatment was started) progressed to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis--sometimes within a few hours. The concentration of the chemoattractant C5a was not decreased in the ascitic fluid of the bacterascites patients; this excludes ascitic fluid C5a deficiency as the explanation of the lack of neutrocytosis. Monomicrobial nonneutrocytic bacterascites is a common variant of ascitic fluid infection that may resolve without treatment or may progress to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 
5	Spinal nerve stimulation in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Direct spinal nerve stimulation was compared with needle electromyography (EMG) in 40 patients who were suspected of having an L5 or S1 radiculopathy. For spinal nerve stimulation, we adapted a monopolar needle electrode inserted deep into the paraspinal muscle. The minimal latency, amplitude, and negative phase area of compound muscle action potential from myotomal muscles were recorded with computer assistance. Abnormality was considered to be significant when the value fell outside of 2 SD of control mean values. Among 17 patients with clinical evidence of radiculopathy, needle EMG was abnormal in 10 patients (58.8%), whereas in the nerve stimulation test the abnormalities were shown in 16 patients (94.1%); in amplitude difference and the abnormal area, differences were shown in 12 patients (70.6%). Among 23 patients with only subjective symptoms of radiculopathy, needle EMG was abnormal in nine patients (39.1%), whereas the abnormal amplitude differences were shown in 18 patients (78.3%) and 15 patients (65.2%) with abnormal area difference by spinal nerve stimulation, respectively. Direct spinal nerve stimulation is recognized as an objective and sensitive test in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy. 
5	Salicylate poisoning from enteric-coated aspirin. Delayed absorption may complicate management. Acute salicylate poisoning with enteric-coated aspirin may result from accidental ingestion, a suicide attempt, or a complication of long-term therapy. Because absorption of enteric-coated aspirin is delayed, use of the Done nomogram to determine toxicity may lead to underestimating the severity of the poisoning. Treatment options include induction of emesis or diuresis, gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, and surgery. 
1	Flow cytometric analysis of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is a useful marker for lymphoid precursor cells. In this study, the authors used flow cytometry (FCM) to analyze TdT expression in human hematopoietic malignancies. Cells were fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde, briefly exposed to nonionic detergent, and subsequently labeled with mouse monoclonal anti-TdT antibodies followed by fluorescein-conjugated antimouse IgG and propidium iodide (PI), which was used for the simultaneous analysis of DNA content. Cells from 20 of 22 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), 4 of 7 mixed lineage leukemias, 2 of 21 acute myeloid and myelomonocytic leukemias, 1 of 2 chronic myeloid leukemias in blast crisis, 1 lymphoblastic lymphoma, and 1 thymoma were TdT positive. Cells from 13 nonlymphoblastic lymphomas, 3 myelodysplastic bone marrows, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 29 normal individuals were negative. An excellent correlation was seen between this assay, the conventional slide immunofluorescence technique, and an enzyme immunoassay method. The FCM assay detected as few as 2% blasts in mixing experiments of TdT-containing leukemic cells with normal peripheral lymphocytes. Furthermore, the combined analysis of TdT and DNA allowed the recognition of aneuploid TdT positive cells in four cases of ALL. The high sensitivity, the quantitative information obtained, and the capability of simultaneously analyzing DNA content make this method of TdT analysis more valuable than conventional techniques. 
2	Surgical management of bile duct stones. The biliary surgeon in the 1990s must be familiar with all of the available techniques for the treatment of bile duct stones. Experience and judgment are important in the successful management of the individual patient with intrahepatic or extrahepatic stones. Knowledge of the nonsurgical methods of stone removal is important in the decision-making process. However, the biliary surgeon must resist the temptation to do less than a thorough removal of all stones at the operation lest the patient be subjected to additional procedures, which carry their own risks of morbidity and death. The goal should be to clear the stones from the biliary system with the fewest procedures offering the lowest morbidity and mortality risks to the patient. 
5	Role of leukotriene B4 in granulocyte infiltration into the postischemic feline intestine. Several studies have demonstrated that granulocytes accumulate in the intestinal mucosa following ischemia/reperfusion. It has been suggested that leukotriene B4 may be released during ischemia/reperfusion and consequently may promote granulocyte infiltration into the mucosa. The objectives of this study were to determine whether (a) leukotriene B4 is produced in the gut mucosa during ischemia and reperfusion, and (b) inhibition of leukotriene B4 attenuates granulocyte infiltration into the postischemic intestinal mucosa. Isolated segments of cat intestine were subjected to 3 hours of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion. Mucosal samples were obtained during baseline, ischemia at 3 hours and reperfusion at 1 hour. Leukotriene B4 production was determined by radioimmunoassay. Tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity was used to quantitate granulocyte accumulation in the mucosal samples. In untreated animals, mucosal leukotriene B4 concentration was higher at reperfusion compared with baseline levels. The reperfusion-induced increase in mucosal leukotriene B4 was entirely prevented by pretreatment with either nordihydroguaiaretic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or L663,536 (Merck-Frosst, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), two potent lipoxygenase inhibitors. Both lipoxygenase inhibitors, as well as leukotriene B4 antagonist (SC-41930) significantly attenuated the reperfusion-induced infiltration of granulocytes. These results indicate that leukotriene B4 plays an important role in mediating the granulocyte accumulation elicited by reperfusion of the ischemic bowel. 
5	Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. A clinical case series of 21 patients. New Mexico Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome Study Group. We reviewed 21 cases of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome to describe the range of clinical findings in these patients. Most patients were women (20 [95%]) and middle-aged (mean, 46 years) and had taken the food supplement L-tryptophan (95%). All cases involved eosinophilia (eosinophil count, greater than or equal to 2.0 x 10(9)/L) and incapacitating myalgias. Fourteen (88%) of the 16 patients tested had mild liver function abnormalities. Aldolase levels were abnormal in all patients tested. Muscle biopsies were done in five patients; four showed eosinophilic perimyositis, and one had interstitial inflammation. No physical finding was pathognomonic or universal, but muscle tenderness, tachycardia, and rash were the most common signs found during physical examinations. Seven patients were treated with prednisone, and six showed improvement in muscle pain and a decrease in eosinophilia. The cause of this disorder is still unknown. 
1	Radioimmunology. Imaging and therapy. Targeting of radioactivity to tumors using antitumor antibodies is evolving from a laboratory curiosity toward a practical diagnostic and therapeutic technique that promises widespread benefits for many common human cancers. The development of the hybridoma technique by Kohler and Milstein for producing monoclonal antibodies is probably the single most important contribution to the development of this field. A large array of monoclonal antibodies against many human tumors have been created and labeled with a variety of radioisotopes; 110 clinical trials have been identified from the literature between the interval of 1978 to the present. These studies are beginning to form the basis for certain conclusions regarding likely benefits for certain combinations of antitumor antibodies and isotopes in specific instances of clinical management in patients with malignant neoplasms. For example, in melanoma, lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and colorectal malignancies, radiolabeled antibodies have demonstrated occult tumors, which could not be disclosed with conventional methodologies. Radioimmunotherapy of malignant lymphoma is achieving durable remissions in patients who have failed conventional forms of therapy. For the most part, these advances have been achieved through intelligent application of known principles of immunochemistry, imaging physics, and tumor immunology. Progress has been slow but steady. In a few instances, the term "magic bullet" is warranted in describing the targeting of a particular radiolabeled antibody to a human tumor. I-131, 3-F8, an IgG3 against the GD2 antigen of neuroblastoma, which was introduced by Cheung, and In-111 T-101, against the CD5 antigen of T-cells, which was developed by Royston, stand out because of the consistency and high concentration of radioactive targeting to human tumors in clinical trials. If certain technical innovations fulfill their initial promise, the future will be bright for radioimmunologic methods of diagnosis and therapy. Genetic engineering will permit the development of "humanized" antibodies with biologic properties that favor tumor localization. New chemical approaches will broaden the range of isotopes available as diagnostic and therapeutic radiolabels. Application of modern imaging methodologies, such as positron emission tomography (PET), will detect more lesions of smaller size and permit quantitative imaging for dosimetry considerations. Greater speed and ease of use of computerized work stations will lead to the broader application of fusion imaging in which radioantibody images will be viewed simultaneously with TCT or MRI for better anatomic correlation of abnormal sites of antigen-reactive tumor deposits. 
5	Recanalization of chronic total coronary arterial occlusions by percutaneous excimer-laser and laser-assisted angioplasty. A low primary success and high restenosis rate after recanalization of chronic total occlusions by conventional coronary angioplasty have encouraged the application of new interventional techniques like excimer-laser angioplasty. In 39 patients with a coronary occlusion for 1 to 12 months, recanalization was attempted by laser angioplasty through a multifiber-catheter coupled to a pulsed XeCl excimer laser. After successful passage of the occlusion by a standard guidewire in 27 patients (69%), the laser catheter was advanced over the central guidewire and crossed the occlusion in 25 patients (64%). In 2 patients with unsuccessful passage of the laser catheter, the subsequent attempt with a low profile balloon catheter also failed. In 19 of the 25 patients with successful laser recanalization, the residual stenosis exceeded 50% and was therefore followed by additional balloon angioplasty. The average residual stenosis after laser was 61 +/- 17% of the vessel diameter, and after balloon angioplasty 28 +/- 9% (n = 19), whereas after laser angioplasty alone it was 38 +/- 5% (n = 6). No complications associated with the laser application were observed. Angiographic control after 24 hours showed a reocclusion of 2 (8%) recanalized vessels. In this pilot study, laser angioplasty proved to be a safe and feasible method for the treatment of chronic total coronary occlusions. Because it was necessary to guide the catheter by a central wire, the primary success was limited by a successful passage of the wire of the occlusion. The rate of stand-alone laser angioplasty has to be increased by future improvements of the technique to enable a comparative evaluation of this method with conventional angioplasty. 
1	Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography in pediatric head and neck masses. Fifty-three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 25 computed tomography (CT) studies of 53 head and neck masses in pediatric patients were reviewed retrospectively. All lesions had pathologic proof except for 2 metastatic and 2 recurrent lesions, which only had prior pathologic confirmation at their primary sites. These included 12 malignant tumors, 23 benign tumors, 6 inflammatory masses, and 12 congenital lesions. The MRI performance ranged predominantly from good to excellent in detection of the lesion and the extent of involvement and in contrast to the surrounding tissue; when CT comparison was available, MRI proved to be equal to or better than it in detection of these factors and in preoperative diagnosis. Our results suggest that MRI should be the method of choice for the initial evaluation of the pediatric head and neck region, especially in those patients requiring multiple examinations. However, CT and MRI should be used conjunctively in complicated cases, especially those possibly involving lesions with calcifications or bony involvement. 
4	Efficacy of potassium and magnesium in essential hypertension: a double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover study OBJECTIVE--To evaluate the antihypertensive activity of potassium given alone or in combination with magnesium in patients with mild hypertension. DESIGN--A double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover trial of 32 weeks' duration. SETTINGS--Cardiology outpatient department, Sassoon General Hospitals, Pune, India. PATIENTS--37 Adults with mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure less than 110 mm Hg). INTERVENTION--Patients received either placebo or potassium 60 mmol/day alone or in combination with magnesium 20 mmol/day in a crossover design. No other drug treatment was allowed. MEASUREMENTS--Blood pressure and heart rate assessed at weekly intervals and biochemical parameters at monthly intervals. RESULTS--Potassium alone or in combination with magnesium produced a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p less than 0.001) and a significant reduction in serum cholesterol concentration (p less than 0.05); other biochemical variables did not change. Magnesium did not have an additional effect. Urinary potassium excretion increased significantly in the groups who received potassium alone or in combination with magnesium. The drug was well tolerated and compliance was satisfactory. CONCLUSION--Potassium 60 mmol/day lowers arterial blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension. Giving magnesium as well has no added advantage. 
1	Reproducibility of image interpretation in immunoscintigraphy performed with indium-111- and iodine-131-labeled OC125 F(ab')2 antibody injected into the same patients. An important criterion for the clinical use of a new imaging technique is the correct reproducibility of interpretation. Forty-six paired immunoscintigraphic examinations were performed on 43 patients with suspected ovarian carcinoma recurrence using F(ab')2 fragments of OC125 antibody labeled first with indium-111 and then with iodine-131. Planar scintigraphy (PS) and emission computed tomography (ECT) images were interpreted blindly and separately by three observers, and reproducibility was evaluated by a kappa concordance index. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility were generally satisfactory (kappa values of 0.6 and 0.7, respectively). Binomial analysis of kappa values for ECT showed the superiority of indium-111 for intraobserver (p = 0.035) and interobserver (p = 0.0039) study. However, for PS there was no significant difference in reproducibility with the two radionuclides. 
5	Interferon-alpha receptor expression and regulation in chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Interferon-alpha elicits antiviral and immunoregulatory activities by binding to specific receptors on the cell surface. In this study, binding characteristics of interferon-alpha to peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection were studied using radioiodinated recombinant interferon-alpha 2b to determine interferon-alpha receptor numbers and dissociation constants. A single class of interferon-alpha receptor was demonstrated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mononuclear subsets. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (n = 20) and controls (n = 16) expressed a similar number of interferon-alpha receptors (484 +/- 175 vs. 511 +/- 168 sites/cell respectively, p = NS) with a similar dissociation constant (dissociation constant approximately 0.2 to 0.7 nmol/L). Expression of interferon-alpha receptors was similar in monocyte-enriched and lymphocyte-enriched fractions in both groups. Similar changes were observed in patients receiving alpha-interferon therapy. There was no correlation between interferon-alpha receptors expression and serum transaminase, serum HBsAg, serum HBV DNA, liver histological findings or the response to interferon-alpha therapy. After incubation of lymphocytes in vitro with interferon-alpha 2b (10 to 1,000 U/ml), interferon-alpha receptors number dropped by 42% to 80%, but this was associated with an increase in binding affinity (dissociation constant approximately 0.05 to 0.15 nmol/L) in both patients and controls. There was significant delay in the initial phase of receptor recovery in the patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection compared with normal controls (days 1 and 2, p less than 0.05). 
5	The surgical anatomy of the scalp. Cadaveric dissections and surgical observations have led to the description and clarification of the boundaries. blood supply, and nomenclature of the layers of the scalp. Special attention was directed to the layer of "loose connective tissue" that lies beneath the entire galea and above the cranial periosteum centrally, and the temporalis fascia laterally. It has been named the subgaleal fascia (SGF). The subgaleal fascia is a trilaminar structure with unusual potential in reconstructive surgery. Histologic study reveals the subgaleal fascia to be composed of a central dense collagenous layer surrounded by vascularized areolar tissue. It is readily dissected from surrounding galeal and periosteal layers. The subgaleal fascia was probably included in previously described "pericranial flaps," which were often based beyond the periosteum. The blood supply of the subgaleal fascia originates from the proximal portion of the peripheral vessels of the scalp and continues within the areolar lamina. The subgaleal fascia is an exceptionally thin, malleable, and well-vascularized flap useful for facial reconstruction. 
2	Left retroperitoneal exposure for distal mesenteric artery repair. Distal disease in the mesenteric arteries has usually been repaired transabdominally since it is believed that only the proximal centimeter of each vessel is accessible through the retroperitoneum. We treated five patients with chronic visceral ischemia and lesions extending beyond the orifice using a retroperitoneal approach. Exposure was obtained with a left flank incision through the tenth interspace. The left crus of the diaphragm was divided in order to control the supraceliac aorta. The mesenteric vessels were identified and dissected until their entrance into the peritoneum. There were no difficulties in exposing the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) as it coursed under the pancreas and over the duodenum for an approximate length of 5 to 10 cm. The uncinate process of the pancreas was not a limiting factor for exposure of the SMA in this region and further distal exposure could be obtained by incising the peritoneum. The trifurcation of the celiac artery and the splenic artery were accessible through this exposure; however, only the first centimeter of the hepatic and gastric branches could be reached. Revascularization was performed with endarterectomy (2 patients) and bypass (3 patients). Bowel viability was assessed at the conclusion of the procedure by incising the peritoneum. There were no complications from this exposure and no patient required reoperation for ischemic bowel. We conclude that the left retroperitoneal approach is not only acceptable for orifice lesions but is also applicable for distal disease. 
2	Pulmonary hypertension complicating portal hypertension: prevalence and relation to splanchnic hemodynamics. The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in 507 patients hospitalized with portal hypertension but without known pulmonary hypertension who underwent cardiac catheterization was prospectively studied. Ten (2%) of these patients, 6 of whom were clinically asymptomatic, had primary pulmonary hypertension. Second, 26 patients with symptomatic pulmonary hypertension complicating portal hypertension were reviewed. Pulmonary hypertension occurred later after diagnosis of portal hypertension in patients with a surgical shunt (10 patients) than in those without a shunt (147 +/- 49 vs. 44 +/- 27 months; P less than 0.0001). Cardiac index correlated inversely with pulmonary arterial pressure (r = -0.45; P less than 0.01) and was lower in the 5 patients who died of pulmonary hypertension than in the 5 who died of liver failure (1.52 +/- 0.14 vs. 3.69 +/- 1.88 L/min.m2; P less than 0.05). Third, systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics were compared in 285 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and 29 controls. No significant relation was found between elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and increased portal pressure, zzygos blood flow, or cardiac index. Pulmonary hypertension is considerably more frequent than was previously estimated in patients with portal hypertension. The risk of developing pulmonary hypertension could increase with the duration of portal hypertension without any clear relation to the degree of portal hypertension, hepatic failure, or amount of blood shunted. 
1	Caesarean section in a patient with haemoglobin SC disease and a phaeochromocytoma. The anaesthetic management of a patient with haemoglobin SC disease for lower segment Caesarean section and excision of a phaeochromocytoma is described. The patient was given a general anaesthetic for the surgical procedure after exchange transfusion had achieved an haemoglobin A concentration of greater than 50%. A live infant was delivered and a suprarenal phaeochromocytoma was excised during a 6.5 hour procedure. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful. 
1	Long-term follow-up in toxic solitary autonomous thyroid nodules treated with radioactive iodine The long-term effects of radioiodine treatment on thyroid function in patients with a toxic solitary autonomous thyroid nodule were evaluated. Fifty-two patients received a therapeutic dose of 20 mCi of iodine-131 (131I). Duration of follow-up was 10 +/- 4 yr. Follow-up data included a biochemical evaluation of thyroid function. The failure rate (recurrent hyperthyroidism) was 2%. The incidence of hypothyroidism was 6% and was not related to the dose per gram of nodular tissue. Oral administration of 20 mCi of radioiodine is a simple and highly effective method for the treatment of patients with a toxic autonomous thyroid nodule. The risk of development of hypothyroidism is low if extranodular uptake of 131I is prevented. This can be achieved by not treating euthyroid patients, by no longer using injections of exogenous thyroid stimulating hormone in the diagnostic work-up of the patients and by always performing radioiodine imaging shortly before treatment. 
1	Ganglioneuroma of the spinal cord. This report describes a 2-year-old boy who harbored an intramedullary ganglioneuroma involving almost the entire length of the spinal cord. The terminology, pathology, and neurobiological behavior of this tumor is discussed. 
5	Red cell antibodies arising from solid organ transplants. RBC antibodies arising from transplanted organs and directed against recipient RBCs represent a well-established immunohematologic complication of solid organ transplantation. In ABO-unmatched organs, the frequency and severity of graft antibodies and hemolysis generally increase with the size (lymphoid content) of the organ, from kidney to liver to heart-lung transplants. In the cases reviewed here, the frequency of hemolysis increased in cyclosporine-treated kidney transplant recipients and O-to-A liver transplant recipients and decreased in group AB liver transplant recipients and kidney transplant recipients receiving azathioprine or low-dose postoperative graft irradiation. Available data cannot otherwise distinguish which cyclosporine-treated recipients of ABO-unmatched kidneys and livers (30-40% of total) will develop graft antibody. There has been no conclusive effect to date of the age, race, or gender of the donor or the recipient, of cadaver versus living kidney donors, or of patients' A2 or secretor status. In a few cases of living-donor kidney grafts, the donor was the patient's mother or wife who had been exposed to the recipient's RBC antigens via pregnancy. The ABO antibodies are typically IgG, appear 7 to 10 days after transplantation, and last for about a month. If immediate-spin crossmatching is done routinely, DATs are recommended in compatibility testing after ABO-unmatched transplants. Changes in the immunosuppressive regimen, such as a change from cyclosporine therapy, have not affected the duration of these antibodies. Most patients require only transfusions for this self-limited process, but six cases of hemolysis-induced acute renal failure have been reported, and one death was attributed to complications of hemolysis. RBC or plasma exchange has been performed in a few fulminant cases. RBCs of the donor's blood type are given when antibody appears. Some workers recommend such transfusion as prophylaxis at the time of surgery, although in liver transplants, the plasma accompanying a large amount of group O RBCs given perioperatively might be problematic. In several other centers, ABO-unmatched liver transplants have equivalent overall graft survivals, but the Pittsburgh adult patients with hemolysis have had reduced early graft survival. In the cases reviewed here, nine IgG Rh antibodies from kidney grafts directed against recipient RBCs have been observed, usually beginning 2 to 3 weeks after a cyclosporine-treated transplant, lasting for 2 to 6 months after operation, and causing mild hemolysis. One case represented a primary immune response from a previously unsensitized donor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Pancreatic transplantation: radiologic evaluation of vascular complications. Transplantation of the pancreas is an increasingly common therapeutic option for preventing or delaying complications of type I diabetes mellitus. The authors studied the relative roles of various radiologic examinations in diagnosing vascular complications in these grafts including arterial and venous thrombosis, stenosis, and anastomotic leak (the most common vascular factors that necessitate pancreatectomy of the transplant), as defined with pathologic or arteriographic data. The results of 78 scintigraphic flow studies, 40 abdominal and pelvic computed tomographic (CT) scans, 27 sonograms, and eight color Doppler studies were evaluated in 52 patients who received a total of 27 cadaveric and 26 living-donor grafts over a 12-year period. These results were correlated with the data from 45 gross and microscopic pathologic studies and 37 arteriograms to determine their relative value in enabling detection of graft thrombosis and other vascular complications. Scintigraphy, CT, sonography, and color Doppler were all sensitive in detection of generalized graft abnormalities but lacked specificity in defining the underlying etiologic factors. 
4	Vascular lesions of the intestines. This article reviews the pathology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of vascular lesions of the intestine as a cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, a modified system for classifying such lesions, based on the author's personal experience with such lesions, is presented. 
4	Effect of 21-aminosteroid U-74006F on lipid peroxidation in subarachnoid clot. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of U-74006F on malondialdehyde (a by-product of lipid peroxidation) in subarachnoid clot. Eighteen cynomolgus monkeys were divided into three groups of six each. There were two U-74006F-treated groups, receiving doses of 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg, and a placebo-treated group. Each monkey underwent baseline cerebral angiography followed by right-sided craniectomy and placement of subarachnoid clot around the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Treatment was administered intravenously every 8 hours for 6 days. Seven days after the experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), angiography was repeated and the animals were killed. In the placebo-treated group, significant vasospasm occurred in the MCA on the side of the clot (p less than 0.01). After U-74006F treatment at both dosages, significantly less vasospasm developed in the clot-side MCA (p less than 0.01). The content of malondialdehyde was measured by both the thiobarbituric acid test and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Comparing the two methods, HPLC proved to be more accurate than the thiobarbituric acid test, especially for measurement of low concentrations of malondialdehyde. In the placebo-treated group, the malondialdehyde content was significantly increased in the Day 7 clot (p less than 0.05). In contrast, malondialdehyde content in freshly prepared clot was very low. In the 0.3-mg/kg U-74006F group, the malondialdehyde content of clot was significantly less at Day 7 compared to clot from the placebo-treated group (p less than 0.05). Although the malondialdehyde content of clot from the 1.0 mg/kg U-74006F-treated group was less than that of placebo, it was not significantly so. Malondialdehyde was not detected in the actual vessel wall of the MCA of any group. These results suggest that lipid peroxidation in subarachnoid clot may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasospasm and that the salutary effects of U-74006F in vasospasm may be mediated by a reduction of lipid peroxidation in SAH. 
4	Clinical and angiographic determinants of primary coronary angioplasty success. M-HEART Investigators. Clinical and anatomic determinants of the initial success of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were prospectively evaluated in 826 patients enrolled in the Multi-Hospital Eastern Atlantic Restenosis Trial (M-HEART). The 639 men and 187 women ranged in age from 31 to 85 years. Successful angioplasty (residual stenosis less than 50% and no major complications) was achieved in 886 (88.6%) of 1,000 lesions. Success rates were uniform among the eight individual centers. Outcome was not influenced by gender, age or other clinical features, including severity and duration of angina, prior myocardial infarction, rest pain, transient ST segment elevation, history of smoking or diabetes. In contrast, procedural outcome was significantly associated with lesion-specific angiographic factors. Stenoses 60% to 74%, 75% to 89%, 90% to 99% and 100% were associated with success rates of 96%, 90%, 84% and 69%, respectively (p less than 0.001). Angioplasty was less successful in calcified than in noncalcified lesions (82% versus 90%, p less than 0.01), in thrombotic than in nonthrombotic lesions (82% versus 90%, p less than 0.05) and in lesions in the right coronary artery than in other vessels (84% versus 90%, p less than 0.01). Outcome was not related to other anatomic variables, including lesion location (proximal versus distal), vessel size, eccentricity, stenosis length or translesional gradient. By multivariate logistic regression, preangioplasty percent stenosis, right coronary artery location and lesion calcification were demonstrated to be significant independent predictors of angioplasty success. Alternative clinical and angiographic variables did not contribute to this regression model. 
4	Prognostic value of predischarge low-level exercise thallium testing after thrombolytic treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Low-level exercise thallium testing is useful in identifying the high-risk patient after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). To determine whether this use also applies to patients after thrombolytic treatment of AMI, 64 patients who underwent early thrombolytic therapy for AMI and 107 patients without acute intervention were evaluated. The ability of both the electrocardiogram and thallium tests to predict future events was compared in both groups. After a mean follow-up of 374 days, there were 25 and 32% of cardiac events in the 2 groups, respectively, with versus without acute intervention. These included death, another AMI, coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty with 75% of the events occurring in the 3 months after the first infarction. The only significant predictors of outcome were left ventricular cavity dilatation in the intervention group and ST-segment depression and increased lung uptake in the nonintervention group. The sensitivity of exercise thallium was 55% in the intervention group and 81% in the nonintervention group (p less than 0.05). Therefore, in patients having thrombolytic therapy for AMI, nearly half the events after discharge are not predicted by predischarge low-level exercise thallium testing. The relatively weak correlation of outcome with unmasking ischemia in the laboratory before discharge may be due to an unstable coronary lesion or rapid progression of disease after the test. Tests considered useful for prognostication after AMI may not necessarily have a similar value if there has been an acute intervention, such as thrombolytic therapy. 
1	Modified Van Nes rotationplasty for osteosarcoma of the proximal tibia in children Above-knee amputation has been the traditional treatment for osteosarcoma of the proximal tibia. Recent advances in chemotherapy have encouraged the development of limb-salvage techniques. Van Nes rotationplasty for malignant lesions of the distal femur has increased in popularity as a reconstructive technique, but no similar procedure has been described for lesions of the proximal tibia. We have developed a modified rotationplasty for this lesion and have performed it in four children. The surgical technique, postoperative management and results of the procedure are described. Two patients had delayed wound healing. No other complications have developed and our patients were disease-free at follow-up, while the appearance of the leg was well accepted by the patients and their parents. This procedure is a useful addition to the armamentarium of the tumour surgeon for the treatment of malignant lesions of the proximal tibia. 
5	The child with recurrent syncope: autonomic function testing and beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity. Recurrent syncope in the child with a normal heart poses both diagnostic and therapeutic problems. To assess autonomic contributions to syncope, formal autonomic function testing was performed in 22 children (aged 7 to 18 years) with recurrent syncope and a normal heart. Autonomic testing consisted of eight to nine separate tests; 14 of the 22 patients had reproduction of syncope or symptoms during testing. Patients with a positive test had a lower norepinephrine level while supine (334 +/- 86 versus 547 +/- 169 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and lower norepinephrine level in the upright position (628 +/- 219 versus 891 +/- 270 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) than did patients with a negative test. The slope of heart rate response versus log isoproterenol dose was greater in patients with a positive test than in those with a negative test (1.70 +/- 0.70 versus 0.89 +/- 0.19, p less than 0.01). All five patients with a positive test who were given intravenous propranolol had elimination of syncope with repeat testing. Eight of 10 patients with a positive test were successfully treated with atenolol, including 2 patients without prior resolution of symptoms after pacemaker implantation for symptoms attributed to bradycardia. Beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity may cause recurrent syncope in young patients. Inappropriate heart rate response to standing may elicit the Bezold-Jarisch reflex, resulting in bradycardia or hypotension, or both, in some patients. Beta-adrenergic blockade is of benefit in many of these patients. 
1	Immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma presenting as an eyelid tumor. A 59-year-old white man presented with an ulcerating mass of the left upper eyelid of 6 months' duration. A biopsy specimen of the tumor was diagnosed as an immunoblastic T-cell malignant lymphoma. The lesion completely regressed after 4000 cGy of cobalt-60 radiation therapy. In the ensuing 33 months, multiple, widespread skin nodules of the same neoplasm developed including a right upper eyelid tumor. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of an immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma initially manifesting as an eyelid neoplasm. 
5	Infertility and eating disorders. Sixty-six consecutive infertility clinic patients were prospectively screened with the 26-item Eating Attitudes Test and a study questionnaire. Women identified as being at high risk for an eating disorder were then interviewed to confirm or refute the diagnosis. A total of 7.6% of infertility clinic women were found to suffer from anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. If eating disorders not otherwise specified were included, a total of 16.7% of infertility patients were found to suffer from an eating disorder. Among infertile women with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea 58% had eating disorders. Because women often fail to disclose eating disorders to their gynecologists and may appear to be of normal weight, it is recommended that a nutritional and eating disorder history be taken in infertility patients, particularly those with menstrual abnormalities. It has previously been shown that disorder eating and nutrition can affect menstruation, fertility, maternal weight gain, and fetal well-being. 
4	Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Emery-Dreifuss syndrome is a rare form of muscular dystrophy associated with cardiac complications that lead to sudden death. The disorder and its potential anaesthetic implications in the management of a patient who presented for orthopaedic surgery is described. 
3	Pulse oximetry during apparent tonic-clonic seizures. A pulse oximeter was used to monitor arterial oxygen saturations in 11 patients during apparent tonic-clonic seizures. 8 had a clinical diagnosis of genuine fits, 6 of whom showed striking falls in oxygen saturation during the seizures. 3 had a clinical diagnosis of pseudoseizures, none of whom had hypoxia during these episodes. Pulse oximetry during apparent tonic-clonic seizures may help to identify patients with low arterial oxygen tension who need immediate intervention. 
1	Use of m-[131I]iodobenzylguanidine in the treatment of malignant pheochromocytoma. The efficacy and safety of m-[131I]iodobenzylguanidine ([131I]MIBG) were assessed in 15 patients with malignant pheochromocytomas in a nonrandomized, single arm trial, in which patients were treated with [131I]MIBG (SA, 740 megabequerel/mg) every 3 months. Seven of these patients had bone and soft tissue metastases, 4 had only soft metastases, and 4 had only bone metastases. The follow-up period ranged from 6-54 months; the number of doses ranged from 2-11, with 2.9 (78.4 mCi) to 9.25 gigabequerel (GBq) (250 mCi)/administration and a cumulative activity from 11.1-85.90 GBq (300-2322 mCi). The absorbed cumulative dose in tumors ranged from 12-155 Gy. A beneficial effect of the treatment was observed in 9 patients (60%). No complete remission of the disease was observed. Seven patients died during the study, among whom 4 never responded to the treatment. Seven had hormonal responses (4 complete and 3 partial), with a duration ranging from 5-48 months. Among these patients, 4 relapsed, and 3 died within 3 months. Five patients had partial tumoral responses mainly located in soft tissues and for a duration ranging from 29-54 months. All patients with a hormonal response had objective improvement in clinical status and blood pressure. There was no clear-cut relationship between the cumulative dose and the responses. The main side-effect observed in 1 patient with widespread bone metastases after three doses (12.9 GBq) was a pancytopenia, which resolved after treatment was discontinued. This study suggests that repeated [131I]MIBG treatment could be effective in patients with advanced malignant pheochromocytoma. 
2	Contributions of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The salient contributions of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have made it unique. No pancreatic endocrine tumor described before (insulinoma) or subsequently (glucagonoma, somatostatinoma, vipoma, pancreatic-polypeptidoma) has been the topic of such a variety of studies, or has been such an inspiration and rich source of new ideas for investigation and ultimate improvement in patient care. 
4	Presentation and management of an acute caffeine overdose. A one-year-old white female ingested approximately two to three grams of caffeine (200-300 mg/kg). The patient survived the ingestion with a maximum caffeine concentration of 385 micrograms/ml four hours postingestion. The child developed ventricular arrhythmias, seizures, metabolic disturbances, and severe pulmonary edema. She survived without apparent long-term sequelae despite having reached a serum caffeine concentration that is the second highest reported level in a survivor. 
3	Responses of intercostal muscle biopsies from normal subjects and patients with myasthenia gravis. In order to evaluate the mechanisms of weakness in muscles of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), intercostal muscle biopsies were obtained from 9 normal subjects and 6 MG patients, and the compound muscle action potential (AP) and tension responses to nerve and muscle stimulation, and contracture responses on exposure to caffeine, were monitored in vitro. In normal muscle, on stimulation of the nerve or muscle at 30 to 100 Hz, the AP responses showed decrement in amplitude, one-third of which was attributable to failure of neuromuscular transmission and two-thirds to failure of muscle membrane excitation. On stimulation at 1 to 5 Hz, the AP responses showed very little decrement, while the contractile responses showed significant fade in tension, due to failure of E-C coupling or contractility. In muscle from patients with generalized MG, stimulation of the nerve at all frequencies (1 to 100 Hz) caused much greater decrement in APs and fade in tension responses than in normal muscle, due mainly to failure of neuromuscular transmission. However, at 100 Hz, 40% of the decrement in APs was due to failure of muscle membrane excitation, and at 1 to 5 Hz, 40% of the fade in tension was due to failure of E-C coupling or contractility, as in normal muscle. On direct stimulation the contraction and half-relaxation times were slower and the tetanic tension was smaller than in normal muscle, especially in the MG patient with thymoma. Caffeine-induced contractures were smaller in MG muscle than in normal muscle. These results indicate that while the weakness of MG muscle is due mainly to failure of neuromuscular transmission, it is also partly due to reduced E-C coupling or contractility. 
3	Individual differences in children's response to pain: role of temperament and parental characteristics. Sixty-five families were enlisted in a study exploring factors associated with distress behavior in 5-year-old children receiving diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunizations. At a home visit 1 month before the immunization, the following measures were obtained: (1) the Behavioral Style Questionnaire, a measure of temperament: (2) parental self-reports of medically related attributes (eg. "good patient"); (3) parental attitudes toward pain in children and responsiveness to their child's pain; and (4) parental prediction of distress at upcoming immunization. The child's distress behavior during the immunization was evaluated using a modification of the Procedure Rating Scale-Revised and, after the procedure, the child's assessment of his or her pain was elicited using the Oucher. Children's mean Procedure Rating Scale-Revised score was 2.57 of a possible 11. Thirty-one (48%) had low (less than or equal to 1) and 7 (11%) had high distress scores (greater than or equal to 2 SD above the mean). Factors positively correlated with distressed behavior included more "difficult child" cluster characteristics, the individual temperamental dimension of adaptability, but few parental attitudes and attributes. Parent's predictions of distress were the strongest correlates. These findings document the variation that children demonstrate in response to pain and offer some insight into associated innate and environmental factors. These results imply that treatment strategies derived from parental knowledge and tailored to individual characteristics of the child may be most effective in alleviating pain-related distress in medical settings. 
4	Age-related spontaneous intracerebral hematoma in a German community. We investigated incidence, age distribution in relation to etiology, and localization of spontaneous intracerebral hematoma in 100 consecutive cases. Incidence in the total population of the Giessen area was estimated to be greater than 11/100,000 inhabitants/yr and increased with age. There was a trend toward higher incidence in males. Overall mortality was 27%, 22% of 58 patients aged less than 70 years and 33% of 42 patients aged greater than or equal to 70 years. Hypertensive putaminal hematoma showed the highest mortality rate (42%, 10 of 24 cases). Chronic alcoholism and anticoagulant medication influenced the mortality rate unfavourably. We found the following localizations and etiologies to have a specific relation with age: 1) lobar hematomas from vascular malformations, group aged less than 40 years; 2) hypertensive putaminal hematomas and hypertensive thalamic hematomas, group aged 40-69 years; and 3) lobar hematomas, group aged greater than or equal to 70 years. Alcoholism was an additional factor in 38% of the 13 middle-aged men with hypertensive putaminal hematomas. Fourteen cases of spontaneous intracerebral hematoma were possibly due to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Six of these 14 patients had recurrent lobar hematomas, but only three of the six could be histologically investigated. In these three cases, cerebral amyloid angiopathy was proven. 
5	Proximal gastric vagotomy in the emergency treatment of bleeding duodenal ulcer. Proximal gastric vagotomy for bleeding duodenal ulcer was performed in 52 low-risk patients between 1973 and 1986. Duodenotomy without violation of the pylorus was done in all patients to allow inspection and control of the bleeding site. The median duration of operation was 3 hours and 20 minutes, although 25% of the procedures required 4 or more hours. There was no postoperative mortality and no early reoperations. Among the six patients with postoperative complications, one rebled from the ulcer and two developed prolonged gastric atony. At the time of follow-up (median, 2.9 years), 48 of the patients were alive and 4 had died of non-ulcer causes. No patient had significant postvagotomy sequelae. Ulcer recurrence was documented in six patients, and three required reoperation. Proximal gastric vagotomy is a safe, effective therapy for bleeding duodenal ulcer. Because of the length of the operation, it should be restricted to low-risk patients who are hemodynamically stable at the time of operation. 
5	Starch peritonitis. A case report and clinicopathologic review. A case of starch peritonitis is presented with a review of the history of this continuing problem. The syndrome's presentation, diagnosis, histopathology and treatment are discussed. The rarity of starch peritonitis today may be due to more attention to glove washing by surgeons, fewer impurities in the glove powder or lack of recognition of the syndrome. In order to prevent a resurgence of the starch peritonitis syndrome we must continue to emphasize the importance of washing gloves, maintain the quality control and purity of the powder used, and be cognizant of the signs and symptoms so that such cases may be managed nonoperatively. 
5	Chronic otitis media: the significance of nasal obstruction. The nasal airway resistance of 15 patients with unilateral chronic otitis media and 15 controls was measured by anterior active rhinomanometry. Airway resistance was measured on each side before and after decongestion to differentiate resistance due to structural abnormality from that due to mucosal swelling. The nasal resistance was significantly greater (P less than 0.01) on the side of the affected ear in patients with unilateral chronic otitis media before decongestion, but following decongestion the difference was not significant. Nasal obstruction is a significant determinant in unilateral chronic otitis media and although septal displacement may be the underlying cause, the major component of the obstruction appears to be due to an associated mucosal oedema. 
4	Efficacy and safety of intravenous nicardipine in the control of postoperative hypertension. IV Nicardipine Study Group. In a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study, the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) nicardipine was compared with placebo in the control of postoperative hypertension in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients. One hundred twenty-two patients (17 cardiac and 105 noncardiac surgery) met the entry criteria (systolic BP greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg) and were randomized (3:2) to receive IV nicardipine (n = 71) or placebo (n = 51). Therapeutic response (greater than or equal to 15 percent reduction in BP from baseline) was achieved in 94 percent of patients treated with IV nicardipine vs 12 percent with placebo (p less than 0.001). The mean response time and infusion rate for IV nicardipine were 11.5 (+/- 0.8) minutes and 12.8 (+/- 0.3) mg/h, respectively. The magnitude of BP reduction was similar in both cardiac and noncardiac postsurgical patients. Blood pressure control was sustained with minimal dose adjustments of IV nicardipine (3.0 +/- 0.2 mg/h) during a prolonged maintenance infusion period of 6.8 +/- 0.5 h. A reflex mean increase in heart rate of 5 bpm was seen in patients treated with IV nicardipine. Sixteen patients (15 noncardiac and one cardiac surgery) had a sustained heart rate of greater than 100 bpm, with a mean increase of 24 bpm from the baseline. In all these patients except three, tachycardia was resolved while receiving nicardipine. None of these patients who had development of tachycardia during nicardipine therapy had exhibited ST segment changes indicative of ischemia. One patient with tachycardia at baseline had exhibited ST segment depression (3 to 4 mm) during nicardipine treatment, which was resolved following discontinuation of nicardipine therapy and application of nitroglycerin (Nitropaste). Hemodynamic evaluation revealed that IV nicardipine significantly decreased mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and significantly increased cardiac index with no change in heart rate. These hemodynamic changes were similar in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients. Adverse experiences reported with IV nicardipine included hypotension (4.5 percent), tachycardia (2.7 percent), and nausea/vomiting (4.5 percent). In the placebo group, the incidence of adverse experience was 6 percent, with an equal distribution of hypotension (2 percent), nausea/vomiting (2 percent), and headache (2 percent). No clinically important changes in laboratory variables related to IV nicardipine were reported. In conclusion, these findings indicate that nicardipine, a titratable intravenous calcium channel blocker, can rapidly and effectively control postoperative hypertension in cardiac and noncardiac surgical patients. 
4	The effect of continuous drainage of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage: a retrospective analysis of 108 patients. The effects of continuous drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on vasospasm and hydrocephalus were analyzed retrospectively in 108 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who were operated on for ruptured aneurysms within 48 hours of their onset. Ninety-two of these patients underwent a procedure for CSF drainage (cisternal drainage, ventricular drainage, lumbar drainage, or a combination of these). The duration, the total volume, and the average daily volume of CSF drainage were 10.4 +/- 7.0 days (mean +/- SD). 2034 +/- 1566 ml, and 190 +/- 65.3 ml, respectively. Patients with a greater drainage volume at a lower height of drainage in the early period after SAH developed more cerebral infarctions later (P less than 0.025). The relationship between the total volume of CSF removed and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus was determined to be statistically significant (P less than 0.005). Cerebral infarction and hydrocephalus after SAH were also found to be statistically associated (P less than 0.001). Thus, continuous cerebrospinal fluid drainage should not be performed too readily in patients with SAH, because the removal of a large amount of CSF can induce cerebral vasospasm as well as hydrocephalus. 
5	Quantitative angiographic comparison of the immediate success of coronary angioplasty, coronary atherectomy and endoluminal stenting. Coronary atherectomy and coronary stenting effectively reduce the severity of coronary artery stenoses, but direct comparisons of these interventions with conventional balloon angioplasty have not been performed. To compare the immediate efficacy of these 3 interventions, the angiographic morphology and the severity of the residual coronary stenosis were quantitatively evaluated in 18 patients undergoing coronary atherectomy and in 21 patients treated by endoluminal coronary stenting. Each of these groups of patients was compared with a matched group of coronary angioplasty patients selected from a large, computerized data-base. The variables matched included patient age and sex, lesions site and severity, and lesion complexity. Both coronary atherectomy and coronary stenting more effectively reduced the severity of the coronary stenosis when compared with balloon angioplasty. The luminal diameter stenosis was reduced from 69 +/- 10 to 22 +/- 20% in the atherectomy group compared with a reduction from 74 +/- 11 to 44 +/- 14% in the matched coronary angioplasty population (p = 0.008). Similarly, the luminal diameter stenosis was reduced from 77 +/- 11 to 26 +/- 12% in the stented group compared with a reduction from 81 +/- 10 to 42 +/- 14% in the matched coronary angioplasty group (p = 0.014). In addition, moderate or severe coronary dissections were noted more frequently in the coronary angioplasty groups than in their respective atherectomy and stent groups (0 vs 33%, p = 0.008, and 5 vs 19%, p = 0.15, respectively). 
5	Dietary management of acute childhood diarrhea: optimal timing of feeding and appropriate use of milks and mixed diets. Several recent clinical trials have examined the optimal timing of feeding and the appropriate foods for use in the dietary management of acute childhood diarrhea. Important methodologic issues relevant to these trials, such as the composition and masking of study diets, measurement of outcome variables, and assessment of nutritional status, are discussed. Available data suggest that feeding should be continued during diarrhea, although a small subgroup of patients receiving nonhuman milk exclusively may have an excess rate of complications. These children should be closely supervised or provided with alternative diets. By contrast, children receiving human milk, nonmilk formulas, and mixed diets are generally able to tolerate these foods and to benefit nutritionally from continued feeding. 
5	Onset of induced atrial flutter in the canine pericarditis model To test the hypothesis that induced atrial flutter evolves from a transitional rhythm, the onset of 99 episodes of induced atrial flutter (mean cycle length 135 +/- 18 ms) lasting greater than 5 min in 40 dogs with sterile pericarditis was first characterized. In 85 (86%) of the 99 episodes, atrial flutter was preceded by a brief period (mean 1.4 +/- 0.9 s, range 0.4 to 42) of atrial fibrillation. Then, in 11 open chest studies, atrial electrograms were recorded simultaneously from 95 pairs of right atrial electrodes during the onset of 18 episodes of induced atrial flutter (mean cycle length 136 +/- 16 ms). Atrial flutter was induced by a train of eight paced atrial beats, followed by one or two premature atrial beats (7 episodes) or rapid atrial pacing (11 episodes). A short period of atrial fibrillation (mean cycle length 110 +/- 7 ms) induced by atrial pacing activated the right atrium through wave fronts, which produced a localized area of slow conduction. Then unidirectional conduction block of the wave front occurred for one beat in all or a portion of the area of slow conduction. This permitted the unblocked wave front to turn around an area of functional block and return through the area of slow conduction that had developed the unidirectional conduction block, thereby initiating the reentrant circuit. The location of the unidirectional block relative to the direction of the circulating wave fronts determined whether the circus movement was clockwise or counterclockwise. The area of slow conduction and unidirectional conduction block occurred where the wave front crossed perpendicular to the orientation of the atrial muscle fibers, suggesting a role for anisotropic conduction. These areas included the high right atrial portion of the sulcus terminalis (10 episodes), the low right atrial portion of the sulcus terminalis (4 episodes) and the pectinate muscle region (4 episodes). It is concluded that the development of a localized area of slow conduction in the right atrium followed by unidirectional conduction block in this area produced during a short period of atrial fibrillation or rapid atrial pacing is necessary for atrial flutter to occur in this model. 
4	Hemodynamic profiles of prostaglandin E1, isoproterenol, prostacyclin, and nifedipine in experimental porcine pulmonary hypertension. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We compared the hemodynamic effects of four vasodilators in experimental embolic pulmonary hypertension in a randomized controlled trial, using nine pigs weighing 16 to 23 kg. After anesthesia induction and cannulation with arterial, central venous, and thermodilution output pulmonary artery catheters, animals were repetitively embolized with glass beads (60 to 160 mu) in order to establish pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure [PAP] doubled from baseline). Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), isoproterenol, prostacyclin (PGI2), and nifedipine were compared at doses producing equivalent reduction in systemic BP. RESULTS: Only PGE1 and PGI2 decreased both PAP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). PGE1 decreased PAP from 39 +/- 1 to 33 +/- 1 mm Hg; prostacyclin decreased PAP from 38 +/- 1 to 31 +/- 1 mm Hg and produced the largest increase in cardiac output (Qt). Isoproterenol did not change PAP, markedly increased heart rate (162 +/- 8 to 216 +/- 11 beats/min), and resulted in significant arrhythmias. Nifedipine increased PVR from 1044 +/- 113 to 1125 +/- 100 dyne.sec.cm-5 and decreased Qt. CONCLUSIONS: Vasodilators demonstrate unique hemodynamic drug profiles. Isoproterenol infusion is characterized by tachycardia and arrhythmias. Both PGE1 and PGI2 effectively decrease PAP and PVR. Nifedipine depressed Qt significantly in this glass-bead embolization model of acute pulmonary hypertension. 
5	Genetics of NIDDM. This brief review discusses the current level of understanding of the role of genetic defects in the etiology of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and the use of molecular-genetic methods for this study. Evidence for genetic susceptibility is strong, and defects in both insulin production and action are suspect. With restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms and genomic sequencing, various candidate loci are being evaluated. Evidence that multiple genes are involved is only circumstantial. If NIDDM is genetically heterogeneous and also influenced by environmental components, population associations and linkage analyses in families may not be as easily interpreted as for diseases involving single major gene defects. 
5	How and why aztreonam works. Aztreonam is the first monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic (monobactam) to be tested clinically. Its synthetic structure determines specific areas of activity, including enhanced activity against Pseudomonas species, exceptional activity against gram-negative bacteria, stability to beta-lactamases and lack of activity against gram-positive bacteria--all of which can be directly related to its chemical composition. Aztreonam has a high affinity for the protein-binding protein 3 (PBP-3) of aerobic gram-negative bacteria. Most of these organisms are inhibited and killed at low concentrations of the drug. Aztreonam binds poorly to PBP sites of the aerobic gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria and consequently has relatively poor inhibitory effects against these bacteria. In vitro, minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values against almost all of the Enterobacteriaceae and against Neisseria and Haemophilus strains are typically below 1 microgram per milliliter. MIC values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa of 8 micrograms per milliliter are comparable with those of other antipseudomonal beta-lactams and the acylureidopenicillins. As combination therapy with amino-glycosides, aztreonam acts in synergy against P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter and gentamicin-resistant gram-negative rods. Aztreonam is widely distributed in the body tissues and fluids, and the average elimination half-life is 1.7 hours. Intramuscular dosing results in peak serum levels in approximately one hour, while intravenous dosing results in peak levels within five minutes. After a 2 gram dose given intravenously, MIC90 values for most of the Enterobacteriaceae are exceeded for eight hours, and those for P. aeruginosa, for almost six hours. The steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 0.18 liter per kilogram. Concentrations above the MIC90 for most gram-negative bacteria are also present within bone, prostate and cerebrospinal fluid. Between 60 and 70 per cent of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, resulting in concentrations approximating 3,000 micrograms per milliliter two hours after a 1 gram dose given intravenously. Serum clearance of aztreonam is directly proportional to creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustment must, therefore, be made in the presence of reduced clearance. Dosing varies between 0.5 and 2.0 grams every six to 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection. The characteristics of aztreonam suggest that it is a useful nonnephrotoxic drug for treatment of aerobic gram-negative infection. 
3	Tilt test for diagnosis of unexplained syncope in pediatric patients. Thirty-five teenage patients with a history of presyncope or syncope underwent a passive head-up tilting to reproduce symptoms of syncope. If tilting alone did not induce syncope, isoproterenol infusion was given to increase heart rate to 150 to 160 beats per minute. In 80% of patients with a history of syncope, identical symptoms could be reproduced during tilting: an abrupt fall in blood pressure combined with profound nodal bradycardia, ranging from 32 to 86 beats per minute. These symptoms were quickly reversed by returning the patient to the supine position. For patients with frequent occurrences of syncope, especially when there was a history of trauma sustained during these episodes, a therapeutic regimen of either beta blockers or 9 alpha-fluorocortisol was begun. The mechanisms of this common cause of syncope in childhood is neurocardiogenic in response to venous pooling and catecholamine-induced tachycardia. The tilt test is an excellent and cost-effective test for the workup of unexplained syncope in childhood. 
5	Visual loss with dancing extremities and mental disturbances. A case is reported of a teenage girl, who presented with a profound loss of vision in the right eye, secondary to retinal vasculitis. During the preceding year, a gradual change in her personality had been noted, associated with a deterioration in her intellect. She developed an area of pigment epithelial disturbance in the macular region of the right eye, and subsequently, optic atrophy. One year after this, she had a similar, but more localized episode in the left eye. She later developed involuntary movements, and two years after initial presentation, a diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was made. Subsequently her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and she died. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. This case demonstrates the insidious nature of the disease and suggests that the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis should be considered in any child or young adult who presents with unexplained retinal vasculitis, maculopathy or chorioretinitis. 
2	Spontaneous rupture of liver during pregnancy: current therapy. Spontaneous hepatic rupture secondary to severe pregnancy-induced hypertension is associated with a high rate of maternal and fetal mortality. Numerous types of surgical management have been described, but a uniform surgical approach has not been accepted. The purpose of this review was to examine modes of surgical therapy reported in the literature since 1976, as well as the 11-year experience at our institution. Twenty-eight cases were extracted from the literature and seven more were identified at our institution. The incidence in our population was one per 45,145 live births. Among 27 cases managed by packing and drainage, an 82% overall survival was achieved, whereas only 25% of eight patients undergoing hepatic lobectomy survived (P = .006). Hepatic hemorrhage with persistent hypotension unresponsive to blood products should be managed by evacuating the hematoma, packing the damaged liver, and draining the operative site. More aggressive surgical techniques, such as hepatic artery ligation or hepatic lobectomy, should be reserved for refractory cases. 
2	Selective dopamine DA1 stimulation with fenoldopam in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a systemic, splanchnic and renal hemodynamic study. We studied the effects of fenoldopam, a selective dopamine DA1 agonist on systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics, renal blood flow and sodium excretion in 12 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and ascites. Hepatic, azygos and renal veins were catheterized before and after intravenous administration of fenoldopam, 0.05 micrograms/kg/min for 1 hr and increased to 0.1 micrograms/kg/min for another hour. Mean arterial pressure progressively decreased (from 83 +/- 7 to a minimum of 77 +/- 8 mm Hg 100 min after starting the infusion) but returned to baseline level at 120 min. Plasma norepinephrine and renin activity increased (respectively from 567 +/- 297 to 919 +/- 375 pg/ml, p less than 0.05, and from 17 +/- 14 to 23 +/- 15 ng/ml/hr, p less than 0.05). Renal blood flow, urine output or sodium excretion did not change. Sodium output decreased at 1 hr from 6.9 mumol/min to 4.0 mumol/min, p less than 0.05. Both hepatic venous pressure gradient and azygos blood flow significantly increased by 21%. We conclude that the acute administration of fenoldopam did not improve renal hemodynamics or function in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. In addition, dopamine DA1 agonism caused further increases in norepinephrine concentration and plasma renin activity. Portal pressure also increased, probably because of an increase in mesenteric blood flow. These results question the renal benefit and raise concern about the use of dopamine agonists in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. 
4	Predicting the appropriate use of carotid endarterectomy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and coronary angiography BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In a nationally representative population 65 years of age or older, we have demonstrated that about one quarter of coronary angiographies and upper gastrointestinal endoscopies and two thirds of carotid endarterectomies were performed for reasons that were less than medically appropriate. In this paper we examine whether specific characteristics of patients (age, sex, and race), physicians (age, board-certification status, and experience with the procedure), or hospitals (teaching status, profit-making status, and size) predict whether a procedure will be performed appropriately. RESULTS. In general, we found that little of the variability in the appropriateness of care (4 percent or less) could be explained on the basis of standard, easily obtainable data about the patient, the physician, or the hospital. For all three procedures, however, performance in a teaching hospital increased the likelihood that the reasons would be medically appropriate (P = 0.09 for angiography, P = 0.30 for endoscopy, and P less than 0.01 for endarterectomy). In addition, angiographies were more often performed for appropriate reasons in older or more affluent patients (P less than 0.01 for both). Being treated by a surgeon who performed a high rather than a low number of procedures decreased the likelihood of an appropriate endarterectomy by one third, from 40 to 28 percent (P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. Appropriateness of care cannot be closely predicted from many easily determined characteristics of patients, physicians, or hospitals. Thus, for the present, if appropriateness is to be improved it will have to be assessed directly at the level of each patient, hospital, and physician. 
1	Ten cases of transitional cell carcinoma of bladder causing ureteric obstruction. A review was carried out on 10 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (Ta lesions) that were causing ureteric obstruction. Evidence of upper tract obstruction did not necessarily indicate deep invasion. 
5	Neuro-imaging and positron emission tomography of congenital homonymous hemianopsia. Congenital homonymous hemianopsia is an uncommon asymptomatic visual field defect discovered typically in young adult life that is caused by a diverse group of insults to the retrochiasmal afferent visual system occurring prenatally, at birth, or during early childhood. We treated eight patients with congenital homonymous hemianopsia; seven with damage involving the optic radiations and one with an abnormality of the optic tract. We performed positron emission tomography using 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose on two patients with dense homonymous hemianopsias, lesions of the contralateral optic radiations, and largely intact occipital cortex. These studies showed minimal abnormalities in resting visual cortex glucose metabolism of the affected visual cortex. 
4	Impaired pressor reactivity in cirrhosis: evidence for a peripheral vascular defect. The blood pressure responses to intravenous infusions of norepinephrine and angiotensin II, sympathetic and nonsympathetic vasoconstricting agents, respectively, were measured in 20 patients with cirrhosis (10 Child-Pugh grade A and 10 Child-Pugh grades B or C) and in 20 healthy subjects. The log PD20 (dose of agonist required to raise blood pressure by 20 mm Hg) for norepinephrine was 4.78 +/- 0.36 (mean +/- S.D.) in patients with severe cirrhosis and 4.36 +/- 0.37 in controls, p less than 0.01. Log PD20 for angiotensin II was 3.16 +/- 1.06 in patients with severe cirrhosis and 1.97 +/- 0.74 in controls, p less than 0.01. Cardiovascular responses to selective sympathetic agonists were measured in 10 other cirrhotic patients (all Child-Pugh grades B or C) and in 10 healthy controls. Log PD20s for phenylephrine, an alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, and for alphamethylnorepinephrine; an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, were increased in cirrhosis (phenylephrine = 5.35 +/- 0.49 vs. 4.95 +/- 0.35, p less than 0.05; alphamethylnorepinephrine = 4.05 +/- 0.26 vs. 3.44 +/- 0.55, p less than 0.001). In contrast, log CD20 (dose of agonist required to raise the heart rate by 20 beats/min) for isoproterenol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, was similar in cirrhotic patients and controls (2.81 +/- 0.38 vs. 2.94 +/- 0.45, p = 0.49). These studies demonstrate that pressor reactivity to both sympathetic and nonsympathetic agonists is impaired in severe cirrhosis, that the impaired sympathetic responses are not caused by generalized sympathetic desensitization and that the site common to the four agonists with impaired responses is the peripheral vascular smooth muscle. 
4	Free and peptide-bound amino acids as indicators of ischemic damage of the rabbit spinal cord. The concentrations of free and peptide-bound amino acids aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu), glycine (Gly) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were studied following ischemia and recirculation in the ventral and dorsal gray matter of the rabbit spinal cord. No changes in the concentration of amino acids following ten minutes (min) of ischemia and four days of recovery were found. The most significant change after 20 min, and especially 40 min, of ischemia was a decrease in free Asp and GABA levels in both parts of the gray matter. The relatively greater decrease in the concentration of free amino acids in the ventral horns corresponds with the greater morphological damage to this part of spinal cord following ischemia. Following 40 min of ischemia and recirculation decrease in peptide-bound Glu in the ventral horns and Asp and Glu in the dorsal horns was found. 
4	Surgical management of pericardial effusion in patients with malignancies. Comparison of subxiphoid window versus pericardiectomy. There is a lack of consensus regarding optimal surgical management of symptomatic pericardial effusions in patients with malignancies. Subxiphoid pericardial window formation (subxiphoid pericardial drainage) has been considered a safe and effective method for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. To ensure adequate drainage, many surgeons prefer the formation of a larger pericardial window by performing either an anterior thoracotomy or a partial/total pericardiectomy. To evaluate the efficacy of these methods for palliation of symptomatic pericardial effusion in patients with malignancy, 28 consecutive pericardial surgery cases involving patients with malignancy were retrospectively analyzed. Ten patients (Group 1) had subxiphoid window formation, whereas 18 patients (Group 2) had partial or total pericardiectomy or pericardial window formation by anterior thoracotomy. There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.22) in the survival rates between these two groups. A median survival time of 2.67 months (range, 0.43 to 26.6 months) was observed in Group 1 versus 1.23 months (range, 0.03 to 10.83 months) in Group 2. However, a statistically significant difference (P less than or equal to 0.02) in postoperative morbidity was observed between the two groups: 67% in Group 2 versus 10% in Group 1. Because of lower morbidity, subxiphoid pericardial window formation is recommended by this study as the preferred surgical method for palliation of symptomatic pericardial effusion in patients with malignancy. 
3	Pharmacology of recovery after stroke. Laboratory research during the past decade has begun to provide insights into the neurobiologic basis of functional recovery after brain injury. It is clear that drugs influencing specific neurotransmitters also can influence the recovery process. Some of these drugs may be beneficial, but others may be detrimental. Some of the difficulties in interpreting the results of these behavioral studies are reviewed, and potential mechanisms of drug effects are discussed. These types of studies are leading to an increased awareness of the potentially harmful effects of some drugs often given to stroke patients. Pharmacotherapy designed to enhance functional recovery after stroke may be possible in the future. 
1	Significance of anti-HBx antibodies in hepatitis B virus infection. Serological responses to hepatitis B virus-X determinants have been noted in human sera, but conflicting findings concerning the correlation of anti-HBx antibodies with different stages of hepatitis B virus infection or pathological sequelae have been reported. Using an adenovirus-based eukaryotic vector, the 17 kD X protein was efficiently expressed in 293 cells. Cellular extracts containing the eukaryotic X protein have been used to screen for anti-HBx antibodies by immunoblot analysis in a large panel of sera from patients affected by hepatitis B virus chronic hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma and acute viral hepatitis. Sera from 32 of 171 (19%) chronic hepatitis B virus patients were positive for anti-HBx antibodies. Only one of thirty-two (3%) HBsAg-negative, anti-HBs/anti-HBc-positive chronic hepatitis serum was anti-HBx positive. Very few sera from primary hepatocellular carcinoma patients showed positivity for anti-HBx (8 of 149 or 5%). Anti-HBx were also detected in 8 of 48 (17%) acute viral hepatitis patients. In the four cases that were followed up weekly, anti-HBx antibodies appeared 3 to 4 wk after the onset of the clinical signs. To compare the X protein expressed in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells as a substrate for anti-HBx antibody detection, 171 sera were screened with HBx fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. The prokaryotic cell extract test seems to be more sensitive. During the chronic phase of hepatitis B virus infection, the presence of anti-HBx antibodies detected with the eukaryotic cell extract correlates with the presence of well-established markers of ongoing viral replication: serum hepatitis B virus-DNA (p less than 0.001) and intrahepatic HBcAg expression (p less than 0.001). 
1	Follicular cell predominance in the cytologic examination of dominant thyroid nodules indicates a sixty percent incidence of neoplasia. The interpretation of aspiration cytologic smears that contain a predominance of follicular components often presents a dilemma to the clinician who is treating a patient who has a dominant thyroid nodule, especially when thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression does not produce any significant involution of the dominant nodule. We reviewed a consecutive series of 555 fine-needle aspiration cytologic examinations of dominant thyroid nodules. All specimens that contained colloid or follicular cells mixed with lymphocytes or Hurthle cells were excluded from this review. Additionally, nine aspirates contained degenerated follicular cells with insufficient material for cytologic diagnosis. The remaining 76 specimens contained a predominance of follicular cells: 27 specimens were interpreted as containing "normal" follicular cells, and the remaining 49 specimens were read as "atypical" follicular cells. Histopathologic examination of the resected specimens indicated a 60% incidence of neoplasia (30% carcinoma, 30% adenoma) in which the aspiration cytologic study was interpreted as "normal" follicular cells. On the other hand, a 63% incidence of neoplasia (27% carcinoma, 36% adenoma) occurred in which the cytologic study was read as "atypical." In conclusion, aspirates showing a predominance of follicular cells, whether "normal" or "atypical" indicate a 60% incidence of neoplasia in dominant thyroid nodules that do not decrease significantly in size with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression. 
4	Unfavorable outcome following early surgical repair of ruptured cerebral aneurysms--a critical review of 238 patients. Among 238 consecutive patients admitted early with ruptured cerebral aneurysms, surgical repair within 48-72 hours was feasible in 200 cases. Unfavorable outcomes among the latter 200 patients are analyzed and discussed in this paper. Preoperatively, 148 patients were in Hunt and Hess grades I-III, 33 were in grade IV, and 19 in grade V. After clipping of the aneurysm, all patients received a regimen of topical intracisternal and intravenous/peroral medication with the calcium antagonist nimodipine. The overall rate of unfavorable outcomes was 25%, ie, outcome with moderate or severe deficit or lethal outcome. The reasons for unfavorable outcomes among these 49 patients were the devastating effect of the bleed (severe subarachnoid hemorrhage or additional intracerebral hemorrhage) in 31 patients (15% of the 200 patients), a surgical complication in 11 (5.5%), preoperative rebleeding in three (1.5%), delayed ischemia from vasospasm in one (0.5%), and various others in three further patients (1.5%). Unfavorable outcome occurred in 11% of patients with preoperative grades I-III, in 52% of patients with grade IV, and in 16 of 19 patients with grade V. Among the 141 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage but not intracerebral or intraventricular hematoma, 16 made an unfavorable outcome, ie, 11% versus 56% among patients with intracerebral hematoma/intraventricular hematoma on preoperative computed tomography scan. The present data seem to speak in favor of early surgery. Since half of the patients with intracerebral hematoma and poor outcome had suffered previous warning leaks, it appears to be a continuing challenge to diagnose warning leaks before a massive hemorrhage occurs. 
5	Heterotopic liver transplantation for fulminant Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease may present with severe acute hepatocellular failure. The only effective treatment for fulminant Wilson's disease is liver transplantation, which may lead to reversal of the underlying disease. Some patients with cirrhosis who are too ill to undergo orthotopic liver transplantation have been treated with heterotopic liver transplantation. However, use of heterotopic liver transplantation for fulminant hepatocellular failure has not been successful. This case study involves a patient in whom a heterotopic liver transplant was successfully used for treatment of Wilson's disease presenting with fulminant hepatocellular failure. 
4	Comparison of right ventricular and biventricular circulatory support in a porcine model of right heart failure. The effects of right ventricular (RVAD) and biventricular assist devices (BVAD) in an acute porcine model of right heart ischemic failure produced by occluding the right coronary artery for 2 min (RCAO) were compared. Right and left ventricular pressures were measured with Millar transducers and respective septal-to-free wall dimensions (RVSFWD, LVSFWD) with ultrasonic crystals. RCAO alone resulted in significant right heart failure, marked by a 36 +/- 5% reduction in cardiac output (pulmonary artery flow) and a 54 +/- 16% reduction in RV stroke work. Isolated RVAD significantly improved the hemodynamic conditions by restoring pulmonary blood flow and left heart filling to control levels. RVAD also resulted in reduced RVSFWD to control levels and increased LVSFWD via a rightward septal shift due to right heart unloading. Biventricular support resulted in the same hemodynamic improvement, but estimated LV peak systolic wall stress was reduced by 65 +/- 15% compared with control, due to concomitant LV unloading and reductions in LVSFWD. Therefore, either right or biventricular devices are effective in treating RV failure. The advantage of biventricular support is that the left ventricle is also unloaded, thus allowing improved circulatory support with minimal LV wall stress. 
5	Dietary intake in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), patients with AIDS-related complex, and serologically positive human immunodeficiency virus patients: correlations with nutritional status. One of the major clinical manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex (ARC) is the development of cachexia. This most likely results from a multifactorial interplay of poor diet, malabsorption, and altered metabolism. To assess the potential role of nutrient intake in the development or persistence of malnutrition, a detailed analysis was performed of a 72-hr diet record in clinically stable patients with AIDS (N = 18), ARC (N = 12) and in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive controls without significant manifestations of disease (N = 13). Total calorie intake was 39.1 +/- 13.2 kcal/kg/day in AIDS patients vs 34.6 +/- 7.8 kcal/kg/day in ARC patients or 31.9 +/- 17.7 kcal/kg/day in HIV seropositive cases (all p = NS). Likewise, mean protein intakes were similar among the groups and exceeded recommended daily dietary allowance (RDA) guidelines. The mean body weight changes from the inception of illness were -11 +/- 1% in AIDS, -6 +/- 7% in ARC, vs +3 +/- 2% in HIV-seropositive-only cases (p less than 0.05 vs AIDS and ARC). Dietary vitamin and mineral analysis revealed that 88% of AIDS, 88% of HIV seropositive, and 89% of ARC patients were ingesting less than 50% RDA for at least one nutrient. The mean number of deficiencies per patient was 1.8 +/- 1.3 in AIDS, 3.8 +/- 3.5 in ARC, and 2.9 +/- 2.5 in HIV-seropositive-only cases (p less than 0.05 AIDS vs ARC). There were no significant correlations between specific anthropometric measurements and dietary intakes of protein or fat. 
2	Intermittent obstruction of an incarcerated hiatal hernia with a total thoracic stomach. A case of intermittent obstruction of a sliding hiatal hernia is presented. The obstruction occurred when the patient's stomach was totally above the diaphragm. The anatomy of sliding hiatal hernias is discussed, as well as the presenting signs and symptoms of obstruction in sliding hiatal hernias. 
5	Trochanteric fractures. Influence of reduction and implant position on impaction and complications. A review of roentgenograms and charts was made of 532 trochanteric fractures treated by the sliding-screw technique. According to Evans' modified classification, 65% of the fractures were unstable. There was no breakage or bending of implants. Twenty (3.8%) reoperations were performed because of technical complications or nonunion. The Singh index revealed more unstable fractures and technical complications in hips with Grades 1-3 than in hips with Grades 4-6. Reoperation was more frequent if the screw tip was within 8 mm from the subchondral line in the superolateral quadrant or in the anteroproximal quadrant than if the screw ended farther from the subchondral line. Fifty-five (10.8%) of the lag screws migrated 2 mm or more. Postoperatively, the neck-shaft angle decreased more in unstable fractures than in stable fractures. The decrease in neck-shaft angle was less when the proximal fragment impinged medially on the shaft fragment. Unstable fractures with this type of reduction also impacted less than hips with anatomic reduction or medial reduction of the shaft fragment. Weight bearing did not significantly influence the degree of impaction. 
1	The use of monoclonal antibody 44-3A6 in cell blocks in the diagnosis of lung carcinoma, carcinomas metastatic to lung and pleura, and pleural malignant mesothelioma. Monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 44-3A6 recognizes a glandular differentiation-associated antigen and has been used to identify exocrine differentiation in pulmonary carcinomas. The authors assessed its value in the diagnosis of lung carcinomas metastatic to lung/pleura and pleural malignant mesothelioma (MM), using cell blocks derived from cytologic specimens. Sixty-three primary lung carcinomas, 31 metastatic adenocarcinomas (ACs) (from breast, gastrointestinal tract, or genitourinary tract), and 36 MMs were immunostained with 44-3A6, Leu-M1, and anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The results confirm the value of 44-3A6 in identifying ACs but do not allow distinction between those of pulmonary, breast, GIT, or ovarian mucinous derivation. Endometrial, ovarian serous, and renal ACs are essentially nonreactive, as are almost all MMs. The occurrence of one positive MM predicates caution in interpreting 44-3A6 positivity in isolation, but, judiciously used with other discriminating antibodies such as Leu-M1 and anti-CEA, 44-3A6 is of value in the differential diagnosis of ACs and MMs. Further, its applicability to cytologic specimens may obviate the need for more invasive diagnostic procedures and lead to rapid, accurate diagnosis. 
1	Physiologic and psychobehavioral research in oncology. A major thrust in research in psychosocial oncology is the study of the interaction of psychologic and physiologic variables. This discussion reviews the current status and future directions of such research. Areas addressed include pain, nausea and vomiting with chemotherapy, sexuality, effects of cancer on psychologic and neuropsychologic function, impact of psychologic factors on cancer and its treatment, and psychoneuroimmunology. In addition, specific recommendations for strategies to facilitate research in these areas of psychosocial oncology are proposed. 
5	Mastectomy following preoperative chemotherapy. Strict operative criteria control operative morbidity. The surgical morbidity associated with aggressive preoperative chemotherapy in 106 patients with advanced primary breast cancer who had chemotherapy followed by mastectomy was examined. These patients were compared with a group of 91 consecutive patients who had mastectomy without preoperative chemotherapy. Strict operative criteria were used to determine the timing of mastectomy following chemotherapy. Wound infection rates were no different in the preoperative chemotherapy group compared to the mastectomy-alone groups (7% versus 4%; p = 0.62). The incidence of wound necrosis was similar (11% versus 6%; p = 0.29). Seroma formation was decreased significantly in the preoperative chemotherapy group compared to the mastectomy-alone group (15% versus 28%; p = 0.04). Intensive preoperative chemotherapy did not delay the reinstitution of postoperative treatment (30% versus 20%; p = 0.27). However, when delay in instituting postoperative chemotherapy was more than 30 days, there was a significant decrease in overall survival rate (p = 0.04). This study provides evidence that intensive preoperative chemotherapy and mastectomy can be performed without increased morbidity. Furthermore it is important to institute systemic chemotherapy within 30 days of mastectomy to achieve maximum survival. 
4	Effects of long-term coenzyme Q10 and captopril treatment on survival and functional capacity in rats with experimentally induced heart infarction. The effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) and captopril on functional capacity, hemodynamics and survival were studied in 154 rats that recovered after experimental myocardial infarction. Rats were randomized into four groups receiving either CoQ, captopril, a combination of the two drugs or 1 ml of tap water once daily for 12 weeks from the day of coronary artery ligation. CoQ as well as captopril and the combined treatment significantly improved exercise capacity as evaluated by lactate production during a standardized treadmill exercise test. No significant changes in heart rate or mean blood pressure were observed during the study in the captopril-treated group. CoQ treatment increased the maximum heart rate significantly, whereas no effect on mean blood pressure was observed. Both captopril and CoQ decreased pulmonary congestion. Furthermore, the data may suggest that captopril prevents right ventricular hypertrophy seen in placebo-treated rats with large infarcts. This was not observed after CoQ treatment. Captopril treatment improved 3-month probability of survival (93%) as compared with placebo (74%) (P less than .05). CoQ and the combined treatment tended to improve survival, but this was, however, not statistically significant. 
5	The anatomy and physiology of nerve injury. Nerves have a structure of considerable complexity with features of special relevance to nerve injury and nerve regeneration. These include variations in the cross-sectional areas devoted to fascicular and epineurial tissue, the fascicular redistribution and mixing of different branch fibers brought about by fascicular plexuses, and the numbers of nerve fibers representing individual branches. The elasticity and tensile strength of nerve trunks and their capacity to resist traction deformation reside in the fascicular tissue, while the epineurium provides a protective cushion against compression. The microstructure of nerve trunks provides the basis for a classification of nerve injuries into five degrees of severity with partial and mixed types--each with a clearly defined pathology and distinguishing clinical features. Following a transection injury, changes occur in the severed axons, endoneurial tubes, fasciculi, and nerve trunk. The type of injury and the nature of these changes determine the outcome of axon regeneration. 
1	Insulin-like growth factor I expression by tumors of neuroectodermal origin with the t(11;22) chromosomal translocation. A potential autocrine growth factor. Expression of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mRNA by some tumor cell lines of neuroectodermal origin has been described. To further explore the significance of IGF-I mRNA expression in these tumors, a more extensive analysis was performed. Most (9 of 10) neuroectodermal tumor cell lines with a t(11;22) translocation (primitive neuroectodermal tumor [PNET], Ewing's sarcoma, esthesioneuroblastoma) expressed IGF-I mRNA, whereas 0 of 15 cell lines without the translocation (PNET, neuroblastoma) expressed IGF-I. Furthermore, inasmuch as all neuroblastoma (12 of 12) cell lines examined expressed IGF-II RNA, the pattern of IGF expression could distinguish between these closely related tumors. CHP-100, a PNET cell line with the t(11;22) translocation, was shown to secrete both IGF-I protein and an IGF binding protein, IGFBP-2. This cell line also expressed the type I IGF receptor mRNA, and blockade of this receptor by a monoclonal antibody (alpha IR3) inhibited serum-free growth. These data demonstrate that IGF-I expression is a property of neuroectodermal tumors with a t(11;22) translocation and that interruption of an IGF-I autocrine loop inhibits the growth of these tumor cells. 
3	Postoperative lumbar spinal instability occurring or progressing secondary to laminectomy. The manifestations and pathomechanism of postoperative lumbar spinal instability, occurring or progressing secondary to laminectomy, was clarified by means of functional radiographic analysis in a series of 46 patients over 40 years of age. The relation between instability and the clinical symptoms also is discussed. In patients under 60 years of age, instability at the operated level tended to appear in cases of wide laminectomy more often than in cases of partial laminectomy. Occurrence or progress of instability seems to be promoted by resection of the posterior spinal elements rather than the disc. It is further considered that the postoperative aggravation of clinical symptoms may be influenced not only by instability, but also by the other factors. 
2	Poisoning with equine phenylbutazone in a racetrack worker. Phenylbutazone is a potent nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug often used by veterinarians to treat racetrack animals. Its use in human beings is limited because of significant adverse effects and the availability of newer, safer drugs. We report the case of a 24-year-old man who ingested 17 g of equine phenylbutazone over a 24-hour period to treat the pain of a toothache. He developed grand mal seizures, coma, hypotension, respiratory and renal failure, and hepatic injury. Serum phenylbutazone concentration obtained approximately eight hours after presentation was 900 micrograms/mL. The patient recovered during six weeks of intensive supportive care and repeated hemodialysis. 
3	Botulinum A toxin for the treatment of adult-onset spasmodic torticollis. Thirty-five patients with adult-onset idiopathic torticollis were treated by local injections of botulinum A toxin into dystonic cervical muscles. Substantial improvement with respect to reduction and elimination of pain was found in 81 percent, improvement in posture deformity and involuntary spasms in 70 percent, increased range of motion of the neck in 78 percent, reduction in visible sternocleidomastoid hypertrophy in 86 percent, and improvement in tremor in 65 percent. The syndrome was divided into four subtypes based on pattern of dystonic muscle groups involved in the dystonia, head and shoulder posture, and sternocleidomastoid muscle hypertrophy. Injection strategy based on this subdivision is described. 
4	Involvement of sodium in the protective effect of 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride on ischemia-reperfusion injury in isolated rat ventricular wall. During reperfusion in the isolated right ventricular wall of the rat after 60 min of ischemia, developed tension and resting tension were 35 +/- 4 and 221 +/- 12%, respectively, of preischemic values. Including 35 microM ouabain in the perfusate before and after ischemia resulted in more severe cardiac dysfunction during reperfusion than in drug-untreated hearts. Introduction of the Na(+)-H+ exchange inhibitor, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), could effectively protect the right ventricular wall against ischemia-reperfusion dysfunction in the presence or absence of ouabain. The ion content in the right ventricular wall was measured with atomic absorbance spectrophotometry. Before ischemia, Na+,Ca++ and K+ content were 53.4 +/- 6.4, 2.70 +/- 0.22 and 262 +/- 7.7 mumol/g of dry weight tissue, respectively. After 60 min of ischemia and 6 min of reperfusion, Na+,Ca++ and K+ content were 73.4 +/- 7.2, 3.79 +/- 0.31 and 180 +/- 15 mumol/g of dry weight tissue, respectively (P less than .05). Introduction of 20 microM DMA normalized ion content in the muscles which was consistent with the contractile function recovery during reperfusion. The data suggest that a rise in intracellular Na+ in the early stage of reperfusion represents a crucial or primary step for the development of cardiac contractile dysfunction. DMA, which protects against severe reperfusion-induced cardiac contractile dysfunction, appears to act via a normalization of tissue sodium levels. This action is consistent with its proposed role as a blocker of transsarcolemmal Na(+)-H+ exchange. 
4	Assessment of major venous anomalies by computerized tomography. Congenital anomalies of major venous structures are not common but their identification and relative position, particularly in relation to an abdominal aortic aneurysm, are of significant value in planning and conducting aortic operations. Computed tomography (CT) has become a common method of preoperative evaluation of aortic disease. Its reliability in providing accurate information regarding aneurysmal size, configuration, and extension, as well as the presence of intraluminal thrombus and involvement of the renal and iliac arteries, has been demonstrated. Simultaneous visualization of the major adjacent venous structures with the use of contrast enhancement is obtained, but anatomic variants can be overlooked because they are commonly subtle and considered incidental. The preoperative diagnosis of these venous abnormalities is significant to the vascular surgeon. Such information can be accurately and reliably acquired with the present CT techniques without the need for further diagnostic studies. 
1	The cellular composition of basal cell adenoma of the parotid gland: an immunohistochemical analysis. Four cases of basal cell adenoma of the parotid gland were examined immunohistochemically to characterize their cellular composition. In all cases epithelial membrane antigen and keratin were detected in the inner luminal cells; some cells also showed positive staining for secretory functional markers, indicating their differentiation toward secretory epithelium. In tubular and trabecular types the outer cells consistently displayed an intense staining for vimentin and some were also positive for actin, indicating their myoepithelial nature. In the solid type, most tumor cells resembled the ductal cells or basal cells of larger ducts in normal gland with regard to their immunoreactivity. Our results may suggest that the proportion and arrangement of heterogeneous tumor cells are responsible for different histologic patterns of the salivary basal cell adenoma. 
1	Immunophenotypic aberrancy in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Some recent reports indicate a high frequency of immunophenotypic aberrancy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To investigate this issue with regard to adult ALL, the authors reviewed the immunophenotyping data from 39 cases analyzed in their clinical laboratory. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow was performed with the use of a panel of 21 B-cell, T-cell, and myeloid monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). The surface antigen profiles of the leukemic cells were compared with those of normal bone marrow and thymic counterparts, as defined by current models. Twenty-six cases were B-precursor ALL, 8 were T-ALL, and 3 were B-ALL (Burkitt's leukemia). Only two cases coexpressed lymphoid and myeloid antigens. In contrast, intralineage aberrancy was quite common. Immunophenotypes from 13 of 26 B-precursor ALL cases deviated from normal B-lineage marrow cells as defined by a recent classification. The T-ALL cases were also immunophenotypically heterogeneous. This high incidence of aberrant antigen expression in adult ALL suggests that leukemogenesis also involves aberrant differentiation rather than purely a process of maturational arrest. 
4	Effects of the novel thromboxane antagonist Bay U 3405 on experimental coronary artery disease. Bay U 3405 is a novel thromboxane receptor blocker. The present investigations describe its effects on experimental canine and porcine cardiac damage. In anesthetized dogs, a coronary artery was occluded for 6 hours and reperfused for 30 minutes. Bay U 3405 was administered intravenously 15 minutes after occlusion (1 mg/kg) followed by infusion of 10 mg/kg/hr from 30 minutes after ligature. In a second study, the effects of Bay U 3405 on endoperoxide analogue U-46619-induced coronary constriction were studied in anesthetized, open-chest pigs. Bay U 3405 reduced myocardial infarct expansion by 65% (p less than 0.01) assessed with biochemical staining. Hemodynamics and collateral blood flow were unaffected. However, reperfusion arrhythmias were suppressed. In porcine experiments, 1 mg/kg Bay U 3405, given intravenously or intraduodenally, antagonized U-46619-induced coronary vasoconstriction over 5 hours. The studies demonstrate anti-ischemic and antivasoconstrictor properties of Bay U 3405 probably due to binding to platelet and smooth muscle thromboxane receptors. This may have clinical relevance in angina pectoris and myocardial infarction. 
5	Association of Treacher Collins syndrome and translocation 6p21.31/16p13.11: exclusion of the locus from these candidate regions. Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is an autosomal dominant defect of craniofacial development which has not been chromosomally localized. We have identified a mother and two children who have TCS and also a balanced translocation t(6;16)(p21.31;p13.11), which suggested the possibility that the TCS locus might be located at one of the translocation breakpoints. These were defined by in-situ hybridization as 6p21.31 (by using loci in the HLA complex defined by the probes p45.1DP beta 003/HLA-DPB2 and pRS5.10/HLA class I chain) and 16p13.11 (by using probes pACHF1.3.2/D16S8 and VK45/D16S131). Pairwise and multipoint linkage analysis using localized chromosome 6 probes and chromosome 16 probes in 12 unrelated TCS families with multiple affected siblings excluded the TCS locus from proximity to both translocation breakpoints. These data were confirmed when a third affected child, who did not exhibit the translocation, was born to the mother. 
4	Diagnostic value of a new myocardial perfusion agent, teboroxime (SO 30,217), utilizing a rapid planar imaging protocol: preliminary results [corrected and republished with original paging, article originally printed in J Am Coll Cardiol 1990 Oct;16(4):855-61] Technetium-99m-labeled agents have advantages over thallium-201 in terms of photon statistics, cost and clinical availability. They have been suggested as an alternative to thallium for myocardial perfusion imaging. Teboroxime is a new boronic acid adduct of technetium dioxime (BATO) compound that demonstrates favorable characteristics in preliminary studies. With use of a novel (seated) patient positioning technique and a rapid dynamic acquisition protocol, 30 patients underwent planar imaging with teboroxoime while at rest and after maximal treadmill exercise. Postexercise scans were completed in an average time (mean +/- SD) of 4.4 +/- 1.6 min, with 4.8 +/- 1.5 min for the views at rest. These results were compared with coronary arteriography or thallium scintigraphy after treadmill exercise, or both. Diagnostic agreement (abnormal versus normal) was present in 28 of the 30 patients (p less than 0.001). Regarding physiologic assessment as compared with thallium scintigraphy, the finding of infarction and ischemia was concordant in 89% and 86% of patients, respectively. This report describes the initial use of teboroxime with a rapid dynamic planar imaging technique, resulting in a high correlation with exercise thallium scintigraphy. Delayed postexercise images obtained 5 to 10 min after exercise demonstrated rapid disappearance of exercise-induced defects noted on the initial (0 to 5 min) postexercise views. The rapid differential washout with teboroxime has not been previously described and the possible clinical significance is discussed. 
5	'Locked-in syndrome' for 27 years following a viral illness: clinical and pathologic findings. We describe a man who, after a presumed encephalitic illness, was "locked-in" for 27 years. His CT and autopsy findings showed atrophy of the brainstem and a cystic lesion at the base of the pons. He survived longer than most other patients in a similar state. 
5	Treatment of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis by immunosuppression. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is exceedingly uncommon in childhood and its etiology is uncertain. Support for an immunological basis for the disease is given by a report of a 14-year-old girl with severe retroperitoneal fibrosis causing progressive azotemia in whom azathioprine and prednisolone were used successfully. This case supports the efficacy of immunotherapy in the treatment of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis. 
1	Progression through the cell cycle: an overview. Tissues in adults can be maintained at constant mass or they can increase or decrease in size because of imbalances of synthetic and degradative processes acting at the cellular and molecular levels. Some size changes are caused by physiologic conditions to which the tissue must adjust. Alternatively, the balance may be distorted in favor of net tissue increase in pathologic situations such as cancer. Strict regulatory mechanisms are required to keep proliferation responsive to the organism's needs; these mechanisms may be defective in disease. Net tissue proliferation requires repeated rounds of cell duplication in excess of that necessary to counterbalance cell death. Duplication of a cell requires a net doubling of its every molecule and structure. The myriad of molecular events required for cell proliferation such as DNA duplication and its partitioning at mitosis are tightly regulated in normal cells. One may conceive of two classes of molecules: those required for "housekeeping," which constitute the cell's structural and functional machinery, and those such as growth factors, their receptors, and second messengers involved in signal transduction responsible for regulating the activities of the housekeeping molecules. These molecular events and the cascade of processes that control them can be organized within the sequence of the cell cycle. In this brief overview, we illustrate these issues with a few examples taken from very recent discoveries of novel proteins that appear to have major regulatory roles. Most of these results have been obtained with mammalian fibroblasts, but some have originated with discoveries made using two very different yeasts. 
5	Effectiveness of periodic checkup by ultrasonography for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Periodic checkup by ultrasonography was conducted on patients with chronic liver diseases for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. In 19 months, a total of 2004 examinations were performed on a total of 660 cases (179 cases with liver cirrhosis in the compensatory stage, younger than 70 years; 481 cases with chronic hepatitis, aged 40 to 70 years for men and 50 to 70 years for women). Of the 660 cases, 22 HCC cases (3.3%) were detected and finally diagnosed by angiography and/or histologic examination. Four of those cases (18%) had a single nodule smaller than 1 cm in diameter, and 11 cases (50%) had a single nodule smaller than 2 cm. Surgical resection was performed on 12 cases (55%). In comparison with the control group (83 HCC cases not receiving any periodic checkup), the frequency of small liver cancer and the surgical resection rate in the study group were significantly higher. This examination system by periodic ultrasonography checkup of patients with chronic hepatic diseases was effective for early detection and permitted aggressive therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
5	A distinctive triad of malformations of the central nervous system in the Meckel-Gruber syndrome. A distinct triad of central nervous system (CNS) malformations (prosencephalic dysgenesis, occipital exencephalocele and rhombic roof dysgenesis) was present in seven cases of the Meckel-Gruber syndrome examined at autopsy. We compared our findings with those previously described. Microcephaly, sloping forehead, posterior occipital exencephalocele, cerebellar hypoplasia, Chiari malformation, hydrocephalus, polymicrogyria, arhinencephaly, holoprosencephaly and anencephaly constituted a broad spectrum of the reported CNS anomalies. Few reports contained a comprehensive description of the observed CNS malformations. In those reports, and in our cases, features of prosencephalic dysgenesis included agenesis of olfactory bulbs and tracts (arhinencephaly), hypoplasia of optic nerves and chiasm, agenesis of corpus callosum, fused thalami or complete holoprosencephaly. The occipital encephalocele has consisted of a displacement of rhombic roof elements, including caudal third ventricle, cerebellar vermis and fourth ventricle, extruded through an enlarged posterior fontanelle rather than through an occipital cranium bifidum and is thus more precisely labeled an exencephalocele. Different degrees of dysgenesis of posterior fossa structures, described by some as a variant of Dandy-Walker cyst with features of a Chiari malformation, were often associated with this occipital exencephalocele. This pattern of CNS anomalies represents a triad of malformations probably associated with defective ventral induction of the developing CNS by the prechordal mesoderm. 
2	Sequential esophageal motility studies after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy: a prospective investigation. To assess prospectively the effects of endoscopic intravariceal sclerosis (EIS) on esophageal function, we performed esophageal manometry on 13 cirrhotic patients before EIS, 24 h after the second session and 4 wk after the fourth session. EIS had no impact on lower esophageal sphincter pressure. However, a significant decrease in the amplitude of peristaltic waves was observed immediately post-EIS in the lower two-thirds of the esophagus. There was no modification of duration or velocity of progression of peristaltic waves. A four-fold increase in simultaneous contractions was observed early after EIS. These changes were reversible, as assessed by late esophageal testing after EIS. No correlations were demonstrated between esophageal motor parameters and doses of sclerosant. We conclude that sclerosant injection into the esophageal wall acutely impairs esophageal motility, but motor function is partially restored 4 wk after completion of EIS, suggesting that dysmotility is reversible. 
5	Itraconazole therapy in aspergillosis: study in 49 patients. Itraconazole, 200 to 400 mg once daily, was administered to 49 patients with different types of aspergillosis: pulmonary aspergilloma (14 patients), chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (14), and invasive aspergillosis (21). Itraconazole was prescribed alone or in combination or after treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine. Of 14 aspergilloma patients, 2 were cured and 8 had symptomatic improvement. In chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis, 7 of 14 patients were cured and 6 improved significantly. In invasive aspergillosis treatment failed in 6 patients and 15 were cured. Itraconazole can be an alternative to amphotericin B in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis. In aspergilloma itraconazole may be useful in inoperable cases. 
5	Studies of controlled reperfusion after ischemia. XXII. Reperfusate composition: effects of leukocyte depletion of blood and blood cardioplegic reperfusates after acute coronary occlusion. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the role of leukocyte depletion during initial reoxygenation with normal blood and blood cardioplegic reperfusates in limiting reperfusion damage. METHODS: Twenty-eight dogs underwent 2 hours of ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The initial reperfusate (37 degrees C) was delivered on total vented bypass to the left anterior descending artery by a calibrated pump via an internal mammary artery graft at 50 mm Hg for 20 minutes. Eight dogs received normal (normokalemic, nonenriched) blood reperfusion (leukocyte count 8000/mm3) and six were reperfused with leukocyte-depleted normal blood (leukocyte count less than 100/mm3). Of 14 dogs reperfused with substrate-enriched (hyperkalemic) blood cardioplegic solution, six received a cardioplegic solution with a leukocyte count less than 100/mm3. RESULTS: Leukocyte depletion of normal blood reduced reperfusion-induced arrhythmias from 63% to 17% (p less than 0.05). Coronary vascular resistance at initial reperfusion was low and remained low during substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic reperfusion with both normal and reduced leukocyte counts. In contrast, coronary vascular resistance rose 63% with normal blood reperfusion, and this increase was avoided by leukocyte depletion (2.6 versus 4.0 mm Hg x ml/min, p less than 0.05). Coronary vascular resistance after 20 minutes was, however, higher than that with blood cardioplegia with normal or decreased leukocyte counts. Negligible functional recovery followed reperfusion with normal blood and leukocyte-depleted blood (12% and 6% of control systolic shortening). In contrast, substantial segmental recovery followed blood cardioplegic reperfusion (73% systolic shortening, p less than 0.05) but was not improved by leukopheresis (81% systolic shortening). Leukocyte depletion of normal blood reperfusate reduced histochemical damage from 53% to 38% (p less than 0.05), but the least histochemical damage followed blood cardioplegic reperfusion with a normal or reduced leukocyte count (8% or 11%, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest an important role for leukocytes in reperfusion damage, but reperfusate leukocyte filtration alone is inferior to blood cardioplegic reperfusion. Leukocyte depletion of blood cardioplegic solutions seems unnecessary after only 2 hours of ischemia. 
4	Is routine preoperative hemodynamic evaluation of nonagenarians necessary? An Incidence of co-morbid cardiac disease in the elderly surgical patient as high as 66% has been previously reported. Even in the absence of clinically significant cardiac disease, advanced age alone is often considered sufficient indication for Swan-Ganz placement, hemodynamic evaluation, adjustment of fluid states, and inotropic support. Yet data clearly documenting the need for this evaluation and therapy are difficult to obtain. All major general surgical and orthopedic operations in non-agenarians were reviewed in our institution from July 1, 1987 through December 31, 1988. Fifty-one procedures were performed on 46 patients. None of these patients had preoperative Swan-Ganz catheterization or hemodynamic evaluation. Eighteen general surgical, 30 orthopedic, 2 neurosurgical, and 1 gynecological procedures were performed. Forty-three were performed under general anesthesia, 7 under spinal anesthesia, and 1 with local anesthesia. Seven out of 51 patients (14%) experienced major complications, and 16 out of 51 (31%) experienced minor complications. Thirty-day mortality was 0%, and 6-month survival was 92%. Only one complication occurred within 48 hours of surgery that might possibly have been prevented with hemodynamic evaluation, adjustment of fluid status, inotropic support, and intensive care unit monitoring. 
1	Multiple parathyroid adenomas: report of thirty-three cases. An increasing number of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are found to have two or three enlarged parathyroid glands. Of 865 patients successfully operated on by one surgeon (J.N.A.), multiple enlarged parathyroid glands (adenomas) were found and resected in 33 cases (3.8%), with resulting normocalcemia lasting from 1 to 22 years (mean 5.8). Twenty-nine patients had two adenomas and four had three adenomas. In 28 patients the multiple adenomas were synchronous. Twenty-five patients underwent removal of all of the enlarged parathyroid glands in one operation; in three patients one adenoma was removed, reoperation for persistent hypercalcemia was performed, and a second adenoma was resected with cure. In five patients one adenoma was removed, normocalcemia ensued for 3 to 18 years, and a second (metachronous) adenoma occurred and was resected successfully. Although 10 of 70 enlarged parathyroid glands removed were labeled hyperplasia, cure in all but one of our patients by selective resection of only enlarged parathyroid glands emphasizes the unreliability of histologic criteria in differentiating between parathyroid adenoma and hyperplasia. Based on this study, we support the existence of multiple adenomas and advocate removal of only macroscopically enlarged parathyroid glands in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. 
5	Developmental changes in vascular responses to histamine in normoxic and hypoxic lamb lungs. This study of newborn (3-10 day old) and juvenile (6-8 mo old) in situ isolated lamb lungs was undertaken to determine whether 1) histamine receptor blockade accentuates hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction more in newborns than in juveniles, 2) histamine infusion causes a decrease in both normoxic pulmonary vascular resistance and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in newborns, and 3) the H1-mediated dilator response to infused histamine in newborns is due to enhanced dilator prostaglandin release. Pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) was determined at baseline and in response to histamine (infusion rates of 0.1-10.0 micrograms.kg-1 min-1) in control, H1-blocked, H2-blocked, combined H1- and H2-blocked, and cyclooxygenase-inhibited H2-blocked lungs under "normoxic" (inspired O2 fraction 0.28) and hypoxic (inspired O2 fraction 0.04) conditions. In newborns, H1-receptor blockade markedly accentuated baseline hypoxic Ppa, and H2-receptor blockade caused an increase in baseline normoxic Ppa. In juveniles, neither H1 nor H2 blockade altered baseline normoxic or hypoxic Ppa. Histamine infusion caused both H1- and H2-mediated decreases in Ppa in normoxic and hypoxic newborn lungs. In juvenile lungs, histamine infusion also caused H2-mediated decreases in Ppa during both normoxia and hypoxia. During normoxia, histamine infusion caused an H1-mediated increase in normoxic Ppa in juveniles as previously seen in mature animals; however, during hypoxia there was an H1-mediated decrease in Ppa at low doses of histamine followed by an increase in Ppa. Combined histamine-receptor blockade markedly reduced both dilator and pressor responses to histamine infusion. Indomethacin failed to alter the H1-mediated dilator response to histamine in newborns. 
3	Cerebral cysticercosis. We studied 143 cases of cerebral cysticercosis over a 30-year period. In 46 there was hydrocephalus due to cysts obstructing the cerebrospinal fluid pathways, with signs of hydrocephalus and cerebellar dysfunction. In 97 there were cysts in the cerebral parenchyma, causing symptoms of intracranial hypertension alone in 22 cases, with additional neurological deficits in the remainder. Before 1980 diagnosis was made by pneumoencephalography and ventriculography, but since then it has mostly been done by computed tomography. In 28 cases scanned, typical abnormalities were present in 25. Complement fixation tests were positive in serum in 74% of cases and in cerebrospinal fluid in 73%, and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test was positive in serum in 90% and in cerebrospinal fluid in 92%. Treatment of cases with hydrocephalus was by removal of the cysts at craniotomy, with placement of a shunt where necessary. Intracranial hypertension caused by parenchymal cysts was treated with steroids and osmotic agents, if possible. In resistant cases subtemporal decompression was needed, unilateral in 55 cases and bilateral in eight. Mortality in the acute stage was 11%, with a further 20% at follow up. 
5	The in vivo biologic effect of interleukin 2 and interferon alfa on natural immunity in patients with head and neck cancer. Given the association of deficient natural immunity with the risk of metastatic disease, the ability to activate natural killer cell function may have a therapeutic significance. The effect of continuous infusion of interleukin 2 plus intramuscular interferon alfa on natural immune status was, therefore, analyzed in eight patients with head and neck cancer. Also evaluated was the effect of interleukin 2-interferon alfa therapy on lymphokine-activated killer cell activity as well as total lymphocyte count, percent of lymphocyte subsets, and levels of both circulating immune complexes and antibody classes. Both the percent and absolute number of natural killer cells (ie, CD56+ CD3- lymphocytes) within peripheral blood as well as natural killer cell activity against K562 targets increased significantly with treatment. The remaining immune parameters were not significantly altered. The demonstrated capacity to modulate natural immune function supports the potential use of interleukin 2-containing regimens as a preventive measure against metastatic disease in patients with head and neck cancer. 
4	Infiltration of epinephrine in tonsillectomy: a randomized, prospective, double-blind study. A variety of hemostatic agents and techniques have been used in an attempt to reduce intraoperative blood loss and postoperative bleeding in tonsillectomy. The efficacy of most of these substances and techniques has been judged primarily on clinical impressions. Because of the paucity of prospective studies, a randomized, prospective, double-blind study, using the patients as their own controls, was conducted. Ninety-two patients were injected before tonsillectomy in a random, double-blind fashion with normal saline solution in one tonsil and 1:100,000 epinephrine in the other. The blood loss, time of dissection, and postoperative bleeding were recorded separately for each tonsil. Cardiac manifestations were also monitored. The tonsils injected with epinephrine had a statistically significant reduction in blood loss and dissection time when compared with those injected with normal saline. Subjectively, dissection was easier on the epinephrine-injected side. There was no difference in the incidence of postoperative hemorrhage. Cardiac manifestations of epinephrine were minimal and transient. This study demonstrates that epinephrine is useful in reducing hemorrhage during tonsillectomy and can be used safely with the appropriate inhalation anesthetics. 
1	Interferon alpha-2a and 5-fluorouracil for advanced colorectal carcinoma. Assessment of activity and toxicity. Preclinical data showed that the cytotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are augmented by interferon (IFN). In a small study, 13 of 17 patients with advanced colorectal cancer responded to a regimen of 5-FU with IFN. Using the same dose and schedule as in this pilot study, 38 previously untreated patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma were treated with continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of 5-FU 750 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, followed by weekly bolus 5-FU at 750 mg/m2 and subcutaneous IFN at 9 million units three times per week. Of 35 evaluable patients, nine (26%) had a partial response (95% confidence limit, 11% to 41%), with a median response duration of 7.5 months (range, 4.4 to greater than 11.7 months). Seven patients (20%) had a minor response, and ten (28%) had stable disease. The most common toxicities observed were stomatitis (52%) and diarrhea (43%). Neurotoxicity was seen in 34% of patients and consisted of gait disturbance, dizziness, confusion, memory loss, and dementia. Because of toxicity, 84% of patients required a reduction of the IFN dose by at least 50%, and 63% required reduction of the 5-FU dose by at least 25%. Although the combination of 5-FU and IFN in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma has some activity, the regimen was toxic, and the observed response rate (26%) was not substantially superior to alternative 5-FU programs. 
5	Stress fractures of the femoral neck in athletes. The consequence of a delay in diagnosis. Twenty-three patients with stress fractures of the femoral neck were followed up at an average of 6.5 years after the injury. There were 16 recreational athletes and seven elite athletes. Most injuries (N = 15) occurred during running. The diagnosis was confirmed within 3 to 104 weeks (mean, 14 weeks) after the initial onset of symptoms. Sixteen of the patients were treated with internal fixation, the remaining seven were treated conservatively. Seven patients (30%) developed complications requiring major surgery. Five of these patients had Type 3 fractures (displaced) and four had been treated with internal fixation initially. The remaining two patients had Type 1 fractures (endosteal or periosteal callus without an overt fracture line); one was treated operatively and the other conservatively. Three patients developed avascular necrosis and two were treated by hip replacement. The third patient was treated with arthrodesis. Three refractures and one pseudarthrosis were treated by osteotomy. At followup, all elite athletes stated that they had to end their career as a result of the injury. Results were rated by the ability of the athlete to return to sports. There were 9 bad or fair results, 13 good, and 1 excellent result. No difference in activity level or subjective rating was observed between the surgically and conservatively treated group either preinjury or postinjury. The most important factor influencing the complication rate seems to be the type of fracture. The high incidence of displaced fractures (Type 3) could speculatively be caused by undiagnosed tension side stress fractures. If so, the delay in correct diagnosis may be disastrous. However, we could only objectively observe this in one of our cases. 
1	Results of treating ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast with conservative surgery and radiation therapy. To determine the frequency, pattern, and time course of tumor recurrence in the breast, the outcome of 38 women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy between 1976 and 1985 was studied. Surgery typically consisted of local excision without evaluation of the microscopic margins of resection. The median radiation dose to the tumor site was 6400 cGy. With a median follow-up time of 81 months, eight patients (21%) have experienced a recurrence in the breast. The time course to recurrence was protracted in some cases, with failures occurring at 17, 27, 43, 63, 71, 83, 92, and 104 months. The 5-year and 8-year actuarial rates of tumor recurrence in the breast were 8% and 27%, respectively. Seven patients had a recurrence at or near the primary tumor site, four with invasive carcinoma, and one had an invasive recurrence at a site elsewhere in the breast. No clinical or pathologic factor was significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrence, but the number of patients in the study population was small. The authors reached the following conclusions for patients with DCIS treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy without careful mammographic and pathologic evaluation: (1) recurrence in the breast may be seen in at least one fifth of the patients; (2) recurrence typically occurs at or near the primary site; and (3) recurrence can occur long after treatment. Careful mammographic and pathologic assessment may be useful in reducing the local recurrence rate and should be considered essential if patients are considered for conservative surgery and radiation therapy. 
1	HiC-COM: a 2-month intensive chemotherapy regimen for children with stage III and IV Burkitt's lymphoma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We designed a protocol that included 2 months of intensive Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide; Bristol-Myers Co, Evansville, IN), high-dose methotrexate (MTX), high-dose cytarabine (ara-C), and vincristine (HiC-COM) to improve event-free survival (EFS) for patients with advanced-stage Burkitt's lymphoma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We also wished to test the feasibility of rapidly cycling Cytoxan and high-dose ara-C based on signs of early marrow recovery. Twenty patients including 12 with stage III Burkitt's lymphoma and eight with stage IV Burkitt's lymphoma or B-cell ALL were entered onto this pilot study. The rate of complete remission was 95%. Four patients have relapsed. The 2-year actuarial EFS was 75% (median follow-up, 37 months). Two of the initial five patients developed transverse myelitis, which we believe may have been secondary to the concomitant administration of intrathecal (IT) and high-dose systemic ara-C. We conclude that this short but intensive regimen is highly effective for patients with advanced Burkitt's lymphoma and B-cell ALL. EFS has improved over previous less intensive regimens, and is comparable to regimens of longer duration. 
4	Rapid control of refractory atrial tachyarrhythmias with high-dose oral amiodarone. To shorten the delay in the onset of antiarrhythmic effect when using amiodarone for the conversion of refractory atrial tachyarrhythmias to sinus rhythm, 19 patients were given oral amiodarone according to a high-dose loading protocol. In 18 of 19 patients (95%), sinus rhythm was restored 36 hours (range, 0 to 96 hours) after starting amiodarone. The conversion occurred as a result of amiodarone therapy alone within 48 hours in 12 patients (63%), and by amiodarone therapy plus electrical cardioversion at 48 to 96 hours in six patients (32%). Minor side effects were noted in eight patients (42%). No major side effects were encountered. The length of hospital stay after initiating amiodarone therapy was 3.6 days (range, 2 to 5 days). High-dose oral amiodarone loading is a safe and effective method for the rapid conversion of atrial tachyarrhythmias to sinus rhythm. 
4	Great vein and right atrial thrombosis in critically ill infants and children with central venous lines. We performed a retrospective review of echocardiographic data files of infants and children hospitalized in the Newborn and Pediatric Intensive Care Units. Echocardiograms were examined to detect the presence and evolution of great vein and right atrial thrombosis in patients with central venous lines. Thirty-seven patients were identified over a five-year period. Echocardiograms were performed, not routinely, but in response to specific indications including catheter malfunction, thrombocytopenia, persistent chylothorax, bacterial or fungal sepsis, and superior vena cava syndrome. Fifteen of 37 patients died, 13 of them during the hospitalization in which the thrombus was discovered. Thrombolytic agents and surgery were used to treat selected patients, with mixed results. Two of the 22 survivors have significant disability related to the thrombus or complications arising from it. We conclude that great vein and/or right atrial thrombosis is a common complication of central venous catheterization in small infants and children; moreover, the morbidity and mortality relating to this complication is substantial. 
4	Interaction of citrus juices with felodipine and nifedipine Six men with borderline hypertension took felodipine 5 mg with water, grapefruit juice, or orange juice. The mean felodipine bioavailability with grapefruit juice was 284 (range 164-469)% of that with water. The dehydrofelodipine/felodipine AUC ratio was lower, diastolic blood pressure lower, and heart rate higher with grapefruit juice than with water. Vasodilatation-related side-effects were more frequent. Orange juice had no such effects. Six healthy men took nifedipine 10 mg with water or grapefruit juice; the bioavailability with grapefruit juice was 134 (108-169)% of that with water. 
5	Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass after failed femoropopliteal reconstructions. Deep femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass is a reconstructive technique occasionally applicable when more conventional attempts at revascularization of the distal portion of the leg have failed. Three such patients, in whom the anterior tibial was the only distal patent branch of the popliteal artery, had severe symptoms of arterial insufficiency. Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass was done using autogenous The distal portion of the deep femoral artery was exposed through an anteromedial distal thigh approach. The three patients have been followed up for a mean of 20.3 months, and each maintains graft patency and marked symptomatic improvement. 
5	Endophthalmitis after placement of a Molteno implant. I report a case of early postoperative endophthalmitis following placement of a Molteno implant. Excellent results were obtained by immediate removal of the implant and surgical management of the infection, followed by replacement of the implant. 
5	Safety and efficacy of urokinase during elective coronary angioplasty. Eighty-nine of 462 patients were treated with adjunctive urokinase during elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), 26% for unstable angina, 34% for intracoronary thrombus, 27% for intimal dissection, 10% for abrupt closure, and 3% for saphenous vein graft embolism. The 80 patients treated before abrupt closure (group A) were compared with 167 patients with similar profiles who did not receive urokinase (group B). Procedural success rates were similar. Adverse cardiac events (abrupt closure, myocardial infarction, emergency coronary artery bypass, or death) in group A versus group B occurred in: 1 of 30 (3%) versus 5 of 27 (18.5%) (p = 0.07) with intracoronary thrombus, 5 of 45 (9%) versus 18 of 110 (16.3%) with unstable angina, 1 of 12 (8%) versus 4 of 13 (31%) with unstable angina with intracoronary thrombus, 4 of 33 (12%) versus 14 of 97 (14.4%) with unstable angina without intracoronary thrombus, and 5 of 24 (20.8%) versus 6 of 66 (9%) with intimal dissection. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 11% of patients who were treated with urokinase versus 9% of patients who were not (p = NS). No difference in blood transfusions existed. Thus urokinase was found to be safe during elective PTCA. In patients with intracoronary thrombus, urokinase appears to decrease the incidence of new adverse cardiac events, whereas in patients with intimal dissection it might have an adverse effect. 
4	Segmental wall motion abnormalities in the absence of clinically documented myocardial infarction: clinical significance and evidence of hibernating myocardium. To determine the frequency and significance of left ventricular wall motion abnormalities in patients without clinical evidence of myocardial infarction, we reviewed the two-dimensional echocardiograms of 252 patients who had no history or electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction and who subsequently underwent coronary angiography. Seventy-seven patients (31%) had one or more segmental wall motion abnormalities. Sixty-six of the 77 patients (86%) had significant coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% luminal diameter stenosis). Seventy-four percent of the patients with coronary artery disease had multivessel disease. The left ventricle was divided into anterior and posterior regions. In the 66 patients, there were 77 separate regions with wall motion abnormalities (49 hypokinesis, 22 akinesis, 6 dyskinesis), including 60 regions (78%) supplied by coronary vessels with greater than or equal to 70% stenosis. Thirty-two patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Follow-up echocardiograms were obtained in 19 patients who had wall motion abnormalities involving 22 regions. Twenty of the 22 regions were revascularized. Wall motion improved in 17 of 20 regions (85%) and returned to normal in 15 regions (75%). We conclude that segmental wall motion abnormalities may be detected by echocardiography in up to one third of patients evaluated for suspected coronary artery disease without documented myocardial infarction. These abnormalities are associated with a high likelihood of multivessel disease as well as with significant narrowing of the artery supplying the region demonstrating abnormal wall motion. Improvement in segmental wall motion abnormalities after revascularization suggests that these areas represent regions of hibernating myocardium. 
1	Trends in thirty years of vaginal hysterectomy. Vaginal hysterectomy, as currently performed at the University of Vienna, was first described by Halban in 1932. From 1955 to 1985, a total of 9,967 hysterectomies were performed. The vaginal route was used for 6,078 (60.9 per cent) of these procedures. Sixty-four per cent of the women operated upon were multiparous, 27 per cent were uniparous and 8 per cent were nulliparous. A comparison of the periods 1955 to 1975 and 1976 to 1985 revealed the following trends: the incidence of uterine myomas (30.6 to 27.1 per cent), in situ carcinoma of the cervix (6.5 to 7.9 per cent) and endometrial carcinoma (1.4 to 0.6 per cent) remained largely constant. In the past decade, indications for positional abnormalities (uterine descent and prolapse) were encountered more often (27.6 to 41.6 per cent) than in the first observation period, while the incidence of recurrent metrorrhagia was found to decline (33.9 to 22.8 per cent). The most common complications included hemorrhage during the operation, lesions of the bladder, hemorrhage until 48 hours after surgical treatment and hemorrhage from days 2 to 14 postoperatively (around 0.5 per cent, respectively). During the second observation period, no postoperative fistulas developed. Two instances of tubal prolapse were seen. Laparotomy was done in four of 6,078 instances. Two patients died of septic complications. Whenever possible, we prefer vaginal hysterectomy because of its low complication rate, low mortality rate and low postoperative morbidity. 
3	Hypercalcemia in infants presenting with apnea. To our knowledge apnea in infants has not been associated with hypercalcemia. We describe seven hypercalcemic infants aged 2 days to 3 months who had presented with apnea; six of the seven were otherwise healthy. The apneic attacks were brief, and normal breathing was restored spontaneously or after tactile stimulation. The attacks stopped and the apnea monitoring was discontinued when the children were 1 month to 2 years of age. The only abnormal finding common to all of the patients was hypercalcemia. Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia was diagnosed in six of the patients and familial benign hypercalcemia in one. Our findings suggest that determination of the plasma calcium level be included in the investigation of apnea in infancy. 
1	Transthyretin receptors on human astrocytoma cells. Transthyretin (TTR), a transport protein for T4 and retinol-binding protein, is the principal T4-binding protein of cerebrospinal fluid. Its function in regard to the delivery of its ligands and in other respects is unclear. The binding of [125I] TTR to cultured human astrocytoma cells was studied to determine whether these cells carry receptors for TTR. Scatchard analysis was consistent with a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 3 nM. No significant cross-reactivity with transferrin or serum albumin was observed. Internalization of TTR was temperature dependent and proportional to receptor occupancy. Dilutions of cerebrospinal fluid displaced [125I]TTR in proportion to their content of radioimmunoassayable TTR and in parallel with purified TTR. The uptake and internalization of TTR increased in the presence of high T4 or T3 concentrations. These results demonstrate that TTR binds to specific high affinity receptors on human astrocytoma cells. Receptor binding of TTR provides a potential mechanism for the delivery of its ligands within the central nervous system. 
5	Eosinophil infiltration and degranulation in Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis. Eosinophil granules contain cationic proteins, including the major basic protein, which are toxic to mammalian tissue. While eosinophils have been observed to comprise part of the inflammatory reaction in acute Helicobacter pylori gastritis, the role of the eosinophil in the pathogenesis of chronic gastritis is unknown. We evaluated whether eosinophil infiltration and degranulation are associated with chronic gastritis and H. pylori infection. We studied eight patients with chronic H. pylori antral gastritis, three with chronic antral gastritis in the absence of H. pylori, 11 healthy age-matched volunteers without antral gastritis, and eight patients with H. pylori-negative chronic specific gastritis (three Crohn's antral gastritis and five Menetrier's disease). Serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, with Giemsa, and by a specific indirect immunofluorescence technique for eosinophil granule major basic protein. Specimens were graded independently by three observers and scores of 0-3 were given for eosinophil infiltration and degranulation (0 = none to 3 = confluent infiltration and/or degranulation). In H. pylori antral gastritis, significantly greater eosinophil infiltration and degranulation were found compared to the normal group, Menetrier's disease, and chronic H. pylori-negative gastritis. There was no significant difference between gastric Crohn's disease and H. pylori gastritis. The severity of chronic gastritis was significantly correlated with the eosinophil score. Eosinophil degranulation did not appear to be greater at or near sites of bacterial colonization in the H. pylori gastritis specimens. The results suggest that eosinophil infiltration and degranulation may be associated with H. pylori gastritis. We postulate that the release of toxic cationic proteins from eosinophils contributes to the inflammatory changes present in H. pylori gastritis. 
5	Ankylosing spondylitis with exuberant sclerosis in the sacroiliac joints, symphysis pubis and spine. We report the case of a man with ankylosing spondylitis involving the symphysis pubis and some intervertebral discs in addition to the sacroiliac joints. The bone adjacent to each inflammatory area showed an unusually exuberant sclerosis. In the early phases of evolution the appearance of sacroilitis was indistinguishable from that of osteitis condensans ilii. 
5	Progressive functional deterioration of bioprostheses assessed by Doppler ultrasonography. Doppler echocardiography was used to study the function of bioprosthetic heart valves by noninvasive means in 32 patients aged 29 to 72 years at various postoperative intervals. There were 24 Ionescu-Shiley, four Hancock, and four Carpentier-Edwards prostheses, 19 in the aortic and 13 in the mitral position. Initial studies were performed at a mean of 2.3 years after implantation and were repeated one, two, and three years thereafter. Flow velocities in the mitral orifice, left ventricular outflow tract, and ascending aorta, as well as mitral pressure half-time, were measured from pulsed-wave or continuous-wave Doppler recordings. Mitral and aortic valve areas and aortic pressure gradients were calculated. In aortic prostheses the valve area decreased and pressure gradient increased progressively in relation to the time from implantation. The mean value (+/- SD) of the aortic valve area was 67 +/- 17 percent of the manufacturer's nominal value at the first examination and 57 +/- 20 percent one year later, 51 +/- 14 percent two years later, and 46 +/- 11 percent three years later (overall differences, p less than 0.01). In mitral prostheses, reduction of the valve area was not related to the time from implantation. The mean mitral valve area was 45 +/- 12 percent of the nominal value at rest and increased to 68 +/- 18 percent during exercise at a mean of 45 months after implantation. There was no change in these values at the one-year repeat study. It is concluded that in a population with predominantly pericardial bioprostheses, (1) aortic tissue prostheses showed a progressive functional deterioration demonstrable by Doppler echocardiography, most probably due to degenerative changes; and (2) in mitral tissue prostheses, there was no significant reduction of orifice area in relation to time from implantation. Reduction of mitral valve areas may, to some extent, reflect a less than full opening at rest. 
2	Peritoneal macrophage beta-2 microglobulin production and bacterial peritonitis in CAPD patients. To evaluate the role of bacterial peritonitis in peritoneal macrophage (PM) Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M) production, and its relationship with PM Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) release, the authors studied 20 CAPD patients (10 with peritonitis): 1. in vivo plasma and peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE) B2M, IL-1, and LTB4 levels; 2. in vitro B2M, IL-1, and LTB4 release by PM. Values were compared with those seen in the plasma or with peripheral blood monocytes of 30 hemodialysis (HD) patients (10 treated with Cuprophan [CU]; 10 with Polyacrylonitrile [PAN]; and 10 with Cellulose Acetate [CA]). Results showed that in CAPD patients with bacterial peritonitis B2M, IL-1 and LTB4 concentrations in the PDE were significantly higher than those seen in CAPD patients without peritonitis, or in the plasma of HD patients treated with PAN or CA, but were similar to those seen in HD patients treated with CU. At the same time, in vitro PM from CAPD patients with bacterial peritonitis produced more B2M, IL-1, and LTB4, than did PM from CAPD patients without peritonitis, or peripheral blood monocytes from HD patients treated with PAN or CA. The authors conclude that in CAPD patients, bacterial peritonitis is able to induce PM B2M production, probably via a cytokine mediated process, which may be analogous to what occurs with peripheral blood monocytes of HD patients treated with CU. 
3	Self-injurious behavior: a review of the behavior and biology of self-mutilation. OBJECTIVE: The authors describe the clinical characteristics of self-injurious behavior, giving special emphasis to self-injurious behavior occurring among individuals with character disorders. DATA COLLECTION: They review data suggesting the involvement of serotonergic, dopaminergic, and opiate neurotransmitter systems in the expression of self-injurious behavior. FINDINGS: Self-injurious behavior occurs among mentally retarded individuals, psychotic patients, prison populations, and individuals with severe character disorders. Although theoretical psychological models of self-injurious behavior are helpful in understanding the patient's experience of self-injury, no generally useful therapeutic approach has yet evolved from these models. Data derived from animal models and treatment studies suggest the involvement of opiatergic and dopaminergic mechanisms in self-injury among the mentally retarded. Serotonergic influences on self-injurious behavior may be present in varying forms of this behavior. The scientific literature on the benefits of pharmacological agents for mentally retarded individuals is beset with a number of problems. Support is emerging, however, for the use of lithium and carbamazepine with self-injuring mentally retarded patients, and some behavioral interventions appear to be successful for mentally retarded individuals. Self-injuring patients with borderline personality disorder may benefit from milieu treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although no form of treatment has yet been demonstrated to be of general benefit, the literature suggests that therapeutic trials with dopamine antagonists, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and opiate antagonists may be of value. 
4	Immunogenetic heterogeneity in rheumatoid disease as illustrated by different MHC associations (DQ, Dw and C4) in articular and extra-articular subsets. Genetic variants at DRB1 (Dw subtypes), DQB, and C4 loci were compared in rheumatoid disease subjects with or without the extra-articular feature of Felty's syndrome or major vasculitis. DR4 positive subjects with rheumatoid arthritis alone showed no preferential associations with DQB or Dw variants or with C4 null alleles. Felty's subjects showed associations with the DQB encoded DQw7 allele and with the C4B null allele but no preferential associations with any Dw subtype of DR4. By contrast DR4 +ve rheumatoid-vasculitic subjects showed associations with the Dw14 as well as with DQw7 and the C4A null allele. These different MHC associations in different clinical disease subsets show that rheumatoid disease is immunogenetically heterogeneous and suggest that MHC genes outside the DRB1 locus may also influence susceptibility or modify expression of the rheumatoid disease process. 
5	Hypereosinophilic syndrome with unusual cutaneous manifestations in two men with HIV infection. We report two men with human immunodeficiency virus infection who had unusual cutaneous manifestations of hypereosinophilic syndrome, exfoliative erythroderma, and linear flagellate plaques. In the first patient the cutaneous disease was the initial manifestation, and in the second the skin was the only organ affected. We also describe a favorable response to systemic corticosteroids and to psoralen with UVA phototherapy in one patient. 
3	Immunopathology and viral reactivation. A general theory of schizophrenia. A theory is proposed that explains a broad range of clinical manifestations in schizophrenia. It is a heuristic device for organizing research in the neuroimmunology and virology of schizophrenia. This approach is different from other immune and viral theories of schizophrenia and defines testable hypotheses for further theory refinement or rejection. Defective alpha-interferon (aIFN) regulation resulting in excessive effect is postulated to cause schizophrenia. The role of aIFN in the regulation of development and its induction within the brain by the reactivation of viruses that are commonly present in the normal central nervous system (CNS) are the primary pathophysiological mechanisms. Biological properties of aIFN include neural excitation, opiate and adrenocorticotropic hormone activity, and inhibition of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Psychosis results from in situ viral stimulation of aIFN production in the CNS of a vulnerable host having defective regulation of either sensitivity or production. Negative symptoms result from aIFN effects on CNS development and the behavioral toxicity of aIFN. Biological developmental abnormalities, gender differences in severity, and decline in psychotic symptoms with age are discussed in the context of the theory. Research strategies and specific testable hypotheses are presented. 
3	AAEM minimonograph #35: Clinical experience with transcranial magnetic stimulation. We elicited motor evoked potentials (MEPs) using transcortical magnetic stimulation in 150 control subjects aged 14 to 85 years and 275 patients with a variety of diseases. There were no significant side effects. Cortex-to-target muscle latencies measured 20.2 +/- 1.6 ms (thenar), 14.2 +/- 1.7 ms (extensor digitorum communis), 9.4 +/- 1.7 ms (biceps), and 27.2 +/- 2.9 ms (tibialis anterior). Central motor delay between the cortex and the C-7 and L-5 measured 6.7 +/- 1.2 ms and 13.1 +/- 3.8 ms, respectively. Mean spinal cord motor conduction velocity measured 65.4 m/s. MEP amplitude expressed as a percentage of the maximum M wave was never less than 20% of the M wave. A value of less than 10% is considered abnormal. MEP latency increases linearly with age and central motor delay is longer in older subjects. Compound muscle action potentials and absolute MEP amplitudes decreased linearly with age. In multiple sclerosis (MS), MEP latency and central delay were often very prolonged. The MEP was more sensitive than the SEP in MS. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, MEP latencies were only modestly prolonged; the characteristic abnormality was reduced amplitude. When pseudobulbar features predominated MEPs were often absent. The MEP was of normal latency in Parkinson's disease, but age-related amplitude was often increased. MEP latency and amplitude were normal in Huntington's disease. Abnormal MEPs persisted several months after stroke despite good functional recovery. The MEP could be used to advantage to demonstrate proximal conduction slowing and block in demyelinating neuropathies. In plexopathy, ability to elicit an MEP several days after onset of paresis was good evidence of neuronal continuity in motor fibers. 
4	Estimating the benefits of cholesterol lowering: are risk factors for coronary heart disease multiplicative? It is often stated that the major risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD)--smoking, high blood pressure and high serum cholesterol--are not merely additive but act together such that each multiplies the effects of the others. Economic analyses in which the benefits of risk factor modification are estimated often reflect this. This paper explains how predictive models based on the simplest form of the multiple logistic function inevitably predict greater benefit from cholesterol lowering in those in whom other risk factors are adverse; this results from the model itself, rather than the data. CHD death rates from the screenee population of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial are examined: these suggest that the relationship between cholesterol and both other major risk factors is closer to additive than to multiplicative. When the benefits of cholesterol lowering are estimated, a model based on additive risk, specifying product ("interaction") terms, is to be preferred. 
4	Fatty infiltration: another restrictive cardiomyopathic pattern. Restrictive cardiomyopathies have been shown to occur as result of infiltrative processes from a variety of sources. The current report describes an obese male, who was found to have hemodynamic evidence of a restrictive cardiac process. His pericardium was proven to be normal and an incisional biopsy obtained of the myocardium during coronary artery bypass surgery demonstrated histologic evidence of fatty infiltration of myocardium. Review of the restrictive and pathology literature is discussed and indicates that this is the first report to demonstrate the association between fatty infiltration and hemodynamic findings consistent with a restrictive cardiomyopathy. 
1	Introduction to limb-salvage surgery for sarcomas. This article provides a history of limb-salvage surgery and definitions of terms used to describe aspects of the procedure. Staging is also discussed. 
2	T cell subsets (Tc, Th, Ts, Tsi) and IL2 receptor-bearing cells in peripheral blood of patients in the acute phase of alcoholic hepatitis. The present study was designed to evaluate the proportion of T cell subsets and IL2 receptor positive cells in the peripheral blood of patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) using monoclonal antibodies to T cell antigens and Tac in a double immunofluorescent technique. The results indicate that the percentage of the total T cells and the intensity of all the T cell antigens are significantly reduced and the percentage of T helper cells and the ratio between Th/Ts cells are significantly increased in AAH when compared to healthy controls. But, significant differences in values observed in this study were not found for the absolute number of these cells. These altered values returned to normal levels during convalescence. 
4	Alpha 1-antichymotrypsin as a possible biochemical marker for Alzheimer-type dementia. We measured serum alpha 1-antichymotrypsin levels in 38 patients with Alzheimer-type dementia, 89 control subjects, 2 subjects with Down's syndrome, 20 with vascular dementia, 18 with Parkinson's disease, 14 with spinocerebellar degeneration, 15 with cerebrovascular disease without dementia, and 14 with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin were also measured in 15 patients with Alzheimer-type dementia, 26 control subjects, 6 with vascular dementia, 7 with cerebrovascular disorder, and 11 with degenerative disorders. In control subjects, there were no age-related changes or sex differences. Serum and CSF levels were significantly and specifically higher in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia than in other subjects (serum, p less than 0.001; CSF, p less than 0.05). Serum levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin were significantly elevated in the early stage of Alzheimer-type dementia, whereas there was no definite correlation between serum levels and the degree of dementia. CSF levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin tended to parallel the severity of dementia. Serum levels were not correlated with CSF levels. These data indicate that serum and CSF levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin might be independently upregulated in Alzheimer-type dementia. We concluded that the measurement of serum levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin could be useful as a screening marker for Alzheimer-type dementia. In addition, CSF levels also could be a useful marker for Alzheimer-type dementia, because they might reflect the state of dementia. 
1	L-methionine uptake by human cerebral cortex: maturation from infancy to old age Age-associated changes in amino acid transport from blood to normal frontal cortex were studied using positron emission tomography (PET). Seventeen patients, 1.8-71 yr, were injected intravenously with tracer doses of [11C] L-methionine and a baseline PET scan was obtained. To assess competitive inhibition of [11C]L-methionine uptake, patients received either oral L-phenylalanine or an i.v. infusion of amino acids 1 hr before a second PET study. Uptake of [11C]L-methionine by frontal cortex decreased seven-fold between 1.8 and 71 yr (r = -0.71; p less than 0.05). Blood-to-brain transfer of [11C]L-methionine, at 4.5 yr, exceeded mean adult values by more than five-fold. Competitive inhibition reduced L-methionine uptake in all patients older than 4.6 yr. These developmental changes parallel findings in animals. The neutral amino acid transport system may modulate human brain amino acid levels to meet changing developmental metabolic needs. 
4	The effect of lateral tilt on maternal and fetal hemodynamic variables. We measured maternal blood pressure and heart rate, fetal heart rate, and umbilical artery velocity waveforms in 25 healthy women placed in the supine and in both right and left 5 degrees and 10 degrees lateral tilt positions. Although we found no significant difference among these variables in the various maternal positions, two of 25 women became hypotensive and symptomatic in the supine and 5 degrees tilt positions. Because we could not predict which women would become symptomatic, we recommend lateral tilt of all pregnant women during operative procedures beyond 20 weeks' gestation, including those in the lithotomy position for vaginal delivery. 
5	The long-term course of treated alcoholism: I. Mortality, relapse and remission rates and comparisons with community controls. This study examines the course of alcoholism for a sample of patients who were followed 2 years and 10 years later after an index residential treatment episode. The alcoholic patients were 9.5 times as likely to die as matched community controls over the 8-year interval between the two follow-ups, a ratio considerably higher than that found in previous studies. Of the 83 surviving and successfully followed patients, 57% were classified as remitted at the 10-year follow-up. Of the patients classified as remitted at the 2-year follow-up and recontacted 8 years later, 77% had the same outcome status at the long-term follow-up, 67% of the initially relapsed patients retained that status at the 10-year follow-up. The 10-year remitted patients generally were functioning as well as matched, nonproblem-drinking community controls, whereas the relapsed patients exhibited dysfunction in a number of areas. Retrospective data on drinking patterns during each of the 6 years prior to the 10-year follow-up indicated a slight increase over time in the proportion of patients reporting abstinence or nonproblem drinking, with a concomitant decrease in the proportion indicating heavy or binge drinking. Overall, our data show a substantially elevated mortality risk among these alcoholic patients. For those patients who survive, however, the average course is one of modest improvement. 
5	On-table pancreatography: importance in planning operative strategy. We describe our experience with 124 on-table pancreatograms performed during 117 operative procedures on 112 patients in a wide variety of clinical settings. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed on 84 occasions with a 73 per cent success rate for visualization of the main pancreatic duct. On-table pancreatography (OTP) was performed by one of five different techniques: retrograde, prograde or ambigrade ductography, cystography and ascending loopography after pancreaticojejunostomy. OTP provided important information about the main pancreatic duct when endoscopic visualization was unsuccessful (n = 23), incomplete (n = 17) or not performed (n = 33); there was a failure rate of 4 per cent. In 35 patients either the additional information or discrepancies between ERCP and OTP findings resulted in a change of operative plan (19 extra procedures, 16 altered procedures). Complete ductography was especially helpful in the 63 patients with chronic pancreatitis. OTP is technically simple, free from complications and invaluable for planning operative strategy. 
1	Myeloma manifesting as a large jugular tumor: case report. The authors report a case of cranial plasmacytoma with multiple myelomas and palsy of the lower cranial nerves. The osteolytic lesion adjacent to the jugular foramen was demonstrated by an angiogram to be exceedingly hypervascular, with arteriovenous shunting resembling that seen in paragangliomas. Forty-five cases of cranial and intracranial plasmacytoma from the literature were reviewed. The findings indicate that a cranial plasmacytoma commonly appears to be a hypervascular tumor, whereas most dural tumors or intraparenchymal tumors have poor vascularity. 
3	An extracorporeal perfusion system to bridge pediatric liver transplant candidates. An extracorporeal liver perfusion system was designed to maintain cadaver livers in an oxygenated, normothermic state for bridging procedures for hepatic transplantation. Nonpulsatile high flow and pulsatile low flow blood are supplied to the portal venous (PV) and hepatic arterial (HA) circulations. Controlled low blood flow (5-10 cc/kg [patient]/min) is exchanged between the high flow extracorporeal perfusion circuit (1 cc/g [liver]/min) and the patient. The system was evaluated in perfusions of fresh, excised pig livers (n = 5). The average oxygen consumption was 9 +/- 3 microliters/g/min, and bile production averaged 4.7 microliters/g/hr. Perfusion pressures and flows were normal in both the HA and PV circulations for about 4 hr. Pressures then gradually rose, especially in the HA circulation, causing flow to decrease, with subsequent mottling and discoloration of the liver. Red blood cell, platelet, and white blood cell counts fell continuously. Maintenance of liver function was assessed by clearance of an 80 mg taurocholic acid challenge. An average of 56% of injected acid was cleared from the perfused livers (n = 5) in the first half hour, compared with 90% and 25% for the in situ (n = 3) and unperfused (n = 3) control livers, respectively. The system consistently maintained livers in a moderately well functioning state through the first 4 hr of perfusion. Adequate support of animals with induced hepatic failure must now be demonstrated. 
4	Systemic hypertension in sleep apnea syndrome. Relationship with sleep architecture and breathing abnormalities. To examine the possible relationship between systemic HT and SAS we compared 21 hypertensive (HT+) and 29 normotensive (HT-) patients for morphologic characteristics, sleep disturbances and respiratory events monitored during a full night polysomnography. There was no significant difference between HT+ and HT- patients with respect to age, weight, BMI, sleep stage distribution and disorganization, apnea-hypopnea index (number of episodes per hour of sleep) and duration (minutes per hour of sleep) nor O2 saturation indices: mean nocturnal and minimum O2 saturation. We conclude therefore that HT in SAS patients is not directly related to morphologic characteristics, sleep disturbances and breathing abnormalities. 
1	Rapid sequence treatment of advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract: a pilot study. A review of the literature suggested that prolonged treatment time may lessen the probability of cure for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. To shorten treatment time, rapid sequence treatment (RST) was devised in which chemotherapy, surgery, and irradation were administered in a total treatment time of 8 weeks. Twelve patients were treated and followed 3 years or longer. Medical complications were minor. Osteonecrosis occurred in each of the first five patients and was the only major complication of the protocol. Surgical techniques were modified, and no additional patient developed osteonecrosis. No patient developed local or regional recurrence. Two patients developed distant metastases and three other patients developed second primaries. Absolute survival was 50%. Rapid sequence treatment is an aggressive and potentially hazardous protocol that yielded encouraging results in this pilot study. 
3	Role of serum prolactin determination in evaluation of impotent patient. Hyperprolactinemia is a recognized cause of impotence. The discovery of elevated prolactin levels in impotent men is very important since pharmacotherapy in this instance is highly successful. We review our experience with prolactin determinations in impotent men, and a population is defined that may benefit from routine prolactin determination. In our experience, the predominant symptom associated with hyperprolactinemia in men is loss of libido. 
5	Application of a modified bioassay for monitoring serum teicoplanin and vancomycin in febrile neutropenic patients. Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic with a mode of action and spectrum of activity similar to those of vancomycin. Its efficacy and tolerability as empiric therapy and its pharmacokinetic properties in neutropenic patients are being studied in a double-blinded, randomized trial in comparison with those of vancomycin. We report here a modified agar diffusion bioassay which is suitable for monitoring levels of either teicoplanin or vancomycin in serum during combination therapy with beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and amphotericin B. Serum samples spiked with either teicoplanin or vancomycin gave reproducible results (mean coefficient of variation, 8.8%) regardless of the presence of tobramycin, amikacin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, amphotericin B, or their combinations. Among 25 patients who received teicoplanin at a dosing schedule of 6 mg/kg every 24 h intravenously, steady state was reached after 14.2 +/- 4.0 days, and 1-h peak and trough concentrations of teicoplanin in serum at steady state were 40.8 +/- 15.0 and 12.5 +/- 3.2 mg/liter, respectively. In contrast, among 25 patients who received vancomycin at a dosing schedule of 15 mg/kg every 12 h intravenously, steady state was reached by 24 h, and the 1-h peak and trough concentrations in serum were 37.5 +/- 15.6 and 8.3 +/- 3.8 mg/liter, respectively. The elimination half-lives for teicoplanin estimated by two separate approaches agreed closely with each other: 80.5 +/- 21.5 h by an accumulation model (M. Gilbaldi and D. Perrier, Pharmacokinetics, 2nd ed., p. 121, 1982) and 87.3 +/- 19.3 h as predicted from the degree of renal function (M. Rowland, Clin. Pharmacokinetic 18:184-209, 1990). These values were 14- to 15-fold higher than that for vancomycin (5.6 +/- 1.8 h). 
3	Disturbance in daily sleep/wake patterns in patients with cognitive impairment and decreased daily activity. The sleep/wake patterns of 121 chronically ill, mentally and physically handicapped patients were visually monitored hourly for 14 consecutive days. Four types of sleep/wake patterns were found. In order to investigate how cognitive and physical functions correlated with sleep disorders, patients were classified based on a scale of mental function and the grading of daily activity. The percent of total sleep hours and the sleep rating, showing disturbances in sleep/wake pattern, were evaluated. We found a high degree of individuality in sleep/wake patterns. Sleep disturbance was associated with daily activity as well as with cognitive impairment. This monitoring system provides medical personnel with valuable information for clinical management. 
2	Peptic ulcer disease: CT evaluation. The authors retrospectively describe the computed tomographic (CT) findings in 35 patients with peptic ulcer disease. Three of eight patients with gastritis or duodenitis had bowel-wall thickening. Ten of the remaining 27 patients had CT evidence of ulcer perforation (n = 2) or penetration (n = 8), four cases of which were unsuspected clinically. Both patients with acute free perforation had pneumoperitoneum, and one showed free extravasation of orally administered contrast material. The precise site of perforation could not be established in either case with CT. The eight patients with ulcer penetration had CT evidence of bowel-wall thickening (n = 3) and inflammatory changes in adjacent soft tissues and organs (n = 8), including the pancreas (n = 4), liver (n = 1), and lesser omentum (n = 1). Ulcer craters were seen in only two. The CT findings of penetration can mimic other disease processes. CT was not useful in detecting uncomplicated peptic ulcer disease. 
5	Impact of echocardiography on the management of patients with mitral valve prolapse OBJECTIVE: To determine whether echocardiography affects the decisions to use beta blockers or to recommend bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients suspected of having mitral valve prolapse (MVP). DESIGN: Retrospective review of echocardiograms and clinical records. SETTING: Military tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: 127 patients with clinically suspected MVP (105) or incidentally discovered MVP (22). MAIN RESULTS: Beta blockers were used more often in patients with suspected MVP and positive echocardiograms (45%) than in patients with normal echocardiograms (13%, p less than 0.001). Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis was recommended more often in patients with suspected MVP and positive echocardiograms (65%) than in patients with normal echocardiograms (11%, p less than 0.001). Presence or absence of a murmur did not influence the decision to recommend bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis. Patients in whom MVP was incidentally discovered were unlikely to receive either beta blockers or the recommendation for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of echocardiography affect the decisions to use beta blockers or to recommend bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients with suspected MVP. 
3	Antemortem diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease. Using the presence of widespread cortical Lewy bodies (LB) as the pathologic criteria of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), we describe serial neurologic and mental status examinations in 6 patients with DLBD, 3 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 1 patient with Parkinson's disease (PD). The 6 patients with DLBD included 3 with neocortical neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) consistent with coincident AD. Most patients with DLBD had gait impairment concurrent with mild to moderate dementia. Abnormalities of tone or resting tremor were also prominent early symptoms in the subjects with DLBD, but not AD. Patients with DLBD frequently had abnormal EEGs with background posterior slowing and a frontally dominant burst pattern at the time of mild to moderate dementia. Agitation, hallucinations, and delusions were frequent early symptoms in DLBD patients. Patients with DLBD without concomitant AD had numerous Alz-50 negative cortical plaques. Patients with DLBD have a distinct clinical syndrome that can be differentiated from AD. Pathologic features, including the absence of Alz-50 immunoreactivity, also differentiate DLBD from AD. 
1	Role of histamine in natural killer cell-mediated resistance against tumor cells. The formation of lung metastases by i.v.-injected B16 melanoma (F1 and F10 strain) cells in Swiss albino, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice was reduced by a single dose of histamine given 24 h before tumor cell inoculation. The antimetastatic effect of histamine was specifically mediated by histamine H2-receptors (H2R): it was blocked by the H2R antagonist ranitidine and mimicked by dimaprit, a specific H2R agonist but not by an H2R-inactive structural analog of this compound, nor-dimaprit, or the H1R agonist 2-thiazolyl-ethylamide. A single dose of any of the H2R antagonists ranitidine, tiotidine, famotidine, or cimetidine drastically augmented metastasis. Effects of H2R-interactive compounds on B16 metastasis required intact NK cells, as judged by the inability of histamine or ranitidine to affect B16 metastasis after NK cell depletion in vivo using antibodies to asialo-GM1. NK-cell-mediated lysis of YAC-1 lymphoma cells in vivo was enhanced by histamine and reduced by ranitidine within 4 h after inoculation of tumor cells. The antimetastatic effect of IL-2 was potentiated by histamine; in some experiments, combined treatment with a low dose of IL-2 (6000 U/kg) and histamine completely eliminated metastasis, whereas concomitant treatment with ranitidine abrogated antimetastatic effects of IL-2; animals treated with ranitidine and IL-2 displayed the same level of enhanced metastasis as those treated with ranitidine alone. The presented data are suggestive of an earlier unrecognized role for histamine in NK cell-mediated resistance against metastatic tumor cells. 
1	An unusual complication of silastic dural substitute: case report. A case is presented in which a patient developed an unusual complication after the use of Silastic dural substitute. In 1983, the patient underwent removal of a meningioma with the involved dura. Five years later, he developed around the graft material a very thick connective tissue capsule, which simulated a recurrent meningioma clinically and radiologically. 
4	Effects of bucindolol on neurohormonal activation in congestive heart failure. To examine the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on neurohormonal activation in patients with congestive heart failure, 15 men had assessments of hemodynamics and supine peripheral renin and norepinephrine levels before and after 3 months of oral therapy with bucindolol, a nonselective beta antagonist. At baseline, plasma renin activity did not correlate with any hemodynamic parameter. However, norepinephrine levels had a weak correlation with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01), stroke volume index (r = 0.61, p less than 0.02) and pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.54, p less than 0.05). Plasma renin decreased with bucindolol therapy, from 11.6 +/- 13.4 to 4.3 +/- 4.1 ng/ml/hour (mean +/- standard deviation; p less than 0.05), whereas plasma norepinephrine was unchanged, from 403 +/- 231 to 408 +/- 217 pg/ml. A wide diversity of the norepinephrine response to bucindolol was observed with reduction of levels in some patients and elevation in others. Although plasma norepinephrine did not decrease, heart rate tended to decrease (from 82 +/- 20 vs 73 +/- 11 min-1, p = 0.059) with beta-adrenergic blockade, suggesting neurohormonal antagonism at the receptor level. No changes in I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake occurred after bucindolol therapy, suggesting unchanged adrenergic uptake of norepinephrine with beta-blocker therapy. Despite reductions in plasma renin activity and the presence of beta blockade, the response of renin or norepinephrine levels to long-term bucindolol therapy did not predict which patients had improved in hemodynamic status (chi-square = 0.37 for renin, 0.82 for norepinephrine). 
2	Aggravation of myasthenia gravis by erythromycin. Erythromycin is not currently recognized as causing clinical aggravation of myasthenia gravis. We report the case of a patient who experienced exacerbations of myasthenia gravis subsequent to each of several doses of intravenous erythromycin. We suggest that erythromycin can cause clinical worsening in patients with disease of the neuromuscular junction. 
4	Beta-adrenergic receptors in lymphocyte subsets after exercise. Alterations in normal individuals and patients with congestive heart failure. Dynamic exercise increases the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in mixed lymphocytes by a mechanism that is incompletely understood. In a set of in vivo studies, we have investigated the effects of dynamic exercise on the subset distribution of circulating lymphocytes and on the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in each of these subsets in two groups of patients. In healthy subjects, exercise increased plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine and caused lymphocytosis. Whereas the number of Thelper cells increased only modestly, the number of Tsuppressor/cytotoxic and natural killer cells more than tripled. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors varied among subsets but was not significantly altered by dynamic exercise in any subset except natural killer cells (35% increase, p = 0.0302). In a group of patients with congestive heart failure, dynamic exercise increased plasma norepinephrine but did not alter plasma epinephrine and did not cause significant lymphocytosis. We did not detect any significant alterations of circulating leukocyte subsets or beta-adrenergic receptors in any of these subsets after exercise. A combined analysis of healthy patients and heart failure patients revealed a significant correlation between increases in plasma epinephrine and increases in circulating lymphocytes. We conclude that the exercise-induced increase in beta-adrenergic receptors of mixed lymphocytes is predominantly caused by a redistribution of circulating cell subsets that differ in their beta-adrenergic receptor number. This appears to be mediated by epinephrine rather than norepinephrine. 
4	Heparin as an adjunctive treatment after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The rationale for considering heparin therapy as an adjunct to thrombolytic treatment for patients with acute myocardial infarction is to prevent rethrombosis after successful thrombolysis. The risk of reocclusion is high immediately after thrombolysis because blood flowing through the newly opened coronary artery is exposed to thrombin bound to fibrin in the residual thrombus. Clinical studies of patients with venous thrombosis and acute myocardial infarction indicate that there is a relation between the anticoagulant response to heparin and clinical efficacy and that the concept of a therapeutic heparin level is valid. Subcutaneous doses of approximately 15,000 U twice a day fail to provide an adequate anticoagulant response at 24 hours in the majority of patients, whereas intravenous administration of a bolus of 5,000 U followed by continuous infusion of 30,000 U per 24 hours produces an adequate anticoagulant response at 24 hours in approximately 80% of patients. Studies of patients with myocardial infarction who received streptokinase showed a significant beneficial effect on mortality when 12,500 U of heparin was administered subcutaneously 2 times per day. In contrast, the single largest study evaluating heparin 12,500 U administered subcutaneously 2 times per day as an adjunct to recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment did not show a beneficial effect on mortality. However, studies using full-dose intravenous heparin therapy demonstrated that heparin improves patency after coronary thrombolysis with rt-PA. 
1	Autoradiographic evaluation of monoclonal antibodies' access to melanoma-associated antigens in melanoma xenografts. Autoradiography of nude mice bearing human malignant melanoma xenografts was performed to characterize the distribution pattern of radioiodinated anti-melanoma monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and fragments in macroscopic tumor nodules. Non-uniformity of radioactivity distribution was seen in all MoAb-xenograft combinations. The predominant patterns were marked deposition of radioactivity either in the periphery of nodules or in sharply delimited intra-tumoral foci. These patterns were generated by limitations in the accessibility of melanoma tissue rather than gross necrosis or heterogeneity of antigen expression. Computer-aided densitometry of autoradiograms was used to elaborate the difference of accumulation in intra-tumoral hot spots versus cold areas. It was found that increasing uniformity was achieved by increasing the dose of MoAb (i.e., intact IgG) injected, whereas a reduction in the size of MoAb (IgG greater than F(ab')2 greater than Fab) showed no such effect. 
4	Traumatic popliteal artery pseudoaneurysms: case report and review of the literature. Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the popliteal artery are an uncommon late complication of arterial injury. Although reviewed extensively in wartime, they occur less frequently in civilian trauma and have accordingly been less frequently studied. A case report of a traumatic popliteal artery pseudoaneurysm and review of the literature are presented. 
5	Conservative therapy for adnexal torsion. A case report. Adnexal torsion has traditionally been treated with oophorectomy because of the fear that untwisting the ovarian pedicle may result in a thrombotic embolus. Such a patient had bilateral adnexal torsion secondary to dermoid cysts. Since standard therapy, oophorectomy, was performed, the patient was surgically castrated. A review of the literature revealed no reported cases of a thrombotic embolus arising from the untwisting of twisted adnexa and supported conservation of the adnexa rather than routine extirpation, except when necrotic. 
5	Scatter photocoagulation restores tissue hypoxia in experimental vasoproliferative microangiopathy in miniature pigs. Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion using argon laser photocoagulation in miniature pigs induced the development of ischemic retinal territories associated with preretinal neovascularization. Preretinal partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) measurements on the ischemic territories, using O2-sensitive microelectrodes, established that the ischemic retinal areas were hypoxic. Scatter photocoagulation of these ischemic hypoxic territories restores the local PO2 to the normal values within 2 weeks. Hence, the reported inhibitory effect of photocoagulation on the development of retinal neovascularization could be due to a reversal effect on tissue hypoxia. 
2	Clinical differentiation of fulminant Wilsonian hepatitis from other causes of hepatic failure. Establishing a diagnosis of fulminant Wilson's disease can be difficult because Kayser-Fleischer rings may not be present and parameters of copper metabolism, including serum and urinary copper, and serum ceruloplasmin levels are neither specific nor diagnostic. In this study, ratios of both the serum alkaline phosphatase to total bilirubin and aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase were constructed to evaluate their usefulness in differentiating fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease (n = 6) from other etiologies (n = 43). An analysis of the data showed that cutoff values of less than 2.0 for the alkaline phosphatase-total bilirubin ratio and greater than 4.0 for the aspartate transaminase ratio were associated with a diagnosis of fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease only (P less than 0.001). The alkaline phosphatase-total bilirubin ratio of less than 2.0 provided 100% sensitivity and specificity in identifying fulminant hepatic failure caused by Wilson's disease from other types of fulminant hepatic failure. 
4	Reconstructive surgery in chronic venous obstruction of the lower limbs. Forty-one patients with chronic venous insufficiency due to venous trunk obstruction of the lower limbs underwent 43 flow reconstruction procedures consisting of either free veno-venous bypass or venous transposition. The indicating symptoms for these procedures were (1) progressive chronic edema, (2) claudication while walking, or (3) trophic lesions. Doppler ultrasound and plethysmographic techniques were employed in the diagnosis while phlebography was considered the most useful and most essential technique. Iliac vein obstruction was the most common venous obstruction, followed by superficial femoral vein obstruction. Two patients were operated on for combined obstruction at both levels. Free veno-venous bypass was the most frequently used procedure. In two cases of cavo-iliac obstruction, an original technique of femoro-axillary veno-venous bypass yielded good results. Temporary arteriovenous fistulas to improve patency at sites distal to venous bypass were used in the most complex cases. Good results were obtained in 80% of the operated cases. Postoperative follow-up phlebograms were obtained in 30 of 43 operations. 
4	Age-related changes in membrane fluidity of erythrocytes in essential hypertension. In the present study, age- and calcium-related changes in the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes were examined in patients with essential hypertension by use of electron spin resonance method (ESR). The erythrocytes were obtained from patients with essential hypertension. We examined the ESR spectra for a fatty acid spin label agent (5-nitroxy stearate) incorporated into the erythrocyte membranes. The values of outer hyperfine splitting and order parameter (S) were significantly higher in subjects with essential hypertension than in the normotensive subjects. This finding indicates that the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes was lower in essential hypertension. Calcium-loading of erythrocytes with the Ca-ionophore A23187 decreased the membrane fluidity (S value was increased) more strongly in essential hypertension than in the normotensive subjects. Furthermore, this Ca-induced change in membrane fluidity was significantly correlated with age in essential hypertension. These results demonstrate that the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes is markedly decreased by calcium, especially in essential hypertension in older patients. This suggests an increased calcium-sensitivity of cell membranes in the aged hypertensive patient. 
3	Enhanced in vitro uptake and retention of 3H-tetraphenylphosphonium by nervous system tumor cells. Photodynamic therapy is a promising treatment for human brain tumors because of the selective retention of certain compounds by tumor cells. Certain lipophilic cationic compounds, such as tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), are selectively taken up by a variety of carcinomas. Although preferential retention of TPP has been demonstrated for the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, this compound had not been tested previously on cells derived from nervous system tumors. In the present study, tritiated-TPP (3H-TPP) uptake and retention for eight different cell cultures of three histologically different types of nervous system tumors was measured and the data were compared to a positive control (MCF-7) and negative controls (normal African Green monkey kidney epithelium (CV-1) and the normal human fibroblast (WI-38) cell lines). Uptake and retention characteristics could be grouped by specific pathological tumor types, but individual tumor variability was notable. Malignant astrocytoma (grade III/III glioblastoma) and malignant neurofibrosarcoma cells showed preferential uptake and retention of 3H-TPP relative to meningioma cells and normal controls. A clonogenic assay utilizing the cytotoxic lipophilic cationic compound dequalinium showed strong retainers of 3H-TPP to be more susceptible to the effects of dequalinium than weak retainers. These data demonstrate that certain human and experimental animal nervous system tumor cell lines retain lipophilic compounds possessing a delocalized positive charge. Lipophilic cationic compounds may be useful in the intraoperative delineation of tumor margins and in the photodynamic therapy of certain nervous system tumors. 
1	Disseminated human malignant melanoma in congenitally immune-deficient (bg/nu/xid) mice. Congenitally immune-deficient bg/nu/xid (BNX) mice are severely compromised in their ability to mount T-cell, B-cell, and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell responses. Successful engraftment of BNX mice with human hematopoietic stem cells has been demonstrated recently. We have investigated the potential use of BNX mice for studies relating to the biology and immunotherapy of human malignant melanoma. The intravenous injection of fresh single-cell suspensions of human malignant melanomas into mice resulted in widely disseminated disease. Metastatic spread of human melanoma in BNX mice mimicked that observed in patients: eg, there were numerous tumor nodules identified in the subcutaneous tissues as well as in a variety of visceral organs, including spleen, kidneys, thyroid, adrenals, lungs, heart, and brain. BNX mouse lymph nodes were replaced consistently by human malignant melanoma cells. The presence of human tumor cells in these mice was confirmed by histologic analysis and microcytofluorometry analyses using human melanoma-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Moreover, human melanoma cells passaged in BNX mice remained lysable in vitro by specifically cytolytic, autologous human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The capacity of fresh human malignant melanoma to disseminate widely in BNX mice may prove valuable not only for study of the biology of metastatic spread but also for studies of the immunotherapy of human melanoma using melanoma-specific MAbs and chemotherapeutic agents, as well as human TILs and LAK cells with or without retrovirus-mediated gene transfer modification. 
2	Evaluation of WC3 rotavirus vaccine and correlates of protection in healthy infants. The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of WC3 rotavirus vaccine was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of healthy infants 2-12 months of age; 103 received one dose of vaccine and 103 received placebo. Vaccination appeared to be safe and induced an antibody response (WC3 neutralizing antibody) in 97% of vaccinees. Only 9 (9%) of these, however, produced antibody to human rotavirus serotypes; at least 7 of the 9 were naturally infected before vaccination. Neither the number of symptomatic episodes of rotavirus diarrhea (21 vs 25) nor the number of moderate to severe rotavirus illnesses (9 vs. 15) was significantly different in vaccine or placebo recipients, respectively, during a predominantly serotype 1 rotavirus season. A slight but significant decrease in mean symptom score was detected in vaccine recipients. Despite an overall lack of efficacy, protection could be correlated to previous rotavirus infection, high levels of WC3 neutralizing antibody, and preexisting (maternal) serotype 1 neutralizing antibody with a titer greater than or equal to 30. 
4	Serial left ventricular performance evaluated by cardiac catheterization before, immediately after and at 6 months after balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Although impaired ventricular function has been shown to improve after aortic valve replacement, there are few data on hemodynamic changes after balloon aortic valvuloplasty based on follow-up catheterization. Of 71 patients surviving 6 months after balloon aortic valvuloplasty, 41 agreed to late recatheterization. All patients had pre- and postvalvuloplasty and 6 month catheterization data measured with high fidelity micromanometer pressure recordings and simultaneous digital subtraction left ventriculography. The hemodynamic result immediately after valvuloplasty included a reduction in the aortic valve gradient and a moderate increase in aortic valve area (0.51 +/- 0.14 to 0.81 +/- 0.19 cm2, p less than 0.0001). Ejection fraction increased slightly (52 +/- 18 to 55 +/- 17%, p less than 0.0001) despite a decrease in peak positive rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt 1,650 +/- 460 to 1,500 +/- 490 mm Hg/s, p less than 0.05). There was also a decrease in left ventricular afterload and a small decrease in preload. At 6 month recatheterization, the mean aortic valve gradient and area were similar to baseline values, with 31 (76%) of 41 patients demonstrating valvular restenosis. At 6 months many left ventricular hemodynamic variables, including peak positive dP/dt and stroke work, also resembled prevalvuloplasty values. However, left ventricular end-diastolic volume was reduced (111 +/- 40 ml at 6 months versus 136 +/- 52 ml before valvuloplasty, p less than 0.01). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was unchanged from prevalvuloplasty values in the study group of 41 patients, but was significantly improved in 9 of 15 patients with a baseline ejection fraction less than 50%. 
1	Chondrosarcoma of the jaws: clinical findings, histopathology, and treatment. Three cases of chondrosarcoma involving the jaws are presented, one in the maxilla and two in the mandible. The salient points of clinical presentation elucidated by this series of cases are that a widened periodontal ligament space is present in chondrosarcomas as well as in osteosarcomas, and that a slowly increasing diastema may be the earliest clinical sign. The most important lesson to be learned from the histopathology is that one should not accept a diagnosis of a benign cartilaginous tumor of the jaws. Treatment of these lesions should consist of wide surgical excision and consideration of adjunctive or palliative radiotherapy, especially in the maxilla. It should also be noted that recurrences may develop 10 to 20 years later, and follow-up should be lifelong. 
5	Peptic ulcer surgery during the H2-receptor antagonist era: a population-based epidemiological study of ulcer surgery in Helsinki from 1972 to 1987. To evaluate the effects of improvements in medical therapy on the incidence of, indications for and operative methods used in peptic ulcer surgery, all cases of primary peptic ulcer surgery among adults in the city of Helsinki in the years 1972, 1977, 1982 and 1987 were analysed. There was a total of 565 such cases in a population which consisted of 5.2 X 10(5) individuals in 1972 and 4.8 X 10(5) individuals in 1987. The introduction of H2-receptor antagonists in 1979 was associated with a fall in the annual incidence of elective duodenal ulcer operations, from 15.5 to 6.7 per 10(5) individuals, and a fall in the annual incidence of elective gastric ulcer operations, from 9.4 to 3.1 per 10(5) individuals (P less than 0.05). The decrease was greatest among males with duodenal ulcer. In contrast, the annual incidence of emergency surgery for ulcer haemorrhage and perforation (all types of ulcers) remained relatively stable, varying from 7.2 to 10.2 per 10(5) inhabitants over the observation period (n.s.). The mean age of patients undergoing elective surgery remained essentially unchanged. The mean age of patients undergoing emergency surgery increased. The decrease in the annual incidence of elective duodenal ulcer surgery occurred mainly in relation to proximal gastric vagotomy. There was a concomitant relative increase in the incidence of gastric resection. The types of operative procedures used in cases of pyloric, prepyloric and gastric ulcer remained unchanged over the years 1972 to 1987. 
3	Primary intracerebral sarcoma in childhood: case report with electron-microscope study. A case of a primary intracerebral sarcoma is described in a 5-year-old girl. Histology and immunohistochemistry excluded the diagnosis of a leiomyosarcoma, a malignant haemangiopericytoma or a fibrosarcoma; electron-microscopical findings indicated that the origin of the sarcoma was in the pia mater. 
5	Metastatic carcinoma to the retina. Clinicopathologic findings in two cases. Two cases of metastatic carcinoma to the neuroretina are reported. One patient had an oat cell carcinoma of the lung that was metastatic to the brain and retina; this was confirmed postmortem. The other patient had metastatic breast carcinoma with seeding of tumor cells into the vitreous from a focus of retinal embolism. The diagnosis was confirmed from a vitrectomy specimen. 
3	Technetium-99m-HMPAO brain SPECT in medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy: a postoperative evaluation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of interictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium-99m-labeled hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) for the outcome after temporal lobectomy in patients with complex partial seizures. Out of 40 patients, 21 underwent right-sided and 19 left-sided temporal lobectomy. EEG and CT/MRI were primarily used to select the side of surgery. SPECT results correlated with temporal lobectomy in 68% of the patients. After surgical intervention, memory function was tested for both sides. Following left-sided temporal lobectomy, verbal memory was impaired in 8% of the patients, if SPECT agreed with the side selected for surgery, but in 83%, if it diverged from it. In the present study, there was no relationship between SPECT concordance with the side of temporal lobectomy and outcome as to seizure frequency and non-verbal memory. We conclude that preoperative interictal HMPAO/SPECT can contribute to the prediction of postoperative verbal memory function and that this method should be considered for use prior to temporal lobectomy. 
5	Pharmacokinetics of acyclovir in the term human pregnancy and neonate. Concern about neonatal herpes often leads to cesarean delivery of infants in women with a history of genital herpes. The antiviral drug acyclovir has been used effectively to suppress genital herpes simplex virus recurrences in nonpregnant adults. Its administration to pregnant women with recurrent genital herpes may reduce herpes simplex virus recurrences and thus may decrease the cesarean section rate among this population. To study the pharmacokinetics, safety, and patient tolerance of suppressive oral acyclovir, either 200 mg (n = 7) or 400 mg (n = 8) was administered orally every 8 hours to pregnant women with a history of recurrent herpes simplex virus, from 38 weeks' gestation until delivery. The mean +/- SD plasma levels for the 200 and 400 mg groups, respectively, were: first dose peak, 1.7 +/- 0.6 and 2.3 +/- 1.0 mumol/L; steady-state trough, 0.7 +/- 0.3 and 0.8 +/- 0.6 mumol/L; steady-state peak, 1.9 +/- 1.0 and 3.3 +/- 1.0 mumol/L. In late gestation maternal acyclovir pharmacokinetics were similar to those of nonpregnant adults from other studies. Acyclovir was concentrated in the amniotic fluid; however, there was no accumulation in the fetus (mean maternal/infant plasma ratio at delivery was 1.3). Acyclovir was well tolerated, and no toxicity was seen in the mothers or infants. The administration of acyclovir, 400 mg every 8 hours, appears appropriate for use in an efficacy and safety study regarding suppression of herpes simplex virus recurrences during the last weeks of pregnancy. 
1	Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. A clinicopathologic study of 60 cases. Sixty cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) were analyzed clinicopathologically (24 VIN I, 9 VIN II, 27 VIN III). The ages of the patients ranged from 21 to 83 years (mean, 53.7). Colposcopic examinations showed the presence of white areas in 29 cases, red areas in 9, acetowhite areas in 6 and other alterations in 13. One-third of the lesions were multifocal. Pruritus and burning were present in 65% of the cases. Fifty-one percent of the cases showed histologic changes suggestive of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; the mean age of those patients was significantly lower than that of patients without HPV infection. In 15 cases of VIN, HPV DNA testing was performed with Southern blot hybridization; in three (20%) of those specimens HPV 16 episomal DNA was identified. Epithelial alterations surrounding the areas of VIN were found in 24 cases (40%)-23 squamous cellular hyperplasias and 1 lichen sclerosus. Different types of treatment were performed according to the different grades of VIN: medical therapy, diathermocoagulation, local excision, hemivulvectomy and total vulvectomy. Follow-up was possible in 52 cases, with a mean of 33 months (range, 3-98). Two cases of VIN I showed progression of disease over 12-24 months. 
2	Insulin resistance in noncirrhotic idiopathic portal hypertension. To explore further the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance observed in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, we studied a 35-year-old woman with presinusoidal portal hypertension without cirrhosis due to nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. After oral glucose ingestion, glucose tolerance remained normal; however, this occurred at the expense of a markedly hyperinsulinemic plasma response, suggesting the presence of insulin resistance. To examine this question more directly, we performed a stepwise euglycemic insulin clamp study in combination with an infusion of [6-3H]glucose and [1-14C]palmitate and indirect calorimetry. The ability of insulin to promote total body (primarily muscle) glucose uptake was markedly impaired, whereas its effect to suppress hepatic glucose production was normal compared with results obtained in nine healthy subjects. Moreover, insulin failed to normally suppress plasma free fatty acid turnover and oxidation in this patient. This informative case demonstrates that portal hypertension alone, without hepatic dysfunction from cirrhosis, is associated with impaired insulin-mediated glucose and plasma free fatty acid metabolism and may also play a predominant role in the development of insulin resistance in many cirrhotic patients. 
5	Neglected factors in chronic pain treatment outcome studies--referral patterns, failure to enter treatment, and attrition. An increasing number of chronic pain treatment outcome studies have appeared in the literature. In general, these studies support the efficacy of multidisciplinary pain programs, as well as specific treatment modalities such as biofeedback and relaxation. Reviews of this literature have tended to be cautiously optimistic. Some concerns, however, have been raised about the methodological adequacy of these studies, particularly in terms of the lack of control groups, the brief duration of follow-up periods, and the vague criteria used for establishing the success of the therapeutic interventions. Other factors that mitigate conclusions regarding the generalizability of the favorable results reported need to be considered. In this paper 3 rarely discussed topics that are implicit within most treatment outcome studies and that need to be given greater attention are examined. These topics include: (1) referral patterns to pain clinics (who are referred to pain clinics, when, and how representative is the referred sample?); (2) failure to enter treatment (e.g., exclusion criteria, lack of available financial support to cover the cost of treatment, patient's refusal to accept recommendations), and consequently, the representativeness of the treated sample; and (3) patient's attrition. In this paper we discuss each of these factors as they underscore important qualifications that have to be made in evaluating treatment outcome studies. 
4	Regional obesity and risk of cardiovascular disease; the Framingham Study. Risk of cardiovascular events was determined over 24 years of surveillance in relation to general adiposity reflected by relative weight and by regional obesity estimated by skinfolds and waist girth per inch of height. Upper quintile values of relative weight, subscapular skinfolds and waist girth were each associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease in both sexes. Risk of total cardiovascular events increased with the degree of regional, central or abdominal obesity. Mortality from cardiovascular disease was also increased. Increased relative weight and central obesity were both associated with increased risk factors including cholesterol, blood pressure, glucose and uric acid. Changes in weight were mirrored by changes in risk factors with linear trends over a 15 lb range of weight fluctuations. Subscapular skinfold and the ratio of subscapular-to-triceps skinfold, measures of central obesity, were in either sex also associated with an increased probability of coronary attacks in particular. The subscapular skinfold contributed to CHD risk independent of body mass index (BMI). Multivariate analyses taking all the risk factors into account indicate an independent effect of abdominal obesity on stroke, cardiac failure and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in men. In women, only the subscapular-to-triceps skinfold ratio independently contributes to CHD, cardiovascular and all cause mortality. Regional obesity appears to be an independent contributor to cardiovascular disease at a given level of general adiposity, its effect only partially mediated through promotion of other known risk factors. These data suggest that cardiovascular disease is as closely linked to abdominal as to general adiposity. 
5	Controversies in the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis An increasing number of cases of sore throat caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci occur with concomitant colonization by organisms that may "protect" the streptococci through beta-lactamase inactivation of penicillin at the site of infection. The failure of penicillin to eradicate many of these bacteria, which include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis and a multitude of pharyngeal anaerobes, may help to explain why penicillin is sometimes ineffective for acute and recurrent group A streptococcal infections. Therapeutic alternatives currently include cephalosporins, erythromycin, rifampin combined with penicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium and others. 
1	Carcinoma of the external auditory canal: an update. This review is a continuation of the series of 35 cases of carcinoma of the external auditory canal originally reported by the senior author and colleagues. Eighteen additional cases have been evaluated and treated since 1976. Preoperative high-resolution computed tomographic scanning has replaced polytomography, and improved surgical skull base approaches have allowed for extended resections of advanced lesions. A revised classification for local and extensive lesions is presented. The prognosis for localized tumors treated by en bloc resection remains excellent, whereas prognosis for extensive lesions might be more dependent on histologic type and grade of tumor. 
1	Development and characterization of a new, highly specific antibody to the human chorionic gonadotropin-beta fragment. In addition to high concentrations of hCG, pregnancy urine contains even higher concentrations of a fragment of the hCG beta-subunit. This biologically inactive material complicates immunological measurement of hCG, since it cross-reacts with many polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the hCG beta-subunit that are employed for assays of hCG in urine. Although we and others have developed antibodies to this fragment, specific measurement of the fragment in the presence of free hCG beta has remained difficult due to intrinsic cross-reactivity of these antibodies with the intact hCG beta. Rather than attempt to increase specificity by assay optimization, we developed a new, highly specific monoclonal antibody, designated B210, which cross-reacts less than 0.1% with the free hCG beta-subunit in both liquid and solid phase immunoassay formats. We have used this new monoclonal antibody in immunoradiometric assays to measure specifically the hCG beta fragment in urine throughout pregnancy as well as in the sera of two individuals with cancers producing the hCG beta-subunit. We discovered that the hCG beta fragment can bind three monoclonal antibodies simultaneously, indicating that although the epitope for antibody B210 is a new determinant exposed on the hCG beta fragment and not on intact hCG or on free hCG beta-subunit, the hCG beta fragment retains at least two other hCG beta-related epitopes intact, i.e. those that bind monoclonal antibodies B108 and B201. 
2	Transvaginal approach for repair of rectovaginal fistulae complicating Crohn's disease. The management of rectovaginal fistulae complicating Crohn's disease is difficult and often unsatisfactory. Between December 1983 and November 1988, 13 patients with Crohn's disease underwent repair of rectovaginal fistulae via a transvaginal approach. All patients had a diverting intestinal stoma either as part of the initial step in the staged management of intractable perianal disease or concurrent with the repair of the rectovaginal fistula. Each of the patients had low or mid septal fistulae; high fistulae generally are treated transabdominally and are not the focus of this discussion. Fistulae were eradicated in 12 of the 13 women and did not recur during the follow-up period, which averaged 50 months (range, 9 to 68 months). The only treatment failure was a patient who had a markedly diseased colon from the cecum to the rectum and a very low-lying fistula. It is concluded that a modified transvaginal approach is an effective method for repair of rectovaginal fistulae secondary to Crohn's disease. 
5	Inhibition by dexamethasone of histamine production in allergic inflammation in rats. In an allergic inflammation model of air pouch type in rats, histamine level in the pouch fluid and histidine decarboxylase activity of pouch wall tissues in the postanaphylaxis phase were increased. Although treatment with dexamethasone failed to inhibit histamine release from mast cells in the anaphylaxis phase, histamine production in the postanaphylaxis phase was inhibited dose dependently. Histamine production-increasing activity in the pouch fluid collected 8 h after the Ag challenge, which was estimated by an activity to stimulate histamine production by bone marrow cells, was decreased by the administration of dexamethasone at the time of the Ag challenge. The addition of steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, dexamethasone, prednisolone, or hydrocortisone, into the incubation medium inhibited the pouch fluid-induced histamine production by bone marrow cells. Hydrocortisone mesylate antagonized the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on histamine production by bone marrow cells. However, hydrocortisone mesylate failed to recover the decrease in histamine production-increasing activity of the pouch fluid collected from dexamethasone-treated rats. In addition, the dialyzed sample of pouch fluid obtained from dexamethasone-treated nonsensitized rats did not reduce the stimulated histamine production by the pouch fluid sample obtained from the sensitized rats. However, increase in histamine production of bone marrow cells stimulated by the pouch fluid was not inhibited by cyclosporin A that inhibited histamine production induced by Con A. This observation indicates that the pouch fluid has no effect to induce production of the histamine production-increasing factor by bone marrow cells. Consequently, it is suggested that dexamethasone inhibits not only the production of histamine production-increasing factor but also the response of histamine-producing cells to this factor. 
3	Risk factors for white matter changes detected by magnetic resonance imaging in the elderly. We found increased age (p = 0.001) and history or evidence of stroke (p = 0.016) to be significant independent multivariate predictors of the presence and severity of leukoencephalopathy on magnetic resonance imaging brain scans in a mixed population of 35 elderly psychiatric patients and 25 neurologically healthy elderly volunteers. These results suggest that subcortical ischemia, as well as age-related changes that may not be vascular in origin, contribute to the emergence of periventricular and other deep white matter hyperintensities that are commonly seen on the magnetic resonance imaging brain scans of older adults. 
1	Combined gadolinium-enhanced and fat-saturation MR imaging of renal masses. Combined gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement and fat-saturation (FS) spin-echo (SE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for the detection and characterization of renal masses was evaluated in 43 patients with a total of 71 lesions (28 solid masses and 43 cysts). SE MR sequences compared were the following: short repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE), conventional SE, short TR/TE FS SE, long TR/TE conventional SE, gadolinium-enhanced short TR/TE conventional SE, and gadolinium-enhanced short TR/TE FS SE techniques. MR findings were compared with findings of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and with pathologic findings in all patients. The sensitivities for detection of renal masses with gadolinium-enhanced FS (71 of 71 lesions) and with gadolinium-enhanced short TR/TE conventional (65 of 71 lesions) SE sequences were significantly (P less than .01) greater than with any unenhanced (short TR/TE conventional [40 of 71 lesions], or long TR/TE [39 of 71 lesions]) SE sequence. Lesion characterization was also best with the gadolinium-enhanced FS SE sequence (65 of 71 lesions correctly classified). When combined pre- and postcontrast short TR/TE FS SE images were analyzed with both qualitative (visual) and quantitative (region-of-interest measurements) assessment, lesion characterization improved even further (70 of 71 lesions were correctly characterized). All lesions detected with CT were visualized with the gadolinium-enhanced FS SE MR sequence, which in addition depicted seven cysts and two small renal cell carcinomas. In summary, the use of gadopentetate dimeglumine, especially when combined with the FS technique, was superior to unenhanced MR imaging for detection and characterization of renal lesions. 
4	Ultrasound-Doppler diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome. We report a case of apparently idiopathic Budd-Chiari syndrome, diagnosed by ultrasound and Doppler sonography, in a patient with latent myeloproliferative disease. This case proves that Doppler sonography shows in the hepatic veins a flow pattern suggestive of partial thrombotic obstruction. Moreover, we suggest that the search for a latent myeloproliferative disorder, by means of the spontaneous erythroid colonies formation in culture of bone marrow or blood mononuclear cells, should be routinely included in the diagnostic evaluation of each case of hepatic vein thrombosis without other recognizable causes. 
5	Results and follow-up after percutaneous pulsed laser-assisted balloon angioplasty guided by spectroscopy BACKGROUND. Few data are available on the long-term outcome of patients who undergo laser-assisted balloon angioplasty for recanalization of occluded peripheral arteries. Because the cost of laser angioplasty is high, the value of the method should be carefully analyzed before it can be considered a routine method for recanalization. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early and late results of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty in patients who could not be recanalized by conventional techniques. METHODS AND RESULTS. Laser angioplasty was performed in 66 patients with total occlusion of the iliofemoral artery in whom mechanical techniques failed to recanalize the obstructed vessel. The system consisted of a pulsed dye laser operated at 480 nm, 2 microseconds/pulse, 5 Hz, 50 mJ/pulse coupled into a 0.021-in. laser catheter. The treatment laser was connected with a diagnostic laser to induce tissue fluorescence for spectroscopic analysis via the same fiber. The treatment laser was emitted only when atheromatous tissue was recognized. After a pilot hole was created by laser emission, dilatation was performed to enlarge the channel. The mean length of occlusion was 8.8 +/- 6.1 cm. The primary success rate was 82%. It did not depend on the length of occlusion but was greater in non-calcified than in calcified lesions (88% versus 71%, p less than 0.03). Complications included seven early reocclusions that could be recanalized and eight perforations without clinical sequelae. At a mean 18-month follow-up, 64% of the laser-treated arteries remained patent. The rate of patency was related neither to the length of the occlusion nor to calcifications but was lower in patients who had early reocclusion (p less than 0.02). CONCLUSIONS. Pulsed dye laser-assisted balloon angioplasty is effective for recanalization of totally occluded arteries that cannot be treated by conventional means. The efficacy is limited by calcifications. The long-term patency rate is acceptable given the severity of the lesions. 
5	Acquired childhood aphasia. Outcome 1 year after onset. The effects of the variables age at onset, cause, severity and bilaterality of lesion, and type of aphasia on course and outcome were investigated in a group of 28 aphasic children. Analysis of spontaneous speech and tests of auditory verbal comprehension were used to determine the presence of aphasia. The severity of the cerebral lesion was assessed using a rating scale for computed tomographic scans. Most of the children had not recovered completely 1 year after onset. Recovery was significantly different according to etiological categories. Complete recovery was seen in the majority of traumatic cases. 
2	The management of postoperative chylous ascites. A case report and literature review. Chylous ascites remains rare as a complication of surgical intervention. Although therapeutic manoeuvres to control chylous ascites have been developed over the past 20 years, its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Conservative approaches involving dietary restriction of long-chain triglycerides and salt, together with multiple paracenteses, are still the therapies of choice. Persistent chylous ascites may be treated surgically by ligation of leaking lymphatics or implantation of a peritoneovenous shunt once the lymphatic anatomy has been defined by preoperative investigations. We report a case of chylous ascites developing after laparotomy and duodenotomy for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, which did not respond adequately to medical therapy and was successfully managed by the insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt. 
4	Detection and location of myocardial infarction using technetium-99m sestamibi imaging at rest. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi imaging at rest has been used to detect and localize myocardial infarction. The largest study to date is a cooperative study of 146 patients in 17 institutions. There were 24 normal subjects and 122 patients with documented myocardial infarction based on clinical, enzymatic or electrocardiographic criteria. The presence of segmental myocardial perfusion defects was compared to the presence of a Q wave on the electrocardiogram or wall motion abnormality on gated blood pool scans, performed within 48 hours of the Tc-99m sestamibi study. Of the 122 infarct patients, 118 (97%) showed perfusion abnormalities by Tc-99m sestamibi imaging. A perfusion defect was found in 110 (99%) of 111 patients with a Q wave and a wall motion abnormality, 113 (99%) of 114 patients with a wall motion abnormality and 113 (98%) of 115 patients with a Q wave. Of the 24 normal subjects, 22 (92%) had normal Tc-99m sestamibi images. In 75% of 1,986 segments, both a Tc-99m sestamibi defect and a regional wall motion abnormality on gated blood scans were present. In 11% of segments, wall motion was normal but Tc-99m sestamibi imaging was abnormal; in 14% of segments, wall motion was abnormal and Tc-99m sestamibi images were normal. In the 24 control subjects, 99% of the segments were normal. Thirty-eight patients had coronary angiography. A close relation existed between the coronary anatomy and myocardial Tc-99m sestamibi uptake. All 9 territories supplied by an occluded vessel and poor collaterals had grade 0 uptake (scale 0 to 2: 0 = markedly reduced; 2 = normal). 
1	Nonendoscopic percutaneous gastrostomy. Tight peritoneal adherence of the stomach to the abdominal wall as a prerequisite of percutaneous gastrostomy can be achieved by a newly developed cannula. It serves for puncture and fixation of the gastric wall. Thus, percutaneous gastrostomy can be established safely even in instances of an endoscopically nonaccessible stomach. Further applications of the device for the purpose of intestinopexy and facilitation of endoscopic procedures are being evaluated. 
4	Tricuspid valve papillary fibroelastoma: echocardiographic characterization. We report a tricuspid valve papillary fibroelastoma initially detected by transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography and subsequently characterized by transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography. The mass was excised during open heart operation, and the diagnosis was verified grossly and histopathologically. Transesophageal echocardiography usually provides images far superior to those from transthoracic echocardiography and may be a useful adjunct for intraoperative localization of intracardiac tumors for excision. 
5	Nevus flammeus. Discordance in monozygotic twins. Nevus flammeus has been described as an inherited vascular anomaly. We report two cases of nevus flammeus, each appearing in one of two monozygotic twins. This finding supports the idea that nevus flammeus results from embryologic mishap rather than genetic transmission. 
1	Sensitivity and specificity of various morphological features of cervical condylomas. An in situ hybridization study. Fifty-seven cervical biopsy specimens or endocervical curettings showing condyloma, changes suggestive of condyloma, or no changes of condyloma were analyzed for presence of nuclear atypia (nuclear enlargement and irregularity in superficial epithelium), presence of multinucleated cells, and presence of perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing in superficial squamous epithelium. The findings were correlated with results of in situ hybridization with biotin-labeled human papillomavirus DNA probes. Moderate nuclear atypia was significantly more specific than perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing and 100% sensitive for predicting cases positive for human papillomavirus. Of the various morphological features analyzed, perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing had the lowest specificity for predicting positive results on in situ hybridization. 
5	Prognostic significance of the white nipple sign in variceal bleeding. The prognostic significance of the white nipple sign in variceal bleeding was evaluated prospectively in 203 separate admissions for bleeding esophageal varices in 145 cirrhotic patients. During all admissions a standardized protocol of management defined the failure of transfusion and vasoactive drugs (conservative measures) to stop bleeding and the occurrence of early rebleeding, at which time either emergency sclerotherapy or a staple transection of the esophagus was used. The finding of a white nipple in 18 admissions (9%) did not have predictive value as regards the failure of conservative measures to stop bleeding within 24 hours or rebleeding within 5 days, and there was no association with increased mortality. In one case, a white nipple was seen to occur after spontaneous cessation of a variceal venous spurt, suggesting it is a platelet-fibrin plug. The white nipple sign is diagnostic of a varix that has bled but has no adverse prognostic significance. 
5	The role of antihistamines in the treatment of chronic urticaria. For many years, H1 antihistamines have been the primary management option for urticaria. However, undesirable side effects, particularly daytime sedation, have limited the usefulness of these classic antihistamines. A new class of peripherally acting, nonsedating antihistamines (e.g., terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, and cetirizine) has proved to have clinical efficacy comparable with the classic antihistamines. In comparative trials between the various nonsedating agents, no significant difference in efficacy has been noted. All these agents have good safety profiles, although astemizole use has been correlated with increased appetite and weight gain in some patients, and cetirizine has caused slightly increased sedative effects compared with placebo. Although H1/H2 antihistamine combinations have been proposed as possible treatments for urticaria, studies have produced mixed results. 
4	Coagulation studies in the syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets. The presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in the syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) is debated. We assessed the occurrence of decompensated and compensated DIC (using predefined criteria) in 15 consecutive nulliparous pregnant patients with gestational hypertension combined with the HELLP syndrome and in 12 consecutive nulliparous controls with pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) but without the HELLP syndrome. A combination of routine coagulation assays revealed the absence of decompensated DIC in all studied patients. However, using more specific and sensitive coagulation assays, compensated DIC was observed in all HELLP patients and in three patients in the control group. The mean values of antithrombin III, thrombin-antithrombin III complexes and protein C in the HELLP and the control group were 66 vs 87% (P = 0.0004), 21 vs 8 ng/ml (P = 0.0008) and 57 vs 90% (P = 0.0018) respectively. We conclude that HELLP patients show evidence of compensated DIC which may have pathophysiological significance for the observed organ damage. 
1	Unusual skin tumors in Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. A case of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis with unusual skin manifestations in the form of multiple large skin tumors is described. The skin lesions responded partially to chemotherapy with etoposide and prednisone, and residual lesions were excised surgically. The patient developed central diabetes insipidus during treatment. 
2	Tuberculosis of the esophagus. Tuberculosis of the esophagus is rare. More cases of secondary tuberculosis of the esophagus have been reported compared to primary esophageal tuberculosis. An illustrative case of primary tuberculosis of the esophagus is presented and 54 published cases of esophageal involvement in tuberculosis are reviewed. There were eight primary and 46 secondary cases of esophageal tuberculosis. There were more male than female patients (M/F = 2.6:1) with an average age of 39.2 years (range 6 months to 75 years). Diagnosis can be difficult, being based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histological features and on the response to chemotherapy. Most cases can be successfully treated with antituberculous chemotherapy even in the presence of fistulous tracts. Patients with esophageal tuberculosis in the presence of AIDS do not respond as well to antituberculous chemotherapy. 
2	Rectal irrigation with short-chain fatty acids for distal ulcerative colitis. Preliminary report. Colon cells from patients with ulcerative colitis utilize short-chain fatty acids inefficiently and may be exposed to decreased concentrations of these compounds. To test whether irrigation of the inflamed mucosa with short-chain fatty acids is useful, we conducted a six-week preliminary trial in 12 patients with distal colitis. Each patient used twice daily rectal irrigations with 100 ml of a solution containing acetate (80 mM), propionate (30 mM), and butyrate (40 mM). Two patients stopped at three weeks, one because of no improvement and the other because of complete resolution of symptoms. Of the 10 who completed the trial, nine were judged to be at least much improved and showed a change in a mean disease activity index score from 7.9 +/- 0.3 (SE) to 1.8 +/- 0.6 (SE) (P less than or equal to 0.002) and in a mucosal histology score from 7.7 +/- 0.7 (SE) to 2.6 +/- 0.7 (SE) (P less than or equal to 0.002). Thus, ulcerative colitis patients appear to benefit from increased contact with or higher than usual levels of these critical energy substrates. 
1	RAR-alpha gene rearrangements as a genetic marker for diagnosis and monitoring in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Acute promyelocytic leukemias (APLs) are characterized by a translocation that involves chromosomes 15 and 17. The translocation breakpoints have recently been identified and shown to involve the RAR-alpha gene on 17 and myl on 15. Here we report Southern blotting analysis of 26 APLs, including cases with normal karyotypes and atypical morphology, which showed RAR-alpha rearrangements in 92% cases, myl rearrangements in 73%, and either RAR-alpha or myl rearrangements in 100%. Despite a negative clinical and morphologic picture, DNA rearrangement analysis showed that neoplastic promyelocytes persisted in the bone marrow of two patients sampled after induction chemotherapy. Therefore, the RAR-alpha and myl rearrangements provide molecular markers for accurately diagnosing APLs and monitoring the course of the disease during and after chemotherapy. 
2	Immunohistochemical detection of abnormal cell proliferation in colonic mucosa of subjects with polyps. Previous studies have shown the presence of increased proliferation in the large bowel epithelium of those at high risk of developing colon cancer. An in vitro technique for labelling large bowel mucosa with the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) was therefore developed and its ability to distinguish differences in mucosal proliferation between subjects with colorectal adenomas and normal controls was assessed. Sigmoid biopsy specimens from 15 subjects with polyps and 15 age and sex matched controls were labelled and the incorporated Brdu visualised with an immunohistochemical technique. Mean labelling index (LI) was significantly higher in those with polyps than in controls. Differences in the pattern of labelling in colonic crypts were compared by the generation of cumulative labelling distributions. Analysis showed a significant expansion of the proliferative compartment in the colon crypts of those with polyps. It is concluded that in vitro labelling with Brdu provides a useful method for the assessment of mucosal proliferation in subjects at high risk of developing colon cancer. 
2	Eosinophil infiltration and degranulation in Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis. Eosinophil granules contain cationic proteins, including the major basic protein, which are toxic to mammalian tissue. While eosinophils have been observed to comprise part of the inflammatory reaction in acute Helicobacter pylori gastritis, the role of the eosinophil in the pathogenesis of chronic gastritis is unknown. We evaluated whether eosinophil infiltration and degranulation are associated with chronic gastritis and H. pylori infection. We studied eight patients with chronic H. pylori antral gastritis, three with chronic antral gastritis in the absence of H. pylori, 11 healthy age-matched volunteers without antral gastritis, and eight patients with H. pylori-negative chronic specific gastritis (three Crohn's antral gastritis and five Menetrier's disease). Serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, with Giemsa, and by a specific indirect immunofluorescence technique for eosinophil granule major basic protein. Specimens were graded independently by three observers and scores of 0-3 were given for eosinophil infiltration and degranulation (0 = none to 3 = confluent infiltration and/or degranulation). In H. pylori antral gastritis, significantly greater eosinophil infiltration and degranulation were found compared to the normal group, Menetrier's disease, and chronic H. pylori-negative gastritis. There was no significant difference between gastric Crohn's disease and H. pylori gastritis. The severity of chronic gastritis was significantly correlated with the eosinophil score. Eosinophil degranulation did not appear to be greater at or near sites of bacterial colonization in the H. pylori gastritis specimens. The results suggest that eosinophil infiltration and degranulation may be associated with H. pylori gastritis. We postulate that the release of toxic cationic proteins from eosinophils contributes to the inflammatory changes present in H. pylori gastritis. 
1	Variables influencing tumor uptake of anti-melanoma monoclonal antibodies radioiodinated using para-iodobenzoyl (PIB) conjugate Tumor uptake was examined with respect to antigen expression, time-dependent biodistribution, dose of Mab injected, tumor size, and tumor site (i.e., subcutaneous versus lung or liver metastases). NR-ML-05, 96.5, and P94 showed significantly greater uptake in subcutaneous tumors than CL207 and 5.1 (p less than 0.05). NR-ML-05 had a significantly higher tumor uptake at 24 hr (11.9 +/- 0.51) than at 72 hr (4.0 +/- 0.37) or 144 hr (2.7 +/- 0.84) after injection (p less than 0.001). The other four Mabs had similar tumor distribution at all three time points. The tumor uptake of four Mabs (96.5, P94, CL207. 5.1) differed with respect to in vitro versus in vivo binding to tumor, tumor type, dose of Mab, and tumor site (subcutaneous versus metastases). In contrast, NR-ML-05 demonstrated consistent uptake in tumors independent of the above parameters. These data suggest that certain host parameters can influence in vivo tumor targeting depending on characteristics of each Mab studied. 
5	Mapping chromosome band 11q23 in human acute leukemia with biotinylated probes: identification of 11q23 translocation breakpoints with a yeast artificial chromosome. Translocations involving chromosome 11, band q23, are frequent recurring abnormalities in human acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemia. We used 19 biotin-labeled probes derived from genes and anonymous cosmids for hybridization to metaphase chromosomes from leukemia cells that contained four translocations involving band 11q23: t(4;11)(q21;q23), t(6;11)(q27;q23), t(9;11)(p22;q23), and t(11;19)(q23;p13). The location of the cosmid probes relative to the breakpoint in 11q23 was the same in all translocations. Of the cosmid clones containing known genes, CD3D was proximal and PBGD, THY1, SRPR, and ETS1 were distal to the breakpoint on 11q23. Hybridization of genomic DNA from a yeast clone containing yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), that carry 320 kilobases (kb) of human DNA including CD3D and CD3G genes, showed that the YACs were split in all four translocations. These results indicate that the breakpoint at 11q23 in each of these translocations occurs within the 320 kb encompassed by these YACs; whether the breakpoint within the YACs is precisely the same in the different translocations is presently unknown. 
1	Submandibular cystic hygroma resembling a plunging ranula in a neonate. Review and report of a case. Cystic hygromas are large lymphangiomas that are most often found in the posterior triangle of the neck and the axilla in children. They are most frequently found before age 2 and may be massive. After upper respiratory infection, they may become infected and enlarged, causing dysphagia and toxemia. The diagnosis can usually be made by history and physical examination and confirmed by biopsy. Treatment is by surgical excision of small lesions and staged debulking excisions in more severe cases. A patient with a cystic hygroma having many clinical characteristics of a plunging ranula is presented. The cyst fluid was aspirated and analyzed for its amylase, sodium, potassium, chloride, urea nitrogen, glucose, and total protein content. The characteristics of the fluid were also compared with those of lymph and saliva. This report demonstrates the difficulty in determining the diagnosis of a tumor that has the clinical features of a cystic hygroma, as well as a plunging ranula. The necessity of a proper presurgical diagnosis is essential since the form of therapy for each is different and conflicting. A method that distinguishes between the cervical cystic hygroma and a plunging ranula by means of aspirated fluid is discussed. 
2	Chronic diarrhea in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia: a manifestation of visceral vasculitis? Gastrointestinal involvement occurs frequently in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, and most often involves the liver and spleen. Intestinal involvement is much less common and is generally felt to be a late and often catastrophic manifestation of the disease due to severe vasculitis. Occasionally, the disorder mimics inflammatory bowel disease, both clinically and radiographically. We recently cared for a patient with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia who developed persistent diarrhea. Endoscopic evaluation revealed scattered petechial lesions in the duodenum and colon as well as prominent lymphoid hyperplasia in the terminal ileum. Mucosal biopsies disclosed the presence of diffuse inflammation. We suggest that this patient's diarrhea was due to intestinal vasculitis and that prominent ileal lymphoid hyperplasia may be a manifestation of essential mixed cryoglobulinemia. 
1	Lymph node metastasis from papillary-follicular thyroid carcinoma in young patients. A total of 117 patients under 20 years of age with papillary and/or follicular thyroid cancer presented to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1949 and 1987. The most common presenting symptom was a cervical mass. Twenty percent of the patients had a history of prior irradiation. Sixty percent initially had palpable lymph nodes, while 26% who had clinically negative examinations had pathologically positive lymph nodes. Recurrence was highest in regional lymph nodes at 24%, with only a 4% recurrence rate at the primary site and a 3% recurrence rate at distant sites. There were no deaths due to the thyroid cancer. To maintain a low rate of recurrence, near-total thyroidectomy with neck dissection followed by iodine 131 treatment should be considered in these young patients. 
4	Effects of acute alcohol intake on tolerance to hypotension. The specific aim of this research was to test the hypothesis that intoxication with alcohol results in poor tolerance to hemorrhage. This was evaluated on the basis of blood pressure, cardiac output respiratory rate, blood flow to organs, and survival for 4 hr after hemorrhage. Four groups of six swine per group were used (control, intoxicated, hemorrhage, and intoxicated-hemorrhage). The results revealed that blood alcohol concentrations near 0.1% greatly reduced tolerance to hemorrhage. Intoxicated animals subjected to hemorrhage were unable to maintain an adequate cardiac output, blood pressure, or respiratory rate to sustain life. Pigs tolerated higher blood alcohol concentrations, up to 0.35%, when not exposed to hemorrhage. Also, unintoxicated pigs were able to compensate for severe hemorrhage. Only one of the six pigs in the intoxicated-hemorrhage group survived for 4 hr after hemorrhage. In conclusion the body's ability to compensate and recover from hemorrhage was greatly reduced during intoxication. It is logical to assume that the ability to overcome numerous other stressors may also be reduced during intoxication. 
4	Risk ratios and risk differences in estimating the effect of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the elderly. This article reviews the nature of the effects of hypertension, smoking and cholesterol on the incidence of cardiovascular disease and emphasizes how these effects vary by age. In the Methods section, we discuss briefly the concepts of additive and multiplicative statistical models as tools for summarizing data. In the results section, we summarize available data on the association between incident stroke and coronary heart disease in the elderly and each of these major risk factors. The traditional multiplicative model parsimoniously characterizes the individual and joint effects of age and high blood pressure in terms of risk ratios; but, for smoking and cholesterol, an additive model appears to be the most parsimonious. We discuss the consequences of these observations for the study and prevention of cardiovascular disease in the elderly. 
4	Surgical treatment of endomyocardial fibrosis: a new approach. Endomyocardial fibrosis has been treated surgically for many years. For complete removal of fibrosis from both ventricles by the classic technique, each atrioventricular (AV) valve was removed and replaced with a prosthesis. Relapse of endomyocardial fibrosis has not been observed after surgical correction. Reoperations have been carried out because of complications of valve prostheses. A new surgical technique for removal of ventricular fibrous tissue with preservation of the mitral and tricuspid valves was used in nine consecutive patients with endomyocardial fibrosis. Initial results show a reduction of pulmonary hypertension, mean right and left atrial pressures and end-diastolic pressures in both ventricles. Tricuspid annuloplasty was performed in seven patients and mitral annuloplasty in five. No valve prosthesis was used. There was no death and New York Heart Association functional class improved from class III or IV in the preoperative period to class I or II in the postoperative period. These data suggest that resection of endocardial fibrous tissue can be indicated early in the clinical course and performed with preservation of the AV valves. 
1	Granular cell neoplasm of the extrahepatic biliary tree: morphological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical study and review of the literature. A recent case of a biliary granular cell tumor of the cystic duct prompted a literature review and an extensive pathological examination of the tumor in question. A total of 44 cases have been described mostly in black females. Most cases present with biliary symptoms, and simple surgical resection allows complete control of this benign condition. Granular cell tumors are most likely derived from neural crest cells. 
5	Partial gastric corpectomy results in hypergastrinemia and development of gastric enterochromaffinlike-cell carcinoids in the rat. Studies in the rat have shown that partial gastric corpectomy, in which about 75% of the acid-producing oxyntic mucosa was removed, leads to markedly reduced acid secretion and a feedback increase in the plasma gastrin levels. Ten weeks after operation, the gastric enterochromaffin (ECL)-like cell density in the remaining part of the oxyntic mucosa had increased significantly. In the present study, the effects on the gastric ECL cells of lifelong persistent hypergastrinemia induced by partial (75%) corpectomy have been investigated. Seventy-five partially corpectomized rats and 40 control rats were investigated for plasma gastrin and oxyntic mucosal changes in a 124-week study. The partially corpectomized rats showed increased plasma gastrin levels after the operation; the mean increase compared with the controls was almost 10-fold during the entire study. The remaining oxyntic mucosa of the partially corpectomized rats differed from that of control rats in two respects, showing first general hypertrophy and second a marked hyperplasia of argyrophil ECL cells. The degree and incidence of these changes increased towards the end of the study, i.e., in the aging rats. An age-related increase in ECL-cell density occurred spontaneously also in the control rats but to a lesser extent than in the partially corpectomized group. ECL-cell carcinoids were found in the oxyntic mucosa of 26 of the 75 partially corpectomized rats. The first carcinoid was found 78 weeks after the beginning of the study. Six rats with carcinoids (23%) were found before week 104 (2 years) and the remainder, 20 (77%), were discovered later. No carcinoid tumor was found in the control rats. It is concluded that lifelong hypergastrinemia induced by partial corpectomy leads to the development of ECL-cell carcinoids in the oxyntic mucosa of some rats towards the end of their life span. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that the gastric ECL-cell carcinoids found in rats treated with antisecretory drugs are caused by long-standing hypergastrinemia developing secondary to inhibition of gastric acid secretion. 
1	Alternative splicing of endothelial cell fibronectin mRNA in the IIICS region. Functional significance. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is thought to play a role in modulating vascular cell function in vivo. In vitro, it decreases endothelial cell proliferation and migration. We postulated that these biologic activities could be mediated through TGF-beta 1 modulation of specific gene expression. Therefore we differentially screened a human umbilical vein endothelial cell cDNA library with cDNAs prepared from both untreated and TGF-beta 1-treated bovine aortic endothelial cells. Using this technique, we isolated many TGF-beta 1-induced cDNA clones. Sequence analysis of these cDNAs showed that many of them corresponded to alternatively spliced fibronectin mRNAs. These fibronectin clones all contained the extradomain I (ED I) but three different forms of the type III connecting segment (IIICS). These different fibronectin cDNAs were expressed in bacteria and the recombinant proteins used to study the effects of IIICS alternative splicing on cell attachment, spreading, and migration in bovine aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells and B16F10 melanoma cells. The results of these experiments show that attachment and spreading of bovine aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells depend primarily on the presence of the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) sequence in the recombinant fibronectin proteins. However attachment and spreading of bovine aortic endothelial cells are modulated by alternative splicing in the IIICS region. Specifically splicing of the IIICS region decreases spreading and increases migration rates of the endothelial cells. On the contrary, using a cell line (B16F10 melanoma cells) that is known not to require the RGDS sequence for adhesion confirmed previous findings that B16F10 melanoma cells do not require the presence of the RGDS sequence for attachment and spreading. Indeed B16F10 cells were able to attach and spread on two recombinant proteins that did not contain the RGDS sequence. However attachment and spreading of B16F10 were dramatically inhibited when a 75-base pair DNA fragment was removed from the 5' end of the IIICS region. These results suggest that various regions of the fibronectin molecule may be able to interact with different cell populations to promote cell attachment and spreading, and that alternative splicing may modulate this process. 
4	Comparative study of the effects of three angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the cough reflex. To compare the effects of three different angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the cough reflex, capsaicin and citric acid challenge tests were done in normal subjects and hypertensive patients before and after administration of delapril, captopril, or enalapril. Two groups of 7 normal subjects (single dose study: 15 mg delapril v 18.75 mg captopril or 2.5 mg enalapril) and a group of 6 mildly hypertensive patients (1 week study: cross-over administration of 30 mg/day delapril, 37.5 mg/day captopril, or 5 mg/day enalapril) were studied. Another group of 6 patients with essential hypertension was treated with three ACE inhibitors for 4 weeks in a randomized order, with a 2 week washout period between active therapies. Aerosols of 1 mumol/L and 3 mumol/L capsaicin and 0.68% citric acid in 0.9% NaCl were generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer, and the frequency of cough was counted during inhalation. Delapril treatment resulted in substantially fewer patients with a significant increase (greater than or equal to 4 coughs during treatment than during the control period) in the frequency of cough than did captopril treatment. In the 1 and 4 week studies, enalapril and captopril had substantially more occurrences of significantly increased capsaicin-induced cough than did delapril. These results indicate that delapril has the least cough stimulatory effect among these ACE inhibitors, which may be clinically beneficial. 
4	Surgical indication for aortic arch hypoplasia in infants. To determine the surgical indications for aortic arch hypoplasia, the distal arch outer diameter, distal arch index (ratio of the distal arch diameter to the normal aortic ring diameter), and postoperative pressure gradient across the aortic arch were studied in 23 patients under 6 months of age who underwent surgery for coarctation and/or aortic arch hypoplasia. The ratio of the pressure gradient across the arch to the right radial artery was used to evaluate the postoperative level of stenosis. The maximum ratio of the pressure gradient that could be tolerated after surgery was considered to be 0.15 from the operative results. Negative correlations were found between the distal arch outer diameter and postoperative pressure gradient ratio (r = 0.80), and the distal arch index and postoperative pressure gradient ratio (r = 0.80). These correlations proved that in order to obtain a postoperative pressure gradient ratio of 0.15 or less, a distal arch outer diameter of 3.9 mm or more and a distal arch index of 0.63 or more were necessary. Consequently, a distal arch outer diameter of 3.9 mm or a distal arch index of 0.63 is considered to indicate that aortic arch hypoplasia is in need of repair. 
1	Microspectrophotometric DNA analysis in ulcerative colitis with special reference to its application in diagnosis of carcinoma and dysplasia. The deoxyribonucleic (DNA) content was measured by microspectrophotometry in 100 specimens from 60 patients with ulcerative colitis, including six patients in whom the colitis was associated with carcinoma. Some 23 of 30 (77%) specimens of dysplastic tissue showed aneuploidy or polyploidy, whereas 50 of 53 (94%) specimens of non-dysplastic tissue showed diploidy. The difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Polyploidy was often observed in non-dysplastic mucosa from patients who had carcinoma or dysplasia. In the non-dysplastic patients all samples of inflamed tissue showed diploidy. Some 10% of samples without inflammation, however, also showed polyploidy. A good correlation was found between the frequency of polyploid cells and the grade of dysplasia. Microspectrophotometric measurement of DNA content proved useful in the assessment and diagnosis of dysplasia in ulcerative colitis and could be considered for screening high risk patients. 
1	Obesity, body fat distribution, and sex hormones in breast cancer patients. This study addresses the relationship between female sex hormones, obesity, body fat distribution, and breast cancer. Increasing obesity correlated with a progressive fall in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) level and an increase in testosterone level. Premenopausal breast cancer patients were found to have significantly lower levels of SHBG compared with age-matched and weight-matched controls. This difference in SHBG level was not noted in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. The SHBG level decreased with increasing upper body fat localization in breast cancer patients and controls. This effect was more marked in breast cancer patients which may explain our earlier finding that women with upper body fat localization are at increased risk for developing breast cancer. 
4	Phosphorus-32-colloidal chromic phosphate: treatment of choice for malignant pericardial effusion. A 68-yr-old male with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia was given phosphorus-32-colloidal chromic phosphate intrapericardially for the treatment of malignant pericardial effusion. Technetium-99m-sulfur colloid was used to verify catheter placement and to visualize distribution within the pericardium. Estimated dosimetry for this mode of therapy is presented, and it is suggested that pericardial administration of phosphorus-32-colloidal chromic phosphate is the treatment of choice for malignant pericardial effusion. 
5	Diagnosis of magnesium-induced diarrhea BACKGROUND. There is no specific method of diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea. Therefore, the frequency and clinical importance of diarrhea caused by magnesium are unknown. The purposes of this study were to establish a method for diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea and to apply it to patients with chronic diarrhea. METHODS. We measured fecal output of soluble magnesium and fecal magnesium concentration in 19 normal subjects with formed stools (15 collection periods), with non-magnesium-induced diarrhea (36 collection periods), and with diarrhea induced by magnesium hydroxide alone (11 collection periods) or in combination with phenolphthalein (3 collection periods), and in 359 patients with chronic diarrhea. RESULTS. The upper limits of fecal output of soluble magnesium and fecal magnesium concentration in normal subjects were 14.6 mmol per day and 45.2 mmol per liter, respectively. When normal subjects had diarrhea due to the ingestion of magnesium hydroxide alone or in combination with phenolphthalein, fecal magnesium output was always abnormally high. For each millimole increase in fecal magnesium output, fecal weight increased by approximately 7.3 g. The fecal magnesium concentration was very high when magnesium was the only cause of diarrhea but only moderately elevated when diarrhea was induced by magnesium hydroxide plus phenolphthalein. Biochemical and clinical evidence indicated that excessive ingestion of magnesium was an important cause of chronic diarrhea in 15 of the 359 patients with chronic diarrhea (4.2 percent), if not the only cause. CONCLUSIONS. Quantitative fecal analysis for soluble magnesium is an accurate method of diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea. Some patients with chronic diarrhea ingest excessive amounts of magnesium (in antacids or food supplements), and physicians may fail to discover this before embarking on an expensive and invasive diagnostic evaluation. 
4	Epidermotropic eccrine porocarcinoma. Three cases of epidermotropic eccrine porocarcinoma are summarized and compared with reported cases. All patients had a long-standing tumor on a lower extremity that rapidly metastasized to the skin and proximal lymph nodes. The histologic picture was consistent with an intraepidermal eccrine sweat gland carcinoma. 
5	Placement of esophageal stethoscope by acoustic criteria does not consistently yield an optimal location for the monitoring of core temperature. The esophageal stethoscope has evolved into a device for both acoustic and core temperature monitoring. To test whether routine placement according to acoustic criteria results in placement of the core temperature sensor in the region of contiguity between the esophagus and the heart, we determined the depth of placement electrocardiographically. All patients were undergoing nonthoracic elective operations requiring general anesthesia and tracheal intubation. First, we established that different observers selected the same esophageal depth within +/- 1 cm electrocardiographically, using the criterion of a symmetric biphasic P wave of maximal amplitude (7 patients). Then, in 30 more patients, we compared routine acoustic placements with the depths of the maximal-amplitude biphasic P wave. Stethoscopes placed according to acoustic criteria were within +/- 3 cm of P-wave depths in 15 of 30 patients. In the remaining patients, measured discrepancies ranged up to 13.5 cm. We conclude that the prevailing stethoscope design, with a thermistor at the tip, below the acoustic window, does not ensure placement of the thermistor within the optimal region for monitoring of core temperature. A modification in design that would take advantage of the reliability of electrocardiographic positioning is suggested. 
5	Closure of leaking filtering blebs with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. Five leaking filtering blebs, occurring between 10 months and 21 years after trabeculectomy, were closed with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. Filtering bleb integrity was preserved in four cases, so that additional microsurgery was avoided. The only problem associated with use of tissue adhesive was the development of corneal abrasions in three cases. Although it is an accepted treatment for these conjunctival fistulas, only nine previous cases have been reported to our knowledge. We strongly recommend the use of tissue adhesive as a presurgical treatment in the management of leaking filtering blebs which present as a late postoperative complication of glaucoma surgery. 
4	Diabetes mellitus and hypertension: a physiologic basis for a rational therapeutic approach. The basic mechanisms that initiate and sustain hypertension in the diabetic population are poorly understood. Obesity, insulin, genetic factors, and abnormalities in calcium homeostasis may contribute, and could be related to an elevated Na+/H+ antiport activity. In the first study described in this investigation, hypertensive subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who had an elevated Na+/Li+ countertransport activity were found to have a lower whole body glucose utilization, a lower insulin-stimulated forearm carbohydrate oxidation, larger ultrasound kidney volume, and increased left ventricular mass index when compared with hypertensive IDDM subjects with a normal Na+/Li+ countertransport activity or normotensive IDDM subjects. Thus an elevated Na+/Li+ countertransport activity appears to identify a subset of IDDM patients who are more susceptible to the development of the renal and cardiac complications associated with hypertension. This underlines the importance of choosing an appropriate antihypertensive therapy that will not produce a deterioration in glucose and lipid metabolism. In the second part of the report, results are presented for the treatment of hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with doxazosin. The selective alpha 1-inhibitor produced a significant reduction in blood pressure, together with favorable changes in the serum lipid profile. As a result, the calculated risk of developing coronary heart disease was significantly reduced. Throughout the study no patients required a dose reduction or discontinuation of doxazosin because of side effects, and no clinically significant changes in laboratory tests were apparent. Thus doxazosin could be considered a useful antihypertensive agent in hypertensive patients with IDDM who are insulin-resistant and who have renal and cardiac abnormalities. 
5	Massive hepatic infarction in systemic lupus erythematosus. Liver disease in systemic lupus erythematosus, as demonstrated by abnormal histopathology, is rare and usually mild; typically, this hepatic disease is of chronic nature and not related to a hypercoagulable state. A patient is described in whom life-threatening hypercoagulability in association with systemic lupus erythematosus resulted in extensive liver infarction. Follow-up radionuclide liver scintigraphy suggested that regenerative recovery in the infarcted areas of the liver may be delayed or absent, but there was no evident functional hepatic impairment. 
2	Rosacea and ulcerative colitis: a possible association. Although rosacea was formerly believed to be associated with gastrointestinal upsets, no one any longer finds a significant association between rosacea and the intestinal tract. We describe four patients with a combination of ulcerative colitis and rosacea. In all four, ulcerative colitis preceded the onset of severe papulopustular rosacea, and we therefore feel that the severity of rosacea could have been due to the associated bowel disorder. In one, the severity and poor initial response of rosacea to treatment was clearly related to the activity of the ulcerative colitis, and the rosacea improved only after proctocolectomy. While it is possible that this purported association is fortuitous, we report these cases in the hope that others may have seen this combination of diseases, to our knowledge previously unreported. 
5	Orbital complications secondary to endoscopic sinus surgery. Eight cases of significant orbital complications associated with endoscopic sinus surgery are described. The anatomic problems generally fall into four categories: nasolacrimal sac or duct injury, extraocular muscle injury, intraorbital hemorrhage/emphysema, or optic nerve injury. The successful management of each complication depends on a thorough knowledge of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the orbital injury. Return to normal function of the traumatized orbital structures after medical and/or surgical intervention is anticipated. However, direct optic nerve injury with immediate visual field and/or acuity deficit is usually irreversible. 
1	HTLV-I-associated leukemia/lymphoma in south Florida. We report here 10 cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) seen in South Florida between February 1988 and July 1989. All were seropositive for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). DNA extracted from tumor biopsies/peripheral blood lymphocytes of nine patients was shown by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to contain HTLV-I proviral DNA. Blot hybridization of DNA extracted from seven patients with an HTLV-I cDNA probe revealed a monoclonal pattern of proviral integration consistent with a diagnosis of ATL. Eight of the 10 patients were women. Six patients were from Haiti, three from Jamaica, and one from the Bahamas. All patients had very aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Two patients presented with sinus and retro-orbital involvement; another had gastric lymphoma that perforated. Nine patients developed hypercalcemia. Eight patients died within 1 year of diagnosis. Two were lost to follow-up. During the course of this study, 66 new cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were diagnosed at this hospital. Ten of these cases were ATL. The prevalence of HTLV-I-related lymphoma in this sample was 15%. Since tissue from all patients was not available for HTLV-I screening, however, it is possible that other cases of ATL went undetected. We conclude from this initial survey that a retroviral etiology should be considered in patients from populations known to be at risk for HTLV-I infection who present with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
4	Coronary arteries in truncus arteriosus. The origin and distribution of the coronary arteries was described in 39 autopsy specimens of truncus arteriosus (TA). The specimens were classified according to the number and the patterns of the truncal cusps. The position of the truncal cusps was defined in relation to intracardiac structures, namely, the atrioventricular orifices. Bicuspid truncal valves were observed in 8 cases (21%), tricuspid in 22 cases (56%) and quadricuspid in 9 cases (23%). All tricuspid valves had 2 anterior and 1 posterior cusp. Great variability in the origin of the coronary arteries was observed, with a tendency for the right coronary artery to arise from the anterior right quadrant and for the left coronary artery to arise from the anterior and left quadrant. Such a tendency was observed in 50% of the bicuspid, in 59% of the tricuspid and in 66% of the quadricuspid valves. The anatomic right ventricle was always observed to be vascularized by a right coronary artery, and the anatomic left ventricle by a left coronary artery, even in cases in which there was a single coronary trunk. The anterior surface of the right ventricle was crossed by a right coronary artery in 5 cases. A single coronary artery was observed in 7 cases (18%). Embryologic considerations are offered, especially regarding the relation between the observed variability in coronary artery patterns in TA and the absence of the truncal septation. 
1	Transitional cell carcinomatous meningitis after M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) chemotherapy. The M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) regimen has been utilized at our two institutions to treat 17 patients with advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. We report 2 cases of carcinomatous meningitis resulting from metastatic transitional cell carcinoma which occurred in patients treated with M-VAC. Review of the literature suggests that our experience with central nervous system metastases is not unique, and that treatment of advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with M-VAC may enhance the incidence of meningeal metastases. Carcinomatous meningitis, although rare, is a rapidly fatal manifestation of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma if left untreated. However, prompt diagnosis and early aggressive therapy may result in palliation and stabilization of neurologic status. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of transitional cell carcinomatous meningitis. 
4	Low-molecular-weight heparinoid compared with warfarin for prophylaxis of deep-vein thrombosis in patients who are operated on for fracture of the hip. A prospective, randomized trial. In a randomized, prospective trial, a low-molecular-weight heparinoid (Org 10172 [Lomoparan]) was compared with warfarin for efficacy and safety in preventing deep-vein thrombosis in 263 patients who had an operatively treated fracture of the hip. One group of patients received Org 10172 in a dose of 750 units subcutaneously every twelve hours until the ninth postoperative day; on the seventh postoperative day, warfarin was added to the regimen. The other group received only warfarin. Both drugs were begun preoperatively, immediately after the admission evaluation. In the patients who received warfarin, the desired prothrombin time was one and one-half times the control level. Deep-vein thrombosis was detected by 125I-fibrinogen scanning and impedance plethysmography and was confirmed by phlebography and compression ultrasonography. Deep-vein thrombosis was found in nine (7 per cent) of the 132 patients who received Org 10172 and in twenty-eight (21 per cent) of the 131 patients who received warfarin (p less than 0.001). Adverse reactions were not significantly different in the two groups. Major bleeding complications occurred in eight patients in the Org-10172 group, only four of whom were receiving the drug at the time of bleeding, and in five patients who were receiving warfarin (not significant). There was no difference in intraoperative loss of blood or in requirements for transfusion. We concluded that the low-molecular-weight heparinoid Org 10172 is a safe, convenient, effective antithrombotic agent for the prevention of venous thrombosis after an operation for fracture of the hip. 
1	The nursing role in limb salvage surgery. Limb salvage surgery has proven itself as a valuable option for sarcoma patients. The reconstruction options are vast and include metallic implants, allografts, and a combination of both. The nursing implications for these patients are unlimited. The patient needs to be educated and assessed closely for complications such as infections, nonunion of the allograft, and limited mobility. Although the nursing care is more complicated, the rewards with working with these patients are great. 
1	Long term effects of gastrocystoplasty in rats. Twenty prepubescent rats underwent microsurgical gastrocystoplasty by a technique which is described. An equal number of control rats had their bladders opened and closed. Rats were sacrificed at 16 to 18 months postoperatively. There were no differences in final weight, serum electrolytes, or renal function between the two groups. Prominent histopathologic changes of the bladder occurred in the gastrocystoplasty group. These changes included papillomas present in five of the 15 rats surviving long term. No significant changes occurred in the bladders of the control group of rats. Possible etiologies and the significance of the rats. Possible etiologies and the significance of the gastrocystoplasty related lesions are discussed. 
1	Photodynamic therapy of spontaneous cancers in felines, canines, and snakes with chloro-aluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine. This is the first report on the photodynamic treatment with a second-generation sensitizer, chloro-aluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine (CASPc) of spontaneously arising tumors and on the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of snake neoplasms. Each of 10 cats, 2 dogs, and 3 snakes presenting with a variety of tumor types (squamous cell carcinoma, mast cell malignant tumor, and mixed carcinoma/sarcoma) was given an intravenous injection of 1 mg of CASPc per kilogram body weight 48 hours prior to irradiation with 675-nm light. Some larger tumors (greater than 1.5 cm deep) were surgically debulked prior to PDT. No significant systemic toxicity or skin photosensitization was observed in any animal. The tumor responses were comparable to those seen with conventional cryotherapy, hyperthermia, or surgery. PDT with CASPc of these cases led to 67% (12 of 18) complete response, 22% (4 of 18) partial response, and 11% (2 of 18) no response (less than 50% reduction in tumor size). Four cases could not be evaluated. Since the overall tumor response to CASPc is very good, and the problem of skin photosensitivity is nonexistent, it is expected that using CASPc-PDT to eradicate human tumors would also yield comparable results. Further studies with long-term follow-up are necessary to optimize the use of CASPc-PDT in veterinary and human medicine. 
5	Colobronchial fistula: a rare complication of Crohn's colitis. A 29-yr-old white woman presented with chronic pneumonia in the left lower lobe and with left pleural effusion. She was known to have inflammatory bowel disease, but she was asymptomatic under maintenance treatment with 5-ASA. She received numerous antibiotic regimens according to susceptibility testing of microorganisms cultured from sputum and bronchial lavage and on an empiric basis was also given antituberculosis treatment, but there was no clinical improvement or change in the chest radiographic findings. Sputum was repeatedly examined and yielded, among other organisms, Clostridium inocuum, Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. On one microscopic examination of sputum, the presence of feculent material was suspected. A subsequent gastrografin enema revealed a cologastric and colobronchial fistula between the splenic flexture of the colon and the greater curve of the stomach and the bronchial system. Segmental resection of the colon and resection of the lower lobe of the left lung were performed. Histologic findings of the resected colon were consistent with Crohn's disease. After a long period of postoperative recovery, the patient returned to good general health and well-being. To our knowledge, a colobronchial fistula caused by Crohn's colitis has not been previously reported. 
5	Magnetic resonance imaging in Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. Six girls with suspected Rokitansky syndrome underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and then sonography and laparoscopy to confirm the clinical diagnosis and define the precise characteristics of the malformation. The uterus was missing in all; four had mullerian rudiments in place of the uterus, which were cavitary in two as shown by sonography and in one by MRI. Both ovaries were present in all cases, normally located in four and extrapelvic in two; they were correctly identified by MRI in all cases and by sonography in four. Partially canalized vaginal rudiments were recognized by MRI in two girls and by sonography in one. One patient had unilateral renal agenesis, demonstrated by both MRI and sonography. Magnetic resonance imaging was more precise than laparoscopy and sonography in defining the anatomical characteristics of Rokitansky syndrome, and is less invasive and expensive than laparoscopy. 
5	Bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis as interim palliation for high-risk Fontan candidates. Early results. Thirty-eight patients considered to be at increased risk for a Fontan repair underwent bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis. Twenty-one of the 38 had concurrent pulmonary artery reconstruction. Fontan risk factors included pulmonary artery distortion, elevated pulmonary artery resistance (greater than 2 Woods units) and/or pulmonary artery pressure (mean, greater than 18 mm Hg), atrioventricular valve regurgitation, systemic ventricular dysfunction, complex venous anatomy, and subaortic obstruction. There were no deaths, either early or late. Median arterial oxygen saturation increased from 79% to 84% (p less than 0.01). Median hospital stay was 8 days. No patient had pleural effusions after 7 days. Three patients had significant surgical complications. Five patients had inadequate relief of cyanosis; three of these had venous collaterals and two had severe ventricular dysfunction; the latter two patients subsequently had strokes. One of the patients with persistent cyanosis required a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt. We conclude that a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt, with pulmonary artery reconstruction when indicated, provides adequate relief of cyanosis in most patients with single-ventricle lesions who are considered to be at increased risk for a Fontan repair. Relief of ventricular volume overload and pulmonary artery distortion may improve Fontan candidacy. Also, patients with persistent cyanosis after bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis should be catheterized for location and occlusion of venous collaterals. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the place of bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis in the management of patients at increased risk for a Fontan repair. 
2	Hyperdynamic circulation in cirrhosis: a role for nitric oxide? Hypotension, low systemic vascular resistance, and a reduced sensitivity to vasoconstrictors are features of cirrhosis. These cardiovascular changes might be the result of increased synthesis of a vasodilator. Nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, is synthesised in and released from peripheral blood-vessels in man. Studies in animals indicate that bacterial endotoxin and cytokines induce NO synthase expression in vessel walls, with sustained NO release and consequent hypotension. Endotoxaemia is a common feature of cirrhosis; persistent induction of NO synthase may account for the associated haemodynamic changes. 
1	Inhibition of growth of experimental prostate cancer with sustained delivery systems (microcapsules and microgranules) of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist SB-75. Inhibitory effects of the sustained delivery systems (microcapsules and microgranules) of a potent antagonist of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone N-Ac-[3-(2-naphthyl)-D-alanine1, 4-chloro-D-phenylalanine2, 3-(3-pyridyl)-D-alanine3, D-citrulline6, D-alanine10]LH-RH (SB-75) on the growth of experimental prostate cancers were investigated. In the first experiment, three doses of a microcapsule preparation releasing 23.8, 47.6, and 71.4 micrograms of antagonist SB-75 per day were compared with microcapsules of agonist [D-Trp6]LH-RH liberating 25 micrograms/day in rats bearing Dunning R3327H transplantable prostate carcinoma. During 8 weeks of treatment, tumor growth was decreased by [D-Trp6]LH-RH and all three doses of SB-75 as compared to untreated controls. The highest dose of SB-75 (71.4 micrograms/day) caused a greater inhibition of prostate cancer growth than [D-Trp6]LH-RH as based on measurement of tumor volume and percentage change in tumor volume. Doses of 23.8 and 47.6 micrograms of SB-75 per day induced a partial and submaximal decrease, respectively, in tumor weight and volume. Tumor doubling time was the longest (50 days) with the high dose of SB-75 vs. 15 days for controls. The body weights were unchanged. The weights of testes, seminal vesicles, and ventral prostate were greatly reduced in all three groups that received SB-75, and testosterone levels were decreased to nondetectable values in the case of the two higher doses of SB-75. LH levels were also diminished. Similar results were obtained in the second experiment, in which the animals were treated for a period of 8 weeks with microgranules of SB-75. Therapy with microgranules of SB-75 significantly decreased tumor growth as measured by the final tumor volume, the percentage change from the initial tumor volume, and the reduction in tumor weight. The results indicate that antagonist SB-75, released from sustained delivery systems, can produce a state of chemical castration and effectively inhibit the growth of experimental prostate cancers. The efficacy of the antagonist SB-75 in inhibiting androgen-dependent Dunning prostatic carcinoma and the absence of side effects suggest its possible usefulness for the treatment of hormone-sensitive tumors. 
1	Health effects of radon exposure. Report of the Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association. The consensus of scientists is that exposure to radon is hazardous, but disagreement exists about the effects of lower radon concentrations. Studies of underground miners have indicated that the risk of lung cancer increases in proportion to the intensity and duration of exposure to radon, and a recent authoritative report (BEIR IV) has concluded that estimates based on those studies are appropriate for estimating risks for occupants of homes. The BEIR IV report concluded that smoking cigarettes increases the risk of lung cancer associated with radon. Average radon levels in US homes range from 0.055 to 0.148 Bq/L (1.5 to 4 pCi/L), depending on the circumstances of measurement. Few studies have investigated health outcomes in occupants of homes with high radon levels. In advising patients about reducing the risks associated with radon, physicians should consider the costs, as well as the benefits, of remedial actions, and they should emphasize that, by far, the best way to avoid lung cancer is to stop smoking. 
4	Cutaneous manifestations in patients with essential thrombocythemia. In a retrospective study of 268 patients with essential thrombocythemia, related cutaneous manifestations were found in 58 (22%). In 27 cases (10%) the related skin lesions were present at the time of the primary diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. Hematomas, ecchymoses, petechiae, or purpura occurred in 24 (41%) of the 58 patients. Fifteen patients (26%) had erythromelalgia, in 11 of whom it was the initial complaint. Livedo reticularis, recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis, ischemic complications with gangrene, leg ulcers, or ulcers on the toes were other manifestations. Urticaria occurred in two patients, and Raynaud's phenomenon and necrotizing vasculitis were each observed in one patient. Platelet function may be abnormal, and this was found in 13 of 19 patients studied, 9 of whom had spontaneous platelet aggregation. Knowledge of the cutaneous manifestations in essential thrombocythemia may lead to its earlier detection. Prompt diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia is important because treatment may prevent severe hemorrhagic or thrombotic events. 
3	Pyogenic spinal sepsis in adults. Twenty adult patients presented with bacteriologically and histologically proven nontuberculous spinal sepsis. Thirteen patients presented with varying degrees of neurologic impairment. All patients underwent spinal decompression; in 11 this was combined with an anterior fusion using autogenous tricortical iliac grafts. All patients have recovered and are ambulatory, and no patient's disorder was made worse by surgery. Twenty-three separate organisms were cultured, only five of which were Staphylococcus. The antibiotic courses were shorter and pain relief more rapid with anterior fusion. All anterior bone grafts incorporated rapidly, and there was no progression of kyphosis or sequestration of grafts, regardless of organisms or level. The rational treatment of adult spinal sepsis necessitates the securing of tissue from the spine for histologic and bacteriologic examination. Pain relief, stabilization, and neural decompression can best be achieved with anterior decompression and fusion. Autogenous iliac crest grafts incorporate in the presence of sepsis. 
5	Effect of emitted power on waveform intensity in transcranial Doppler This study assesses the problem of transcranial Doppler recording failure and seeks to determine the extent to which this can be ameliorated by increased emitted power. We hypothesized that waveform intensity is directly related to the rate and quality of successful recording and may be compared quantitatively among groups of patients. Among a large group of patients recorded at 800 mW/cm2 emitted power, intensity was strongest in white men, weakest in black women, and intermediate in black men and white women. It declined with age in women of either race, but not in men of either race. Analysis of the effect of emitted power on intensity predicted that significant numbers of waveforms recorded at 800 mW/cm2 could not be recorded at the current clinical standards of 100 mW/cm2, the difference being most pronounced in elderly black women. Temporal bone window thickness measured in a series of adult cadaver skulls was least in white men, greatest in black women, and intermediate in black men and white women. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that temporal bone window thickness is an important determinant of recording difficulty and suggest that increased emitted power can significantly increase successful recording, particularly in black and elderly patients. Increased power alone, however, cannot completely solve the recording problem within safe limits. 
4	Daptomycin compared with teicoplanin and vancomycin for therapy of experimental Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. The efficacies of daptomycin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin were compared in the therapy of experimental Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Rabbits infected with either of two methicillin-susceptible strains (SA-12871 or its moderately teicoplanin-resistant derivative SA-12873) or a methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain (MRSA-494) were treated with daptomycin, 8 mg/kg of body weight, every 8 h; teicoplanin, 12.5 mg/kg (low-dose teicoplanin [teicoplanin-LD], excluding MRSA-494) or 40 mg/kg (high-dose teicoplanin [teicoplanin-HD]) every 12 h; or vancomycin, 17.5 mg/kg every 6 h, for 4 days. Compared with no treatment daptomycin, teicoplamin-HD, and vancomycin significantly reduced bacterial counts of all test strains in vegetations and renal and splenic tissues (P less than 0.001). Teicoplanin-LD was equally effective against SA-12871 but failed against SA-12873, with three of six animals still being bacteremic at the end of therapy. For SA-12871, daptomycin was as effective as teicoplanin-HD and was superior to teicoplanin-LD and vancomycin (P = 0.02) in lowering vegetation bacterial counts. There were no differences between daptomycin, teicoplanin-HD, or vancomycin in the reduction of bacterial counts in tissues for any of the test strains. In rabbits infected with SA-12871, vegetations from 33% of teicoplanin-LD-treated, 6% of teicoplanin-HD-treated, and 13% of daptomycin-treated animals yielded organisms for which there were up to eightfold increases in the MICs. Resistance may have contributed to early death in one daptomycin-treated animal. No increases in the MICs for the test strain were detected in animals infected with SA-12873 or MRSA-494. 
1	Meningiomas involving the clivus: a six-year experience with 41 patients. A series of 41 meningiomas involving the clivus operated on from July 1983 to January 1990 is reported. The presenting symptoms and signs of these patients were similar to those reported previously. All the patients were evaluated by pre- and postoperative thin-section, high-resolution computed tomography using soft tissue and bone algorithms. Most of the patients also underwent magnetic resonance imaging. The regions of the clivus involved by tumor were divided into upper, middle, or lower regions on the basis of anatomical landmarks. The diameter of the tumor was measured in three axes, and a tumor volume and a tumor equivalent diameter were computed to categorize tumors as small, medium, large, or giant types. There were 9 medium, 27 large, and 5 giant tumors in this series. Some simple and some complex operative approaches were employed to effect tumor removal. Large and giant tumors often required more than one operative approach to remove the tumor. Intraoperative technical difficulties included tumor consistency, vascularity, dissection from the brain stem, and vascular and cranial nerve encasement. Postoperative computed tomographic scans documented total excision in 32 patients (78%). Residual tumor remained in the clival or cavernous sinus areas. These patients were either being observed, or were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery. There was one operative death due to pneumonia (2%), and three patients (7%) suffered permanent major neurological changes, presumably due to vascular occlusions in the posterior circulation. In the follow-up period, which ranged from 3 to 76 months, 2 patients (6%) with tumors that had appeared to be totally excised experienced recurrence. These patients were treated by a second operation, alone or in combination with radiation therapy. Two patients who had subtotal excisions (25%) had evidence of regrowth. In 2 patients, tumor growth continued despite gamma knife radiosurgery or external beam radiotherapy. 
3	High-dose cisplatin plus dacarbazine in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. The combination of cisplatin plus dacarbazine (DTIC) is active in metastatic melanoma with response rates reported between 10% and 55%. To optimize this regimen, a Phase II study was conducted employing a dose intensity of cisplatin higher than previously reported. Twenty-two patients were treated. Eight patients received cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 combined with DTIC 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 8 and 9 (regimen A). Because of excessive toxicity, the protocol was modified so that cisplatin was given at 50 mg/m2 per day and DTIC 350 mg/m2 per day on days 1 through 3 (regimen B). The overall response rate was 32% and consisted of four partial and three complete responses (CR). The median duration of response was 6 months. Two of the CR remain in sustained, unmaintained remission in excess of 1.5 years. All seven patients that responded were treated on regimen B. High-dose cisplatin plus DTIC on a 3-day schedule represents an effective, well-tolerated therapy for metastatic melanoma. 
3	Multipiece tire rim injuries. Multipiece tire rims can explode during tire change, causing severe injury. Although more than 450 such accidents, with at least 80 deaths, have been recorded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), we found no reports in the surgical literature on such injuries in the United States. This report describes experience with seven patients who sustained injuries in explosions of multipiece tire rims. All victims suffered massive maxillofacial trauma with associated ocular, cranial, intracranial, and extremity injuries. Two patients died, both because of intracerebral hemorrhage. One patient suffered serious long-term disability. All survivors required extensive reconstructive surgery. The design of the multipiece tire rim is inherently hazardous. Since many accidents of this type are not reported to the NHTSA, the incidence of such injuries may be significantly higher. An alternative, nonhazardous tire rim is available. Design modifications or a law restricting use of multipiece tire rims would prevent many accidents. 
1	A dentist's dilemma: nonsurgical endodontic therapy or periapical surgery for teeth with apparent pulpal pathosis and an associated periapical radiolucent lesion. First presented is a brief review of nonsurgical versus surgical treatment of radicular cysts. This is followed by a consideration of the use of radiographs for differential diagnosis of periapical radiolucent lesions. Some of the nonendodontic local and systemic lesions that can occur periapically are then presented. Next examined are the fallibilities of pulp vitality testing methods. The need for histopathologic examination of periapical lesions is the subject of the next discussion. The dentist's dilemma is then examined: should teeth with apparent pulpal pathosis and an associated periapical radiolucent lesion have routine surgical treatment including biopsy or should they be treated nonsurgically and have periodic follow-ups? A possible resolution of this dilemma is the final consideration. 
5	A 27-year experience with splenectomy for Gaucher's disease. Gaucher's disease is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by the defective activity of acid beta-glucosidase and the resultant accumulation of glucosyl ceramide-laden macrophages in the liver, bone, and spleen. Splenectomy is the preferred treatment for patients with Gaucher's disease who develop massive splenomegaly with accompanying hypersplenism and/or mechanical pressure symptoms. The charts of 48 patients with Gaucher's disease undergoing splenectomy at our institution between January 1963 and December 1989 were analyzed to determine the short- and long-term results of this procedure. Thirty-five (73%) patients had total splenectomy, whereas 13 (27%) patients had partial splenectomy. There was one postoperative death (after total splenectomy), and 13 patients (27%) had postoperative complications. Eleven patients (23%) presented with accelerated bone disease after total splenectomy (mean follow-up: 96 months). No patients having partial splenectomy (mean follow-up: 25 months) developed progressive bone disease. Eight patients have died since surgery. All four deaths due to malignant disease occurred in patients after total splenectomy. The results of this largest-ever reported series of splenectomy for Gaucher's disease confirm that while either total or partial splenectomy can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality, total splenectomy is accompanied by more aggressive bone disease and a predisposition to malignancy. Prospective, randomized trials are needed to substantiate whether partial splenectomy is indeed the treatment of choice for splenomegaly associated with Gaucher's disease. 
1	Late cardiac effects of doxorubicin therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood BACKGROUND. Cardiotoxicity is a recognized complication of doxorubicin therapy, but the long-term effects of doxorubicin are not well documented. We therefore assessed the cardiac status of 115 children who had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with doxorubicin 1 to 15 years earlier in whom the disease was in continuous remission. METHODS. Eighteen patients received one dose of doxorubicin (45 mg per square meter of body-surface area), and 97 received multiple doses totaling 228 to 550 mg per square meter (median, 360). The median interval between the end of treatment and the cardiac evaluation was 6.4 years. Our evaluation consisted of a history, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording, exercise testing, and echocardiography. RESULTS. Fifty-seven percent of the patients had abnormalities of left ventricular afterload (measured as end-systolic wall stress) or contractility (measured as the stress-velocity index). The cumulative dose of doxorubicin was the most significant predictor of abnormal cardiac function (P less than 0.002). Seventeen percent of patients who received one dose of doxorubicin had slightly elevated age-adjusted afterload, and none had decreased contractility. In contrast, 65 percent of patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter had increased afterload (59 percent of patients), decreased contractility (23 percent), or both. Increased afterload was due to reduced ventricular wall thickness, not to hypertension or ventricular dilatation. In multivariate analyses restricted to patients who received at least 228 mg of doxorubicin per square meter, the only significant predictive factors were a higher cumulative dose (P = 0.01), which predicted decreased contractility, and an age of less than four years at treatment (P = 0.003), which predicted increased afterload. Afterload increased progressively in 24 of 34 patients evaluated serially (71 percent). Reported symptoms correlated poorly with indexes of exercise tolerance or ventricular function. Eleven patients had congestive heart failure within one year of treatment with doxorubicin; five of them had recurrent heart failure 3.7 to 10.3 years after completing doxorubicin treatment, and two required heart transplantation. No patient had late heart failure as a new event. CONCLUSIONS. Doxorubicin therapy in childhood impairs myocardial growth in a dose-related fashion and results in a progressive increase in left ventricular afterload sometimes accompanied by reduced contractility. We hypothesize that the loss of myocytes during doxorubicin therapy in childhood might result in inadequate left ventricular mass and clinically important heart disease in later years. 
1	Intraoperative pleural lavage cytology in lung cancer patients. Cytology of intraoperative pleural lavage was examined in 164 lung cancer patients who underwent pulmonary resections. None of the patients had any pleural effusion or dissemination. Cytology was performed three times: (1) at thoracotomy, (2) immediately after resection, and (3) after washing the pleural cavity with 5,000 mL of physiological saline solution just before closure of the chest wall. Twenty-three patients (14%) had more than one positive cytological finding. The frequency of positive cytological findings was significantly correlated with pathological T classification, pleural status, and pathological stage. The positive lavage group had a significantly higher recurrence rate than the negative lavage group in patients with stage I or stage II cancer. Four patients in the positive lavage group (17.4%) had recurrence in pleura or pericardium whereas only 1 patient in the negative lavage group (0.7%) had a recurrence in pericardium. The positive cytological finding of pleural lavage has more important meaning as a prognostic factor in stage I and stage II and indicates a greater possibility of recurrence in pleura or pericardium, but further examinations to evaluate the viability of detected malignant cells are required so that the positive cytological findings of pleural lavage can be regarded as subclinical pleural dissemination. 
4	Specific supersensitivity of the mesenteric vascular bed of Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) and salt-resistant (DR) rats were maintained on a diet containing normal (0.45%) or high (7%) salt for 5 days. The DS rats had slightly higher systolic blood pressures than DR rats, although a high salt diet failed to significantly elevate pressure in either group when compared with their appropriate (low salt diet) controls. The sensitivity of the isolated, perfused mesenteric vasculature from DS rats fed a high salt diet to nerve stimulation was greater when compared with all other groups in the presence or absence of cocaine (1 microM). A similar difference in sensitivity between high salt DS rats and high salt DR rats to bolus injections of norepinephrine was observed only in the presence of cocaine. The change in sensitivity was characterized by a leftward shift of the dose-response curve without a change in maximum response. No difference in sensitivity between the high salt DS group and any other treatment group was observed in response to the pressor agents KCl, angiotensin II, 5-hydroxytryptamine or the depressor agent acetylcholine. These data indicate that DS rats on a short-term, high salt diet possess a significant and specific elevation in sensitivity to nerve stimulation and norepinephrine in the absence of an increase in blood pressure. Differences in the effectiveness of cocaine among the groups suggest that differences may exist in neuronal uptake (uptake 1). 
1	Congenital biliary tract disease. Jaundice in the pediatric patient requires prompt and directed evaluation. This dictum is highlighted in infants with biliary atresia, in whom the progressive sclerosing process results in complete obliteration of patent but microscopic hilar biliary structures by 4 months of age. Kasai's operation, if done before that time, will re-establish bile drainage in 90% of infants. One fourth to one third of patients achieve long-term jaundice-free survival. Complications of cholangitis, portal hypertension, and fat malabsorption are experienced by many patients. In children with early or late operative failure, liver replacement now offers legitimate hope for extended survival. Choledochal cyst is a conglomerate of pancreaticobiliary anomalies consisting of a choledochal cyst, a common-channel-type pancreaticobiliary junction, intrahepatic cystic disease, and partial obstruction of the distal common bile duct. Many patients have one or more of these malformations. It is now widely accepted that the preferred treatment of choledochal cyst is total excision of the diseased biliary duct with reconstruction by Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy. "Internal" excision avoids injury to other structures in the hepatoduodenal ligament, particularly if pericystic inflammation is present. Congenital perforation of the common bile duct responds in most cases to simple peritoneal drainage of the perforation. Retention of the tube cholecystostomy is useful for subsequent cholangiographic follow-up. Tube cholecystostomy may also be useful for irrigation of the biliary tract in infants with inspissated bile syndrome. 
3	The prognostic value of residual spikes in the postexcision electrocorticogram after temporal lobectomy. We correlated the postresection electrocorticograms (ECoGs) of 80 patients who underwent temporal lobectomy under general anesthesia for treatment of intractable complex partial seizures with surgical results in three groups: seizure/aura free (32 patients), auras only (16 patients), and one or more postoperative seizures (32 patients) at mean follow-up times of 34, 31, and 38 months, respectively. Spontaneous "residual spikes," ie, present after all resections, were present in 47% of patients who had no postoperative seizures or auras. However, they occurred in 72% of patients with any postoperative seizures (p less than 0.05). The location (convexity, mesial, or edge of resections) or the distribution (unifocal versus multifocal) of the residual spikes was not of prognostic value. Quantitative studies in 5-minute epochs of the postexcision ECoGs did not reveal a significant difference in the morphology of the residual spikes, ie, the amplitude or firing pattern (single versus polyspike), in the three groups. The group with postoperative seizures showed a higher number of spikes per epoch (greater than or equal to 50), but it was not significant. Although the study shows that patients with residual spikes may have good prognosis, they are at significantly higher risk for postoperative seizures as compared with those without residual spikes. The possibility that intensity of firing of residual spikes may be an additional predictor of outcome warrants further study. 
4	Positron emission tomography and interventional cardiology. Current noninvasive diagnostic techniques have limited accuracy for detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) in symptomatic and (particularly) asymptomatic patients with silent disease. Furthermore, no standard noninvasive method provides reliable diagnostic information on the location of the coronary arteries involved, the severity of stenosis, the presence of collaterals and myocardial viability. Based on greater than 1,000 cardiac studies at the University of Texas, cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) with either generator-produced rubidium-82, cyclotron-produced N-13 ammonia, or F-18 deoxyglucose is suitable for 4 routine diagnostic purposes: (1) noninvasive diagnosis of CAD in either symptomatic or asymptomatic subjects with a sensitivity of 95 to 98% and specificity of 95 to 100%. This accuracy is now sufficient to schedule diagnostic catheterization and multivessel angioplasty with surgical backup on the basis of the PET scan. At the University of Texas we carry out PET in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients to direct those with mild disease to cholesterol-lowering reversal therapy and those with severe disease to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA); (2) assessment of physiologic severity of coronary artery stenosis as compared to automated quantitative coronary arteriographic analysis. Changes in stenosis severity are followed before and after interventions including PTCA, bypass surgery, vasodilator drugs and cholesterol control regimens for reversal of coronary atherosclerosis; (3) imaging myocardial infarction, ischemia, viability, zone at risk and sizing of these pathophysiologic processes. 
3	Reciprocal inhibition between forearm muscles in spastic hemiplegia. We studied reciprocal inhibition of H-reflexes in the forearm flexor and extensor muscles in 14 patients with spastic hemiplegia secondary to a focal cerebral lesion and 14 normal volunteers. In the spastic limb, the Hmax/Mmax ratio was increased in both flexor and particularly extensor wrist muscles. The 3 normal inhibitory phases of reciprocal inhibition between extensor and flexor forearm muscles were markedly reduced on the spastic side of patients. The early disynaptic phase showed the greatest alteration. Reduced or absent inhibition between forearm muscles associated with increased spinal motoneuron excitability may be typical to spastic hemiplegia. 
3	The effect of glucose administration on carbohydrate metabolism after head injury. The role of intravenous infusion of glucose in limiting ketogenesis and the effect of glucose on cerebral metabolism following severe head injury were studied in 21 comatose patients. The patients were randomly assigned to alimentation with or without glucose. Systemic protein wasting, arterial concentrations of energy substrates, and cerebral metabolism of these energy substrates were monitored for 5 days postinjury. Both groups were in negative nitrogen balance, and had wasting of systemic proteins despite substantial protein intake. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose concentrations were highest on Day 1, but remained higher than normal fasting levels on all days of study, even in the patients who received no exogenous glucose. Although there were no differences in blood or CSF glucose concentrations in the two groups of patients, the glucose group had higher plasma insulin levels, with a mean +/- standard deviation of 14.8 +/- 7.3 microU/ml compared to 10.3 +/- 4.2 microU/ml in the saline group. The blood concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, pyruvate, glycerol, and the free fatty acids were higher in the saline group than in the glucose group. Cerebral oxygen consumption was similar in the two groups, while the cerebral metabolism of glucose and of the ketone bodies was dependent on whether glucose was administered. In the glucose group, glucose was the only energy substrate utilized by the brain. In the saline group, the ketone bodies beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate replaced glucose to the extent of 16% of the brain's total energy production. Cerebral lactate production and CSF lactate concentration were lower in the saline group. These studies suggest that administration of glucose during the early recovery period of severe head injury is a major cause of suppressed ketogenesis, and may increase production of lactic acid by the traumatized brain by limiting the availability of nonglycolytic energy substrates. 
1	Vaginal epithelial abnormalities in patients with CIN: clinical and pathological features and management. Of 4147 women who had CIN treated by laser at the Regional Gynaecological Oncology Centre, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead, 103 (2.5%) had co-existing vaginal epithelial abnormalities. CIN 3 was the histological diagnosis most often associated with vaginal lesions. The upper vagina was almost always involved. In 67% the lesion in the cervix appeared to be confluent with that in the vagina. Even when the lesions were confluent, biopsies form the cervical and vaginal components did not always show the same grade of intraepithelial neoplasia and in some biopsies they showed different lesions. Laser treatment appears to be effective for the vaginal lesions and is therefore recommended although, in selected patients, careful follow up alone may suffice. 
1	Autologous bone marrow transplantation in multiple myeloma: identification of prognostic factors. Multiple myeloma remains a universally fatal malignancy with a median survival time not exceeding 3 years. A clinical trial was undertaken to determine feasibility and efficacy of marrow-ablative chemoradiotherapy supported by unpurged autologous bone marrow (ABMT) and to define prognostic variables. Total body irradiation and either melphalan or thiotepa were administered to 55 patients (median age 53 years; range 20 to 66 years). The group of 21 patients with resistance to standard melphalan-prednisone and to continuous infusions of vincristine and Adriamycin with high dose dexamethasone (VAD) included 7 with primary unresponsive disease and 14 with resistant relapse; among the 34 patients achieving remission with the VAD regimen, 14 were in first and 20 in a subsequent remission. Marked cytoreduction by greater than or equal to 75% was observed among all 21 patients with refractory myeloma, whereas further cytoreduction of this magnitude was noted in only 56% of the 34 patients already in remission after VAD. Five of the 6 early deaths among all 55 patients occurred in the 14 patients with resistant relapse, none of whom achieved complete remission and who, as a group, had median durations of relapse-free and overall survival of only 8 and 7 months, respectively. Among the 41 remaining patients, there was only one early death, and 27% achieved complete remission including a 36% incidence among the 14 patients treated in first remission; their projected 4-year survival rate was 82% regardless of their disease status (first or later remission or primary resistance). When information about sensitivity to prior therapy is unavailable, the presence before ABMT of both high beta-2-microglobulin levels (greater than 3 mg/L) and non-IgG isotype helped identify 9 among the 55 patients with a very poor prognosis: all 8 responders relapsed within 9 months, and 8 patients died within 15 months. By contrast, a 4-year projected survival rate of over 70% for the other patients (about 80% of this series) justifies further investigation of this novel treatment approach in comparison with standard dose regimens. Our results indicate that marrow-ablative therapy cannot be recommended for myeloma patients with resistant relapse or those with a combination of risk factors (advanced tumor burden, absence of IgG isotype). The apparent lack of an adverse effect of even marked plasmacytosis in autografts (up to 30%) emphasizes the need for better cytoreduction rather than bone marrow purging. 
1	Therapeutic outcome of patients suffering from malignant melanomas of the conjunctiva. Eighty-one cases of conjunctival melanoma treated between 1960 and 1988 were studied to determine factors that might affect outcome in patients with such lesions. The therapeutic procedures performed were local excision (16), local excision followed by brachytherapy with Sr-90/Y-90 (32), local excision followed by cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen (16), brachytherapy with Sr-90/Y-90 (12), local excision followed by external beam irradiation (3), and local excision followed by brachytherapy and cryotherapy (2). The median follow-up period was 5.5 years (longest 26, shortest 1 year). Sixty two patients (76.5%) showed a complete regression of the melanoma, 19 (23.5%) developed recurrences, and 15 (18.5%) died from metastases. The melanomas had developed with almost equal frequency from a pre-existing naevus (25.9%), from primary acquired melanosis (25.9%), and 'de novo' (30.9%). Small tumours had a higher chance of regressing (80.6%) than larger ones (68.6%). The cumulative survival rate was 76% after five years and 60% after 10 years from any causes of death and 87.6% after five years and 76.3% after 10 years from deaths caused by metastases. Most deaths from metastases occurred within 5 years. At 88.5%, the cumulative survival rate of patients with small tumours (less than one quadrant of the bulbar conjunctiva and less than 2 mm thickness) was significantly higher than that of patients with larger tumours (more than one quadrant of the bulbar conjunctiva and/or more than 2 mm thickness) with 65% after eight years. Local excision followed by beta ray irradiation (Sr-90/Y-90) or cryotherapy can be recommended as the treatment of choice. Nevertheless the behaviour of conjunctival melanomas remains unpredictable in individual cases. 
1	Expression of class I and II human leukocyte antigens by thyrocytes and lymphocytic infiltration on human thyroid tumors. An immunofluorescence study. Surgical thyroid sections from 30 papillary carcinomas (PC), six medullary carcinomas (MC), three anaplastic carcinomas (AC), two follicular carcinomas (FC), and 16 adenomas (AD) were examined with an indirect immunofluorescence technique employing different monoclonal antibodies to evaluate the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, B, C (Class I) and DR, DP, DQ (Class II) by thyrocytes, together with the phenotype and distribution of inflammatory cells. Ten PC and four FC were also investigated for the presence of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). In situ deposits of immunocomplexes and circulating thyroid autoantibodies were also evaluated. An increased expression of Class I antigens was found in all PC and FC, in 33% of MC and AC, and in 31% of AD. An anomalous expression of Class II antigens was observed in 70% of PC, in 50% of FC, in 33% of AC, in 19% of AD, and in none of the MC. Expression of DP or DQ was revealed only in a portion of the DR-positive glands. A reduction of microsomal autoantigen expression was found. No ICAM-1-positive thyrocytes were detected. A moderate T-lymphocytic infiltrate was noticed only in PC, where it was correlated with DR and DP and/or DQ coexpression. B-cells and natural killer cells were virtually absent. The authors speculate that the weak Class II antigens expression, together with the partial or complete loss in microsomal autoantigen and the absence of ICAM-1 by thyrocytes, may account for the limited engagement of immunocompetent cells observed in thyroid tumors. 
4	Continuous extracorporeal fluid removal in children with low cardiac output after cardiac operations. Eleven hypervolemic and oliguric children with low cardiac output after cardiac operations were treated by slow continuous ultrafiltration or continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration. A mean negative fluid balance of 1.63 +/- 0.37 ml/kg/hr (standard error of the mean [SEM]) significantly improved the hemodynamic status within 59 +/- 6.1 hours (SEM). Although the central venous pressure decreased significantly from 15.2 +/- 0.84 to 8.8 +/- 0.92 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001), the mean arterial pressure increased significantly from 41.5 +/- 2.54 to 53.5 +/- 2.21 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). In addition, pH increased significantly from 7.31 +/- 0.01 (SEM) to 7.43 +/- 0.001 (SEM) (p less than 0.001) and oxygenation index (arterial oxygen tension/inspired oxygen fraction) from 119 +/- 15.2 (SEM) to 214 +/- 27.0 (SEM) (p less than 0.001). Hemodynamic improvement during slow continuous extracorporeal fluid removal allowed a significant decrease of the catecholamine infusion rate. After normovolemia had been achieved, continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration had to be continued in four children because of persistent anuria. Eight patients could be weaned from artificial ventilation and vasopressor support. Two patients died without recovery of renal function and one with restored renal function. Slow continuous ultrafiltration and continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration improve the cardiovascular function in children with low cardiac output by optimizing the preload conditions of the failing heart. In addition, they improve acid-base balance and pulmonary gas exchange. 
4	Stress and hypertension In susceptible persons emotional stress results in immediate sympathetic stimulation, with a vasomotor response that results in a high-output state and elevated blood pressure; the vasopressor response seems to be transient. There seems to be no longitudinal epidemiologic validation of the attractive hypothesis that transiently elevated blood pressures are the prelude to fixed hypertension, however. The acquisition of hypertension by populations abandoning their traditional mode of living has been attributed to the sociocultural stress inherent in westernization, but these studies usually have not taken into account concomitants of this type of acculturation, such as dietary changes and increased body weight. The inverse relationship of blood pressure levels to education could explain the development of hypertension when aspiration to upward mobility is thwarted. The severity of perceived occupational stress relates inversely to blood pressure, suggesting that familiarity with a job renders the demands made by the work environment more predictable and less threatening in terms of vasopressor response. 
5	Corpus callosotomy for intractable seizures in the pediatric age group. The results of corpus callosotomy in 18 patients 16 years old and younger are presented. Eighty-three percent of our patients have had a significant improvement from the surgery (a decrease in seizure frequency of greater than 80% or no longer having generalized atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic seizures). The procedure seems to be well tolerated in young patients, and we have not noted a postoperative deterioration in behavior, memory, or language function in our patients. One of our patients died in status epilepticus 3 months after surgery. Nevertheless, we have not encountered any serious morbidity in our other patients. Corpus callosotomy can be considered for children with intractable seizures, especially when generalized atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic (whether primary or secondary) seizures are the major seizure type. 
5	Use of a computerized closed-loop sodium nitroprusside titration system for antihypertensive treatment after open heart surgery. This study evaluates the clinical applicability of administering sodium nitroprusside by a closed-loop titration system compared with a manually adjusted system. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was registered every 10 and 30 sec during the first 150 min after open heart surgery in 20 patients (group 1: computer regulation) and in ten patients (group 2: manual regulation). The results (16,343 and 2,912 data points in groups 1 and 2, respectively), were then analyzed in four time frames and five pressure ranges to indicate clinical efficacy. Sixty percent of the measured MAP in both groups was within the desired +/- 10% during the first 10 min. Thereafter until the end of observation, the MAP was maintained within +/- 10% of the desired set-point 90% of the time in group 1 vs. 60% of the time in group 2. One percent and 11% of data points were +/- 20% from the set-point in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p less than .05, chi-square test). The computer-assisted therapy provided better control of MAP, was safe to use, and helped to reduce nursing demands. 
1	In vivo evaluation of monopolar versus bipolar electrosurgical polypectomy snares. The energy required and tissue damage in bipolar and monopolar polypectomy snares were compared in a canine model. The bipolar snare required an average of 34 joules of energy, whereas the monopolar snare required 228 joules to cut the same diameter of gastric mucosa tended into a polypoid structure (p = 0.0005). The reduced energy delivered to the tissue from the bipolar procedure resulted in only 32% average depth of damage to the underlying gastric wall, whereas the monopolar procedure caused an average 69% (p = 0.001). Surgically created polyps required 247 joules and 69 joules for corresponding monopolar and bipolar polypectomy (p = 0.001). The decreased energy required and the correspondingly reduced damage caused to the underlying bowel wall by the bipolar snare should reduce the incidence of perforation and post-polypectomy syndrome. The bipolar snare completes a local circuit about the snare, eliminating the return electrode and, consequently, the possibility of any return electrode burns. The bipolar snare thus provides an added safety margin during polypectomy. 
5	The use of a tourniquet when plating tibial fractures. Sixty closed fractures of the tibia were treated by open reduction and internal fixation with plates and screws. Half the operations were performed with a thigh tourniquet and half without. In the tourniquet group, there were six cases with erythema and induration of the wound; in the other group there were no such complications. Despite negative bacterial cultures, superficial infection of the inflamed wounds was suspected. It is suggested that a tourniquet may predispose tissues to infection, and its use is not recommended during operations for internal fixation of the tibia. 
5	Atrial activation sequence during atrial flutter in the canine pericarditis model and its effects on the polarity of the flutter wave in the electrocardiogram. Stable atrial flutter induced in both conscious and open chest states was studied in 30 mongrel dogs after production of sterile pericarditis. During the conscious state studies, induced atrial flutter (mean cycle length 128 +/- 15 ms) was always sustained greater than 15 min and was stable. Three types of flutter wave polarity were noted in electrocardiogram (ECG) lead II: positive in 16 dogs, negative in 3 and flat or slightly positive in 11. Sequential site atrial mapping during atrial flutter (mean cycle length 133 +/- 18 ms) in the open chest state showed either clockwise (18 dogs) or counterclockwise (12 dogs) circus movement in the right atrium. In 19 of 30 dogs, the circus movement clearly did not require any naturally existing anatomic obstacle; in 11, the orifice of the superior vena cava probably was also involved. Double potentials were recorded from the center of the reentrant circuit during atrial flutter, and fractionated electrograms were recorded from a pivot point of the reentrant wave front. A positive flutter wave in ECG lead II (12 dogs with counterclockwise circus movement) was associated with early activation of the Bachmann's bundle region compared with the posteroinferior left atrium and activation of the left atrium mainly in a superoinferior direction. A negative flutter was associated with the early activation of the posteroinferior left atrium compared with Bachmann's bundle and activation of a considerable portion of the left atrium in an inferosuperior direction. A flat or slightly positive flutter wave (14 of 18 with clockwise circus movement) was associated with activation of the left atrium almost simultaneously by two wave fronts coming from both these sites. In conclusion, atrial flutter in this dog model is due to circus movement in the right atrium, the center of which does not necessarily require an anatomic obstacle. Although atrial flutter is generated by circus movement in the right atrium, the flutter wave polarity in the ECG is determined primarily by the activation sequence of the left atrium. 
1	Medulloblastoma: a population-based study of 532 cases. Five hundred thirty-two cases of medulloblastoma (males n = 327 and females n = 205), aged 0 to 86 years diagnosed between 1973 and 1986 were studied to determine the incidence in different geographic regions of the United States and to evaluate the effect of various factors on survival. The median age was 9 years and average follow-up time was 45 months. The overall incidence rate was 1.8 per one million person-years. Variables that were statistically significant (p less than 0.05) in a multivariate model determining survival in rank order were treatment group, sex, geographic region, year group and age. This observational study found that 1) age and sex were statistically significant factors in describing the incidence rates, whereas year group and geographic region were not; 2) no incidence peak in the third decade of life was observed; 3) a significant improvement in survival was observed in the combined 1978 to 1986 year groups relative to the 1973 to 1977 year group; 4) the overall 5-year survival probability was 45%; and 5) there has been an increase over time in the use of more than two modalities of treatment. 
3	Is emotional disturbance a precipitator or a consequence of chronic pain? The present study examined the relationship between psychological factors and pain in order to assess the contribution of emotional disturbance to the perpetuation of pain. A group of 163 chronic pain suffers in multiple settings was compared with 81 control subjects on measures of personal history antecedent to pain onset, as well as on measures of current emotional disturbance. In addition, these psychological variables were examined for their associations with subjectively rated pain intensity. Overall, pain was found to be related to more current depression and less current life satisfaction, but was not associated with most of the personal history variables examined. These results suggests that emotional disturbance in pain patients is more likely to be a consequence than a cause of chronic pain. The dangers of routinely ascribing intractable pain to psychological causation are discussed in the light of these findings. 
1	Different effect of benzylacyclouridine on the toxic and therapeutic effects of azidothymidine in mice. It has been reported that in vitro uridine (Urd) can reverse azidothymidine (AZT) cytotoxicity without decreasing anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity. Our studies in mice have shown that daily oral doses of benzylacyclouridine (BAU), an inhibitor of Urd breakdown, also reduces AZT hematologic toxicity, presumably by elevating the plasma concentration of Urd. We now extend these murine studies and report the effect of various doses of exogenous Urd, various doses of BAU, or the combination of BAU and Urd, administered daily, on AZT-induced toxicity. In mice receiving concomitant AZT, daily doses of Urd of 1,000 to 2,000 mg/kg increase peripheral reticulocytes and slightly reduce AZT-induced hematologic toxicity. However, the range of effective doses is narrow, and higher doses of Urd (greater than 3,000 mg/kg/d) significantly enhance hematologic toxicity. At its most effective dose, (2,000 mg/kg/d), Urd produces 28% mortality. In contrast, BAU doses up to 300 mg/kg/d reduced AZT-related hematologic toxicity in a dose-dependent manner without mortality. Higher daily doses of BAU and the combination of BAU with low doses of Urd were not more effective. Studies conducted in mice infected with the Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV) indicate that BAU does not impair the antiretroviral effect of AZT when administered at doses that reduce AZT-induced anemia and leukopenia. These findings may be significant for the treatment of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex. 
5	Outcome probabilities and life history after surgical mitral commissurotomy: implications for balloon commissurotomy. From 1967 to 1988, 339 patients with mitral stenosis underwent surgical commissurotomy, 103 with a closed and 236 with an open technique. The 1 month and 1, 5, 10 and 20 year overall survival rate was 99.7%, 99%, 95%, 87% and 59%, respectively, and the technique (open versus closed) was not a risk factor. Technique was also not a risk factor for a second mitral commissurotomy, subsequent mitral valve replacement, thromboembolism or poor functional status. Risk factors were older age at commissurotomy, black race, higher pulmonary vascular resistance, mitral leaflet calcification, left ventricular enlargement and postcommissurotomy mitral incompetence. The closed technique was a risk factor for mitral incompetence immediately after commissurotomy, but important incompetence developed in only 2 of the 103 patients undergoing closed commissurotomy. Mitral valve replacement was not required within 10 years in 78% of patients and within 20 years in 47%. Despite some increased prevalence of postcommissurotomy mitral incompetence and particularly in view of the considerable long-term likelihood of mitral valve replacement, initial therapy for most patients with mitral stenosis should probably be surgical closed (or percutaneous balloon) mitral commissurotomy. The equations developed in the present study can be used to predict and compare outcome probability after percutaneous balloon commissurotomy with that after surgical commissurotomy and to compare these with outcome probability after mitral valve replacement. 
2	Management of gastroenteritis. Childhood gastroenteritis remains a common reason for admission to British paediatric units, although the severity of the disease appears to be diminishing in recent years. We studied 215 infants and children with gastroenteritis admitted consecutively to four paediatric units in South Wales in order to determine the severity of the disease, the organisms isolated, the frequency of complications, and the adequacy of management before admission. Stool pathogens were isolated in 125 (58%) patients (viruses in 65, bacteria in 30, and protozoa in 19, with multiple infection found in 11). There was a low incidence of morbidity and complications, but prolonged diarrhoea (postenteritis syndrome) was present in 24 (11%) cases and 77 (36%) had received inappropriate treatment before admission. Contemporary gastroenteritis is thus a relatively mild disease in the acute phase, but management before admission to hospital is often inadequate, and prolonged diarrhoea may be a feature in a considerable number of cases. 
5	Cauda equina syndrome after continuous spinal anesthesia. Four cases of cauda equina syndrome occurring after continuous spinal anesthesia are reported. In all four cases, there was evidence of a focal sensory block and, to achieve adequate analgesia, a dose of local anesthetic was given that was greater than that usually administered with a single-injection technique. We postulate that the combination of maldistribution and a relatively high dose of local anesthetic resulted in neurotoxic injury. Suggestions that may reduce the potential for neurotoxicity are discussed. Use of a lower concentration and a "ceiling" or maximum dose of local anesthetic to establish the block should be considered. If maldistribution of local anesthetic is suspected (as indicated by a focal sensory block), the use of maneuvers to increase the spread of local anesthetic is recommended. If such maneuvers prove unsuccessful, the technique should be abandoned. 
4	Impaired insulin action on skeletal muscle metabolism in essential hypertension. Previous studies have shown that essential hypertension is frequently associated with insulin resistance. The tissues responsible for this metabolic alteration have not been defined. We tested the hypothesis that skeletal muscle is the site of insulin resistance of essential hypertension with the use of the perfused forearm technique. Eight hypertensive (age 42 +/- 3 years, body mass index 27 +/- 1 kg/m2, intra-arterial mean blood pressure 126 +/- 4 mm Hg) and seven normotensive (age 48 +/- 3 years, body mass index 26 +/- 1 kg/m2, mean blood pressure 95 +/- 4 mm Hg) male volunteers were studied. After glucose ingestion (40 g/m2), normal glucose tolerance in the patients was maintained at the expense of a heightened plasma insulin response, suggesting the presence of insulin resistance. During graded, local (intra-arterial) hyperinsulinemia encompassing the physiological range (12-120 milliunits/l), glucose uptake by forearm tissues was significantly (p less than 0.03) reduced in the hypertensive subjects as compared with the controls at each of five insulin steps, by 43% on the average. In addition, forearm lactate and pyruvate release were significantly less stimulated in the hypertensive than in the normotensive group (p less than 0.01 for both), presumably as a consequence of the decreased glucose influx. Forearm exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, lipid substrates (free fatty acids, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate), and potassium were similar in the hypertensive and normotensive groups in the basal state. Insulin had no effect on oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and respiratory quotient in either study group, whereas it stimulated free fatty acids, glycerol, and potassium uptake to the same extent in the hypertensive and normotensive groups. 
5	Effects of repeated temporary clipping of the middle cerebral artery on pial arterial diameter, regional cerebral blood flow, and brain structure in cats. Temporary clipping of the major arterial trunk is an important maneuver to control excessive unexpected bleeding in neurosurgical operations; however, repeated temporary clipping can give rise to severe neurological deficits after surgery. The present study was performed to confirm and explain these clinical findings. Initially, a single 20-minute or 1-hour occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was performed in each of 5 cats. Pial arterial diameter was determined by video imaging, regional cerebral blood flow was measured by autoradiography, and cerebral edema and infarction were observed. In the 20-minute occlusion group, no abnormal changes were found 5 hours after recirculation. In the 1-hour occlusion group, pial arteries were dilated by 45%, and regional cerebral blood flow increased to more than twice the resting cortical values. The extent of cerebral edema was 41.2 +/- 7.5% (SE) and infarction was 34.5 +/- 9.5% (SE) of the hemisphere. In the second experiment, three 20-minute occlusions of the middle cerebral artery in a 1-hour interval were performed in 20 cats. In 10 of them, thiopental (40 mg/kg) was used to protect the brain. In the group without barbiturate treatment, pial arteries were dilated by 40% at the end of experiment, regional cerebral blood flow decreased to about 70% compared with single 20-minute occlusion, cerebral edema was 19.5 +/- 8.1% (SE), and infarction was 8.1 +/- 3.7% (SE) of the hemisphere. In the treated group, these were only trivial changes. The effect of repeated clipping may cumulatively cause brain damage, and barbiturates should be used whenever repeated clipping is necessary. 
3	Dacron-woven pacemaker pouch. Influence on long-term pacemaker mobility. Pacemaker migration can interfere with correct pacing system function and patient comfort. A Dacron pouch has been developed which may prevent these problems. To assess the efficacy of the pouch, we measured various factors of pacemaker mobility in 100 patients after long-term follow-up. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of their dictated operative reports: group 1, no pouch or anchoring stitch; group 2, pouch only; group 3, anchoring stitch to pacemaker header or pouch. The average age of the study population was 74.3 +/- 11 years. Total follow-up time was 42 +/- 28 months (group I, 53 +/- 32 months; group 2, 36 +/- 23 months; group 3, 34 +/- 25 months). There were no significant differences when pacemakers were measured for movement in the inferosuperior and lateromedial directions, nor was there any difference in the distance between the incision scar and the pacemaker header in any group. There was a significant difference between group 1 and groups 2 and 3 when the degree of tilt of the pacemaker off the chest wall was compared. This was 46 degrees +/- 34 degrees for group 1 and 27 degrees +/- 26 degrees and 26 degrees +/- 27 degrees for groups 2 and 3, respectively (p less than 0.02 for both). These data suggest that the Dacron pouch does not restrict pacemaker mobility parallel to the chest wall during long-term follow-up but does reduce the angle to which the pacemaker can be tilted relative to the chest wall. 
5	A protocol for the investigation of pregnancy loss. A protocol for the evaluation of pregnancy loss should include a maternal history, dysmorphic examination of the fetus or abortus, photographs, autopsy, chromosome studies (in most cases), and radiographic or xeroradiographic studies. Selected cases with suspected ascending or transplacental infection may require microbiologic investigation. Increasing specialized laboratory techniques may help in the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism or storage disorders. Coordination of studies requires the interaction of OB/GYN, pathology, genetics, cytogenetics, and nursing in order to assure delivery of this clinical service. Knowledge of the causes of pregnancy loss and their typical time and mode of presentation can facilitate a focused evaluation, with a high chance of achieving an accurate diagnosis. The goal of all investigations is to provide families with recurrence risk data on which to base future childbearing decisions, as well as information on potential prenatal monitoring. 
1	Infiltration of the lower respiratory tract by helper/inducer T lymphocytes in HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), a disorder in which peripheral blood and multiple organs are infiltrated by malignantly transformed T lymphocytes. We investigated the nature of pulmonary disease in a patient with serologic evidence of HTLV-1 infection. In this case, endobronchial biopsy specimens showed infiltration of the bronchial mucosa by pleomorphic cells exhibiting a high degree of nuclear irregularity. These cells were morphologically identical in appearance to malignant cells found in peripheral blood and infiltrating the dermis, expressed the OKT4/Leu3 phenotype and the receptor for interleukin 2, and, by analogy to gene rearrangement studies on leukemic blood cells, were monoclonal in origin. However, in situ hybridization of endobronchial biopsy specimens with full-length HTLV-1 probes failed to detect retroviral RNA or proviral DNA. These studies indicate that T lymphocytic involvement of the lower respiratory tract in HTLV-1-associated ATLL is characterized by expression of a malignant phenotype despite the inability to document actual cellular infection with this retrovirus by a molecular hybridization technique. 
4	Lack of cutaneous hyperemia in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in IDDM. Cutaneous blood flow was measured with the laser Doppler technique and by recording cutaneous O2 tension on the forearm and forehead in nine young adult patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and nine sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects after induction of hypoglycemia. In the healthy subjects, cutaneous blood flow measured with the laser Doppler technique was increased by 120 +/- 26% in the forehead (P less than 0.01) and 196 +/- 50% in the forearm (P less than 0.01) at the glucose nadir (blood glucose 1.8 +/- 0.2 mM) compared with basal blood flow. In contrast, in diabetic patients, cutaneous blood flow was unchanged. The corresponding changes, at the glucose nadir, with cutaneous O2 tension recordings were 286 +/- 131% (P less than 0.05) in control subjects and -22 +/- 15% (NS) in diabetic patients. An impairment of sympathetic nervous function, not detectable by simple cardiovascular tests, could be responsible for the lack of cutaneous hyperemia and sweating and could contribute to unawareness of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients. 
1	Results of contemporary radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer: a clinicopathological study with an emphasis on the inadequacy of the tumor, nodes and metastases classification. We reviewed 261 patients who underwent a radical operation at a single institution as definitive treatment of invasive bladder cancer to evaluate the survival and accuracy of the tumor, nodes and metastasis system in characterizing the prognosis. Between January 1979 and June 1987 the 261 evaluable patients underwent 1-stage radical cystectomy with pelvic node dissection and urinary diversion. No chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy was given before or after the operation. The postoperative mortality rate was 1.8%. The over-all staging error between clinical and pathological stages was as high as 44%. The over-all actuarial 5-year survival rate was 54.5%. The 5-year survival rates were 75% for stage pT1, 63% for stage pT2, 31% for stage pT3 and 21% for stage pT4 disease. A significant difference in the survival (p less than 0.002) was observed in stage pT3 by dividing tumors confined within the bladder wall (pT3a, 50%) from those extending throughout the bladder wall (pT3b, 15%). A careful evaluation of transitional cell involvement of the prostate in stage pT4a cancer led to the identification of 2 different patterns: 1) contiguous when a bladder tumor extended directly into the prostate through the bladder wall and 2) noncontiguous when a bladder tumor and a transitional cell carcinoma of the prostate were found simultaneously. These patterns had completely different (p less than 0.05) survival rates (6 versus 37%). The patients with high grade tumors had a worse prognosis in comparison with those with grades 1 and 2 tumors (41 versus 56%, p less than 0.005). The over-all 5-year survival of patients with positive nodes was 4% in comparison with 60% of those without nodal involvement (p less than 0.001). Despite current optimal surgical treatment, nearly 50% of all patients with invasive bladder cancer continue to die. The need for a modification of the current tumor, nodes and metastasis tumor classification to provide the clinician a more reliable staging system for planning treatment modalities is indeed mandatory. 
5	Sustained increased cerebral blood flow with prophylactic hypertensive hypervolemic hemodilution ("triple-H" therapy) after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Delayed cerebral ischemia is the major cause of death and disability in patients who initially survive an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In the present study, a protocol for prophylactic hypertensive hypervolemic hemodilution ("triple-H" therapy) was utilized in the treatment of SAH, and the response of cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated. Serial CBF measurements, f1 and CBF15, were performed using the xenon-133 inhalation technique to maximize therapy. Surgery within 24 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage was preferred. In 43 patients with SAH, mean hemoglobin and hematocrit were lowered 3.0 +/- 0.3 g/dL and 8.9 +/- 0.5%, respectively, over the first 24 hours. Mean f1 and mean CBF15 over the same period increased 34.2 +/- 5.8% and 21.2 +/- 3.6%, respectively. The maximum mean increase in CBF was 47.2 +/- 4.7% for f1 and 30.1 +/- 3.2% for CBF15. Cerebral blood flow remained elevated during the 21 days after SAH, irrespective of neurological grade on admission, age, sex, or angiographic arterial narrowing. This is the first report of a consistent method for establishing sustained improvement in CBF after SAH. All patients managed in total compliance with the protocol remained neurologically stable or improved. Two patients developed delayed ischemia and infarction because of the inability to sustain protocol requirements. Thirty-six of the 43 patients (84%) were discharged capable of an independent lifestyle. Triple-H therapy is a safe and effective modality for elevating and sustaining CBF after SAH. In combination with early aneurysm surgery, it can minimize delayed cerebral ischemia and lead to an improved overall outcome. 
4	Results of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of high-risk angulated stenoses. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of angulated stenoses has been found in studies using older PTCA equipment to be associated with a heightened risk of procedure-related major ischemic events. To better understand the factors associated with procedural risk and to identify means of lessening that risk, 100 patients, treated sequentially from 1986 to 1989, who underwent PTCA of stenoses located at greater than or equal to 45 degrees bends, were characterized for 27 clinical, anatomic and procedural variables. Clinical outcome of angioplasty was related to these variables. In addition, results from 344 consecutive contemporary patients undergoing PTCA of nonangulated lesions were compared to those of the study group. Procedural success was achieved in only 70% of patients with angulated stenoses, compared with 306 of 344 (89%) nonangulated stenoses, and major ischemic complications (death, bypass surgery or myocardial infarction) occurred in 13% of patients with angulated stenoses compared with 12 of 344 (3.5%) with nonangulated stenoses (both p less than 0.001). The presence of associated thrombus, stenosis length greater than 10 mm or age greater than or equal to 65 years led to an even higher risk of major complications (9 of 44 = 20.5%), whereas highly experienced angioplasty operators and the use of polyethylene terephthalate balloons appeared to decrease risk and increase the likelihood of success. PTCA of such stenoses should be undertaken only cautiously and in carefully selected patients. 
4	Supraventricular tachycardia due to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in children: early disappearance and late recurrence The clinical course of 140 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who had their initial episode of supraventricular tachycardia before 18 years of age was reviewed. Among those whose tachycardia began at age 0 to 2 months, it disappeared in 93% and persisted in 7%. In 31%, it disappeared and reappeared at an average age of 8 years. Among patients whose tachycardia was present after age 5 years, it was persistent in 78% at a mean follow-up period of 7 years. Accessory connection location was mapped by electrophysiologic study in 87 patients and estimated by electrocardiography in 53 patients. There were no differences in tachycardia onset or recurrence based on accessory connection location. Congenital heart defects were present in 37% of all patients, 23% of whom had Ebstein's anomaly. Among all patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, 63% of those with a congenital heart defect had a rightsided accessory connection, whereas 61% of patients with a normal heart had a left-sided connection (p less than 0.01). Multiple accessory connections were found in 12% of patients with a congenital heart defect compared with 6% of those without such a defect. In conclusion: 1) supraventricular tachycardia due to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome that begins in infancy may disappear, but it frequently recurs in later childhood; 2) if tachycardia is present after age 5 years, it persists in greater than 75% of patients; and 3) the location of the accessory connection does not affect the clinical course of tachycardia in children with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. 
5	Effect of acute hypercapnia on limb muscle contractility in humans. The effect of acute hypercapnia on skeletal muscle contractility and relaxation rate was investigated. The contractile force of fresh and fatigued quadriceps femoris (QF) and adductor pollicis (AP) was studied in normal humans by use of electrical stimulation. Maximum relaxation rate from stimulated contractions was measured for both muscles. Acute hypercapnia led to a rapid substantial reduction of contraction force. The respiratory acidosis after 9% CO2 was breathed for 20 min [mean venous blood pH 7.26 and end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2) 65.1 Torr] reduced 20- and 100-Hz stimulated contractions of QF to 72.8 +/- 4.4 and 80.0 +/- 5.1% of control values, respectively. After 8 and 9% CO2 were breathed for 12 min, AP forces at 20- and 50-Hz stimulation were also reduced. Twitch tension of AP was reduced by a mean of 25.5% when subjects breathed 9% CO2 for 12 min [mean arterialized venous blood pH (pHav) 7.25 and PETCO2 66 Torr]. Over the range of 5% (pHav 7.38 and PETCO2 47 Torr) to 9% CO2, there was a linear relationship between twitch tension loss and pHav, arterialized venous blood PCO2, and PETCO2. Acute respiratory acidosis (mean PETCO2 61 Torr) increased the severity of low-frequency fatigue after intermittent voluntary contractions of AP. At 20 min of recovery, twitch tension was 63.2 +/- 13.4 and 46.8 +/- 16.4% of control value after exercise breathing air and 8% CO2, respectively. Acute hypercapnia (mean PETCO2 65.1 and 60.5 Torr) did not alter the maximum relaxation rate from tetanic contractions of fresh QF and from twitch tensions of AP. 
3	Multidisciplinary baseline assessment of homosexual men with and without human immunodeficiency virus infection. III. Neurologic and neuropsychological findings. We explored the possibility that neurologic and neuropsychological changes constitute the earliest detectable manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Without knowledge of HIV status, we assessed neurologic signs and symptoms and administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to 208 homosexual men, of whom 84 were HIV negative, 49 were HIV positive and asymptomatic, 29 were mildly symptomatic, and 46 had significant medical symptoms but not the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. There was no difference between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive men in the frequency of neurologic signs or of defective or borderline performance on any neuropsychological test. However, HIV-positive men performed slightly but significantly worse than HIV-negative men on tests of verbal memory, executive function, and language. Similar results were obtained when comparisons were limited to HIV-positive medically asymptomatic and HIV-negative men. There was no degradation of neurologic status or neuropsychological performance across stages of HIV severity, but neurologic and neuropsychological summary scores correlated with CD4/CD8 ratios in the HIV-positive group. Ratings of neurologic signs and symptoms correlated with neuropsychological summary scores in the HIV-positive group only. Cognitive complaints were more frequent in the HIV-positive men; they correlated with actual test performance in the HIV-positive but not HIV-negative men. The constellation of subjective and objective neuropsychological and neurologic findings suggests the possibility of a definable syndrome associated with HIV infection in asymptomatic individuals. 
1	Proliferation markers Ki-67 and p105 in soft-tissue lesions. Correlation with DNA flow cytometric characteristics. Frozen tissue immunoreactivity with Ki-67, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a nuclear antigen in nonresting or proliferating cells, was compared to DNA flow cytometry results (from fresh tissue) in a diverse group of 60 soft-tissue lesions. Both DNA index and Ki-67 score were independently reported to be associated with grade and prognosis in sarcomas, but no direct comparison of these two variables was made. It was attempted to measure proliferative activity in fixed paraffin-embedded tissues immunohistochemically in a subset of lesions using an antibody to another nuclear proliferation antigen, p105. Lesions were given a grade according to lesion category (reactive, 1; benign, 2; low-grade malignant, 3; and high-grade malignant, 4). Ki-67 reactivity correlated relatively well with this grading system (r = 0.59); benign lesions usually exhibited a low Ki-67 score and malignant lesions usually but not always exhibited a high score. For example, some malignant fibrous histiocytomas contained only rare positive cells. Some disparity between Ki-67 score and grade and within histologic types indicates some independence from these features, a fact that may be important when correlation with prognosis is performed. However Ki-67 did not correlate well with flow data such as percentage S phase (r = 0.30), percentage S + G2M phases (r = 0.37), or DNA index (r = 0.39). This probably is due to the fact that Ki-67 also marks cells in the G1 phase, whereas these are excluded in flow data analyses. Anti-p105 highlighted almost all nuclei in all cases tested, including fibromatosis, and did not correlate with Ki-67 score, histologic grade or DNA flow cytometric data. Results with p105 could not be favorably affected by titration experiments. It is reasonable to conclude that the Ki-67 score is a variable related to but independent of histologic grade, histologic type, and DNA flow values. Whether it is prognostically important in human sarcomas, as has been suggested, awaits further clinicopathologic study. 
2	Cereal-based oral rehydration therapy. I. Clinical studies. Studies of "improved" oral rehydration solutions, in which glucose polymers (starch) derived from rice or other cereals were added to improve cotransport of sodium and to promote sodium and water absorption, have been reported. These solutions were administered to decrease diarrhea volume and duration, reduce vomiting, and replace volume loss in stools. In clinical trials of children and adults with high-output diarrhea, such as in cases of cholera, the use of cereal-based oral rehydration solutions (ORS) compared with glucose-based ORS produced significant (20% to 53%) reductions in stool volumes. In one study the duration of diarrhea was shortened by 30%. In noncholera diarrhea in children, cereal-based ORS was as effective as glucose-based ORS. Although the amino acid transport systems were intact in patients with cholera, the addition of glycine to glucose-based or rice-based ORS did not reduce stool volume or duration of diarrhea. The exception was alanine, which reduced stool output and ORS requirements. More research is needed to determine the optimal mix of starch, amino acids, oligopeptides, and proteins that would utilize the absorptive active transport systems maximally to reduce fluid losses and duration of diarrhea. 
5	Effect of a tricyclic antidepressant and opiate antagonist on binge-eating behavior in normoweight bulimic and obese, binge-eating subjects. A subset of the obese population (25-30%) has been reported to engage in binge eating at least twice weekly (bingers) and to exhibit personality traits and food attitudes similar to those of normoweight bulimic women (bulimics). Tricyclic antidepressants and opiate antagonists effectively suppress binge eating in normoweight bulimics. This 8-wk placebo-controlled, double-blind trial investigated the effect of naltrexone and imipramine on 33 obese bingers and 22 bulimics. Naltrexone (100-150 mg/d) produced a significant reduction in binge duration in bulimics (36 +/- 16%, median +/- SIQR; P = 0.02) whereas imipramine significantly reduced binge duration in obese bingers (88 +/- 31%; P = 0.02). A strong placebo effect was observed in obese bingers and, although a reduction in binge frequency occurred with both naltrexone and imipramine, it was not significantly different from the effect in placebo control subjects. We conclude that naltrexone and imipramine may be useful agents in the treatment of binge eating. 
5	Reconstruction of the chronically insufficient anterior cruciate ligament with the central third of the patellar ligament. The results of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with the central third of the patellar ligament as a free, autogenous, non-vascularized graft were retrospectively reviewed at our institution. Eighty reconstructions in seventy-nine patients were evaluated after a minimum of two years. In forty-eight (60 per cent) of the knees, the reconstruction was augmented with an extra-articular lateral sling of iliotibial band. The patients were evaluated with a physical examination, a KT-1000 arthrometer, radiographs, a subjective questionnaire, and a revision of the scale of The Hospital for Special Surgery for rating ligaments. Postoperatively, seventy-six (95 per cent) of the eighty knees no longer gave way, and the pivot-shift test was negative in sixty-seven (84 per cent) of the knees. The average score on the ligament-rating scale was 93 points. All of the patients who had clinical instability at the time of the most recent follow-up had associated ligamentous instability that had not been appreciated or addressed at the time of reconstruction. Arthrometric evaluation revealed that the laxity differed by three millimeters or less from that of the untreated knee in sixty (76 per cent) of the treated knees. In the patient who had bilateral reconstruction, the laxity was the same in both knees. Seventeen patients, who had more than three millimeters of translation, also had additional related ligamentous instability, most commonly posterolateral instability and insufficiency of the medial collateral ligament. We think that major associated ligamentous instability predisposes the reconstruction to failure and should be corrected in conjunction with the reconstruction. 
5	Repeat operation for failure of antireflux procedures. The majority of patients who receive modern antireflux operations obtain substantial long-term relief of their symptoms. About 10% to 15% will have persistent or recurrent problems, some severe enough to warrant reoperation for correction. With careful symptom review, barium study, endoscopy, and manometry, the mechanism of failure becomes evident, and remedial surgical treatment may proceed. The results at reoperation are not as good as those of the primary procedure, which emphasizes the need for proper diagnosis and choice of procedure and for reliable execution of technique at the initial treatment. 
5	Physiological induction and reversal of focus formation and tumorigenicity in NIH 3T3 cells [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Apr 15;88(8):3510] NIH 3T3 cells undergo morphological transformation in response to conditions of constrained growth, such as occur in low serum concentrations or at confluence. Transformation is expressed in a small fraction of the cells by the appearance of discrete foci of multiplying cells on a confluent monolayer of quiescent cells. We isolated and expanded cell populations from three dense and three light foci. Cells from each of these populations efficiently reproduced foci of the same morphotype when grown on a background of nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells. Using cultures derived from one of the dense foci (subline D/2), we found that the number of focus-forming units was stable and the cells remained tumorigenic when they were subjected to repeated thrice-weekly passage in 2% calf serum. However, equivalent passage in 10% calf serum eventually rendered the cells incapable of both focus production and tumor formation. The results show that the capacity to produce tumors as well as morphological transformation are produced as a response to physiological constraints of growth and/or metabolism in the absence of carcinogens and that both properties can be reversed by lifting the constraints. This behavior is typical of an adaptational response and, taken together with other supporting evidence, shows that tumorigenesis does not require conventional genetic alteration. 
3	Visual evoked potential monitoring of optic nerve function during surgery. A study was made with intra-operative flash--visual evoked potentials (VEP) monitored using a fibre-optic/contact lens photo stimulator in 57 patients undergoing intra-orbital surgical procedures with potential risk to the optic nerve. The VEPs recorded under enflurane and nitrous oxide anaesthesia did not differ significantly in latency or amplitude from the pre-operative recordings. Transient abolition of the VEP was seen under many circumstances and did not correlate with the outcome of surgery, but absence of a previously normal VEP for more than four minutes during surgical manipulation within the orbit did show a correlation with post operative impairment of vision. The technique provides early warning to the surgeon of threats to the integrity of the optic nerve. 
1	Cyclosporine in the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. We present our observations on the use of cyclosporine in the treatment of three patients with mycosis fungoides and two patients with Sezary syndrome. The patients with mycosis fungoides showed mild improvement of short duration. One patient with Sezary syndrome had significant improvement during 2 years of treatment. It is unlikely that cyclosporine alone will be sufficient therapy for cutaneous T cell lymphoma. However, lower doses in conjunction with other immunomodulators may minimize potential side effects and lead to longer lasting clinical improvement. 
5	Delayed subcapsular hematoma after percutaneous liver biopsy as a manifestation of warfarin toxicity. Guidelines for the management of patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy who require liver biopsy are not clearly defined. In patients with normal coagulation, liver biopsy is a relatively safe procedure with a morbidity of less than 0.1% and a mortality of less than 0.01%. We report a patient with a prosthetic aortic valve who developed a large subcapsular hematoma 12 days after a percutaneous liver biopsy as a consequence of warfarin toxicity. Based on the experience with this patient, reinstitution of anticoagulant therapy should be avoided for at least 72 h after a percutaneous liver biopsy. Intravenous heparin should be resumed first, and warfarin added if no bleeding has occurred after an additional 48-72 h. The prothrombin time should be maintained at 1.5 times the baseline. 
4	Evaluating oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization with mixed venous oxygen saturation monitoring: a case study approach. Three cases studies are presented to demonstrate clinical application of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) monitoring in critical care nursing practice. Examples of critically ill patients are used to demonstrate how SvO2 monitoring can be used in clinical practice to reflect an imbalance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization. In the first case, the patient had a problem with oxygen delivery. Continuous SvO2 data aided nurses in guiding, adjusting, and assessing therapy. The second case demonstrates how SvO2 monitoring can provide an early sign of a life-threatening complication. The final case is one in which the patient had a problem with oxygen utilization. In all the cases, continuous SvO2 data provided important information about the balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization. 
1	Uptake of 2-deoxy, 2-(18F) fluoro-D-glucose in bladder cancer: animal localization and initial patient positron emission tomography. An orthotopically transplanted, locally metastasizing rat bladder tumor model was developed to evaluate the extent of uptake of fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) in bladder cancer. Significant uptake of FDG in localized bladder tumors in rats was shown, with an average tumor-to-blood ratio of 39 at 2 hours after intravenous FDG administration. Metastases (3 nodal and 1 peritoneal) also showed significant uptake of FDG, with an average metastasis-to-blood ratio of 21.7, and tumor involved-to-normal lymph node ratio of 5.3. Because FDG is excreted in the urine, urinary FDG potentially could prevent the use of FDG/positron emission tomography (FDG/PET) scanning for localized bladder cancer. Bladder lavage successfully reduced the retention of FDG in the normal rat bladder, with an estimated uptake ratio of tumor-to-normal bladder of 13.1 after 5 ml. saline irrigation. Based on these data, we performed an FDG/PET scan of a patient with biopsy proved recurrent intravesical bladder cancer after radiation therapy. Computerized tomography (CT) of the pelvis showed abnormalities consistent with radiation scarring and extravesical tumor. Due to the scarring, the extent of tumor growth could not be determined. The patient also had pulmonary opacities seen on chest radiography. The FDG/PET scan of this patient showed significant extravesical uptake in the pelvis, confirming the abnormality noted on CT. Good images of the clinically apparent metastases in the chest also were obtained. These preliminary data indicate that FDG/PET imaging of bladder cancer is feasible and it may provide new information for the diagnosis and staging of patients with bladder cancer. 
5	Left ventricular passive diastolic properties in chronic mitral regurgitation. BACKGROUND. In chronic mitral regurgitation, the myocardium responds to the increased filling volume by geometric alteration and eccentric hypertrophy. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of a pure volume overload on left ventricular diastolic chamber and myocardial properties and to assess the relation of passive diastolic function to systolic ejection performance. METHODS AND RESULTS. By use of simultaneous cineangiography and left ventricular micromanometry, left ventricular passive diastolic stiffness was evaluated in nine normal controls (group 1), 14 patients with chronic mitral regurgitation and a normal ejection fraction (greater than or equal to 57%, group 2), and 13 patients with mitral regurgitation and a reduced ejection fraction (less than 57%, group 3). Passive diastolic function was evaluated by using a three-constant elastic model. Left ventricular chamber properties were represented by the relation of pressure to volume; myocardial properties were evaluated by relating myocardial midwall stress to midwall strain. The constant of left ventricular chamber stiffness was decreased in group 2 compared with controls (p less than 0.05) but it was normal in group 3. The constant of myocardial stiffness was increased in group 3 compared with groups 1 and 2 (p less than 0.01). Among patients with mitral regurgitation, there was a significant inverse relation between ejection fraction and the constant of myocardial stiffness (r = -0.83). CONCLUSIONS. The chronic adaptation to volume overload in chronic mitral regurgitation tends to decrease left ventricular chamber stiffness. Patients with mitral regurgitation and a depressed ejection fraction demonstrated diastolic myocardial dysfunction. Compromised diastolic function in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation and reduced systolic performance may contribute to the clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure. 
1	Malignant potential of juvenile polyposis coli. Report of a case and review of the literature. Juvenile polyps of the colon and rectum traditionally have been viewed as being benign inflammatory or harmartomatous lesions without potential for malignant change. The authors report a case of adenocarcinoma developing in a patient with sporadic juvenile polyposis. Juvenile polyposis was diagnosed in the patient at age 4 years. He underwent subtotal colectomy at age 6 years. At age 12, he underwent a proctectomy and a Swenson pull-through because of adenomatous changes in the rectal stump. At age 19 surveillance endoscopy revealed invasive cancer in a juvenile polyp. 
4	Urticaria: current therapy. Although the ideal treatment for urticaria is identification and removal of its cause, no underlying cause can be discerned in the majority of instances. The chief clinical problem is the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria. H1-receptor antagonists are the major class of therapeutic agents used in the management of chronic idiopathic urticaria. The H1 antagonists have been divided into subgroups based on their chemical structure. The second-generation H1 antagonists now available are particularly advantageous for individuals who must remain alert while working. Terbutaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, is of occasional benefit as an adjunct therapy in combination with an H1 antagonist. The oral administration of disodium cromoglycate is ineffective in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, although a few individuals with urticaria caused by food allergy may respond to this drug. It is best to avoid repeated injections of epinephrine and the systemic administration of corticosteroids. Urticaria has a capricious course: it may respond to the administration of placebos or it may resolve spontaneously. About 50% of the patients with urticaria are free of lesions within 1 year, but 20% continue to have episodes for more than 20 years. 
1	Locally recurrent parathyroid neoplasms as a cause for recurrent and persistent primary hyperparathyroidism. Between 1982 and 1989, 145 patients underwent operations for persistent or recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT). At re-exploration, 15 patients (10.3%) were found to have locally recurrent parathyroid tumors (11 patients with adenoma and 4 with carcinoma). These 15 patients had 28 previous operations at outside institutions for HPT. Patients with locally recurrent HPT secondary to adenoma had a longer disease-free interval than patients with locally recurrent carcinoma. At the time of evaluation at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for recurrent or persistent HPT, each patient was symptomatic and patients with carcinoma had significantly more symptoms and higher serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone than patients with adenoma. Locally recurrent parathyroid neoplasm was correctly localized by preoperative testing in 14 of 15 patients. These 15 patients underwent 18 reoperations at NIH for excision of locally recurrent parathyroid tumors. Following the final reoperation (two patients had more than one procedure), each patient had normal serum levels of calcium. In addition each patient remains biochemically cured (based on normal serum calcium level), with a median follow-up interval of 21 months. Local recurrence of parathyroid adenoma comprises a small but significant proportion of cases of recurrent or persistent HPT and can be indistinguishable from parathyroid carcinoma. Findings suggestive of carcinoma include shorter disease-free interval, higher serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone, and histologic appearance. Whether the locally recurrent parathyroid neoplasm is benign or malignant, aggressive surgery can control serum levels of calcium in these patients with acceptable rates of morbidity.
