2	Perforated duodenal ulcer: an unusual complication of gastroenteritis. A 7 year old boy was admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis, which was complicated by an acute perforated duodenal ulcer. After oversewing of the perforation he made an uncomplicated recovery. Peptic ulceration is under-diagnosed in childhood and this leads to delay in diagnosis and appropriate management. Ulceration is associated with severe illness and viral infections, but perforation is rare. 
2	Yersinia enterocolitica abscess of the transverse colon. Report of a case. Yersinia enterocolitica abscess of the bowel is a rare entity. Only five cases have previously been reported--none in the surgical literature. A unique presentation for Yersinia infection, abscess of the transverse colon, is described, and the literature of Y. enterocolitica intestinal perforation and abscess is reviewed. 
4	Prognostic significance of valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis. PURPOSE: Doppler ultrasound is a sensitive modality for detecting and quantitating valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis. Because valvular regurgitation leads to heart failure, we evaluated the prognostic significance of Doppler-detected valvular regurgitation in patients with endocarditis who had not yet developed clinical heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 65 patients with a clinical diagnosis of infective endocarditis from May 1985 to March 1990. A total of 49 patients were included in the study: 33 patients with native valve endocarditis and 16 patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. The initial Doppler echocardiogram was examined in these patients to determine the presence and degree of valvular regurgitation. RESULTS: Significant (moderate to severe) valvular regurgitation was detected in 23 (47%) patients. The presence or absence of significant valvular regurgitation did not predict the development of congestive heart failure, the need for surgery, or death (p = NS). The development of congestive heart failure was significantly associated with the need for surgery (p less than 0.0001) and death (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the detection of significant valvular regurgitation in patients with infective endocarditis who have not yet developed heart failure is not predictive of future complications nor does the absence of significant valvular regurgitation identify a group of patients with a more favorable prognosis. In our series, patients who developed congestive heart failure had a significantly higher incidence of surgery and death. Therefore, decisions regarding clinical management in patients with infective endocarditis should not be made solely on the presence or absence of echocardiographically detected valvular regurgitation. 
5	Is emotional disturbance a precipitator or a consequence of chronic pain? The present study examined the relationship between psychological factors and pain in order to assess the contribution of emotional disturbance to the perpetuation of pain. A group of 163 chronic pain suffers in multiple settings was compared with 81 control subjects on measures of personal history antecedent to pain onset, as well as on measures of current emotional disturbance. In addition, these psychological variables were examined for their associations with subjectively rated pain intensity. Overall, pain was found to be related to more current depression and less current life satisfaction, but was not associated with most of the personal history variables examined. These results suggests that emotional disturbance in pain patients is more likely to be a consequence than a cause of chronic pain. The dangers of routinely ascribing intractable pain to psychological causation are discussed in the light of these findings. 
1	Significance of positive margins in oral cavity squamous carcinoma. Three hundred ninety-eight consecutive, previously untreated patients undergoing surgery for epidermoid carcinoma of the oral cavity from 1979 to 1983 were reviewed. One hundred twenty-nine patients were classified as having positive surgical margins. Of these, 83 patients had tumor within 0.5 mm of the surgical margin, 9 had premalignant changes at the margin, 9 had in situ carcinoma at the margin, and 28 had invasive cancer at the margin. The remaining 269 patients had uninvolved margins. The significance of positive margins relating to survival, subsequent clinical course, local recurrence, and patterns of treatment failure was examined, along with the impact of adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy on positive margins. The percentage of patients having positive margins progressively increased with increasing T stage: 21% in T1 versus 55% in T4 primary cancer. The overall 5-year survival for patients with negative margins was 60%. For patients with positive margins, 5-year survival was 52%. This difference was statistically significant. The incidence of local recurrence in patients having positive surgical margins was twice as much as in those with negative margins (36% versus 18%). Metastasis rates in the neck and at distant sites were not significantly influenced by the status of the surgical margin. Of the 129 patients with positive margins, 49 received postoperative radiotherapy. In those patients so treated, a trend toward lower recurrence rates was noted. Differences were not statistically significant. This retrospective review confirms the importance of adequate resection of the primary tumor as well as the relative ineffectiveness of adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy in the improvement of local control in patients with positive surgical margins. 
5	Transpalpebral decompression of endocrine ophthalmopathy (Graves' disease) by removal of intraorbital fat: experience with 147 operations over 5 years. From 1984 to October 1989 at the Plastic Surgery Unit in Wesseling, we carried out 147 operations on 75 patients with Graves' disease. Intraorbital fat was removed through a transpalpebral incision to achieve decompression. The average amount of fat was 6.0 cm3. We have made a long-term follow-up (more than 6 months postoperatively) study of 57 patients who experienced 108 operations. The first results were published in September 1988. When we compared the results to a traditional decompression operation (with resection of one or two orbital walls), we found that the postoperative complication rate was significantly lower and that the success rate was much higher. Thus the range of indications for surgery may be much wider than previously considered. Patients who are about to lose their vision as well as those experiencing lesser symptoms can be much improved with this operation. At the beginning, before the technique was fully developed, complications such as supraorbital nerve palsy occurred. 
3	Dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity in cerebrospinal fluid of idiopathic torsion dystonia. Since a postmortem biochemical study and a genetic linkage study of idiopathic torsion dystonia suggested possible involvement of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), we determined CSF DBH activities of Jewish and non-Jewish patients with childhood-onset idiopathic torsion dystonia and found no differences from a control population. 
4	Autonomic nervous system and coronary blood flow changes related to emotional activation and sleep. Experimental models have been developed to investigate the influences of anger, fear, and sleep on coronary blood flow. Studies of anger in dogs with coronary stenosis indicate that the postarousal phase is particularly conducive to myocardial ischemia. Specifically, a delayed coronary vasoconstrictor response has been observed within 1-3 minutes after cessation of behavioral arousal. The response is prevented by bilateral stellectomy and can be elicited in anesthetized animals by electrical stimulation of the right or left stellate ganglion. The latter effect is averted by alpha-adrenergic blockade with prazosin. Although the basis for the protracted nature of the delayed vasoconstriction remains to be clarified, the current hypothesis is that the phenomenon results from a time-dependent imbalance between the vasoconstrictor effects of adrenergic input and the vasodilator influences of coronary pressure and/or cardiac metabolic activity. A behavioral model emulating the fear state has also been developed. When dogs that fail to exhibit anger are placed in a food-access confrontation protocol, the animals demonstrate a fearlike state evidenced by a cowering posture and somatic tremor. There is a distinct plasma catecholamine profile that is characterized by a predominant increase in epinephrine compared with norepinephrine. This is in contrast to the pattern observed during anger, in which a prevalent increase in norepinephrine is observed. Fear results in significant increases in heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and coronary arterial flow. Sleep is also associated with substantial alterations in coronary hemodynamic function. 
5	Fungal pulmonary infections after bone marrow transplantation: evaluation with radiography and CT. The authors reviewed 55 pairs of chest radiographs and computed tomographic (CT) studies obtained in 33 febrile bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The images were read separately, without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis. Twenty-one episodes of fungal infection were documented. One chest radiograph showed a pneumonia-like opacity, and 17 showed nodular opacities, five with cavitation. In 20 of 21 episodes, CT showed nodules with cavitation (n = 7), halo (n = 4), hazy margin (n = 5), air bronchogram (n = 2), cluster of fluffy nodules (n = 1), or sharp margin (n = 1). In none of the nine bacteremic episodes, however, were there opacities on chest radiographs or CT studies. CT studies demonstrating complicated nodules in febrile BMT patients strongly suggest a fungal infection, whereas negative CT studies suggest bacteremia or non-filamentous fungal infection of nonpulmonary origin. CT appears to add useful information to radiographic analysis during the assessment of febrile episodes in BMT patients, especially when invasive diagnostic procedures pose a high risk. 
5	Percutaneous support devices for high risk or complicated coronary angioplasty. Indications for coronary angioplasty have expanded to include patients with unstable acute ischemic syndromes, severe multivessel coronary artery disease and impaired left ventricular function. Several mechanical approaches have been developed as adjuncts to high risk coronary angioplasty to improve patient tolerance of coronary balloon occlusion and maintain hemodynamic stability in the event of complications. These percutaneous techniques include intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, anterograde transcatheter coronary perfusion, coronary sinus retroperfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, Hemopump left ventricular assistance and partial left heart bypass. The intraaortic balloon pump provides hemodynamic support and ameliorates ischemia by decreasing myocardial work; it may be inserted for periprocedural complications or before angioplasty in patients with ischemia or hypotension. Anterograde distal coronary artery perfusion may be accomplished passively through an autoperfusion catheter or by active pumping of oxygenated blood or fluorocarbons through the central lumen of an angioplasty catheter. Synchronized coronary sinus retroperfusion produces pulsatile blood flow via the cardiac veins to the coronary bed distal to a stenosis. Both perfusion techniques limit development of ischemic chest pain and myocardial dysfunction in patients undergoing prolonged balloon inflations. Percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass provides complete systemic hemodynamic support which is independent of intrinsic cardiac function or rhythm and has been employed prophylactically in very high risk patients before coronary angioplasty or emergently for abrupt closure. These and newer support devices, while associated with significant complications, may ultimately improve the safety of coronary angioplasty and allow its application to those who would otherwise not be candidates for revascularization. 
5	Recurrent acute fatty liver of pregnancy associated with a fatty-acid oxidation defect in the offspring. A case of a 29-year-old woman who has had two episodes both clinically and biochemically consistent with acute fatty liver of pregnancy is described. These episodes occurred in two successive pregnancies, and liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis in the second pregnancy. Both pregnancies were managed by prompt fetal delivery; on both occasions this led to a complete biochemical resolution of the liver function abnormalities. Two healthy babies were delivered by ceasarian sections. This case is of particular importance because a rapidly progressive and devastating illness developed in both infants, leading to death at 6 1/2 and 6 months, respectively. The illness in both babies was characterized by wide-spread fatty infiltration of several vital organs and a failure of any treatment to influence the outcome of that illness. Studies suggested that the illness in the children was caused by a still ill-defined disorder of fatty acid oxidation. The biochemical disorder evidenced in this family is discussed, in an attempt to shed light on the etiology of acute fatty liver of pregnancy. 
5	Chronic diarrhea in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia: a manifestation of visceral vasculitis? Gastrointestinal involvement occurs frequently in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, and most often involves the liver and spleen. Intestinal involvement is much less common and is generally felt to be a late and often catastrophic manifestation of the disease due to severe vasculitis. Occasionally, the disorder mimics inflammatory bowel disease, both clinically and radiographically. We recently cared for a patient with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia who developed persistent diarrhea. Endoscopic evaluation revealed scattered petechial lesions in the duodenum and colon as well as prominent lymphoid hyperplasia in the terminal ileum. Mucosal biopsies disclosed the presence of diffuse inflammation. We suggest that this patient's diarrhea was due to intestinal vasculitis and that prominent ileal lymphoid hyperplasia may be a manifestation of essential mixed cryoglobulinemia. 
5	CR leads in cardiac emergencies. A preliminary study. The purpose of this study was to find a set of simplified electrocardiographic (ECG) leads that would be useful in cardiac emergencies. In 27 ambulatory cardiac patients and in 15 patients admitted to the hospital, we found that ECG records obtained with six bipolar CR leads were, in most respects, similar to records obtained previously in the same patients with six V leads. Records obtained with two abdominal-upper extremity leads, tested as possible alternatives to limb leads 2 and 3, were quite similar to records obtained with leads 2 and 3 in patients with an inferior wall infarction. Records obtained with leads CR7, CR8, and CR9 in a patient with a posterior wall infarction revealed a QS pattern that was not seen in the conventional 12-lead hospital record. In patients with anterolateral and inferior myocardial infarctions and in patients with unstable angina, the diagnostic patterns recorded with 11 bipolar leads described in this report were identical to patterns recorded with 12-lead ECGs. Although a larger number of observations, including patients with arrhythmias, would be required to reach a definitive conclusion, our results provide preliminary evidence that cardiac potentials may be adequately analyzed by using only two electrodes, using CR and abdominal leads, in succession. The technique described in this report, in which the reference electrode is attached to the right arm, and the exploring electrode is moved successively over nine preselected chest sites and over the umbilicus, can be completed in less than 3 minutes in a given patient, and provides records that are comparable to those obtained with the conventional 12-lead system. 
4	Sudden death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with normal left ventricular mass An active, healthy, and symptom free 16 year old boy with a family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy died suddenly while walking home from school. Necropsy showed absence of left ventricular hypertrophy (that is, normal heart weight), though the characteristic histological abnormalities of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, such as cardiac muscle cell disorganisation and abnormal intramural coronary arteries, were present. It is likely that this patient had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and died before left ventricular hypertrophy developed. 
2	Development of acute myelocytic leukemia in patients with Crohn's disease. In our hospital within one year two patients with Crohn's disease were seen who developed an acute myelocytic leukemia. A review of the literature reveals eight previously reported patients with both Crohn's disease and leukemia. Six of the reported 10 patients have had acute myelocytic leukemia and, interestingly, three of them, including our two patients, have shown monocytic differentiation (FAB type M4). It has been suggested that the relative risk of leukemia, especially acute myelocytic leukemia, is increased in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. More data of patients with Crohn's disease and acute leukemia are needed to evaluate the possible association between these diseases. 
5	Sudden death during empiric amiodarone therapy in symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Amiodarone is reported to improve symptoms and to prevent sudden death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). Amiodarone treatment (loading dose 30 g given over 6 weeks; maintenance dose 400 mg/day) was prospectively evaluated in 50 patients with HC in whom the drug was initiated because of symptoms refractory to conventional drug therapy (calcium antagonists and beta blockers). Twenty-one (42%) patients had ventricular tachycardia (VT) during Holter monitoring. Amiodarone significantly and often markedly improved the patients' New York Heart Association functional class status (from 3.3 to 2.7 at 2 months, p less than 0.001) and treadmill exercise duration (p less than 0.001). Eight patients, however, died (7 suddenly) during a mean follow-up period of 2.2 +/- 1.8 years. Of the 7 sudden deaths, 6 occurred within 5 months of initiation of treatment. The 6-month and 1- and 2-year survival rates were 87, 85 and 80%, respectively. The survival rate of patients with VT was significantly worse than that of patients without VT (61 vs 97% at 2 years; p less than 0.01). Sudden death occurred despite abolition of VT on Holter monitoring. Amiodarone increased left ventricular peak filling rate by radionuclide angiography in 20 of 33 patients (61%) (p less than 0.01). Decrease in peak left ventricular filling rate within 10 days of amiodarone therapy (8 of 33 patients) was associated with subsequent sudden death (p less than 0.04). 
5	Clinical significance of white cell antibodies in febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions. Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs) are associated with white cell (WBC) antibodies. The purposes of this study were to determine the frequency of WBC antibodies, to associate the severity of reactions with antibody specificity, and to distinguish FNHTRs from infection and postoperative fever. By using the granulocyte indirect immunofluorescence test in conjunction with lymphocytotoxicity testing, it was found that 70 percent of FNHTRs in 24 patients involved WBC antibodies. The remaining 30 percent of apparent FNHTRs were associated with infections and postoperative fever. Granulocyte-specific antibodies were as prevalent as HLA antibodies and were associated with the severest reactions. Because FNHTRs occur with granulocyte-specific antibodies, HLA antibodies, and possible monocyte-specific antibodies (untested in this and other studies), these reactions could be grouped together as WBC-associated reactions. 
2	Pancreatic cancer versus chronic pancreatitis: diagnosis with CA 19-9 assessment, US, CT, and CT-guided fine-needle biopsy. The authors prospectively performed serum CA 19-9 assessment, ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the pancreas in 81 consecutive patients with suspected chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic neoplasm. The final diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 54 patients and chronic pancreatitis in 27 patients. CA 19-9 assessment, US, CT, and FNAB were considered nondiagnostic, respectively, in 0%, 25%, 19%, and 6% of cases. When a definite diagnosis was rendered, the positive predictive value was 90% for CA 19-9 assessment, 95% for US, 98% for CT, and 100% for FNAB; the negative predictive value was, respectively, 69%, 95%, 86%, and 100%. The accuracy of all diagnostic and nondiagnostic studies was 81% for CA 19-9 assessment, 72% for US, 77% for CT, and 94% for FNAB. It is concluded that CT-guided pancreatic FNAB is the most reliable examination for enabling differential diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. When the pancreas is well visualized at US, the negative predictive value for pancreatic cancer is more accurate than that of CA 19-9 assessment and CT. 
1	Incidence of hairy cell leukemia, mycosis fungoides, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in first known HTLV-II-endemic population. Unlike human T cell leukemia-lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I), HTLV-II has not been convincingly linked to a malignancy. In the first 10 months of serologic screening for HTLV-I/II among blood donors in New Mexico in 1988-1989, HTLV-I/II infection was found in 27 donors. HTLV-I/II infection was present in 1.0%-1.6% of American Indian and 0.16%-0.27% of Hispanic donors compared with 0.009%-0.06% of non-Hispanic white donors. HTLV-II was identified by DNA amplification in 12 of 13 samples from Indian and Hispanic seropositive donors. Despite apparent endemic HTLV-II infection in these populations, New Mexico Tumor Registry data showed that the incidences of hairy cell leukemia, mycosis fungoides, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were comparable among the three ethnic groups. A population with endemic HTLV-II infection has been identified, and there is no evidence of increased risk for these three malignancies in the endemic groups. 
4	Jets over Labrador and Quebec: noise effects on human health. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the noise from low-level flights over Labrador and Quebec is harmful to human health. DATA SOURCE AND SELECTION: Search of MEDLINE for articles on the effect of noise, particularly impulse noise associated with low-level flights, and a search of the references from identified articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: The noise levels from low-level flights could affect hearing acuity. However, the more important consequences appear to be stress-mediated physiologic effects, especially cardiovascular ones, and psychologic distress, particularly in children. Subjective perception of control over the noise has been found to mitigate some physiologic effects. CONCLUSION: There is sufficient evidence to show that the noise from low-level flights is harmful to human health. 
3	Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Both the afferent visual pathways and ocular motor system may be affected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Coexisting infections and neoplastic processes in the eye and brain create a diagnostic challenge for the clinician. This article discusses neuroophthalmic manifestations associated with HIV and AIDS, with emphasis on clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment. 
4	The evaluation of the abdominal aorta: a "how-to" for cardiac sonographers. A thorough evaluation of the abdominal aorta can be readily achieved by use of the standard views of the echocardiographic examination. The ultrasound evaluation of the abdominal aorta represents a logical extension of the standard echocardiographic examination of the adult patient. This article provides the information needed to carry out a complete ultrasound examination of the abdominal aorta including the anatomy, the vascular disease, and the steps involved in accomplishing the ultrasound examination of the abdominal aorta. 
2	Clinical features of adenovirus enteritis: a review of 127 cases. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features of 127 hospitalized pediatric patients whose fecal samples were positive for adenovirus (Ad) by electron microscopy during an 18-month period. Serotyping results obtained by microneutralization tests and restriction endonuclease analysis were available for 105 of 127 cases. There were 69 males and 58 females and 94% of patients were less than 4 years of age. The average body temperature was 38 degrees C rectal (range, 36.2-40.8 degrees C) with an average duration of fever of 1.6 days. The average duration of clinical illness was 8.8 days (range, 1 to 32 days). Although Ad 40 and Ad 41 were isolated in the majority of cases (59 of 105 (56%], Ad 31 was associated with 18 of 105 cases (17%). Of the 18 cases associated with Ad 31, 14 were nosocomial and associated with diarrhea. Our survey confirms the importance of fastidious enteric Ad in infantile diarrhea (Ad 40, Ad 41) and suggests that Ad 31 produces a clinical syndrome indistinguishable from that caused by Ad 40 and Ad 41. The occurrence of Ad enteritis in patients admitted for unrelated illnesses well after initial hospitalization suggests that Ad is also an important cause of nosocomial enteritis in our hospital. 
3	The induction dose of propofol in infants 1-6 months of age and in children 10-16 years of age. The propofol dose needed for satisfactory induction of anesthesia was determined in 22 infants 1-6 months of age and 22 children 10-16 yr of age. A single bolus of propofol was given over 10 s. Thirty seconds after injection the lid reflex was tested and the anesthesia mask was applied. The patient was considered to be asleep if there were no gross movements during the next 30 s while the patient breathed O2. The dose required for satisfactory induction in 50% of patients (ED50) (+/- SE) was 3.0 +/- 0.2 mg/kg in infants and 2.4 +/- 0.1 mg/kg in older children (P less than 0.02). Pain on injection occurred in 50% of the infants and 18% of the children. 
5	Metabolic bone disease in lumbar pseudarthrosis. Pseudarthrosis occurs in many patients who undergo lumbar spine fusion and it has been suggested that abnormalities of bone metabolism contribute to it. The authors evaluated 47 patients with pseudarthrosis for metabolic bone disease. Symptomatic patients with pseudarthrosis underwent metabolic bone evaluation. Abnormal results of laboratory tests were found in 7 patients (14.9%): 3 low or borderline 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3, 2 elevated 24-hour urine calcium, and 2 low serum testosterone. None of these abnormalities correlated with other clinical findings. Bone density was low in 14 of 24 patients in whom it was measured. Low values did not correlate with smoking or abnormal laboratory values. Metabolic bone abnormalities do not appear to play a frequent or significant role in pseudarthrosis after attempted lumbar spine fusion. 
2	Severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage in Crohn's disease. Twenty-one of fifteen hundred twenty-six patients with Crohn's disease (CD) treated at The Mount Sinai Hospital between 1960 and 1986 developed severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage. There were 26 separate episodes of severe hemorrhage: 17 patients bled only once, three bled twice and one bled three times. The frequency of bleeding was significantly higher among patients with colonic involvement (17 of 929; 1.9%) than among those with small bowel disease alone (4 of 597; 0.7%) (p less than 0.001). Twelve patients required surgery on 13 occasions, which involved colon resection in all but one case. Eleven of these patients underwent surgery during their first hemorrhagic episodes, and 1 of 11 had a second operation for recurrent bleeding; the 12th patient, whose first hemorrhage had been treated medically, had surgery during a repeated episode of hemorrhage. The precise bleeding points could be located in only 2 of the 26 bleeding episodes, both at the ileocecal area. Three patients died, of whom two had not undergone surgery when they had bled a few weeks earlier. Primary bleeding episodes subsided without surgery in 10 of 21 cases, but 3 of these 10 patients (30%) rebled massively. By contrast primary excisional surgery was followed by recurrent hemorrhage in only 1 of 11 cases (9%). These differences in mortality and in recurrent bleeding rates, although not statistically significant, seem to favor removal of diseased bowel at the time of the first episode of massive hemorrhage. 
4	Unusual haemostasis for an unusual tumour. Catastrophic bleeding from a tactile neurofibroma affecting the thoracic vertebrae. Case report. The symptomatology of a typical acute descending thoracic aorta dissection was imitated by profuse haemorrhage caused by a benign tumour composed almost exclusively of Wagner-Meissner like tactile corpuscles and fatty tissue. The tumour caused extensive destruction of the bodies of the fifth and sixth thoracic vertebrae at the level of the vertebro-costal articulation. Emergency cross clamping of the descending aorta and haemostasis of the bleeding from osteal defects by tamponade with bone polymethyl methacrylate appeared the only way to control the life threatening haemorrhage. It seems that an intrathoracic tactile neurofibroma with a similar case history has not been reported till now. 
3	Post-traumatic intracerebral pneumatocele: case report. Pneumocephalus occurs in 0.5 to 1.0% of head trauma, but may also occur after neurologic surgery, or as a result of eroding infection or neoplasm. The pathophysiology involves the presence of craniodural fistula allowing ingress of air. A ball-valve mechanism may allow air to enter but not exit the cranium, or CSF leak permits air entrance as fluid leaves the intracranial space. While a "succession splash" is considered diagnostic of pneumocephalus, most patients have nonspecific signs and symptoms such as headache. Therefore, a high index of suspicion in a patient with recent head trauma is necessary. The diagnosis is made radiographically by CT scan. This is generally performed to rule out intracranial hematoma or cerebral contusion in head trauma, but will reveal even very small quantities of air to the unsuspecting physician. Therapy is often noninvasive, allowing the craniodural defect to heal spontaneously. Selected situations require immediate operative repair of the fistula. 
1	Fluorescent cytochemical detection of estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast fine-needle aspirates. Estrogen and progesterone receptors were studied in fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimens of 56 patients with primary, recurrent, or metastatic breast carcinoma. The ligands, 17 B-estradiol-6-carboxymethyloxine-bovine serum albumin fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-BSA estradiol) and hydroxyprogesterone hemisuccinate bovine serum albumin tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TMRITC-BSA progesterone), were used in the fluorescent cytochemical method. The findings obtained from the aspirated cells with the use of the fluorescent cytochemical technique were compared with results obtained from the cell population of the same tumor after removal with the use of both the fluorescent cytochemical technique and the biochemical dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) assay. For the needle aspirates, there was 89% concordance for estrogen receptor and 86% concordance for progesterone receptor between biochemical and cytochemical results. A high degree of correlation was also demonstrated between fine-needle aspirates and imprint preparations with the use of the cytochemical technique. This study suggests that the fluorescent cytochemical technique is an effective tool in assessment of estrogen and progesterone receptor content in fine-needle aspirates of primary and metastatic breast cancer. The fluorescent cytochemical technique can be performed easily at community hospitals and is well suited for specimens of insufficient size for biochemical assay. 
2	Gastroesophageal reflux and sclerotherapy strictures. The development of esophageal stricture is common following endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS). Gastroesophageal reflux may be at least partly responsible. Twelve randomly selected male patients underwent chronic EVS for the management of bleeding esophageal varices. Six patients developed strictures during or after EVS, six did not. There were no significant differences between stricture and nonstricture patients during 24 hour esophageal pH monitoring. Three of the six stricture patients and four of the six nonstricture patients had an abnormal amount of reflux. Gastroesophageal reflux occurs frequently in patients undergoing EVS, and it is not likely to play a major role in EVS stricture formation. 
4	Coronary artery fistula formation secondary to permanent pacemaker placement. We present the findings in two patients who apparently developed a coronary artery fistula as a complication of an endocardial pacing electrode. This complication may actually be occurring more frequently than recognized because the patient may be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and therefore not undergo a coronary angiogram. Awareness of this potentially serious complication is important and stresses the need for proper electrode placement without excess pressure on the tip. 
3	Eosinophilic meningitis: cause of a chronic pain syndrome. Three tourists developed eosinophilic meningitis after visiting the Fijian Islands. Two had a severe and long lasting illness with chronic intractable pain. In one patient electrophysiological studies and MRI scan of the brain were abnormal and provided evidence of both radicular and cerebral parenchymal involvement by the most likely causative agent, Angiostrongylus cantonensis. 
5	Intraoperative protection of cranial nerves and perforating arteries by silicone rubber sheets. Technical note. The authors describe a technique whereby, during microneurosurgery, vital structures are covered or wrapped with small pieces of silicone rubber sheeting to protect them from intraoperative injury. In this way, perforating arteries located behind a large aneurysm can be covered to avoid their inclusion within the blades of the clip, and the cranial nerves coursing around or through a tumor can be wrapped to protect them from injury by a suction or forceps. By insulating nerves and arteries, this silicone rubber sheet has the added advantage of protecting them from injury due to electrical current of bipolar forceps. The silicone rubber sheet described here is smoother, thinner, and lighter than a cotton pattie. 
5	Aggravation of human and experimental myasthenia gravis by contrast media. After observing a 72-year-old myasthenic patient develop an acute myasthenic exacerbation following the administration of routine diagnostic IV contrast material, an observation rarely described in the literature, we used the experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis model in rabbits injected with a contrast agent to simulate the situation. There was significant worsening of the decremental response to 3 Hz repetitive nerve stimulation from 40 +/- 29% to 55 +/- 27% following the IV administration of contrast agent at doses similar to those used in humans. IV calcium partially reversed this aggravation. Caution is merited when myasthenic patients are administered contrast media. 
5	Sciatic nerve monitoring during revision total hip arthroplasty. This study presents a simple method of intraoperative sciatic nerve monitoring during revision total hip arthroplasty (THA), utilizing intraoperative, somatosensory evoked potentials. Using this method, the sciatic nerve was protected when surgical correction of shortened limb length was necessary during revision THA. Twenty-three revision THAs were performed using intraoperative sciatic nerve monitoring. No postoperative peripheral nerve complications occurred, with an average increase of 18 mm in leg length, ranging from 6 mm to 43 mm. 
1	Current strategies in the management of locoregional and metastatic gastric carcinoma. Gastric carcinoma remains a significant cause of death worldwide. A patient's prognosis depends on the degree of gastric wall penetration, presence of lymph node metastases, and location of the primary site. Metastatic gastric carcinoma is currently incurable. However, chemotherapy continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Active agents include 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin, cisplatin, methotrexate, mitomycin, and etoposide. Combination etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (EAP) has been reported to result in encouragingly high response rates, including a 10% complete response rate in patients with metastatic gastric carcinoma. Trials are now under way to confirm these results. Similarly, another etoposide-based combination, etoposide, leucovorin, and 5-FU (ELF), has resulted in an equally good response rate but less toxicity than EAP. The 5-FU, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (FAMTX) regimen, previously reported to have an excellent response rate, is also being investigated further. For patients with locoregional carcinoma, curative resection rate is often unsatisfactorily low; however, curative resection is consistently associated with improved survival (between 23 and 26 months). In patients with potentially resectable carcinoma, two significant problems must be recognized: (1) a low rate of curative resection and (2) the development of widespread carcinoma despite curative resection. Despite many attempts, the postoperative strategies of adjuvant chemotherapy have been ineffective. New strategies must be investigated aggressively. Combination etoposide, 5-FU, and cisplatin (EFP) has been administered preoperatively and postoperatively to patients with resectable gastric carcinoma, resulting in an encouraging curative resection rate (greater than 70%) and manageable toxicity. Based on promising results reported with EAP in patients with unresectable locoregional carcinoma of the stomach, a trial of preoperative and postoperative EAP in potentially resectable carcinoma of the stomach is now under way. 
5	Usefulness of labetalol in chronic atrial fibrillation. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are useful in controlling excessive ventricular rate in chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) but often reduce exercise capacity. To investigate the advantage of labetalol--a unique beta blocker with alpha-blocking property--in chronic AF, 10 patients without underlying structural heart disease were studied with treadmill test, 12-minute walk and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Patients were randomized and crossed over to receive 4 phases of treatment (placebo, digoxin, digoxin with half-dose labetalol, and full-dose labetalol). Exercise durations were 14.1 +/- 1.5, 14.2 +/- 1.5, 16.1 +/- 1.1 and 15.6 +/- 1.1 minutes, respectively, indicating that labetalol did not reduce exercise tolerance. Although digoxin had no advantage over placebo in controlling maximal heart rate (177 +/- 2 vs 175 +/- 3 beats/min), labetalol, both as monotherapy or as an adjunct to digoxin, was advantageous (156 +/- 4 vs 177 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.01, and 154 +/- 4 vs 177 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.01, respectively). The rate-pressure product was consistently lowered by labetalol at rest and during exercise. At peak exercise, the addition of labetalol to digoxin reduced the maximal rate-pressure product achieved from 30,900 +/- 1300 to 24,100 +/- 2,000 mm Hg/min (p less than 0.01) and the maximal rate-pressure product was lowest with full-dose labetalol (22,300 +/- 1,600 mm Hg/min). During submaximal exercise on treadmill or during the 12-minute walk, the combination of labetalol and digoxin produced the best heart rate control, whereas labetalol monotherapy was comparable to digoxin therapy. 
5	Retrograde nephrostolithotomy in management of complex renal calculi. From October 1986 to July 1990 we evaluated 22 patients with complex renal calculi in 25 kidneys for initial therapy using retrograde percutaneous nephrostolithotomy. In 3 patients we could not attain renal access in a retrograde fashion. In the remaining patients residual fragments after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy were treated with a combination of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), chemolysis and retrieval of small calculi with a flexible nephroscope. Successful treatments were achieved in 6 of the 22 kidneys (27%) using percutaneous nephrostolithotomy alone and in 17 (77%) using all modalities. Retrograde and antegrade percutaneous nephrostolithotomy in conjunction with ESWL, chemolysis and flexible nephroscopy in the treatment of patients with complex calculi yield comparable success rates. However, retrograde percutaneous nephrostolithotomy can be performed without the aid of an interventional radiologist and it provides easy access to the nondilated collecting system. 
4	Human atherosclerotic coronary artery xenografts: a model for investigation of transluminal recanalization. A model for testing transluminal recanalization techniques was developed. Fragments of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries were transplanted into carotid arteries of dogs and evaluated by angiographic, angioscopic, and histologic study within a three-month period. An inflammatory response was most intense within the first week. By two weeks no inflammation was noted. Total occlusion (n = 13) and stenosis (n = 11) of the carotid arteries were achieved without complications. The model is easy to produce within a short period and the arterial occlusion resembles human vascular disease. This model has been used to evaluate laser recanalization of vascular obstructions. 
5	Lovastatin. Warfarin interaction. Two patients who developed hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding due to lovastatin-warfarin drug interaction are described. Because of the wider use of lovastatin and warfarin, heightened clinical awareness of this potentially serious interaction must be publicized. Therefore, prothrombin time should be monitored diligently when warfarin is prescribed to patients receiving lovastatin. 
5	Carbamazepine maintenance treatment in outpatient schizophrenics. A double-blind crossover trial was used to evaluate carbamazepine as the sole maintenance treatment of chronic, nonmanic schizophrenic outpatients whose conditions had been stabilized with the use of neuroleptics prior to study. Criteria of treatment effectiveness included the number of patients relapsing and time to relapse over a 95-day neuroleptic-free period during which either carbamazepine or placebo was administered. Relapse was determined by the concordance of psychiatric ratings and independent clinical judgements indicating significant worsening. Results for 27 patients (13 receiving carbamazepine and 14 receiving placebo) involved in the first phase of this treatment comparison were nondifferentiating. Corroborating descriptive findings in the second phase were available for 14 of these patients. There was no evidence supporting the existence of a treatment-relevant subgroup defined by episodic dyscontrol phenomena. 
1	The role of interleukin-2 in cancer immunotherapy. The arena of cellular immunotherapy is an emerging field of study. The field has strong foundations in numerous animal tumor models, which provide avenues of research for refinements in human immunotherapy. Experience from a number of research centers can be generalized: LAK cell trials in humans have demonstrated that PBMCs activated with IL-2 possess reproducible antitumor activity in vitro. Exogenous IL-2 administration to patients is required to maintain the biologic activity of the activated cells, although the requirement for LAK cells in tumors like melanoma is not clear-cut. Overall, the response rate to immunotherapy in humans is approximately 30%. The toxicity of immunotherapy, which is related to the dose of systemic IL-2, can be significantly reduced. The next generation of trials of cellular immunotherapy in humans will use TILs. Murine experiments indicate that this population of cells is more powerful and potentially more specific for tumor than LAK cells. Like LAK cells, TILs also require exogenous IL-2 for optimum performance in vivo. The difficulty in reproducible TIL growth can be overcome by the use of monoclonal antibody activation and IL-2. Improvements in TIL therapy are anticipated from the use of TILs combined with hybrid antibodies, the addition of other biologic response modifiers, and the implementation of genetically engineered cells and cell products. 
2	Investigation of mode of action of biofeedback in treatment of fecal incontinence. A study was carried out in 25 incontinent patients to evaluate some of the factors thought to be responsible for the success of retraining for fecal incontinence. Subjects were initially allocated to one of two groups; one group was trained to perceive small rectal volumes (active retraining), the other group carried out the same maneuvers but were not given any information or instruction. Active sensory retraining reduced the sensory threshold from 32 +/- 8 to 7 +/- 2 ml (P less than 0.001), corrected any sensory delay that was present (P less than 0.004), and reduced the frequency of incontinence from 5 +/- 1 to 1 +/- 1 episodes per week (P less than 0.01). Sham retraining caused a modest reduction in the sensory threshold (from 29 +/- 9 to 20 +/- 8; P less than 0.05) but did not significantly reduce the frequency of incontinence. Subsequent strength and coordination training did not significantly improve continence, although at the end of the study, 50% of patients had no incontinent episodes at all and 76% of patients had reduced the frequency of incontinence episodes by more than 75%. This improvement in continence was not associated with any change in sphincter pressures or in the continence to rectally infused saline but was associated with significant improvements in rectal sensation. The functional improvement was sustained over a period of two years in 16 of the 22 patients available for follow-up. In conclusion, the results support the use of retraining in the management of fecal incontinence and suggest that retraining may work by enhancing rectal sensitivity and instilling confidence. 
2	Demonstration of two distinct subsets of gastric varices. Observations during a seven-year study of endoscopic sclerotherapy. Over a seven-year period, assessment of gastric varices was made on 225 patients receiving endoscopic sclerotherapy for variceal hemorrhage. Of 170 patients with complete data, gastric varices were observed in 26 (15.3%). Importantly, two distinct subsets of gastric varices were identified: varices distal to the gastroesophageal junction without extension into the fundus, termed "junctional varices," occurred in 11.2%, and varices that were confined only to the fundus, termed "fundal varices," occurred less frequently in 4.1%. Although rebleeding was increased in both subsets of gastric varices, junctional varices were more amenable to sclerotherapy. Patients with fundal varices (N = 7) had a significantly higher rebleeding rate, increased complications with sclerotherapy, and significantly decreased survival (P less than 0.005) when compared to patients with esophageal varices alone (N = 87) who were followed for more than three months. Cumulative survival was not significantly different (P less than 0.08) in patients with junctional varices (N = 19) when compared with patients with esophageal varices alone. We conclude that not all patients with gastric varices have a poor result with sclerotherapy. Recognition of these subsets may improve treatment strategies in patients with gastric varices. 
5	Total-hip arthroplasty: periprosthetic indium-111-labeled leukocyte activity and complementary technetium-99m-sulfur colloid imaging in suspected infection Indium-111-labeled leukocyte images of 92 cemented total-hip arthroplasties were correlated with final diagnoses. Prostheses were divided into four zones: head (including acetabulum), trochanter, shaft, and tip. The presence (or absence) and intensity of activity in each zone was noted, and compared to the corresponding contralateral zone. Though present in all 23 infected arthroplasties, periprosthetic activity was also present in 77% of uninfected arthroplasties, and was greater than the contralateral zone 51% of the time. When analyzed by zone, head zone activity was the best criterion for infection (87% sensitivity, 94% specificity, 92% accuracy). Fifty of the arthroplasties were studied with combined labeled leukocyte/sulfur colloid imaging. Using incongruence of images as the criterion for infection, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the study were 100%, 97%, and 98%, respectively. While variable periprosthetic activity makes labeled leukocyte imaging alone unreliable for diagnosing hip arthroplasty infection, the addition of sulfur colloid imaging results in a highly accurate diagnostic procedure. 
5	Caffeine as an analgesic adjuvant. A double-blind study comparing aspirin with caffeine to aspirin and placebo in patients with sore throat. Despite its frequent clinical use in analgesic agents, caffeine has not been accepted unequivocally as an analgesic adjuvant. To evaluate this activity of caffeine, we used new study methods in a randomized controlled trial on patients with acute sore throat due to tonsillopharyngitis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of one of three treatments: 800 mg of aspirin with 64 mg of caffeine (n = 70), 800 mg of aspirin (n = 68), or placebo (n = 69). Under double-blind conditions, during a 2-hour evaluation period, patients used different rating scales to assess pain intensity, change in pain, relief, and two qualities of throat pain, how swollen the throat felt, and difficulty swallowing. Aspirin with caffeine and aspirin alone were significantly more effective than placebo for all efficacy measurements from 30 minutes through 2 hours and overall. The aspirin-caffeine combination also showed evidence of activity at 15 minutes on the relief scale. Aspirin with caffeine was more effective than aspirin alone after 30 minutes and over the entire study period. For patients with fever, both active treatments were equally effective antipyretic agents. We conclude, therefore, that 800 mg of aspirin, given alone or with 64 mg of caffeine, is an effective analgesic and antipyretic agent. Because the aspirin-caffeine combination is significantly more effective than aspirin alone as an analgesic, we also conclude that 64 mg of caffeine is an analgesic adjuvant. 
5	Clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the t(4;11)(q21;q23): a collaborative study of 40 cases. The t(4;11)(q21;q23) chromosomal abnormality was identified in 40 (2%) of 1,986 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This translocation was associated with female sex (63%), age less than 1 year (60%), hyperleukocytosis (median leukocyte count, 156.5 x 10(9)/L), CD10-/CD19+ B-precursor cell immunophenotype, and myeloid-associated antigen (CD15) expression (63%). Nearly all cases had at least some CD24- blast cells. The CD10-/CD15%/CD19+/CD24/+ phenotype was found in 20 of the 32 t(4;11) cases tested. None of the 40 cases had the cytogenetic finding of hyperdiploidy greater than 50, which is a favorable prognostic feature. For clinical comparison, the t(4;11) cases were divided into three groups according to age at diagnosis: less than 1 year (n = 24), 1 to 9 years (n = 8), and greater than or equal to 10 years (n = 8). Compared with older patients, infants were more likely to have initial central nervous system leukemia (P = .05) and less likely to have pre-B-cell ALL (P = .05). Complete continuous remission has been maintained in only 7 of 24 infants and 2 of 8 patients aged greater than or equal to 10 years, in contrast to 7 of 8 children in the intermediate age group (P = .048). These findings suggest that the t(4;11) is an adverse prognostic feature in these two age groups. 
5	Venous stasis and vein lumen changes during surgery The mechanisms underlying the development of postoperative deep vein thrombosis remain to be fully elucidated. Previous studies have suggested that peroperative venous distension may be a factor associated with venous thromboembolism. In this study we have obtained high resolution ultrasound images of gastrocnemius and posterior tibial veins in 62 patients undergoing a range of general surgical procedures. From these we determined the changes in vein diameter occurring during the operative procedures, in response to induction of anaesthesia, and after completion of surgery. Veins showed no evidence of dilatation in response to the induction of anaesthesia, but by the end of the operative procedure showed distension of 22-28 per cent. Distension was most prominent in the gastrocnemius veins, and lesser distension was observed in the posterior tibial veins. In a series of patients who received an infusion of 1 litre of saline in addition to basal requirements, distension was 57 per cent compared with 22 per cent in the corresponding control group. Intraoperative venous distension is associated with factors that lead to deep vein thrombosis and may be involved in the mechanisms which result in the commencement of deep vein thrombosis. 
4	Percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty. To determine the efficacy of percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty as an adjunct or alternative to conventional balloon angioplasty, 55 patients were studied in a multicenter trial. These patients underwent the procedure using a modification of conventional balloon angioplasty technique. A first-generation, 1.6-mm diameter catheter constructed of 12 individual silica fibers concentrically arranged around a guidewire lumen was used. Catheter tip energy density varied from 35 to 50 mJ/mm2. The mean number of pulses delivered at 20 Hz was 1,272 +/- 1,345. Acute success was defined as a greater than or equal to 20% increase in stenotic diameter and a lumen of greater than or equal to 1 mm in diameter after laser treatment. Acute success was achieved in 46 of 55 (84%) patients. Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed on 41 patients (75%). The percent diameter stenosis as determined by quantitative angiography decreased from a baseline of 83 +/- 14 to 49 +/- 11% after laser treatment and to 38 +/- 12% in patients undergoing adjunctive balloon angioplasty. The mean minimal stenotic diameter increased from a baseline of 0.5 +/- 0.4 to 1.6 +/- 0.5 mm after laser treatment and to 2.1 +/- 0.5 mm after balloon angioplasty. There were no deaths and no vascular perforations. One patient (1.8%) required emergency coronary bypass surgery. These data suggest that excimer laser energy delivered percutaneously by specially constructed catheters can safely ablate atheroma and reduce coronary stenoses. 
5	The differentiation of delayed serologic and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions: incidence, long-term serologic findings, and clinical significance. Delayed serologic transfusion reactions (DSTRs) and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs) were studied in a large tertiary-care hospital. A DSTR was defined by the posttransfusion finding of a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and a newly developed alloantibody specificity. A DHTR was defined as a DSTR case that showed clinical and/or laboratory evidence of hemolysis. Thirty-four cases of DSTR, 70 percent of which were due to anti-E and/or -Jka, were documented prospectively over a 20-month period. Retrospective review of the medical records found clinical evidence of hemolysis in only 6 (18%) of the 34. Thus, the incidence of DSTR was 1 (0.66%) of 151 recipients with posttransfusion samples available for testing, whereas the incidence of DHTR was only 1 (0.12%) of 854 patients tested. Fifteen of the 34 patients were followed for up to 174 days after reaction. Twelve of the 15 still demonstrated a positive DAT with anti-IgG only. Eluate studies indicated that the persistence of a positive DAT after DSTR or DHTR may involve several immunologic mechanisms, including the development of posttransfusion autoantibodies. This study indicates 1) that DSTRs are a frequent finding in multiply transfused patients, although most cases are benign and fail to meet rigid criteria for DHTR, and 2) that the persistence of a positive DAT after DSTR or DHTR is common. 
4	Coronary stent implantation in acute vessel closure 48 hours after an unsatisfactory coronary angioplasty. We report the implantation of a balloon-expandable stent in a patient with acute vessel closure in the state of evolving myocardial infarction following 48 hr after unsatisfactory coronary angioplasty. The stent was implanted after successful recanalization of an occluded left anterior descending artery, with repeated unsatisfactory results of balloon angioplasty. Adjunct thrombolytic therapy was contraindicated. No residual stenosis was documented in immediate control angiograms, or after 24 hr, 3 weeks, and 4 months. 
3	Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis presenting as infertility. Case report. The authors report a nulliparous patient presenting with infertility and hyperprolactinemia. She underwent transsphenoidal surgery after radiological investigation disclosed an enlarged pituitary gland which did not respond to bromocriptine therapy. The removed tissue had histological features consistent with adenohypophysitis including a diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate. The lymphocyte subsets present in the infiltrate were characterized by immunohistochemical methods to establish the contribution of different elements of the cellular immune response. Lymphocytes bearing CD4 antigen (helper-inducer cells) were most prominent and appeared to bear the majority of the interleukin-2 receptor (expressed during lymphocytic activation) present in the pituitary gland. A few B lymphocytes were also observed. The location of the major histocompatibility antigen (classes I and II) and interleukin-2 receptor correlated with the lymphocytes and macrophages rather than with the stromal or parenchymal elements of the pituitary. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is an unusual cause of pituitary enlargement which can mimic a pituitary tumor, and is sometimes associated with hyperprolactinemia. In women of child-bearing age, it almost always occurs during pregnancy or the postpartum stage. The autoimmune disorder reported here has not previously been associated with infertility nor has the lymphocytic infiltrate of the pituitary previously been analyzed in detail by modern immunological methods. 
1	Clinical management of port-wine stain in infants and young children using the flashlamp-pulsed dye laser. The flashlamp-pulsed dye laser (FLPDL) at 585 nm, a wavelength well absorbed by oxyhemoglobin, causes highly selective vascular injury. In addition, the 450 microsecond pulse duration produced by this laser approximates the thermal relaxation time for dermal blood vessels thereby confining the energy to the target. This new laser effects excellent lightening of port-wine stain (PWS) in infants and young children without the adverse complications of hypertrophic scarring, permanent pigmentation abnormality, or textural changes, complications often seen with conventional laser systems. The FLPDL now permits treatment of this patient population expected to gain the most benefit from early laser therapy in a much safer manner, before the psychological complications of being a "marked" person develop. The purpose of this report is to: (1) describe the theoretical considerations behind achieving selective removal of PWS that can be understood and used by a nonsurgically-oriented practitioner; and (2) describe the practical application of the device used in the clinical management of infants and young children. 
1	Piroxicam decreases postirradiation colonic neoplasia in the rat. This study evaluated the effects of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent piroxicam on chronic radiation proctitis in the rat. Forty female Wistar rats received a 2250-cGy dose of irradiation to the distal 2 cm of the colon. Twenty received piroxicam 8.0 mg/kg orally 30 minutes before exposure and 24 hours after exposure; 20 rats served as irradiated controls. All animals were evaluated by colonoscopy 1 and 3 weeks postexposure and every third week until death or killing at 1 year. At killing, colons were removed for light microscopic examination. One year postirradiation results showed no differences in mortality, vascular changes, acute inflammation, colitis cystica profunda, or rectal stricture between the control and piroxicam-treated groups. However, at 1 year postirradiation the control group demonstrated neoplasia in 15 of 19 animals compared with eight of 20 animals in the piroxicam-treated group. The first endoscopic appearance of colonic neoplasm occurred at 15 weeks postirradiation in one control irradiated rat whereas the first evidence of endoscopic neoplasm in the piroxicam-treated group did not occur until 36 weeks postirradiation. Histologic examination documented a tendency toward a greater presence of adenocarcinomas in the control group compared with the piroxicam-treated group. The authors conclude that piroxicam treatment significantly decreased the incidence of colonic neoplasia in general as well as delayed the endoscopic appearance of colonic neoplasia in rats after pelvic irradiation. 
5	Airway luminal liquid. Sources and role as an amplifier of bronchoconstriction. The release of mediators from inflammatory cells into the airway lumen can initiate a series of events leading to airway obstruction, particularly smooth muscle contraction and alteration of endothelial and epithelial permeability leading to mucosal edema and subsequent influx of liquid into the airway lumen. In this report we briefly review the effects of several inflammatory mediators, including eicosanoids, platelet-activating factor, and histamine, as well as the effects of plasma proteins and tachykinins that may be secondarily released because of the presence of inflammatory mediators on endothelial and epithelial permeability. We then consider physical mechanisms whereby the resulting airway luminal liquid could amplify the response of an airway previously constricted because of smooth muscle contraction. Specifically, liquid in the interstices between epithelial projections that are formed during muscular contraction could amplify the degree of luminal compromise by (1) further decreasing luminal cross-sectional area by occupying space, and (2) providing an additional source of inward recoil because of the surface tension of the air-liquid interface. 
2	Accumulation and pepsin solubility of collagens in the bowel of patients with Crohn's disease. The collagen content of resected strictured intestine, with and without fistulas, from patients with Crohn's disease has been compared with that in macroscopically normal intestine removed from the same patients and from others without inflammatory bowel disease. Collagen content per unit wet or dry weight of tissue was significantly increased in all grossly diseased tissue whether fistulated or not. Although there was a significant increase in collagen types I, III, and V in diseased tissue, the relative proportions of major collagen types extracted by limited pepsin digestion were similar for both Crohn's and non-Crohn's intestine (type I, 65 to 70 percent; type III, 25 to 30 percent; type IV, 2 to 3 percent; and type V, 2.5 to 3 percent). CNBr digestion of pepsin insoluble material showed a similar relative abundance of types I and III, indicating no major change in collagen type distribution between older (insoluble) and more newly synthesized collagen. There was no evidence of the presence of type I trimer collagen. Type VI collagen, although not quantitated, was observed in 70 percent of intestinal specimens. The proportion of total collagen solubilized by pepsin treatment was significantly greater in both grossly diseased and macroscopically normal Crohn's bowel compared with non-inflammatory bowel disease bowel. These findings suggest that there are disturbances of collagen metabolism in Crohn's intestine, which account for the stricturing process and which may predate gross pathologic changes. 
5	Neonatal hepatitis and extrahepatic biliary atresia associated with cytomegalovirus infection in twins. Prenatally acquired cytomegalovirus infection in twins was temporally associated with a discordant development of neonatal hepatitis and extrahepatic biliary atresia. This case presents evidence suggesting an association between perinatal cytomegalovirus infection and selected extrahepatic biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis. Congenital cytomegalovirus infections and cytomegalovirus hepatitis are also discussed. 
1	Prostate specific antigen in hormonally treated stage D2 prostate cancer: is it always an accurate indicator of disease status? The clinical significance of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) values in hormonally treated prostate cancer patients and the effect of hormonal therapy on the serum PSA concentration, independent of the response observed from its antitumor activity, are not well defined. To elucidate further the influence of antiandrogen therapy on serum PSA expression, 81 randomly selected patients with stage D2 prostate cancer were evaluated with respect to serum PSA concentration. These patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of previous hormonal therapy. Group 1 consisted of 43 patients 55 to 89 years old (mean age 71 years) who had received no prior therapy for prostate cancer. Group 2 included 38 men 58 to 84 years old (mean age 72 years) who had received only androgen deprivation therapy with either bilateral orchiectomy or diethylstilbestrol. The mean interval between initiation of antiandrogen therapy and evaluation of these patients was 14 months (range 8 to 31 months). At the time of PSA determination both groups were similar in all respects, including tumor grade, disease symptoms and bone scan findings. The median serum PSA concentration was 96.0 ng./ml. in group 1 and 16.5 ng./ml. in group 2 (p less than 0.001), despite both groups having similar symptoms and widespread metastatic disease on radionuclide bone scan. In group 1 only 1 patient (2%) had a serum PSA level less than 4.0 ng./ml., whereas 13 men (34%) in group 2 had a serum PSA concentration below 4.0 ng./ml. (p less than 0.001). Of the patients in group 1, 2% and of the men in group 2, 45% had a serum PSA concentration less than 10 ng./ml. (p less than 0.001). These findings demonstrate that the serum PSA level in prostate cancer patients treated hormonally may have a significantly different meaning than the same serum PSA value in patients without hormonal therapy. In addition, these observations suggest that PSA expression may be under hormonal regulation and that androgen deprivation therapy may have a direct effect on the serum PSA concentration, independent of the response obtained from any antitumor activity. However, the exact mechanism of this androgenic influence on PSA expression awaits further investigation at the cellular level. 
4	The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have additive effects with most other antihypertensive agents, but the mechanisms of these interactions vary. With diuretics the interaction with ACE inhibitors can be explained by their contrasting effects on the renin-angiotensin system, while with calcium antagonists it may be attributed to independent mechanisms of action. With beta-blockers there is a variable additive effect, which has been proposed to be due to more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than can be obtained with either type of agent alone. 
5	Characteristics of accessory pathways exhibiting decremental conduction. The prevalence, electrophysiologic characteristics and functional significance of decremental conduction over an accessory pathway were examined in this retrospective study of 653 patients who had an accessory pathway demonstrated at electrophysiologic study. Decremental conduction was identified in 50 patients (7.6%). In 15 patients with anterograde decremental conduction, the accessory pathway was right parietal or septal in 14 patients and left parietal in 1 patient. In the 40 patients with retrograde decrement, the accessory pathway was left parietal in 19, posteroseptal in 13, right parietal in 2 and right anteroseptal in 6 patients. Anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway was absent in 11 of the 40 patients with retrograde decrement. Retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway was absent in 9 patients with anterograde decrement. There was no significant difference in the accessory pathway effective refractory period, or shortest cycle length with 1:1 conduction over the accessory pathway in anterograde and retrograde directions. The shortest RR interval in atrial fibrillation between 2 preexcited QRS complexes was longer in patients with anterograde decremental conduction than in a control group of patients with anterograde-conducting accessory pathways without decremental properties. These data demonstrate that decremental conduction over accessory pathways is uncommon. Anterograde decremental conduction usually occurs in right-sided or septal pathways that often do not conduct in the retrograde direction. 
1	Chemical shift imaging of human brain: axial, sagittal, and coronal P-31 metabolite images. Multivoxel magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and novel data analysis techniques were developed to obtain high-quality phosphorus-31 metabolite images from the human brain and to overlay each metabolite distribution directly onto corresponding hydrogen-1 MR images. The P-31 MR spectroscopic data were acquired by means of three-dimensional chemical shift imaging (phase encoding in three spatial dimensions) on a 1.5-T clinical instrument equipped with a specially designed quadrature P-31 birdcage coil constructed in the authors' laboratory. Axial, sagittal, and coronal metabolite images based on the area for any one of five peak regions (phosphodiester; phosphocreatine; gamma, alpha, and beta adenosine triphosphate) were generated from 8 X 8 X 8 or 12 X 12 X 8 CSI arrays with voxel sizes of 27 cm3 and 12 cm3, respectively. The positions of these images were aligned with anatomic features by means of the voxel-shifting capability of the Fourier transform. Direct overlays of these metabolite images on corresponding proton images demonstrated excellent correlation with anatomy, factors indicating the utility of this technique for viewing P-31 metabolite levels in all areas of the brain simultaneously. 
1	Technetium-99m(v) dimercaptosuccinic acid planar scintigraphy in head and neck cancer: clinical, scintigraphic and radiological study. Technetium-99m (Tc99m)(v) Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (DMSA) is an imaging agent which has been proposed as a scintigraphic marker for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Fifty-four patients were studied of whom 51 had a head and neck tumour. All patients were examined and then imaged using Tc99m(v) DMSA scintigraphy and computerized tomography. Scintigraphy was less sensitive than clinical examination in the detection of patients with cancer, patients with primary tumours and patients with metastatic neck disease. CT was as sensitive and as accurate as clinical examination but more sensitive than Tc99m(v) DMSA in detecting patients with cancer and with primary tumours. CT was more sensitive and more accurate than both clinical examination and Tc99m(v) DMSA scintigraphy in predicting which patients had metastatic neck disease. Although Tc99m(v) DMSA is accumulated by squamous cell carcinoma, its inability to detect low volume disease and apparent low specificity means it has no role to play in the management of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. 
5	Umbilical cord hematoma following diagnostic funipuncture. Major complications associated with funipuncture have been reported but are rare. This is a report of a diagnostic funipuncture performed on a 29-week fetus with a single umbilical artery and multiple malformations. Immediately after the procedure, a voluminous hematoma developed at the site of needle insertion in association with a severe fetal bradycardia. Fetal death was confirmed within 5 minutes of needle insertion. It is hypothesized that the risk of complications of funipuncture may vary according to the clinical indication for the procedure and may be increased in the presence of certain fetal malformations. The rapid evolution of complications, as occurred in the present case, underlines the importance of having a clear plan of management in the event of mishap and discussing this plan with the parents before undertaking diagnostic funipuncture. 
3	The neurologic workup in patients with cervical spine disorders. Care must be exercised in interpreting the clinical and radiologic findings when assessing patients with cervical spondylosis and involvement of neural structures for surgery. If the clinical picture cannot logically be explained by the radiologic findings, further investigation is indicated to exclude a coexistent disorder. Investigations may include electrophysiologic tests, transcranial magnetic stimulation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Only then can the indication for surgical intervention be properly determined. 
5	Ultrasonographic findings of testicular microlithiasis associated with intratubular germ cell neoplasia. Testicular microlithiasis is an uncommon condition in which calcified concretions fill the lumina of seminiferous tubules. We report the case of a twenty-three-year-old white man with a metastatic germ cell tumor and normal findings on testicular physical examination, but abnormal ultrasonography of the right testis. Orchiectomy revealed intratubular germ cell neoplasia with testicular microlithiasis. Multiple circular echogenic foci on ultrasound correlated with the histologic finding of testicular microlithiasis. Further studies are indicated for assessing ultrasonography as an adjunct for screening the population at risk for intratubular germ cell neoplasia. 
2	Death, after swallowing and aspiration of a high number of foreign bodies, in a schizophrenic woman. A 46-year-old woman who had had a long-term schizoid psychosis collapsed on the street. Upon admission to the hospital, she was determined to have an acute abdomen. The chest radiograph showed metallic foreign bodies in both main bronchi; foreign bodies in the stomach were not observed clinically. The woman died from repeated cardiac arrest shortly after hospital admission. At the autopsy a screw and a nail were found in both main bronchi. The abdominal cavity contained 2 L of greenish purulent fluid and a massive fibrinoid peritonitis was observed. Two perforations of the stomach, each 1 cm in diameter, were detected. The stomach was completely filled with a mass of metallic foreign bodies, greenish fluid, and a bezoar of a total weight of 1,400 g; 422 distinguishable and mostly metallic foreign bodies were counted. Death was attributed to cardiac arrest in delayed shock after massive purulent peritonitis caused by two gastric perforations combined with obstruction of the airways by aspirated foreign bodies. Cases of massive swallowing of foreign bodies are mainly restricted to mentally handicapped persons, especially schizophrenics, whereas acute impaction of the larynx by large food particles occurs nearly exclusively in heavily intoxicated adults. 
3	Remote effect of deep-seated vascular brain lesions on cerebral blood flow. We measured regional cerebral blood flow using the xenon-133 inhalation method, at approximately 1 month after onset, in 60 stroke patients who had no evidence of major carotid artery stenosis or occlusion. Their single lesions (43 infarcts and 17 hematomas) were located in the capsulothalamolenticular region, sparing the cortex. Hemispheric mean cerebral blood flow was reduced on the side of the lesion in 25 patients and on both sides in 20. Regional hypoperfusion was observed in 46 patients (ipsilaterally in 34, bilaterally in 10, and contralaterally in two). Regional hypoperfusion was observed most frequently in the frontal lobe, particularly in the motor and premotor cortices of the prerolandic area. The 46 patients with regional hypoperfusion were compared with the 14 patients without regional hypoperfusion, considering the size and location of the lesion as well as the functional and analytic motor performances. As a rule, the lesion was slightly smaller and more posterior and the functional (p less than 0.001) and analytic (p less than 0.05) motor performances were significantly better in the 14 patients without regional hypoperfusion. Since the xenon-133 inhalation method examines cortical blood flow, we can attribute blood flow reductions resulting from deep-seated lesions to a functional depression akin to diaschisis. Interpretation of the clinical consequences and pathogenesis of this phenomenon requires further sequential and pathologic studies. 
2	Systemic hemodynamic and cardiac function changes in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. The objective of this study was to determine the changes in systemic hemodynamics (systemic vascular resistance [SVR], cardiac output [CO], systemic blood pressure [SBP]) and cardiac function (pulmonary artery pressure [PAP] and pulmonary wedge pressure [PWP]) during the 96 hours following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and correlate these with changes in hepatic and renal function and patient outcome. The study took place in a 12-bed medical respiratory intensive care unit in a large teaching hospital. Twenty-one patients had OLT performed over a 21.5-month period (January 1988 to October 15, 1989) for end stage liver disease (ESLD) from a variety of causes. A flow-directed right heart catheter and an indwelling arterial cannula were inserted for hemodynamic monitoring over a 96-hour postoperative period. Liver and renal function studies, total serum calcium, serum albumin, and fluid balance were determined daily. The SVR increased significantly to 12.8 +/- 0.6 U at 48 hours compared with immediate (less than 8 hours) postoperative levels (p less than 0.05) and remained elevated for 96 hours. The CO fell progressively and was significantly lower than baseline values from 64 to 96 hours. There was significant inverse correlation between the increase in SVR and the fall in CO (r = .85, p less than 0.01). The SBP was stable except for a small, but significant fall at 16 and 24 hours postoperatively. The PWP increased significantly from a baseline value of 12.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg to 15 +/- 0.9 mm Hg at 32 hours and remained elevated through 96 hours (p less than 0.05). The serum bilirubin level fell progressively postoperatively and the prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) shortened significantly. Bile flow increased progressively from 107 +/- 120 ml/24 hours at the end of the first 24 hours to 188 +/- 125 ml/24 hours by 96 hours postoperatively. Five patients died from nine to 43 days postoperatively. These patients' hemodynamic parameters were not significantly different from the patients who survived. Successful OLT is associated with a rapid increase in SVR and a fall in CO without changes in SBP. These findings tend to parallel the improvement found in results of liver function tests. However, there is no correlation between the improvement in the hemodynamic state and long-term survival. 
2	Chest pain in teenagers. When is it significant? Chest pain in teenagers often has no obvious organic cause. Onset of symptoms with an emotionally stressful situation may indicate psychogenic chest pain. The differential diagnosis also includes cardiac, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory disorders. Routine testing generally does not help to establish a diagnosis and may even do harm by reinforcing a patient's unspoken fear of serious illness. Most teenagers with chest pain have no such illness, and symptoms usually resolve without therapy. An important role for primary care physicians is to provide support during evaluation and follow-up. 
3	Left ventricular ejection fraction may not be useful as an end point of thrombolytic therapy comparative trials. In the era of comparative and adjunctive trials in reperfusion therapy, the need to develop alternative end points for mortality reduction is clear. Left ventricular ejection fraction, which has been commonly used as a surrogate, is problematic due to missing values, technically inadequate studies, and lack of correlation with mortality results in controlled reperfusion trials performed to date. In this paper, we present a composite clinical end point that includes, in order, severity of adverse outcome death, hemorrhagic stroke, nonhemorrhagic stroke, poor ejection fraction (less than 30%), reinfarction, heart failure, and pulmonary edema. Such a composite index may be useful to detect true therapeutic benefit in reperfusion trials without necessitating greater than 20-30,000 patient enrollment. 
2	Gastrointestinal function and structure in HIV-positive patients. We examined 19 patients (17 men) with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and gastrointestinal symptoms to determine whether those symptoms were due to either a gastrointestinal tract infection or a defect in mucosal absorption because of an enteropathy. The erythrocyte folate and serum vitamin B12 levels were within normal limits in all of the patients. The serum ferritin level was elevated in 12. The xylose absorption test results were abnormal in 8 of the 13 patients able to complete the study. None of the duodenal aspirates yielded a pathogen. Light microscopy revealed nonspecific lymphocytic inflammation without infection in the stomach (in seven patients), the esophagus (in five), the duodenum (in two) and the rectum (in two). However, biopsy specimens were positive for Candida albicans in the esophagus (four patients), cytomegalovirus in the esophagus (one) and the rectum (two), Helicobacter pylori in the antrum (two), Treponema infection in the rectum (two) and Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare in the small intestine (one). Only three patients had a normal series of biopsy specimens. All of the patients had similar ultrastructural changes at the epithelial-stromal junction of the antral glands and in the intestinal crypts. We conclude that abnormal biochemical and endoscopic findings are common in HIV-positive patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Defects in carbohydrate absorption and ultrastructural changes may be responsible for some aspects of HIV enteropathy. 
5	v-Ha-ras transgene abrogates the initiation step in mouse skin tumorigenesis: effects of phorbol esters and retinoic acid. Experimental carcinogenesis has led to a concept that defines two discrete stages in the development of skin tumors: (i) initiation, which is accomplished by using a mutagen that presumably activates a protooncogene, and (ii) promotion, which is a reversible process brought about most commonly by repeated application of phorbol esters. We have created a transgenic mouse strain that carries the activated v-Ha-ras oncogene fused to the promoter of the mouse embryonic alpha-like, zeta-globin gene. Unexpectedly, these animals developed papillomas at areas of epidermal abrasion and, because abrasion can also serve as a tumor-promoting event in mutagen-treated mouse skin, we tested these mice for their ability to respond to phorbol ester application. Within 6 weeks virtually all treated carrier mice had developed multiple papillomas, some of which went on to develop squamous cell carcinomas and, more frequently, underlying sarcomas. We conclude that the oncogene "preinitiates" carrier mice, replacing the initiation/mutagenesis step and immediately sensitizing them to the action of tumor promoters. In addition, treatment of the mice with retinoic acid dramatically delays, reduces, and often completely inhibits the appearance of promoter-induced papillomas. This strain has use in screening tumor promoters and for assessing antitumor and antiproliferative agents. 
5	Total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation in hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland. Hyperparathyroidism caused by multiple-gland hyperplasia has traditionally been treated by subtotal parathyroidectomy. Excellent results have been reported by some, particularly in primary hyperparathyroidism, but other have reported a significant incidence of recurrent hyperparathyroidism. Since 1979, we have chosen to avoid the possibility of remedial exploration of the neck and its attendant risks by treating all patients with primary and secondary hyperplasia with total parathyroidectomy and heterotopic autotransplantation. A total of 20 patients were studied. There were no failures of grafts and no operative complications. We conclude that this procedure is a reliable and safe alternative in the treatment of primary or secondary hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland. 
4	Prediction of the frequency and duration of ambulatory myocardial ischemia in patients with stable coronary artery disease by determination of the ischemic threshold from exercise testing: importance of the exercise protocol The relation between ambulatory myocardial ischemia and the results of exercise testing in patients with ischemic heart disease remains undefined, because of the dissimilar results of previous reports. To further investigate this issue and, in particular, to ascertain the importance of the exercise protocol in determining that relation, 70 patients with stable coronary artery disease underwent 48 h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and treadmill exercise tests after withdrawal of medications. Patients exercised using two different protocols with slow (National Institutes of Health [NIH] combined protocol) and brisk (Bruce protocol) work load increments. Exercise duration was longer with the NIH combined protocol (14.1 +/- 5 versus 6.8 +/- 2 min; p less than 0.0001), but the maximal work load and peak heart rate achieved were greater with the Bruce protocol (9.8 +/- 2 versus 6.5 +/- 2 METs, and 142 +/- 19 versus 133 +/- 22 beats/min, respectively; p less than 0.0001). A close inverse correlation between exercise testing and the results of ambulatory ECG monitoring was observed using the NIH combined protocol; the strongest correlation was observed between time of exercise at 1 mm of ST segment depression and number of ischemic episodes (r = -0.86; p less than 0.0001). With the Bruce protocol a significantly weaker inverse correlation was found (r = -0.35). The mean heart rate at the onset of ST segment depression was similar during monitoring and during exercise testing with the NIH combined protocol (97.2 +/- 13 versus 101.0 +/- 17 beats/min, respectively) but it was significantly higher (110.4 +/- 13) when using the Bruce protocol (p less than 0.001). 
1	Effects of epidermal growth factor and analogues of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and somatostatin on phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues of specific protein substrates in various tumors. Analogues of somatostatin (SS) and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) activate tyrosine phosphatases in MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cell line membranes and inhibit growth. We compared the substrates phosphorylated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) to those dephosphorylated by the SS analogue RC-160 (D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Trp-NH2) and [D-Trp6]LH-RH in cancer cell lines such as MIA PaCa-2 (human pancreatic cancer), HCPC (hamster cheek pouch carcinoma), A-549 (human lung cancer), HT-29 (human colon cancer), and R3230AC (breast cancer). EGF phosphorylated proteins of 170, 65, and 60 kDa and analogues of SS and LH-RH promoted the dephosphorylation of these proteins in MIA PaCa-2 and HCPC cell lines. The EGF receptor is 170 kDa. pp60src (60 kDa) is known to be a substrate for EGF receptor. The LH-RH receptor is also 60 kDa. The effects of RC-160 and [D-Trp6]LH-RH were quantitatively different. Examinations of HT-29, A-549, and R3230AC cancer cell lines revealed no phosphorylation by EGF or dephosphorylation by RC-160 and [D-Trp6]LH-RH. In addition to the 170-, 65-, and 60-kDa proteins, 35-kDa proteins were also phosphorylated in some cancer cell lines. This work demonstrates that analogues of SS and LH-RH can reverse the effects of EGF biochemically as well as functionally. 
1	Influence of age and endocrine factors on the volume of benign prostatic hyperplasia. To determine whether endocrine factors influence the volume of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 23 hormonal factors were measured in the serum of 64 men ages 42 to 71 years with low volume prostatic cancer and these levels were correlated with the volume of benign hyperplastic tissue in their radical prostatectomy specimens. With age there was a significant increase in the volume of BPH. Also with age there was a significant decrease in the serum levels of free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandronsterone (DHA), dehydroepiandronsterone sulphate (DHA-S), delta 5-androstenediol, and 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and a significant increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), LH, and FSH. When BPH volume and hormone levels were corrected for age, BPH volume correlated positively with free testosterone, estradiol, and estriol. These data indicate that with age patients with larger volumes of BPH have higher serum androgen and estrogen levels suggesting that serum androgen and estrogen levels may be factors in the persistent stimulation of BPH with age. If so, therapeutic attempts at lowering plasma testosterone levels, reducing estrogen levels, or blocking androgenic stimulation through other mechanisms may interfere with the progression of BPH with age. Conversely, the fact that androgen production declines gradually with age may explain the observation that only 20 to 30% of men who live to age 80 require surgical treatment for urinary obstruction from BPH. 
5	Amenorrhea, osteopenia, and the female athlete. Athletic amenorrhea is a problem because it is associated with an increased risk of injuries and potentially an increased risk of osteoporosis in later life. This article gives suggestions for the evaluation of the athlete with amenorrhea and for treatment protocols. Primary care physicians should routinely screen female adolescent athletes for amenorrhea and, if athletic amenorrhea is present, initiate treatment or referral for treatment for this important problem with short- and long-term complications. 
3	Levels of the human hepatocyte growth factor in serum of patients with various liver diseases determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We have found a hepatotrophic factor in plasma or sera of patients with fulminant hepatic failure and have purified human hepatocyte growth factor from plasma of these patients. In this study we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with high specificity and sensitivity for human hepatocyte growth factor in human serum. This assay for serum human hepatocyte growth factor is a sandwich method consisting of three steps. The standard curve for human hepatocyte growth factor appeared to be linear in the range of 0.20 to 12.50 ng purified human hepatocyte growth factor/ml (2.35 to 147 pmol/L). The assay took about 4 hr. Serum human hepatocyte growth factor values in patients with fulminant hepatic failure measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed a strong positive correlation with that by bioassay using rat hepatocytes in primary culture. The mean value of serum human hepatocyte growth factor for 30 normal subjects was 0.24 +/- 0.12 (S.D.) ng/ml; that for 23 patients with fulminant hepatic failure was 8.06 +/- 1.76 (S.E.M.) ng/ml- greater than 30 times greater than the mean value for normal subjects. Serum human hepatocyte growth factor levels in patients with acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were found to be slightly higher than those in normal subjects, but only the increase in serum human hepatocyte growth factor of acute hepatitis patients was statistically significant. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum human hepatocyte growth factor should prove useful for serum human hepatocyte growth factor level measurement in patients with various liver diseases. 
5	Window operation: an alternative treatment method for Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses Recently, we developed the "window operation" as a more effective way to treat Bartholin gland cysts and abscesses. The window operation was used to treat 25 Bartholin cysts and 22 Bartholin abscesses during a 3-year period from October 1, 1986 to September 30, 1989. Under local anesthesia, a small piece of skin including the cyst wall was excised in an oval shape, and suturing was performed along the excised margin. Postoperative antibiotics were given in cases of acute inflammation. A new mucocutaneous junction was observed at the 4-week postoperative checkup. No complications or recurrences have been observed during the study period. The window operation can be an alternative method of treatment for Bartholin gland cysts or abscesses. 
5	CO2 laser for suppurative hidradenitis of the vulva. Chronic suppurative hidradenitis is a disease of the apocrine glands occurring predominantly in the axillae of the anogenital region. Treatment, to date, has been frustrating. Prolonged antibiotic therapy and multiple incisions and drainage have been the usual form of therapy, but those surgical procedures leave patients with ugly scars; retracted, hypertrophic skin edges; and pitted, indurated and disfiguring abscesses. The only successful treatment to date has been wide excision of the entire apocrine gland-bearing tissues, such as radical vulvectomy, which often necessitates grafts to cover the surgically exposed areas. That has left patients with unsatisfactorily functioning vaginas and a mutilated appearance. Recently we instituted the use of the CO2 laser to treat these patients with the goal of eradicating the suppurative sinus tracts and the infected apocrine glands without removing large volumes of adjacent, unaffected tissue. Over the past eight years we treated 11 patients who had extensive, chronic hidradenitis of the anogenital area with the CO2 laser. The use of laser therapy for these patients has produced effective and less-mutilating results. Such treatment has been a successful option for treating this debilitating disease. 
3	Auditory hallucinations and smaller superior temporal gyral volume in schizophrenia. Recent neuropathologic investigations in schizophrenia report smaller volume of medial temporal lobe structures. These findings are confirmed by preliminary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Direct stimulation of lateral temporal lobe structures in the region of the superior temporal gyrus provokes hallucinations. The authors' MRI study of young schizophrenic patients demonstrates smaller volume of the superior temporal gyrus (an auditory association area) and of the left amygdala. Smaller size of the left superior temporal gyrus and left amygdala is not accounted for by smaller size of the overall brain or temporal lobe. Shrinkage of the left superior temporal gyrus is strongly and selectively correlated with severity of auditory hallucinations. 
3	Urologic function after experimental cauda equina compression. Cystometrograms versus cortical-evoked potentials. Twenty female beagle dogs underwent an L6-7 laminectomy and six dogs each had 25, 50 or 75% constriction of the cauda equina and 2 control dogs had laminectomy only. Cystometrograms were performed pre- and post-operatively and three months after constriction. Cortical evoked potentials were monitored pre- and post-operatively and monthly for three months. After three months of constriction, the cauda equina of these dogs in each group was examined histologically and vascular circulation was examined by latex and India ink injection (Spalteholz technique). The control dogs had normal CMGs and CEPs. Twenty-five percent constriction caused no CMG changes and mild CEP changes. Fifty percent constriction caused no statistically significant CMG changes, major CEP changes and venous congestion of the nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia. Seventy-five percent constriction produced severe CMG changes with detrusor areflexia, increased bladder capacity and clinical incontinence. CEPs also had marked deterioration. Vascular analysis revealed severe arterial narrowing at the level of constriction and venous congestion of the nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia. Blockage of axoplasmic flow and nerve root atrophy was seen in all dogs with 75% constriction. Cortical evoked potentials were the most sensitive predictor of neural compression. CMGs were not sensitive until severe compression was achieved. Bladder dysfunction, i.e., detrusor areflexia, appears to occur with blockage of axoplasmic flow and early sensory changes occur with neurovenous congestion. 
4	Treatment of Kawasaki syndrome: a comparison of two dosage regimens of intravenously administered immune globulin. Because intravenously administered immune globulin (IVIG) is effective in reducing the incidence of coronary artery aneurysms in Kawasaki syndrome when given at a dose of 400 mg/kg daily for 4 days, we undertook a multicenter clinical trial comparing two dosage regimens of IVIG. Patients were randomly assigned to receive IVIG at either 400 mg/kg daily for 4 days (22 patients) or 1 gm/kg as a single dose (22 patients). All patients received aspirin therapy, and all were enrolled within 7 days of onset of fever. The presence of coronary artery aneurysms was evaluated by means of two-dimensional echocardiography before infusion; at days 4 to 6, 14 to 21, and 42 to 49 after infusion; and at 1 year. Coronary artery aneurysms were detected in 3 of the 44 patients, including one patient receiving 400 mg/kg and two patients receiving 1 gm/kg (p value not significant). No giant aneurysms were detected. No major side effects occurred with either dosage regimen. Patients receiving the 1 gm/kg dose had a faster resolution of fever and were discharged from the hospital approximately 1 day sooner than the 400 mg/kg group (p = 0.01). Although the relatively small sample size in this trial does not allow for a more definitive statement regarding the occurrence of coronary artery aneurysms, it appears that the 1 gm/kg dose is associated with a more rapid clinical improvement and a shorter hospital stay. 
5	Glutamic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmitters in central control of breathing. We review recent cross-disciplinary experimental and theoretical investigations on metabolism of the amino acid neurotransmitters glutamic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain during hypoxia and hypercapnia and their possible role in central control of breathing. The roles of classical modifiers of central chemical drive to breathing (H+ and cholinergic mechanisms) are summarized. A brief perspective on the current widespread interest in GABA and glutamate in central control is given. The basic biochemistry of these amino acids and their roles in ammonia and bicarbonate metabolism are discussed. This review further addresses recent work on central respiratory effects of inhibitory GABA and excitatory glutamate. Current understanding of the sites and mechanisms of action of these amino acids on or near the ventral surface of the medulla is reviewed. We focus particularly on tracer kinetic investigations of glutamatergic and GABAergic mechanisms in hypoxia and hypercapnia and their possible role in the ventilatory response to hypoxia. We conclude with some speculative remarks on the critical importance of these investigations and suggest specific directions of research in central mechanisms of respiratory control. 
5	Cumulative load as a risk factor for back pain. The association between cumulative load (biomechanic load and exposure time integral over the entire work experience) and back pain was investigated in a group of institutional aides with physically stressful jobs. A questionnaire/interview was conducted with 161 of these institutional aides. The point prevalence of back pain in this sample was 62%. Men had worked a mean duration of 14.3 years and women 11.6 years at the time of the onset of the first pain episode. Every job performed was analyzed by the use of a two-dimensional static mathematical model. The compression and shear at the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral discs were computed by the use of a biomechanic model. Cumulative compression and shear were significantly higher in institutional aides with pain compared with those without pain (P less than 0.05-0.01). The pain group was similar to the no-pain group in age, weight, and height. 
5	Mediastinitis following nasal intubation in the emergency department. A patient who developed a retropharyngeal abscess and fatal mediastinitis following emergent nasal intubation is described. Despite aggressive surgical therapy the patient died of mediastinitis. Although mediastinitis as a complication of oral intubation has been described, mediastinitis following nasal intubation has not previously been reported. 
1	Occurrence of hypercalcemia and leukocytosis with cachexia in a human squamous cell carcinoma of the maxilla in athymic nude mice: a novel experimental model of three concomitant paraneoplastic syndromes. Hypercalcemia and leukocytosis may occur in conjunction as paraneoplastic syndromes associated with malignant disease. Here we describe a human squamous cell carcinoma of the maxilla that was associated with hypercalcemia and leukocytosis, and also cachexia. The primary tumor was surgically removed and established in permanent cell culture. When either primary tumors or cultured tumor cells were inoculated into nude mice, the nude mice developed the same paraneoplastic syndromes as those which occurred in the patient from whom the tumor was originally derived. The plasma calcium was increased two and one-half-fold and the WBC count 30-fold, and the body weight was decreased by 45% in tumor-bearing animals. Each of these paraneoplastic syndromes was alleviated by surgical excision of the tumor, indicating that the paraneoplastic syndromes were due to a factor or factors produced by the primary tumor. The development of each of these paraneoplastic syndromes in nude mice correlated positively with the other two syndromes. We examined the organs of tumor-bearing mice and found striking histopathologic abnormalities in the bones, spleen, and liver, but no infiltration with tumor cells. The bones showed marked evidence of osteoclastic bone resorption. This model of a human tumor associated with the hypercalcemia-leukocytosis paraneoplastic syndrome, together with cachexia, should make it possible to determine the mechanisms responsible for these paraneoplastic syndromes and their relationship to each other. 
4	How to select a drug for the long-term treatment of chronic heart failure. First-line drugs for the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure should produce immediate symptomatic benefit, improve exercise tolerance, and thereby improve the quality of life. They should preferentially be active as monotherapy or at least reduce the need for comedication. The drugs must be safe and well tolerated by patients and change, in the end, the natural history of the disease, so that sudden death will be prevented and life expectancy improves. None of the currently available drugs satisfies all these criteria. Diuretics, digitalis, converting-enzyme inhibitors, and ibopamine come close to the described ideal. 
1	The diagnosis of ovarian cancer by pathologists: how often do diagnoses by contributing pathologists agree with a panel of gynecologic pathologists? The Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study, a multicenter, population-based, case-control study of ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancer in women 20 to 54 years of age, permitted the diagnoses of contributing pathologists to be compared with those of a panel of three gynecologic pathologists. A diagnosis of ovarian cancer was made by contributing pathologists on 477 subjects. Agreement between the two groups of pathologists was 97% for primary epithelial ovarian cancer and 89% for primary nonepithelial ovarian malignancies. Agreement on diagnosis of major cellular subtypes of ovarian malignancy ranged between 73% for endometrioid cancer and 100% for clear cell carcinomas. We conclude that the diagnosis of pathologic features of primary ovarian cancer is highly predictable. Nonetheless, diagnosis by histologic type varies sufficiently that a review process should be considered for clinical or investigative decisions involving specific histologic diagnoses of ovarian cancer. 
4	Endoscopic laser surgery. A single-center comprehensive experience. A retrospective review of endoscopic procedures using the Nd:YAG laser was carried out for patients treated between October 1985 and March 1989. During this 42-month period 165 procedures were performed on 100 patients. The study encompasses a unique period of time in this center, as it includes the initial application, and finally, the time when its use became routine. Indications for laser surgery included the treatment of tumors, bleeding, benign strictures, arterial occlusions, and hemorrhoids. Nd:YAG laser was found to be effective in the treatment of these lesions. The overall success rate was 81 per cent. Patients who are poor surgical candidates would especially benefit from this therapeutic alternative. 
2	The surgical management of children with ulcerative colitis. The old vs. the new. The authors' experience with children who have chronic ulcerative colitis was reviewed to compare their current surgical approach (ileoanal anastomosis) with earlier methods of management. Between 1960 and 1984, 137 children with chronic ulcerative colitis underwent surgery (mean duration of follow-up, 7.1 years). In 91 patients, the procedures were a total proctocolectomy with ileostomy or Kock pouch (66) or a lesser colectomy with either an ileostomy (16) or an ileorectal anastomosis (9) (group I). Forty-six patients underwent an ileoanal anastomosis procedure (group II). Children in group I were more likely to have significant preoperative loss of weight, a debilitated condition, and malnutrition. Urgent or emergency surgical intervention was required in 25 percent of patients in group I but in only 4 percent of patients in group II. Trends included 1) a younger age at operation in group II, 2) a higher mortality in group I (7.7 percent) than group II (0 percent), and 3) a higher perioperative mortality with emergency operations (23 percent) than elective procedures (1.6 percent). In group I, 98 percent of patients had an abdominal ostomy, but no patients in group II had an abdominal ostomy. The children with an ileoanal anastomosis had an average of 4.8 stools during waking hours and 1.3 stools each night. On the basis of this experience, the authors recommend use of the ileoanal anastomosis procedure in the surgical treatment of chronic ulcerative colitis in children. 
3	Magnetic motor-evoked potentials in epilepsy: effects of the disease and of anticonvulsant medication. Magnetic motor-evoked potentials were recorded in 53 patients with medically intractable, mainly temporal lobe epilepsy and compared with potentials of 110 healthy volunteers. The motor-evoked potentials were reevaluated in 16 of the 53 patients after substantial reduction of antiepileptic drug doses. The objective was to assess the effect of epilepsy and of anticonvulsant medication on the central motor system. In subjects receiving antiepileptic treatment, cortical threshold intensities were markedly elevated and peripheral latencies were prolonged. Cortical threshold intensities and peripheral latencies decreased to approach control values after anticonvulsant medication was reduced but were increased in patients treated with 2 or 3 anticonvulsant agents instead of 1. Additionally, high levels of interictal epileptiform activity and a high frequency of seizures significantly decreased the central motor conduction time and, in part, threshold intensities. The central motor conduction time was further diminished after reduction of anticonvulsant treatment and increased when several drugs were administered. The duration of epilepsy, the location of the epileptic focus, and the type of the epileptic seizure did not affect motor-evoked potentials. Conclusively, central motor pathways are endogenously facilitated by epileptiform activity even if clinical signs of their involvement are absent. Anticonvulsant medication exerts major reversible effects on magnetic motor-evoked potentials. 
5	Mechanisms of hemolysis and anemia associated with acute antepartum pyelonephritis. Anemia develops in about a fourth of women whose pregnancy is complicated by pyelonephritis, although its exact mechanism has not been defined clearly. In this study of 18 women with antepartum pyelonephritis, although only a third had anemia (hematocrit less than 30 vol/dl), there was evidence for hemolysis in all 18. Specifically there was a mean decrease in hematocrit of 5 vol/dl from admission to discharge. With scanning electron microscopy, we compared erythrocyte morphologic aberrations that were found in women with renal infection with those of normally pregnant women, and the former had significantly increased proportions of echinocytes in particular, but schistocytes and spherocytes were increased also (total 10.3% vs 1.4%, p less than 0.0001). These changes, especially echinocytosis, have been induced in vitro by lipopolysaccharide, and they are known to lead to premature red blood cell destruction in vivo. We conclude that hemolysis with subsequent anemia in pregnant women with pyelonephritis is caused by lipopolysaccharide-induced red blood cell membrane damage. 
4	A multifactorial analysis of mortality and morbidity in perforated peptic ulcer disease. Perforated peptic ulcer disease remains a source of considerable morbidity and mortality, and the suggested methods of surgical therapy are diverse. We reviewed the course of 113 patients who were treated surgically and identified 14 factors that influenced the morbidity or mortality rates, or both. Multiple regression analysis showed that the number of coexisting medical conditions, a lower mean blood pressure level and the duration of acute perforation were independent risk factors for death, while age, use of a bronchodilator, a lower mean blood pressure level and the number of coexisting medical conditions correlated positively with all complications. A duodenal site was independently favorable with respect to all complications. The type of operation performed either simple closure, vagotomy and drainage or resection, did not influence morbidity or mortality. The most severely ill patients also did not benefit from any particular type of operation in the short term. Long term results were improved with definitive operation, as measured by the Visick classification and the need for reoperations. Definitive operations are recommended for virtually all patients with perforated peptic ulcer. 
4	Sympathetic neural contribution to salt-induced hypertension in Dahl rats. The Dahl strain provides a model for examining mechanisms involved in the genetic sensitivity or resistance to salt-induced hypertension. Dahl salt-sensitive rats develop hypertension when fed a high salt diet; Dahl salt-resistant rats remain normotensive. Based on early experiments, it was thought that hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive rats epitomized the overriding importance of renal and humoral mechanisms in salt-induced hypertension, but studies in the past 15 years have demonstrated that alterations in sympathetic neural mechanisms also participate critically in the genetic predisposition to salt-induced hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. This article briefly reviews sympathetic neural mechanisms in Dahl rats, including evidence for a role of afferent baroreceptor as well as central neural and peripheral adrenergic mechanisms in salt-induced hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. 
3	OKT3 encephalopathy. OKT3 therapy for induction immunosuppression in a patient who underwent renal transplantation produced obtundation and quadriparesis associated with computed tomographic scan evidence of brain edema. These findings resolved over 3 days with supportive therapy and OKT3 withdrawal. 
4	Incidental blood pressure elevations: a MIRNET project. BACKGROUND. A prospective study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of hypertension in office patients with an incidental diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg. METHODS. During routine screening of 14,890 patients, 174 patients with elevated diastolic blood pressures but no previous diagnosis of hypertension were identified over a 3-month period. Only 115 (64%) returned as requested for two subsequent blood pressure readings. RESULTS. Sixty percent of those returning fit the definition for hypertension using the criteria of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hypertension. Sixty-nine percent (43/62) of the men and 49% (26/53) of the women were hypertensive. Women under 40 years old were less likely to be hypertensive, but age did not predict hypertension in men. Among those patients with a diastolic pressure reading below 105 mm Hg, progressively higher diastolic readings on the first visit did not predict a higher probability of hypertension. Among those patients with a diastolic pressure reading above 105 mm Hg, however, 90% (9/10) were hypertensive. CONCLUSIONS. Physicians should take incidental elevation of diastolic pressure seriously because of the high prevalence of confirmed hypertension in this group of patients. 
4	Changes in quality of care for five diseases measured by implicit review, 1981 to 1986 We measured quality of care before and after implementation of the prospective payment system. We developed a structured implicit review form and applied it to a sample of 1366 Medicare patients with congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident, or hip fracture who were hospitalized in 1981-1982 or 1985-1986. Very poor quality of care was associated with increased death rates 30 days after admission (17% with very good care died vs 30% with very poor care). The quality of medical care improved between 1981-1982 and 1985-1986 (from 25% receiving poor or very poor care to 12%), although more patients were judged to have been discharged too soon and in unstable condition (7% vs 4%). Except for discharge planning processes, the quality of hospital care has continued to improve for Medicare patients despite, or because of, the introduction of the prospective payment system with its accompanying professional review organization review. 
5	Reclosure of disrupted abdominal incisions. We evaluated prospectively a technique of delayed reclosure of disrupted abdominal incisions. Forty-one consecutive postoperative obstetric and gynecologic patients with abdominal incisions that had opened because of infection, hematoma, or seroma and had intact fascia participated in the study. All wounds were first managed identically, with surgical drainage and debridement, for a minimum of 4 days. The patients then were randomized to either wound reclosure by a standardized en bloc technique (35) or healing by second intention (six). Reclosure was successful in 30 of 35 cases (85.7%). The mean time to complete healing was 15.8 days in successful cases, 67.2 days in failed cases, and 23.2 days for all patients who were reclosed. Failure to heal after reclosure was due to subcutaneous infection in two patients and seroma in three; these women were significantly heavier than those in whom reclosure was successful. There were no other major complications of wound reclosure. Patients randomized to healing by second intention required a mean of 71.8 days of wound care. The time to complete healing in the wound-reclosure group was significantly shorter compared with the group that healed by second intention (P = .002, log rank test). We conclude that en bloc reclosure of disrupted surgical incisions, compared with nonsurgical treatment, significantly decreases the time required for wound healing and has minimal morbidity. 
3	Cervicocephalic kinesthetic sensibility in patients with cervical pain. Head orientation in space makes use of multiple sensory afferents, among which the cervical proprioceptive cues could play a predominant role. To quantify the alteration of neck proprioception in patients with cervical pathology, we proposed a test for the clinical evaluation of the ability to relocate the head on the trunk after an active head movement, for 30 healthy subjects and 30 patients with cervical pain. The data demonstrated that this ability was significantly poorer in the patient group, indicating an alteration in neck proprioception. This test permits a discriminant classification of healthy and sick subjects, justifies proprioceptive rehabilitation programs, and allows a quantitative evaluation of their results. 
2	Colobronchial fistula: a rare complication of Crohn's colitis. A 29-yr-old white woman presented with chronic pneumonia in the left lower lobe and with left pleural effusion. She was known to have inflammatory bowel disease, but she was asymptomatic under maintenance treatment with 5-ASA. She received numerous antibiotic regimens according to susceptibility testing of microorganisms cultured from sputum and bronchial lavage and on an empiric basis was also given antituberculosis treatment, but there was no clinical improvement or change in the chest radiographic findings. Sputum was repeatedly examined and yielded, among other organisms, Clostridium inocuum, Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. On one microscopic examination of sputum, the presence of feculent material was suspected. A subsequent gastrografin enema revealed a cologastric and colobronchial fistula between the splenic flexture of the colon and the greater curve of the stomach and the bronchial system. Segmental resection of the colon and resection of the lower lobe of the left lung were performed. Histologic findings of the resected colon were consistent with Crohn's disease. After a long period of postoperative recovery, the patient returned to good general health and well-being. To our knowledge, a colobronchial fistula caused by Crohn's colitis has not been previously reported. 
2	A new method for mapping hepatic subsegment: counterstaining identification technique. Hepatic subsegmentectomy requires identification of the borders of tumor-bearing subsegment, usually achieved by injecting dye into the portal veins feeding the domain. We describe an alternative technique for performing systematic subsegmentectomy in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, in whom hepatic arterial and portal venous embolizations were already performed as a preoperative adjuvant. Under ultrasonic guidance, each of the neighboring portal units is sequentially stained, thus defining the avascular subsegment to be resected as the nonstaining area. This allows the subsegment to be totally resected. This counterstaining identification technique can be used for all subsegments undergoing complete embolization and for other situations in which the usual staining method is impossible because of the presence of arterioportal shunting or portal tumor thrombus. 
1	Prevalence of common and dysplastic naevi in a Swedish population. The naevus profile was examined in a Swedish population that was randomly selected from a census file. The participation rate was considered high at 82%. The number of common naevi (CN) and the prevalence of dysplastic naevi (DN) were investigated in 379 subjects (aged 30-50 years). The mean total body count of CN greater than or equal to 2 mm was 67 (range 1-300). As many as 22% of the population had 100 naevi or more and only 18% had less than 25. The counts were not influenced by age or sex. DN were diagnosed clinically in 18% (CI 14-22%) of the subjects and histologically in 8% (CI 5-11%). Subjects with dysplastic naevi had a significantly larger number of common naevi and a more sun-sensitive skin type than subjects without DN, P less than 0.001. 
1	Matched group study of surgical resection versus cobalt-60 plaque radiotherapy for primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma. We report the results of a nonrandomized, matched-group, survival and visual preservation study of patients with a choroidal or ciliary body melanoma managed by microsurgical resection of the tumor versus cobalt-60 episcleral plaque radiotherapy. Each treatment group consisted of 30 patients. All patients were matched on a case-by-case basis in terms of tumor size (largest linear tumor dimension), location of the anterior tumor margin relative to the ora serrata, location of the posterior tumor margin relative to the equator, and age at the time of treatment. Although the estimated actuarial 5-year survival probability was slightly greater in the resection group (85.2%) than in the cobalt plaque group (81.8%), this difference was neither clinically impressive nor statistically significant. In contrast, there was a substantially higher rate of early posttreatment severe visual loss in the resection group (P = .0008, Mantel-Haenszel test). 
4	An in vitro evaluation of an artificial heart. Interactions between human blood and the Penn State Artificial Heart were examined in vitro to study the effects of various operating conditions on the hematologic response. A dual-loop recirculating flow system that accommodated human blood was developed and blood was subjected for 3 hr to various operating conditions known to alter fluid mechanics in the artificial ventricle. The operating conditions investigated were: 60 beats/min at 50% systolic duration, 60 beats/min at 30% systolic duration, and 90 beats/min at 50% systolic duration. Quantification of plasma free hemoglobin provided a direct indicator of hemolysis in the flow system. Platelet number and beta-thromboglobulin levels were monitored to investigate thrombotic activity, and levels of complement 3a were measured to examine complement system activation. The system was effective in demonstrating the relative hemolytic properties of the operating conditions. Ninety beats/min induced 37% more hemolysis than 60 beats/min at 50% systolic duration, and 50% systolic duration induced 32% more hemolysis than 30% systolic duration at 60 beats/min. There were no statistically significant changes in either platelet number or beta-thromboglobulin levels during the 3 hr recirculation period. Increases were seen in complement 3a levels, but these appeared to be surface-induced and not sensitive to the different operating conditions. These studies demonstrate the usefulness of the flow system in examining the relative hemolytic properties of the artificial ventricle, and suggest that bulk turbulent stresses may play a more important role than laminar wall shear stresses in mediating blood damage in this artificial ventricle. 
4	Calcium regulating hormones in essential hypertension. Importance of gender. Alterations of calcium metabolism have been described in human essential hypertension and experimental hypertension. We investigated the interrelationship of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) in patients with untreated essential hypertension as compared to normotensive controls. The hypertensive subjects (n = 75; 43 men, 32 women) had a mean blood pressure of 138 +/- 8/95 +/- 5 mm Hg as compared with 120 +/- 11/80 +/- 8 in the normotensive group (n = 40; 22 men, 18 women). Serum PTH was measured with an intact molecule immunochemiluminometric assay and 1,25(OH)2D was measured with radioimmunoassay after HPLC separation. Hypertensive men had PTH levels that were 36% higher than normotensive men (5.3 +/- 2.9 v 3.9 +/- 0.8 pmol/L, P = .005). When blood pressure was analyzed as a continuous variable, there was a direct correlation between it and serum PTH in men (r = .31, P = .004). In women, by contrast, there was no difference in serum PTH between hypertensive and normotensive subjects and no relationship between blood pressure and the serum PTH concentration. Blood pressure was inversely correlated with serum phosphorus levels in both sexes (r = -0.20, P = .04). In men, the elevated serum PTH levels and depressed serum phosphorus levels would have predicted that serum 1,25(OH)2D would be higher in the hypertensive subjects. However, that was not observed, as serum 1,25(OH)2D was slightly lower in hypertensive (38.3 +/- 15.2 pg/mL) than normotensive men (42.7 +/- 11.3, P = .21). 
4	Extracorporeal LDL cholesterol removal: role of LDL-pheresis in combination with other hypolipidemic therapy to regress vascular disease. The direct relationship between hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis has resulted in formal cholesterol-lowering recommendations for patients at increased risk. The incomplete response to therapy of some forms of hypercholesterolemia as well as not uncommon drug intolerance prompted the development of extracorporeal techniques to reduce serum cholesterol levels. Nonhuman primate data and an analysis of human cholesterol epidemiology and reduction trials were used to establish guidelines that would maximize the likelihood of stabilizing or regressing established coronary artery atherosclerosis. These goals are a total cholesterol (TC) level of less than or equal to 150 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and a ratio of TC to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) of less than 2.8. Selective, extracorporeal removal of LDL cholesterol (LDL-pheresis) was combined with diet and hypolipidemic drugs in a pilot study at The Rogosin Institute to achieve these lipid end-points. Technical aspects of LDL-pheresis, the background rationale for its use as part of a combined hypolipidemic therapy, the initial experience at The Rogosin Institute, and plans for future studies and applications are presented. 
3	Interactions between substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, taurine and excitatory amino acids in the spinal cord. Using in vivo microdialysis in the dorsal spinal cord of the rat, we have previously observed increases in glutamate and aspartate during exposure to a noxious stimulus. The present investigation was designed to determine whether these increases may be mediated by substance P. Infusion of 1 mM of substance P in the dialysis fluid increased the concentrations of glutamate and aspartate, similar to the response seen during noxious stimulation. In addition, substance P also increased the concentrations of the inhibitory amino acids glycine and taurine. Calcitonin gene-related peptide, previously shown to enhance substance P-induced biting and scratching behavior, produced no effect on amino acid release by itself but potentiated the apparent release of taurine by substance P. To assess the importance of substance P-induced amino acid release in sensory processing, we examined the influence of taurine and of excitatory amino acid antagonists on the biting and scratching behavior produced by excitatory amino acids and substance P. Taurine selectively inhibited only substance P-induced biting and scratching while excitatory amino acid antagonists inhibited only excitatory amino acid-induced behavior. To further explore the ability of taurine to inhibit the substance P-induced behavior, 3 tests of nociception were then used. Pretreatment with taurine inhibited the nociceptive-related writhing behavior produced by an intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid in mice but failed to alter the latency of response in the hot plate or tail flick assay. 
5	Childhood blindness in Peru. A survey of childhood blindness in Peruvian children was done. Although most causes of blindness were due to congenital and hereditary conditions, measles accounted for almost 10% of blindness. With widespread measles immunization, this preventable cause of blindness in children can be eliminated or dramatically reduced. 
1	Depression of serum melatonin in patients with primary breast cancer is not due to an increased peripheral metabolism. Serum melatonin and its main metabolic product 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were determined in 17 patients with breast cancer (BC) with either a fresh primary tumor (nine) or a secondary tumor (eight) as well as in four patients with untreated benign breast disease (controls). Circadian rhythms were detected in all groups with acrophases around 2 AM for melatonin and around 3 AM for 6-sulfatoxymelatonin. The nocturnal melatonin and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations were significantly depressed in the group of patients with primary breast cancer compared with controls (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.025). The circadian amplitudes of melatonin and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin were also depressed by 81% (P less than 0.01) and 63% (P less than 0.01). In contrast, patients with secondary BC had nocturnal melatonin and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations and amplitudes similar to controls. These results demonstrate that the depression of circulating melatonin in patients with primary BC is not due to an enhanced degradation to 6-sulfatoxymelatonin in the liver but must be due to a reduced activity of the pineal gland. 
5	Two types of abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials in chronic cerebellar ataxias. To investigate subclinical sensory impairment in spinocerebellar degenerations, median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were examined in 16 patients with chronic cerebellar ataxia who were originally diagnosed by clinical neurologists as having olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA). Two types of abnormal SEP patterns were found in six patients. Two patients had the SEP pattern of peripheral neuropathy, which was also detected by peripheral sensory nerve conduction studies. Four patients had abnormal SEPs seen in patients with the lesions in the central nervous system (dorsal column, medial lemniscus). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple sclerosis (MS). It is possible that clinically diagnosed OPCA sometimes includes a similar form of Friedreich's ataxia with subclinical sensory fiber neuropathy detected by SEPs and peripheral sensory conduction studies. In cases of lesions in the central nervous system demonstrated by both SEPs and MRI, there must be a follow-up in order to make a final diagnosis. In those cases, an alternative diagnosis of MS must be considered when the temporal profile of symptoms and signs characteristic of MS is observed. 
4	Acute rheumatic fever in West Virginia. Not just a disease of children. Rheumatic fever is a poststreptococcal disease that is receiving renewed attention by the medical community. We describe a recent increase in the number of observed cases of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) in West Virginia. This is the fifth report of a recent increase in the incidence of ARF in the Ohio Valley area in the last 4 years. In contrast to the other reports, nearly two thirds of our cases of ARF were in adults, more than half of whom had suffered previous bouts of ARF. In these adults with recurrences, none was taking prophylactic penicillin at the time of presentation. Carditis was present in seven adults, two without a history of carditis. Arthritis was present in all adult patients. These data indicate a possible geographic phenomenon related to the increased number of observed cases of ARF and document that ARF is not simply a disease of childhood. Furthermore, our findings highlight the need for extended penicillin prophylaxis for secondary prevention of ARF, especially for those with an increased risk of acquiring a streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection. 
4	Outcome and predictors of outcome in pediatric submersion victims receiving prehospital care in King County, Washington Predictors of outcome in pediatric submersion victims treated by Seattle and King County's prehospital emergency services were studied. Victims less than 20 years old were identified from hospital admissions and paramedic and medical examiners' reports. The proportion of fatal or severe outcomes in patients were compared with various risk factors. Of 135 patients, 45 died and 5 had severe neurologic impairment. A subset of 38 victims found in cardiopulmonary arrest had a 32% survival rate, with 67% of survivors unimpaired or only mildly impaired. The two risk factors that occurred most commonly in victims who died or were severely impaired were submersion duration greater than 9 minutes (28 patients) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration longer than 25 minutes (20 patients). Both factors were ascertained in the prehospital phase of care. Submersion duration was associated with a steadily increasing risk of severe or fatal outcomes: 10% risk (7/67) for 0 to 5 minutes, 56% risk (5/9) for 6 to 9 minutes, 88% risk (21/25) for 10 to 25 minutes, 100% risk (4/4) for greater than 25 minutes. None of 20 children receiving greater than 25 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation escaped death or severe neurologic impairment. Our rates for saving all victims, particularly victims in cardiopulmonary arrest, are considerably higher than has been reported before the children. Prompt prehospital advanced cardiac life support is the most effective means of medical intervention for the pediatric submersion victim. Prehospital information provided the most valuable predictors of outcome. 
1	Salvage chemotherapy for patients with germ cell tumors. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center experience (1979-1989). Twenty-eight of 124 (23%) advanced germ cell tumor (GCT) patients who were treated on four successive platin-based induction regimens and who failed to achieve a durable complete response (CR) remain alive (median follow-up, 50 months). An analysis of prognostic factors for response and survival was conducted on the 94 patients who received salvage chemotherapy. Survival and/or response to salvage therapy were significantly enhanced for patients with a prior CR to induction chemotherapy, treatment with a cisplatin-based salvage regimen, a testis primary site, a normal serum human chorionic gonadotropin level, a normal serum lactate dehydrogenase level, one site of metastasis, and an Indiana Class of 6 or less. Patients with a prior incomplete response (IR) had a particularly poor prognosis (P = 0.00007) with only 4 of 52 (9%) patients alive (median follow-up, 37 months) compared with 15 of 42 (36%) patients with a prior best response of a CR (median follow-up, 35 months). The poor survival of patients who fail to achieve a durable CR to induction chemotherapy warrants the continued investigation of new salvage therapy. The identification of prognostic features may direct salvage therapy and aid in the interpretation of clinical trials of salvage regimens. 
2	Hepatic lesions in the rabbit induced by acoustic cavitation. Tissue damage during shock-wave lithotripsy is presumably secondary to cavitation phenomena involving the collapsus of gas bubbles in a fluid. To enhance shock-wave-related hepatic lesions, intravascular gas microbubbles were administered. Three groups of eight rabbits each received either 500 shock waves focused on the right hepatic lobe (group 1), gas microbubbles as a mixture of 50 cm3 of air with 50 cm3 of gelatin infused through an arterial catheter (group 2), or 500 shock waves and gas microbubbles simultaneously (group 3). In group 1, two animals had two to three subcapsular hepatic hematomas (diameter, less than 5 mm) and five had one to five intraparenchymal hematomas (less than 1 mm). In group 2, a moderate liver congestion was observed in three animals. In group 3, all animals had numerous subcapsular and intraperenchymal hematomas (2-30 mm). The hematomas were centered around the portal spaces, associated with lacunae (0.5-5 mm in diameter). Hematomas were also present on the anterior wall of intraabdominal organs. It was concluded that intravascular infusion of gas microbubbles into the path of a shock-wave generator dramatically enhances tissue damage. This technique, potentially useful in the treatment of hepatic tumors, needs refinement to confine lesions in a more uniform pattern to the targeted parenchyma. 
4	High-normal blood pressure progression to hypertension in the Framingham Heart Study. This study sought to determine if individuals with high-normal blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure of 85-89 mm Hg) progress to hypertension more frequently than those with normal blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure less than 85 mm Hg), thus advancing to a higher cardiovascular risk category. Individuals from the Framingham Heart Study were placed in normal and high-normal blood pressure categories and followed for 26 years for the development of hypertension. With hypertension defined as a diastolic blood pressure of 95 mm Hg or greater or the initiation of antihypertensive therapy, 23.6% of men and 36.2% of women with normal blood pressure developed hypertension compared with 54.2% of men and 60.6% of women with high-normal blood pressure. The relative risk for the development of hypertension associated with high-normal blood pressure was 2.25 for men (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-2.8; p less than 0.0001) and 1.89 for women (95% CI, 1.5-2.3; p less than 0.0001). The age-adjusted relative risks estimated by the proportional hazards model were 3.36 for men and 3.37 for women (p less than 0.001). Among those risk factors examined, baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressure, Metropolitan relative weight, and change in weight over time were significant predictors of future hypertension in men and women whose initial blood pressure was normal. For men with high-normal blood pressure, systolic blood pressure and change in weight were identified as risk factors for future hypertension. These results indicate that the probability of individuals with blood pressure in the high-normal range developing hypertension is twofold to threefold higher than in those with normal blood pressure. 
1	Monoclonal antibody-purged autologous bone marrow transplantation therapy for multiple myeloma. Eleven patients with plasma cell dyscrasias underwent high-dose chemoradiotherapy and anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody (MoAb)-treated autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). The majority of patients had advanced Durie-Salmon stage myeloma at diagnosis, all were pretreated with chemotherapy, and six had received prior radiotherapy. At the time of ABMT, all patients demonstrated good performance status with Karnofsky score of 80% or greater and had less than 10% marrow tumor cells. Eight patients had residual monoclonal marrow plasma cells and 10 patients had paraprotein. Following high-dose melphalan and total body irradiation (TBI) there were seven complete responses, three partial responses, and one toxic death. Granulocytes greater than 500/mm3 were noted at a median of 21 (range 12 to 46) days posttransplant (PT) and untransfused platelets greater than 20,000/mm3 were noted at a median of 23 (12 to 53) days PT in 10 of the 11 patients. Natural killer cells and cytotoxic/suppressor T cells predominated early PT, with return of B cells at 3 months PT and normalization of T4:T8 ratio at 1 year PT. Less than 5% polyclonal marrow plasma cells were noted in all patients after transplant. Three of the seven complete responders have had return of paraprotein, two with myeloma, and have subsequently responded to alpha 2 interferon therapy. Eight patients are alive at 18.9 (8.9 to 43.1) months PT and four remain disease-free at 12.3, 17.5, 18.9, and 29 months PT. This preliminary study confirms that high-dose melphalan and TBI can achieve high response rates without unexpected toxicity in patients who have sensitive disease, and that MoAb-based purging techniques do not inhibit engraftment. Although the follow-up is short- and long-term outcome to be determined, relapses post-ABMT in these heavily pretreated patients suggest that ABMT or alternative treatment strategies should be evaluated earlier in the disease course. 
2	Milk protein enteropathy after acute infectious gastroenteritis: experimental and clinical observations. Animal models of allergic gastroenteropathy have defined both morphologic and physiologic changes that accompany the immune-mediated reaction to a dietary protein. In such models a broadening of the allergic response to other dietary proteins present in the gastrointestinal tract may occur during the localized anaphylactic reaction. The characteristic histologic intestinal findings of food protein-induced enteropathy may develop in selected infants with protracted diarrhea after infectious enteritis. Mechanisms underlying the induction of this response remain to be explained, but they may in part be similar to the broadening of the hypersensitivity response seen in experimental models of allergic enteropathy. 
3	Effect of epilepsy and sleep deprivation on the rate of benign epileptiform transients of sleep. Seventy-eight individuals with EEG records containing benign epileptiform transients of sleep (BETS) were identified among 7,400 records reviewed in our laboratory in a 6-year period. The records contained no other abnormality in 51 patients (65%). Genuine epileptiform discharges were found in the records of 19 patients; 14 had a history of epilepsy. Thirty-five patients (45%) had a proven history of epilepsy with antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. In the records of these patients, the mean number of BETS per unit of time was significantly higher (11.88 +/- 2) than in the record of the rest of the laboratory population with BETS (6.89 +/- 0.9) (p less than 0.02). Among five conventional surface montages, ipsilateral ear referential montage (IERM) showed a significantly higher number of BETS per unit of time than did any other surface montage used in the study. Thirty-nine records (50%) were performed after sleep deprivation (SD). When only IERM was considered, SD records showed a significantly higher number of BETS per unit of time (7.36 +/- 1.1) than did non-SD records (3.89 +/- 0.69) (p less than 0.01). Our findings support the general consensus that individual BETS may be normal variants, but a high occurrence of BETS in the record should raise suspicion of underlying epilepsy. 
1	Examination of HTLV-I integration in the skin lesions of various types of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL): independence of cutaneous-type ATL confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The various clinical features of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) are frequently accompanied by skin eruptions. Recently, a cutaneous type of ATL has been proposed by clinical studies. We analyzed the viral integration of human T-cell leukemia virus-I (HTLV-I) and monoclonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene in blood lymphocytes and the cutaneous infiltrated cells of nine ATL patients with various clinical features and skin eruptions. We classified them by the results of Southern blot analysis and propose a cutaneous-type ATL accordingly. In two of them, we could detect the monoclonal integration of HTLV-I and T-cell monoclonality only in the skin but not in the peripheral lymphocytes. We also demonstrated the time course study in one patient. Clinicians should be aware of the HTLV-I positive cutaneous T cell lymphoma that can be named cutaneous-type ATL. Examination of viral integration and T-cell monoclonality in skin lesions is required to make an exact diagnosis of cutaneous ATL. 
3	Progression of diabetic autonomic neuropathy over a decade in insulin-dependent diabetics. The prognosis for diabetics with autonomic neuropathy is little known. We therefore studied the progress of young insulin-dependent diabetics, first identified as having abnormal autonomic function 10-15 years ago. We have shown that the mortality of diabetics with symptomatic autonomic neuropathy is increased, but is less than previously reported. Mortality in asymptomatic diabetics with an isolated abnormality in autonomic function tests is not increased. The heart rate variability declines at 1.02 +/- 0.47 (SD) per annum in diabetics with an initially normal heart rate variability. While symptoms of autonomic neuropathy do not usually remit even over a decade, they do not commonly progress. Three groups of young insulin-dependent diabetics had heart rate variability tested between 1972 and 1977 and have been reviewed 10-15 years later. Group A (n = 49) had symptomatic autonomic neuropathy and an abnormal heart rate variability (less than 12), Group B (n = 24) were asymptomatic yet had an abnormal heart rate variability and Group C (n = 38) were asymptomatic and had a normal heart rate variability (16-26). The 10-year survival in Group A (73.4 per cent) was less (P less than 0.05) than in Groups B (91.7 per cent) or C (89.5 per cent) which did not differ from each other. The 18 Group A deaths were due predominantly to renal failure (n = 4), myocardial infarction in patients with nephropathy (n = 3) and sudden unexpected death (n = 3). The chief symptoms of autonomic neuropathy--diarrhoea, postural hypotension and gustatory sweating, were very persistent but did not necessarily deteriorate or become disabling in the majority of patients. The development of autonomic symptoms in asymptomatic patients with abnormal heart rate variability was uncommon over a decade. 
4	Anginal symptoms without ischemic electrocardiographic changes during ambulatory monitoring in men with coronary artery disease. Episodes of angina pectoris without electrocardiographic (ECG) signs of myocardial ischemia during 24-hour ambulatory monitoring were studied in 128 patients with a history of stable angina, angiographically proven coronary artery disease and positive exercise test results. In all, 341 episodes of ischemic ECG changes (ST-segment depression greater than 1 mm for greater than 1 minute) and 190 episodes of angina pectoris were observed: 86 episodes consisted of both ECG changes and angina pectoris, 255 episodes consisted only of ECG changes, and 104 episodes only of angina pectoris. Duration and magnitude of ST-segment deviation and heart rate at the onset of ischemia were similar in the 86 symptomatic and the 255 asymptomatic episodes with ECG changes. The 104 episodes of angina pectoris without ECG changes were detected in 44 patients (34%) (group A); 29 of them had only episodes with angina pectoris and 15 patients had both--episodes of angina pectoris with and without ECG changes. In 84 patients (66%) (group B) angina pectoris without ECG changes was not observed; all episodes were accompanied by ischemic ECG changes in these patients. No differences in the angiographic extent of coronary artery disease and in exercise test data were seen in both groups A and B; however, maximal ST-segment depression during exercise testing was significantly greater in group B than in group A patients (2.4 +/- 0.8 mm vs 1.9 +/- 0.9 mm; p less than 0.05). 
4	Ventricular free-wall rupture after myocardial infarction. Treatment and outcome. Ventricular free-wall rupture remains one of the leading causes of death after myocardial infarction (MI). With increased abilities for diagnosis and resuscitation techniques, surgical correction of free-wall myocardial defects resulting from ischemia and necrosis may become a simple modality of treatment, resulting in improvement of the survival rate. We are reporting our experience with four patients with ventricular free-wall rupture after MI, with emphasis on clinical presentation, diagnosis, and surgical management. 
4	The long-term prognosis of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest but no inducible ventricular tachycardia. The long-term prognosis of patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest who do not have acute precipitating factors and in whom ventricular arrhythmias cannot be induced during baseline electrophysiologic testing is controversial. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term risk of recurrent sudden death and determine the clinical, angiographic, hemodynamic, and electrophysiologic predictors of recurrent cardiac arrest in such patients. Twenty-six (37%) of 71 consecutive patients with a single episode of aborted sudden death did not have inducible ventricular arrhythmias (less than 7 intraventricular responses) during baseline drug-free electrophysiologic study and they form the basis of this report. Their mean age was 54 +/- 13 (mean +/- SD) years and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.47 +/- 0.17. After a mean follow-up period of 16 months, 11 patients (42%) had a recurrent cardiac arrest (fatal in 10 patients). The actuarial incidence of recurrent cardiac arrest was 30 +/- 10% at 1 year and 55 +/- 13% at 3 years. Patients with LVEF less than or equal to 0.40 had a significantly higher occurrence of recurrent cardiac arrest than those with LVEF greater than 0.40 (p = 0.02; 1-year actuarial incidence of 57 +/- 17% versus 13 +/- 19%). Patients with recurrent sudden death had a significantly greater incidence of dilated cardiomyopathy (55% versus 7%; p = 0.02) and baseline frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs greater than 10/hr; 64% versus 17%, p = 0.036) or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (36% versus 0%; p = 0.37) than patients without these characteristics. 
5	Role of oxygen-derived free radicals in the pathogenesis of gastric mucosal lesions in rats. The role of oxygen-derived free radicals and lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of acute gastric mucosal erosion was investigated in rat models produced by burn shock stress, by treatment with regional hyperthermia, platelet activating factor, and compound 48/80, and by ischemia-reperfusion. In all experimental models, the increase in the gastric erosions and in TBA reactants in the gastric mucosa were significantly inhibited by the treatment with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and/or catalase. Pretreatment with allopurinol, a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, prevented considerably the gastric injury (a) induced by burn shock, (b) produced by treatment with compound 48/80, and (c) caused by ischemia-reperfusion. By the treatment with anti-rat neutrophil antibody, the gastric mucosal injuries induced by regional hyperthermia, platelet activating factor, and compound 48/80 were significantly inhibited; however, burn shock and ischemia-reperfusion injuries were not inhibited. These results suggest that oxygen-free radical and lipid peroxidation contribute to the formation of gastric mucosal lesions, and that the sources of oxygen radicals seem to be different among these experimental models. 
4	Neuropsychological outcome of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Thirty patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (15 with and 15 without postanoxic coma on admission) underwent a clinical examination and neuropsychological testing. In order to assess quality of life, they were compared to two matched control groups; 15 patients with previous myocardial infarction and 15 healthy subjects. None of the survivors showed severe neurologic impairment, and all had returned to self-sufficient physical activity. However, the behavior rating scale scores were significantly worse in patients with postanoxic coma. The processing ability linked to memory was significantly worse in the postanoxic coma group. Mood disorders were also observed in this group, but they did not have pathological significance. The remarkably low incidence of neurologic and psychological sequelae in these resuscitated patients, particularly in those with early clinical evidence of severe cerebral damage, is an encouraging result that supports the therapeutic systems development and efforts in the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 
5	Pancreatic duct abnormalities in gall stone disease: an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic study. This study was carried out to assess pancreatic duct abnormalities in gall stone disease. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatograms of 50 patients with gall stone disease were analysed and the results compared with those obtained in 33 patients investigated for cholestatic jaundice who were found to have a normal biliary tree (control group). Abnormal pancreatograms were obtained in 24 (48%) patients with gall stone disease and in only two (6%) in the control group; the differences were statistically significant (chi 2 = 14.3; p less than 0.001). The patients in the control group showed mild abnormalities as did those in the gall stone group. The frequency of various abnormalities were: mild 16 (32%), moderate five (10%), and severe three (6%). Pancreatic duct abnormalities were more severe and occurred more frequently in patients with gall stones who had stones in the biliary tree than in patients with a normal biliary tree (postcholecystectomy patients, 55% v 25%) but the difference between the two groups just failed to be significant (chi 2 = 3.34). In conclusion, nearly half of all patients with gall stone disease have pancreatic duct abnormalities and in 16% these were severe enough to be labelled as chronic pancreatitis. 
2	Prospective study of a prosthetic H-graft portacaval shunt. This study was undertaken to prospectively evaluate the 8-mm Gore-Tex interposition H-graft portacaval shunt. Thirty-six high-risk patients at the University of South Florida-affiliated hospitals received small-diameter shunts because of bleeding esophagogastric varices over a recent 2-year period. Portal vein and portal vein-inferior vena cava gradients were significantly reduced after shunting. These pressure changes were manifested clinically by the absence of variceal rebleeding and improvement of ascites; in addition, the incidence of encephalopathy was low. The 8-mm graft maintained hepatopedal flow in 67% of the patients, but reversal of flow did not result in complications commonly associated with poor portal perfusion. Graft thrombosis occurred in four (11%) patients. All grafts were successfully revised, three by operative revision and one by an interventional radiologist. Operative mortality was low (11%), and morbidity was unusual. The small-diameter H-graft portacaval shunt is a safe and effective method of treatment for bleeding esophagogastric varices. 
5	Helicobacter pylori and associated duodenal ulcer. Twenty three children with coexistent duodenal ulcer and Helicobacter pylori infection were treated with either two weeks of amoxycillin (25 mg/kg/day) in addition to six weeks of cimetidine, or cimetidine alone. Endoscopy with antral and duodenal biopsies for urease test, microaerophilic culture, and histological studies were performed at entry, six weeks, 12 weeks, and at six months. Children with persistent H pylori infection at six weeks were given a further two weeks' course of amoxycillin. H pylori persisted in all children not receiving amoxycillin treatment but cleared in six of the 13 children (46%) treated with amoxycillin. With failure of H pylori clearance at six months, only two out of six (33%) ulcers had healed and 50% of patients had experienced ulcer recurrence. In contrast, when H pylori remained cleared all ulcers healed and no ulcer recurred. Persistent H pylori infection was associated with persistent gastritis and duodenitis despite endoscopic evidence of ulcer healing. Detection and eradication of H pylori deserves particular attention in the routine management of duodenal ulceration in children. 
1	Acute renal failure in obstructive jaundice in cholangiocarcinoma. This study was aimed at defining the natural history of renal failure in obstructive jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma, which is an important health problem in northeastern Thailand. Sixty-four patients among a total of 130 patients with obstructive jaundice secondary to cholangiocarcinoma who developed acute renal failure were studied retrospectively. Analysis was made with respect to clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcome. The development of renal failure before surgery was observed in all patients. It was nonoliguric in 80% and was associated with severe jaundice, gram-negative infection (42%), hypotension (31%), hypoproteinemia (30%), hyponatremia (56%), and hypokalemia (63%). The mean duration of renal failure was 2 weeks. All patients underwent surgery for the relief of jaundice. Seventy-seven percent of the patients survived and had recovery of renal function after the relief of jaundice. Twenty-three percent of the patients died of infection. Clinical data highlight the higher serum bilirubin levels and the frequent occurrence of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypotension in renal failure. Their possible roles in contributing to the development of renal failure are discussed. 
4	Hexamethonium and midazolam terminate dysrhythmias and hypertension caused by intracerebroventricular bupivacaine in rabbits. Previous studies have demonstrated that bupivacaine administered directly into the central nervous system (CNS) is capable of producing signs of bupivacaine cardiovascular toxicity. To investigate the mechanisms by which bupivacaine may act within the CNS to produce cardiovascular toxicity, we studied four groups of halothane-anesthetized rabbits in which infusion of intracerebroventricular (icv) bupivacaine or intravenous (iv) phenylephrine resulted in dysrhythmias and hypertension. In group 1 (n = 5), icv bupivacaine (500 +/- 79 micrograms [mean +/- SEM]) produced dysrhythmias lasting 73 +/- 13 min, whereas icv saline caused no dysrhythmias or hypertension. In group 2 (n = 9), icv bupivacaine-induced hypertension and dysrhythmias were abolished by icv midazolam in 4.4 +/- 0.6 min, and when dysrhythmias and hypertension recurred (22 +/- 0.9 min), hexamethonium (10 mg/kg iv) promptly terminated dysrhythmias and hypertension (14 +/- 1 s). In group 3 (n = 10), icv bupivacaine-induced dysrhythmias and hypertension were not affected by increasing the inspired halothane concentration from 0.8 to 1.6%. In group 4 (n = 6), iv phenylephrine-induced dysrhythmias and hypertension were not affected by icv midazolam. These results suggest that icv bupivacaine produces dysrhythmias and hypertension by increasing autonomic nervous system (ANS) outflow from the brain stem. The finding that peripheral autonomic blockade by hexamethonium rapidly terminated dysrhythmias and hypertension supports this mechanism. We speculate that icv bupivacaine produces an increase in autonomic outflow by blockade of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons that are known to be the principal tonic inhibitors of the ANS. 
1	Molecular methods to detect the Philadelphia chromosome. The Ph1 chromosome has two molecular subtypes: a bcr-positive seen in CML and some cases of ALL, and the bcr-negative subtype mainly seen in ALL. In CML, because of the restriction of chromosome 22 breakpoints to the bcr, Southern analysis to detect bcr rearrangements also can be used to detect the Ph1 chromosome. In contrast, the translocation breakpoints on the Ph1 chromosome are scattered in ALL, so that other methods such as PFGE and PCR are necessary to detect the Ph1 chromosome. In both CML and ALL, use of these methods to detect molecular abnormalities may be superior to cytogenetics in detecting chromosomal abnormalities. Southern analysis also can be used in CML to map breakpoint locations within the bcr. This may offer prognostic information as to the length of chronic phase, but there is conflicting information as to the validity of this approach. The modified PCR (using cDNA from mRNA) can be used to detect the Ph1 chromosome and to define which of the molecular subtypes are present. The exquisite sensitivity of this method, which is capable of detecting as little as a single abnormal molecule of RNA or DNA, makes it suited for the detection of minimal residual disease in both CML and ALL. This is particularly useful after intensive therapies, such as bone marrow transplantation. Whether these low levels of fusion gene expression are of prognostic significance is still unclear. 
5	Dialysis arthropathy: a clinical, biochemical, radiological and histological study of 36 patients. Out of a population of 97 haemodialysis patients, 36 patients with dialysis arthropathy were identified. Dialysis arthropathy is a chronic symmetrical polyarthritis which affected 97 per cent of the patients who had been undergoing cuprophane haemodialysis for more than 10 years. It commonly affected the shoulders, hips, hands, knees and wrists, worsening with time and extending to other joints. Fifty-eight per cent of the patients complained of morning stiffness and 47 per cent complained of exacerbation of shoulder pain during or after haemodialysis. Half of the patients also suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome, which recurred and was associated with a long-lasting disability. The most common radiological abnormality was periarticular bone cysts, followed by articular erosions and a destructive spondyloarthropathy, but clinical symptoms were more common than radiological signs. Patients with dialysis arthropathy had a higher C-reactive protein level than patients without arthropathy (18.6 mg/l versus 11.4 mg/l), indicative of an inflammatory process. Some of the clinical manifestations of the disease correlated with levels of C-reactive protein and ferritin. Serum ferritin levels correlated strongly with the units of blood transfused in the past five years (RS = 0.83), and the logarithm of ferritin level correlated weakly with C-reactive protein (r = 0.32). Haemarthroses were documented in 19 per cent of patients. Mean serum beta 2-microglobulin was elevated in the patients with (57.3 mg/l) and without arthropathy (50.7 mg/l), and there was no difference in the parathormone or aluminium levels between these groups. Articular tissue was obtained in 25 patients; beta 2-microglobulin amyloid was present in 24. Larger deposits were present in the capsular tissue, and these appeared to replace collagen bundles in eight cases. Amyloid deposits replaced the lining layer in six cases. It is likely therefore that amyloid disrupts normal joint function by replacing normal joint tissue. Mild chronic synovitis with haemosiderin deposition were found in approximately 60 per cent of cases. These findings suggest that amyloid derived from beta 2-microglobulin has a primary role in the pathogenesis of dialysis arthropathy, but there was also evidence of inflammatory processes. It is suggested that iron overload or haemarthroses might contribute to the inflammation, but other factors, such as dialysis-related bioincompatibility reactions, may also have a role. 
5	The effect of low-dose warfarin on the risk of stroke in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. The Boston Area Anticoagulation Trial for Atrial Fibrillation Investigators BACKGROUND. Nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke, presumably from atrial thromboemboli. There is uncertainty about the efficacy and risks of long-term warfarin therapy to prevent stroke. METHODS. We conducted an unblinded, randomized, controlled trial of long-term, low-dose warfarin therapy (target prothrombin-time ratio, 1.2 to 1.5) in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation. The control group was not given warfarin but could choose to take aspirin. RESULTS. A total of 420 patients entered the trial (212 in the warfarin group and 208 in the control group) and were followed for an average of 2.2 years. Prothrombin times in the warfarin group were in the target range 83 percent of the time. Only 10 percent of the patients assigned to receive warfarin discontinued the drug permanently. There were 2 strokes in the warfarin group (incidence, 0.41 percent per year) as compared with 13 strokes in the control group (incidence, 2.98 percent per year), for a reduction of 86 percent in the risk of stroke (warfarin:control incidence ratio = 0.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.49; P = 0.0022). There were 37 deaths altogether. The death rate was markedly lower in the warfarin group than in the control group: 2.25 percent as compared with 5.97 percent per year, for an incidence ratio of 0.38 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.17 to 0.82; P = 0.005). There was one fatal hemorrhage in each group. The frequency of bleeding events that led to hospitalization or transfusion was essentially the same in both groups. The warfarin group had a higher rate of minor hemorrhage than the control group (38 vs. 21 patients). CONCLUSIONS. Long-term low-dose warfarin therapy is highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation, and can be quite safe with careful monitoring. 
1	Clinical recognition and evaluation of peptic ulcer disease. When a patient has epigastric pain that worsens 1 to 3 hours after meals, the possibility of peptic ulcer disease should be considered. Completely typical clinical presentations in patients younger than age 50 justify empirical therapy when no physical or laboratory findings suggest a mimicking disorder. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy should be undertaken when response to therapy is incomplete, symptoms recur quickly, or dyspeptic symptoms present for the first time in a patient older than age 50. When gastric ulcers are diagnosed radiographically, endoscopy and biopsy at multiple sites should be done to exclude malignant disease. Intractable duodenal ulcers may necessitate endoscopic biopsy of antral and duodenal mucosa to rule out an associated Helicobacter pylori infection, which may modify therapeutic approaches. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is rare but should be suspected when ulcer disease presents atypically or aggressively or in families. Diagnosis is not difficult to confirm. 
3	Gadolinium-MRI in acute transverse myelopathy. A patient with acute transverse myelopathy (ATM) had serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies before and after administration of gadolinium (Gd-DTPA). Gd-DTPA-MRI was useful in estimating the pathologic extent and residual deficit expected in ATM. 
4	Loss of nocturnal decline of blood pressure in hypertension due to chronic renal failure. The aim of this study was to assess the blood pressure profile of chronic renal failure in comparison with essential hypertension. Thirty hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure due to non-vascular nephropathies were matched by age, sex, and mean 24 h blood pressure, with 30 patients affected by uncomplicated mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. They were studied in an open hospital ward. Diet, meal times, sleep times, and activity schedules were standardized. Noninvasive, automatic, blood pressure recordings were performed for 48 h at sampling intervals of 15 min. The mean 24 h blood pressure almost coincided in the two groups. However, in essential hypertension a mean (+/- SD) nocturnal fall of systolic and diastolic blood pressure was found (12.7 +/- 3.8 and 12.9 +/- 4.8 mm Hg, respectively), while renal patients displayed an average nocturnal increase of 2.7 +/- 8.9 mm Hg and 3.7 +/- 7.8 (P less than .001). The renal patients had also higher heart rates, with a significantly blunted nocturnal fall (4.4 +/- 4.5 beats/min as compared to 9.3 +/- 3.1 beats/min of essential hypertension; P less than .001). Among the renal patients, the day-night blood pressure changes showed no significant correlation with age, creatinine clearance, hematocrit, nocturnal change in heart rate, or day or night mean blood pressure levels. These data suggest that an abnormal day-night pattern of blood pressure is present in chronic renal failure patients independently from external interfering factors. Hence, casual measurements of blood pressure confined to daytime may underestimate a hypertensive condition associated with chronic renal failure. 
4	Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: impact of prostanoids in the perioperative period. A prospective study of 10 neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and five controls to determine the importance of prostanoid concentrations perioperatively and the relation with persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is reported. In neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia postoperative concentrations of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane B2 rose significantly and were higher during episodes of PPH; this rise may provoke PPH and subsequent right to left shunting. 
4	Abnormal baroreflex control of heart rate in decompensated congestive heart failure and reversal after compensation. Congestive heart failure (CHF) causes impairment of baroreflex control of heart rate (HR). To determine if this derangement is reversible, the cardiac chronotropic control was assessed in 10 patients with class IV chronic CHF of various etiologies before and after compensation achieved by bed rest, salt restriction, diuretics and vasodilators. Mean time between the 2 studies was 15 +/- 3 days. The management was modified 3 days before the second autonomic evaluation, so as to reestablish the same diet and pharmacologic conditions of the previous study. Compensation led to significant reduction in symptom-based class, body weight, and pulmonary and systemic congestion. Mean +/- standard error of the mean HR responses (beats/min) before and after compensation were, respectively: (1) to atropine (0.04 mg/kg): 10 +/- 2 and 27 +/- 2 (p less than 0.01); (2) to handgrip (30% maximum capacity, 1 minute): 9 +/- 2 and 19 +/- 3 (p less than 0.005); (3) to headup tilt (5 minutes): 4 +/- 3 and 20 +/- 4 (p less than 0.005). Mean +/- standard error of the mean baroreflex sensitivity (ms/mm Hg) of RR responses to phenylephrine and amyl nitrate-induced changes in systolic pressure was, respectively, in each condition: phenylephrine, 0.9 +/- 0.2 and 8 +/- 2.3 (p less than 0.05); amyl nitrate, 0.3 +/- 0.2 and 4.1 +/- 1.1 (p less than 0.05). A significant correlation between improvement in HR responses to atropine and tilt and changes in body weight was obtained. These findings show a reversible component of impaired baroreflex control of HR in severe CHF, possibly due to its congestive effects. 
3	Neonatal subependymal giant cell astrocytoma associated with tuberous sclerosis: MRI, CT, and ultrasound correlation. We describe a term newborn with tuberous sclerosis who presented with a neonatal brain tumor, diagnosed as a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. We compare the various imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of this tumor. 
5	Treatment of acute hydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage with serial lumbar puncture. Computed tomography demonstrated acute hydrocephalus less than or equal to 72 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage in 24 (23%) of 104 patients. Of these 24 patients, six (25%) had no impairment of consciousness. In nine (11%) of the remaining 80 patients, acute hydrocephalus developed within 1 week after subarachnoid hemorrhage. With the exception of three patients, all 104 patients received antifibrinolytic treatment. Delayed clinical deterioration from acute hydrocephalus occurred in seven (29%) of the 24 patients with acute hydrocephalus on admission and in six (8%) of the remaining 80 patients. Serial lumbar puncture was performed in 17 patients. Twelve (71%) of the 17 patients treated with serial lumbar puncture, including 10 (77%) of the 13 patients with delayed deterioration from acute hydrocephalus after admission, achieved improvement in the level of consciousness. Four of these 17 patients (4% of all 104 patients) required an internal shunt. No patient deteriorated from coning following serial lumbar puncture. The rebleeding rate within 12 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage in hydrocephalic patients with serial lumbar puncture was not higher than the rate in those without hydrocephalus (two [12%] of 17 versus nine [13%] of 71). Neither meningitis nor ventriculitis was observed. We conclude that if neither a hematoma with a mass effect nor an obstructive element exists, cerebrospinal fluid drainage with serial lumbar puncture is a good alternative to ventricular drainage in patients with acute hydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
2	Successful control of bleeding from gastric antral vascular ectasia (watermelon stomach) by laser photocoagulation. We report a case of gastric antral vascular ectasia in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis in whom chronic blood loss was a major problem. She required repeated blood transfusions that were complicated by reactions and still had persistent anaemia. She was treated with laser phototherapy in the form of quadrantic photocoagulation with a neodynium yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser. This greatly improved the endoscopic appearance of the gastric lesions and effectively controlled blood loss. She required no further transfusions. Bleeding recurred after 11 months which was controlled by further laser photocoagulation. 
3	Single unit analysis of the human ventral thalamic nuclear group. Activity correlated with movement. During neurosurgical operations for the relief of movement disorders, single thalamic neurons (n = 107) were identified with activity which was related to verbally cued active movements (movement-related cells). The activity of each neuron was examined during different contralateral movements in order to determine the movement which was associated with the most consistent and pronounced change in firing rate (the optimal response). The optimal response was determined by analysis of histograms of neuronal activity which were constructed by using the onset of EMG activity to synchronize successive repetitions of the active movement. Movement-related cells exhibited optimal responses associated with such movements as making a fist, extension or flexion of the wrist, flexing or extending the elbow, pointing with the entire upper extremity, extending the tongue and lifting the leg. Most movement-related cells recorded in a single parasagittal plane in an individual patient had optimal responses related to movements involving the same part of the body. Movement-related cells were classified into those that were activated in response to somatosensory stimulation (combined cells, n = 20) and those which were not (voluntary cells, n = 87). Combined cells were activated in advance of EMG activity during active movement and so could be distinguished from cells responding only to sensory stimulation (sensory cells). Movement-related cells (combined and voluntary cell types) were located anterior to sensory cells and tended to show a mediolateral somatotopic organization parallel to that of sensory cells with cutaneous receptive fields. Combined cells responded to somatosensory stimulation of the same part of the body as that involved in the active movement related to the optimal response of the cell. Combined cells responding to passive movements of a joint always had their optimal response during active movement about the same joint. The activity of combined cells during parkinsonian tremor may clarify the role of sensory feedback in tremor. 
5	Postpartum hemorrhage: placenta accreta, uterine inversion, and puerperal hematomas. Puerperal hematomas, although rare, can be potentially morbid or life-threatening events. Early surgical management, including clot evacuation, layered closure, drainage, antibiotics, and fluid replacement (including blood), usually result in satisfactory outcome. Prevention is clearly preferable and often achievable with careful initial repair of episiotomies and lacerations. 
2	Should alcoholics compete equally for liver transplantation? The circumstances of liver transplantation are unique among organ transplantation because of the dire, absolute scarcity of donor livers and the predominance of one disease--alcohol-related end-stage liver disease--as the principal cause of liver failure. We propose that patients who develop end-stage liver disease through no fault of their own should have higher priority for receiving a liver transplant than those whose end-stage liver disease results from failure to obtain treatment for alcoholism. We base our proposal on considerations of fairness and on whether public support for liver transplantation can be maintained if, as a result of a first-come, first-served approach, patients with alcohol-related end-stage liver disease receive more than half the available donor livers. We conclude that since not all can live, priorities must be established for the use of scarce health care resources. 
3	Aids for visual impairment. This article provides only a flavour of the type and range of aids available to the visually impaired person. Many other aids for leisure, learning, and daily living are illustrated in the RNIB equipment and games catalogue. 
3	Pharmacologic treatment of noncognitive behavioral disturbances in elderly demented patients. Fifty-nine elderly residents of long-term care facilities who had DSM-III diagnoses of dementia were studied in an 8-week randomized, double-blind comparison trial of haloperidol, oxazepam, and diphenhydramine to test the efficacy of these agents in the treatment of clinically significant behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. All three agents demonstrated modest but significant efficacy as measured by clinician ratings of agitated behavior and activities of daily living. The absolute magnitude of improvement was greater for haloperidol and diphenhydramine than for oxazepam, but differences among groups did not approach statistical significance. Frequencies of acute adverse events during the trial were similar across the drug treatment groups. Although these drugs may differ in terms of long-term safety and efficacy, they appear to be equivalent for short-term management of agitated behavior in severely demented patients. 
4	A case of unilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy after radical neck dissection. We present a case of unilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy after bilateral radical neck dissection. Etiologic factors are discussed. 
5	Stair climbing as an exercise test to predict the postoperative complications of lung resection. Two years' experience. The results of a clinically performed preoperative stair climb was compared to the presence of postthoracotomy complications in the retrospective hospital record review of 54 adult men. The stair climb was a maximum of five flights (125 steps) performed at the patient's rate and terminated at his request. Pulmonary function measurements and facets of the stair climb physiology were also examined in reference to the presence, type, and severity of complications experienced. Most minor complications such as transient arrhythmias, atelectasis, and pneumonia were clearly not predicted by the stair climb performance. The ability to climb three flights preoperatively most clearly separated those patients having the longer postoperative intubation and hospital stay, greater frequency of complications, and cumulative complication score (p less than 0.005). This retrospective study did not have sufficient numbers of fatal cardiopulmonary complications to exclude the possibility that these may be predicted by the results of this simple test. 
3	Sensory visual testing in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: measures sensitive to change. Management decisions in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH; pseudotumor cerebri) are based on the presence and change of visual loss. To study this change, we evaluated tests of sensory visual function over time. We used the results of the right eye of 19 patients whose clinical status improved (decrease in papilledema grade), and compared the outcome measures of the initial and final examinations. Contrast sensitivity testing showed significant improvement in the middle and high spatial frequency targets. Snellen acuity and color tests did not change significantly over the same period. Both Goldmann and automated visual field grade significantly improved from the initial to the final visit, while the presence of a defect on confrontation visual fields did not. Numerical analyses of automated perimetry thresholds also showed significant improvement. Generalized loss, most pronounced on the nasal side of the visual field, was present on the initial examination. Generalized improvement followed, least in the central and inferior paracentral areas. Patients with IIH should be followed with contrast sensitivity testing and perimetry using a disease-specific strategy. 
5	Effect of activity on supraventricular tachyarrhythmias after coronary artery bypass surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient activities, professional staff activities, backrest position, and diurnal variations as factors that may contribute to the onset of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). The activities surrounding the recognition of first-onset SVT, as well as preoperative and postoperative data and patient characteristics were examined in 249 patients having CABG. One hundred seventy-three patients qualified for the study; 28% of these patients (n = 49) had SVT. No statistical difference was found between the subjects with SVT and those without SVT when sex, cross-clamp time, creatine kinase peak, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and number of bypasses were examined. Patients who had SVT were older than those who did not: 64.8 years for the SVT group versus 60.7 years for the non-SVT group (p less than 0.01). SVT was rare in the first 24 hours after surgery, whereas 60% of the cases occurred during the next 48 hours, without significant diurnal variation: mean time of onset was 11:50 AM. No particular activity of the patient or nurse influenced the onset of SVT during the postoperative period in this group. 
5	Primary balloon dilatation of coarctation of the aorta in neonates. Primary balloon dilatation of coarctation of the aorta was attempted in 10 consecutive neonates (age range 2-23 days). The coarctation site was crossed and the balloon inflated in all but one patient. In two patients with associated severe isthmal hypoplasia there was no change in the gradient after dilatation. In the remainder, the residual gradients were trivial and angiography showed complete relief of coarctation. Severe recoarctation developed 5-12 weeks after dilatation in five patients, each considered to have had an excellent initial result. The coarctation was rapidly progressive in three patients in whom Doppler studies within two weeks of the development of recoarctation had shown no significant gradient. In the other two patients progressive restenosis was charted by Doppler examinations over the course of 6-8 weeks. Three patients had a second, initially successful, dilatation procedure. One patient remained well with no residual gradient 18 weeks later. Stenosis recurred within eight weeks in the other two, and both have undergone successful surgical repair. Balloon dilatation of a native coarctation of the aorta gave excellent immediate results in most neonates. Severe isthmal hypoplasia is, however, a contraindication to balloon dilatation and early restenosis is an important problem. These results do not support the continued use of primary balloon dilatation of coarctation of the aorta in neonates. 
3	Neonatal monosodium glutamate abolishes corticotropin-releasing factor-induced epileptogenic activity in rats. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of rat corticotropin-releasing factor (rCRF) at doses of 5-20 micrograms in rats induces epileptogenic activity characterized by pacemaker-like spikes localized in the hippocampal leads. Such an effect was still present in rats neonatally treated with saline but was absent in those neonatally treated with monosodium glutamate (MSG), a treatment that caused marked changes in the concentration of several brain neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in hypothalamic nuclei where CRF is highly concentrated and is believed to induce endocrinologic and behavioral effects. The present results suggest the rCRF-induced spiking activity is mediated by activation of neuronal pathways sensitive to MSG neurotoxic effect. 
5	Prediction of outcome in acute pancreatitis: a comparative study of APACHE II, clinical assessment and multiple factor scoring systems. The APACHE II severity of disease classification system has been examined prospectively in 160 patients with acute pancreatitis. Using clinical and simple laboratory data APACHE II was able to provide useful discrimination between uncomplicated, complicated and fatal attacks within a few hours of admission. Peak APACHE II scores (recorded during the first 3 days) had a prognostic accuracy similar to the multiple factor scoring systems, but then incurred a similar delay. Patients could be graded according to their risk of death or of developing a major complication; no deaths occurred in patients with a peak APACHE II score less than 10. APACHE II can be repeated daily, uncomplicated attacks demonstrating falling scores in association with clinical improvement, in contrast to the rising scores associated with clinical deterioration in those dying early. APACHE II appears to reflect any continuing disease activity and may prove a useful means of monitoring the course of the illness and response to therapy. 
1	Surgical treatment of cardiac myxomas: long-term results. Between 1965 and 1988, 22 patients underwent 24 operations for cardiac myxomas. Two patients had the complex myxoma syndrome. Mitral valve replacement was required at initial operation in 2 patients. One patient died perioperatively, and 5 others died subsequently. The 16 surviving patients recently underwent evaluation at a mean duration of 9 years after operation. Ten are asymptomatic and 6 have New York Heart Association class II symptoms. Nine patients continue to be employed. Eleven are in sinus rhythm, 3 have permanent pacemakers, and 2 have chronic atrial arrhythmias. Echocardiography showed atrioventricular valve insufficiency in 3 patients and reduced contractility in 4, but no new tumor recurrences. The long-term prognosis of this relatively large group of patients with cardiac myxomas has been good. Patients without the complex myxoma syndrome had no recurrence, whereas 2 patients did require reoperation for mitral valve replacement. Long-term disability and chronic arrhythmias have been infrequent, and functional status and employability of these patients have been very good. 
3	Febrile status epilepticus As part of a study of status epilepticus in children (Maytal J, Shinnar S, Moshe SL, Alvarez LA. Pediatrics. 1989; 83:323-331); 44 children with febrile convulsions lasting more than 30 minutes were followed for a mean of 28 months (range 4 to 72). Thirty children were followed prospectively. Children with prior afebrile seizures or evidence of acute central nervous system infection were excluded. Nine (20%) children had prior neurological deficits. The duration of the febrile seizure was 0.5 to 1 hour in 41 cases (85%), 1 to 2 hours in 5 (10%), and greater than 2 hours in 2 children (5%). No child died or developed new neurological deficits following the seizures. The risk of recurrent seizures was increased, but only in the group with prior neurological abnormality. Six (66%) of these children had subsequent febrile seizures compared with 12 (34%) of the normal children (P = .08). Three (33%) had recurrent febrile status epilepticus compared with only 1 (3%) normal child (P = .023). The 2 children in the prospective arm of the study with recurrent febrile status epilepticus were both neurologically abnormal (P = .035). All 3 of the children who subsequently had afebrile seizures (2 prospective) were neurologically abnormal (P = .006 overall, P = .035 for prospective only). It is concluded that the occurrence of febrile status epilepticus in a neurologically impaired child is a risk factor for subsequent febrile as well as afebrile seizures. The occurrence of febrile status epilepticus in an otherwise normal child does not significantly increase the risk for subsequent febrile (brief or prolonged) or afebrile seizures in the first few years following the episode. 
2	Pharmacology of pravadoline: a new analgesic agent. Pravadoline is a new chemical entity with analgesic activity in humans. This report describes the pharmacology of pravadoline and compares the activity of pravadoline with that of two major classes of analgesics, the opioids and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Like the NSAIDs, pravadoline inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) in mouse brain both in vitro (IC50, 4.9 microM) and ex vivo (ED50, 20 mg/kg p.o.) and displayed antinociceptive activity in rodents subjected to a variety of chemical, thermal and mechanical nociceptive stimuli. Administration of pravadoline prevented the writhing response induced by i.p. administration of acetylcholine (ED50, 41 mg/kg p.o.) or PGE2 (ED50, 24 mg/kg p.o.) and prolonged the response latency induced by tail immersion in hot water at a temperature of 55 degrees C (minimum effective dose, 100 mg/kg s.c.). In the rat, treatment with pravadoline prevented acetic acid-induced writhing (ED50, 15 mg/kg p.o.), brewer's yeast-induced hyperalgesia (Randall-Selitto test) (minimum effective dose, 1 mg/kg p.o.), the nociceptive response induced by paw flexion in the adjuvant-arthritic rat (ED50, 41 mg/kg p.o.) and bradykinin-induced head and forepaw flexion (ED50, 78 mg/kg, p.o.). The antinociceptive activity of pravadoline cannot be explained by an opioid mechanism, because pravadoline-induced antinociception was not antagonized by naloxone (1 mg/kg s.c.) and pravadoline did not bind to opioid receptors at concentrations up to 10 microM. However, like the opioid analgesics, pravadoline diminished the electrically induced twitch response of mouse vas deferens preparations, but, in contrast to opioids, this action of pravadoline was not attenuated by naloxone. The possibility is discussed that this effect of pravadoline upon isolated tissues may contribute to its antinociceptive activity. In contrast to NSAIDs, pravadoline was more potent ex vivo as an inhibitor of the formation of PGs in brain vs. stomach. In addition, pravadoline failed to produce gastrointestinal lesions when administered p.o. to rats or mice, and did not possess significant anti-inflammatory activity at antinociceptive doses. Also unlike NSAIDs, pravadoline inhibited rat gastrointestinal transit when administered at doses similar to those which were antinociceptive. The overall pharmacologic profile of pravadoline suggests that the compound may be capable of managing more diverse or more severe pain than is achieved by anti-inflammatory analgesics, without producing side effects commonly associated with either the opioid or the nonopioid analgesics. 
1	Multimodality cisplatin treatment in nonresectable alpha-fetoprotein-positive hepatoma. Twenty-eight patients with alpha-fetoprotein-positive (AFP+) nonresectable hepatoma have been enrolled in a new multimodality Phase I, II program. Induction therapy consisted of 50 mg/m2 intravenous cisplatin followed by 2100 cGy irradiation to the tumor volume in seven fractions over 10 days. Hepatic arterial infusion of 50 mg/m2 cisplatin (IA-CDDP) was then administered at monthly intervals. Twenty-one patients have completed induction and at least two cycles of IA-CDDP. Twelve-month cumulative survival was 52% for all 28 patients and 69% for the 21 patients completing induction and IA-CDDP. Median survival has not yet been reached. Response rate (complete and partial) was 36% overall and 48% among the 21 patients who completed treatment. The improved survival of the present series of patients as well as the minimal hematologic toxicity suggests possible further integration of new modalities for therapy. 
5	Diagnosis, classification, and course of myelodysplastic syndromes. The myelodysplastic syndromes are bone marrow stem cell disorders that result in disorderly and ineffective hematopoiesis. They are prognostically heterogenous. Approximately one third of cases evolve to acute myeloid leukemia. Many additional cases terminate in severe bone marrow failure. The French-American-British Working Group classification of the myelodysplastic syndromes defines morphologic and prognostic groups. Cytogenetic and in vitro cell culture characteristics are important prognostic indicators. 
1	Single polypoid cystitis cystica and glandularis presenting as benign bladder tumor. A case report of a ten-year-old boy with a benign polypoid bladder tumor is presented. The rarity of benign or malignant bladder tumors in children is reviewed, as well as the possible etiology of this unique lesion. 
1	Induction of DNA fragmentation in chronic B-lymphocytic leukemia cells. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B cell type (B-CLL) is a neoplastic disorder characterized by the accumulation of small resting lymphocytes in the periphery. The phenotype of these cells suggests that they are "frozen" at an early stage of maturation. Glucocorticoid hormones are commonly used to treat patients with B-CLL, resulting in a reduction in the peripheral lymphocyte count by an undefined mechanism. Here we report that glucocorticoids stimulate DNA fragmentation characteristic of a suicide process known as apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) in suspensions of cells from patients with B-CLL. The effects can be mimicked by Ca2+ ionophore and involve a sustained increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Specific antibodies binding to membrane-associated IgM on the leukemic cells can also induce PCD by a similar mechanism. Phorbol esters block DNA fragmentation and cell killing in response to all of the agents, suggesting that activation of protein kinase C desensitizes the cells to PCD. Targeting the B-CLL cells with antibodies that induce an unbalanced, sustained Ca2+ increase may therefore represent a rational strategy for the destruction of leukemic cells. 
5	Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with L-tryptophan use. The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with the use of oral preparations of the amino acid L-tryptophan was recognized in late 1989. We describe the clinical and laboratory manifestations, pathological findings and early clinical course of 20 patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Prominent clinical findings included severe myalgias limiting function, fatigue, rashes, edema and weight gain, weight loss, muscle weakness and shortness of breath. Laboratory findings included eosinophilia (often marked), normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated aldolase with normal or low creatine kinase values. On biopsy fascial inflammation was always seen consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes and eosinophils in a perivascular distribution. Invasion of the vascular wall by lymphocytes was seen in 20%. Capillary and arteriolar endothelial cell thickening was found in most cases on electron microscopy and endothelial cell necrosis or mural invasion by lymphocytes was seen in 25% of cases. Two patients improved with no therapy. Ten patients responded to therapy with prednisone alone. Three patients have had progressive disease and one of these died. The relationship of this syndrome to previously described disease entities associated with eosinophilia is discussed. 
2	Decreased toxicity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils toward hepatocytes isolated from rats with acute inflammatory reaction. We have recently demonstrated that polymorphonuclear neutrophils were toxic to hepatocytes through a protease-mediated mechanism. Since synthesis of antiproteases is markedly increased during acute inflammatory reaction, the aim of this work was to investigate the toxicity of neutrophils against normal vs. inflammatory rat hepatocytes. Acute inflammatory reaction was induced by subcutaneous injection of turpentine 24 hr before the experiments. Hepatocytes from normal and turpentine-treated rats were isolated by collagenase digestion. They were incubated with human neutrophils stimulated by 1 mg/ml opsonized zymosan. Cytotoxicity was quantified by the percentage of alanine aminotransferase activity released by hepatocytes in culture medium after an 18-hr incubation period. By comparison to normal hepatocytes, inflammatory hepatocytes were more resistant to the toxicity of neutrophils. At a neutrophil/hepatocyte ratio of 20:1, the alanine aminotransferase activity releases were 53.7% +/- 5.4% (mean +/- 1 S.E.) and 27.4% +/- 4.8% for normal and inflammatory hepatocytes, respectively. Similarly, inflammatory hepatocytes were found to be less sensitive than normal hepatocytes to the toxic effect of purified neutrophil cathepsin G. In contrast, both types of hepatocytes exhibited the same sensitivity to H2O2 generated by a system consisting of glucose and glucose oxidase. Two arguments suggested that the resistance of inflammatory hepatocytes to protease toxicity was explained by an increased production of antiproteases by these cells: (a) when tested against cathepsin G and porcine pancreatic elastase activities, the protease inhibitory capacity of conditioned medium from inflammatory hepatocytes was higher than that of conditioned medium from normal hepatocytes; (b) conditioned medium from inflammatory hepatocytes markedly reduced the toxicity of stimulated neutrophils as that of cathepsin G. 
5	Bleeding time prolongation with streptokinase and its reduction with 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin. The mechanism by which treatment with thrombolytic agents causes bleeding is not known. Recently, frequency of bleeding events has been shown to correlate with bleeding time, particularly in individuals treated with aspirin. We examined the effects of streptokinase (20,000-60,000 IU/kg) on bleeding time in 40 rabbits pretreated with aspirin, a model for fibrinolytic therapy. We then tested the effects of 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) (0.3 microgram/kg), an agent known to reduce bleeding time in a variety of bleeding disorders, in 20 rabbits and compared the results with those of a control group of rabbits receiving normal saline placebo. Aspirin increased the bleeding time from a baseline mean +/- SEM value of 119 +/- 15 to 191 +/- 34 seconds in the control group and from 114 +/- 6 to 188 +/- 18 seconds in the experimental group. The addition of streptokinase increased the bleeding time to 592 +/- 119 seconds in the control group and 810 +/- 114 seconds in the experimental group (p = NS). Subsequent infusion of DDAVP decreased the bleeding time in the experimental group to 302 +/- 29 seconds (p less than 0.01 versus streptokinase) compared with 572 +/- 79 seconds (p = NS versus streptokinase) in the control animals given saline placebo. In a subset of rabbits receiving aspirin and streptokinase (40,000-60,000 IU/kg), samples were obtained for platelet aggregation (n = 16), von Willebrand factor antigen concentration (n = 17), and von Willebrand factor multimer distribution (n = 14). Maximal rates of ADP-induced platelet aggregation were not affected by DDAVP infusion, nor was the plasma concentration of von Willebrand factor antigen, quantified by an immunoradiometric assay, significantly affected by DDAVP infusion. Furthermore, the von Willebrand factor multimer ratio decreased with DDAVP administration. These findings indicate that aspirin and streptokinase combined result in a marked increase in bleeding time that can be reduced by DDAVP. This effect of DDAVP is not accompanied by an increase in platelet aggregation response, plasma von Willebrand factor antigen concentration, or von Willebrand factor multimer ratio. 
3	Hypertension as a risk factor for epilepsy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery. A prospective, consecutive series of 307 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ranging from Grades 1 to V according to the classification of Hunt and Hess on admission were evaluated to determine the incidence of epilepsy 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and surgery. Sixty-three patients had died and one patient was lost to follow-up. Twenty-nine patients developed epileptic seizures after the SAH and surgery. The mean time from the SAH to epileptic seizure varied from 0 days (day of the SAH) to 2 years (mean, 6.7 months). The seizures were classified as focal in 9 patients (31%) and as generalized in 20 patients (69%). All patients received anticonvulsant medication after more than one seizure. The risk factors for development of posthemorrhagic/postoperative epilepsy were, in order of importance: a history of hypertension; an infarct on late computed tomographic scan; and the duration of coma after the ictus. Of the 85 patients with histories of hypertension, 17 (20.0%) developed epilepsy. Only 12 (5.4%) of the 222 nonhypertensive patients developed epileptic seizures. The difference between the groups was significant (P = 0.0001). Computed tomographic scans were undertaken in 237 patients 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after the SAH and surgery. Postoperative epilepsy was significantly associated with infarcts visualized on computed tomographic scan (P = 0.0005). 
1	Increased DNA synthesis and repair-enzyme expression in lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia resistant to nitrogen mustards. Resistance to the nitrogen mustards in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) correlates with an enhanced removal of melphalan-induced DNA interstrand cross-links. This finding suggests that DNA repair enzymes may be involved in this process. The activity of 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase, which can release altered bases, including adducts at the N-7 position of guanine, was increased significantly in lymphocytes from patients with resistant CLL compared with those from untreated CLL patients. Since glycosylase activity varies with cell proliferation, the amount of [3H]thymidine incorporated into DNA was determined and found to be elevated almost threefold in lymphocytes from patients with resistant CLL. The ratio of glycosylase activity to level of thymidine incorporation did not differ between these two groups of patients. Northern blot analysis of ERCC1 gene (a putative DNA repair enzyme involved in nucleotide excision repair) expression in lymphocytes from patients with CLL revealed multiple gene transcripts (1.1, 3.4, and 3.8 kilobases). In addition, analysis of two samples revealed the presence of a 2.6-kilobase transcript. The 2.6-kilobase transcript was recognized by specific RNA probes that hybridize to antisense ERCC1 transcripts. Levels of expression of the 1.1-kilobase protein encoding transcript in lymphocytes from patients with resistant CLL were increased twofold to threefold above those of untreated patients with CLL. These results indicate that increased expression of ERCC1 and increased activity of 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase occur with the development of resistance to the nitrogen mustards in patients with CLL, suggesting a role for enhanced DNA repair in this process. 
4	Catheter modification of the atrioventricular junction with radiofrequency energy for control of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia. BACKGROUND. The utility of transcatheter application of radiofrequency energy to eliminate atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) was investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thirty-nine patients (mean age, 53 +/- 20 years; range 14-86 years) with medically refractory AVNRT underwent perinodal ablation with radiofrequency energy. A custom-designed 6F catheter with a large (3-mm-long) distal electrode and interelectrode pacing of 2 mm was used in the majority of cases. The catheter used for ablation was initially positioned across the tricuspid anulus to obtain the largest His bundle electrogram, then withdrawn to obtain the largest atrial:ventricular electrogram ratio, with a small His bundle electrogram (less than or equal to 100 microV). Each application of radiofrequency energy (350-550 kHz, 16.2 +/- 5.2 W) was stopped after 60 seconds or if PR prolongation or an impedance rise was noted. The endpoints of the procedure were persistent modification of atrioventricular nodal conduction (either first-degree atrioventricular block or impairment of ventriculoatrial conduction) and noninducibility of AVNRT before and during isoproterenol administration. Radiofrequency energy was applied a mean of 6.8 +/- 3.5 times per session. After a mean follow-up of 8 +/- 3.0 months, 32 of the 39 patients (82%) have been free of AVNRT, and did not have high grade AV block. Three patients (8%) developed complete atrioventricular block and had pacemakers implanted. Two patients had unsuccessful initial procedures, and two patients had initially successful ablations but had recurrences of tachycardia 4-6 weeks later. Elimination of AVNRT appeared to be due to effects on the retrograde fast pathway in most patients. CONCLUSIONS. Radiofrequency ablation of the perinodal right atrium appears to be safe and effective for treatment of typical AVNRT. 
5	Detection of breakpoint cluster region- negative and nonclonal hematopoiesis in vitro and in vivo after transplantation of cells selected in cultures of chronic myeloid leukemia marrow. Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome-positive clonogenic progenitors usually disappear within 4 to 6 weeks in long-term cultures established from the marrow of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In contrast, coexisting chromosomally normal hematopoietic cells are relatively well maintained. Thus, even though normal cells are initially undetectable, they may become the predominant population. Recently, we have begun to explore the potential of such cultures as a strategy for preparing CML marrow for autografting, and based on cytogenetic studies of the differential kinetics of Ph1-positive and Ph1-negative clonogenic cells, have chosen a 10-day period in culture to obtain maximal numbers of selectively enriched normal stem cells. Here we present the results of molecular analyses of the cells regenerated in vivo for the initial three CML patients to be treated using this approach by comparison with the differentiated cells generated by continued maintenance of an aliquot of the autograft in vitro (using a slightly modified culture feeding procedure to enhance the production and release of cells into the nonadherent fraction after 4 weeks) for the one patient whose genotype made molecular analysis of clonality status also possible. These analyses showed that cells with a rearranged breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene were not detectable by Southern blotting in either in vitro or in vivo populations of mature cells that might be assumed to represent the progeny of primitive cells present at the end of the initial 10 days in culture. Production of BCR-negative cells was also shown to be temporally correlated with the appearance of nonclonal hematopoietic cells both in culture and in vivo. These findings provide support for the view that prolonged maintenance of CML marrow cells in long-term culture may allow molecular characterization of both the BCR-genotype and clonality status of cells with in vivo regenerative potential. 
3	The community hospital-based stroke programs in North Carolina, Oregon and New York--V. Stroke diagnosis: factors influencing the diagnostic evaluation of patients following acute stroke. Among the 4129 patients of the Community Hospital-based Stroke Program, 30% had an unspecified stroke diagnosis. Since specific diagnosis and, perhaps, eventual treatment, derives in part from diagnostic testing, we examined the effect of clinical condition, geographic and demographic factors on the incidence of certain diagnostic tests after acute stroke. In this multivariable analysis, race, sex, history of hypertension and history of diabetes did not influence the chance of having any test, but older age strongly reduced the chances of receiving extensive evaluation. When CT scanning was available, the utilization of a CT as well as other diagnostic studies including cerebral angiography, radionuclide brain scan, EEG and EKG was increased. The odds of receiving a CT scan increased if the patient was married, and decreased with a history of previous stroke. A history of previous TIA increased the chance of having a cerebral angiogram while a history of cardiac disease decreased the chance. There were striking regional geographic differences in the use of CT, radionuclide brain scanning and cerebral angiography which may, in part, reflect differences between the availability of these technologies in urban and rural hospitals. These results indicate that evaluation of stroke patients remains heterogenous. 
5	An analysis of abnormalities of the retinoblastoma gene in human ovarian and endometrial carcinoma. The altered expression of the human retinoblastoma (RB) gene has been demonstrated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of RB and other tumors. To determine whether the RB gene might be involved in the pathogenesis of human ovarian and endometrial cancer, DNA from 24 human ovarian tumors, 3 normal ovaries, 3 endometrial carcinomas, and 1 endometrial hyperplasia was examined with an RB complementary DNA probe. Evidence for homozygous deletion of the RB gene was observed in only one specimen. Interestingly, the specimen was an endometrioid tumor of the ovary of low malignant potential (LMP). This patient experienced rapid progression of the tumor and died 8 months after diagnosis. Abnormalities of the RB gene may be involved in the aggressive biologic behavior of certain forms of ovarian carcinoma, particularly those of LMP. 
1	Relationship between lung asbestos fiber type and concentration and relative risk of mesothelioma. A case-control study. Lung tissue from 221 definite and probable cases of malignant mesothelioma reported to the Australian Mesothelioma Surveillance Program from January 1980 through December 1985 and from an age-sex frequency matched control series of 359 postmortem cases were examined by light microscopic (LM) and analytical transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX). Concentrations of total fibers (coated and uncoated) (LM), crocidolite, amosite, chrysotile, and unidentified amphibole (TEM) (fibers/g dry lung tissue) were measured. Fiber concentrations less than 10 microns in length and greater than or equal to 10 microns in length were separately quantified. By comparing cases (221) and controls (359 LM, 103 TEM), odds ratios for increasing fiber concentrations compared with less than 15,000 fibers/g (LM) and less than 200,000 fibers/g (TEM) (the respective detection limits) were calculated. Univariate analyses showed statistically significant dose-response relationships between odds ratio and fiber concentration for all fiber concentration measures. The relationship between log(odds ratio) and log(fiber concentration) was linear. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a model containing crocidolite greater than or equal to 10 microns, amosite less than 10 microns, and chrysotile less than 10 microns as explanatory variables best described the data. The odds ratios for a X10 increase in fiber concentration (fibers/micrograms) were as follows: crocidolite greater than or equal to 10 microns, 29.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6 to 241); chrysotile less than 10 microns, 15.7 (95% CI, 6.1 to 40); amosite less than 10 microns, 2.3 (95% CI, 1.0 to 5.3). An additive risk model gave similar results. In a subgroup of cases and controls with only chrysotile in the lungs, a significant trend in odds ratio with increasing fiber content was found. 
3	Low-level lead exposure in the prenatal and early preschool periods: language development. Inconsistent results continue to be reported from studies linking low-level lead exposure and child development. This inconsistency is seen for both prenatal exposure and exposure in the preschool years. The primary outcome measures in most reports are indices of cognitive development, including IQ. Verbal skills may be particularly vulnerable to toxic insult. The fact that 2 y of age is both a time of peak exposure and also a time of rapid language development suggests that this may be a critical period for such an effect. The later prenatal and early infancy period, at which time the nervous system is developing rapidly, may also be critical exposure period. We examined the relationship of maternal and cord blood lead (PbB) at birth and venous PbB at 6 mo, 2 y, and 3 y with language measures at 1, 2, and 3 y of age. The sample consisted of disadvantaged urban children. Multivariate analyses revealed no statistically significant relationship of either prenatal PbB or early preschool PbB with language measures after control of cofactors. Supplementary partial correlations revealed a marginal relationship of cord PbB and mean length of utterance (MLU), which describes a child's ability to form meaningful word combinations. Because this analysis was one of a large number of analyses with both positive and negative regression coefficients, the possibility that this was a chance effect was considered. If there is an effect of low-level lead exposure on language development, that effect is not robust. 
5	The hyperimmunoglobulinaemia E and recurrent infections syndrome in an adult [published erratum appears in Thorax 1990 Dec;45(12):984] A 27 year old white woman with a history of chronic eczema and episodes of serious infection of the chest, skin, and bone presented with acute respiratory failure. She was found to have a spontaneous right pneumothorax and a pneumatocele in the left upper lobe. Despite a left upper lobectomy she was left with chronic respiratory failure, bullous lung disease, and bilateral bronchiectasis. The hyperimmunoglobulinaemia E and recurrent infections syndrome was diagnosed only in adult life. 
4	Magnetic resonance imaging--the evaluation of choice in residual shunt after congenital heart disease surgery? Accurate anatomic diagnosis presents a dilemma in patients with residual shunt after corrective surgery for congenital heart disease. We describe a patient who, after atrial septal defect repair, developed dyspnea and central cyanosis despite normal pulmonary arterial pressures and right heart chamber size. A role for early MRI is suggested. 
4	Ascites after rupture of dissecting aortic aneurysm into the right atrium. We report successful repair of an aneurysmal aorta-right atrial fistula causing intractable ascites. The clamped "ascending aorta" was drained for mixed return after perfusion through the femoral vessels and opened during hypothermic arrest. Return cannulation through the fistula permitted definitive repair. 
5	Large telangiectatic focal nodular hyperplasia presenting with normal radionuclide studies: case report. A 9 cm-lesion of telangiectatic focal nodular hyperplasia was incidentally identified in a 31-yr-old female. Despite a typical appearance by X-ray computed tomography and ultrasonography, scintigraphy with technetium-99m-(99mTc) colloid, 99mTc-diethyliminodiacetic acid, and 99mTc-labeled red cells failed to demonstrate any abnormalities. These findings are felt to reflect the relative lack of architectural disruption that histologically characterizes this particular lesion. The present report described the imaging characteristics of the telangiectatic form of focal nodular hyperplasia. 
3	Cat-scratch disease. Acute encephalopathy and other neurologic manifestations. Seventy-six patients with neurologic complications of cat-scratch disease are discussed. Encephalopathy occurred in 61, while 15 had either cranial or peripheral nerve involvement. The average age of the patients with encephalopathy was 10.6 years (range, 1 to 66 years), and almost twice as many males as females were affected in contrast to patients with uncomplicated cat-scratch disease, in which the ratio was almost equal. Fever was not documented in 50% of patients with encephalopathy and only 26% had temperatures higher than 39 degrees C. Convulsions occurred in 46% and combative behavior in 40%. Lethargy with or without coma was accompanied by variable neurologic signs. Results of laboratory studies, including imaging of the central nervous system, were inconsistent and nondiagnostic. Biopsy tissue from 14 patients showed histopathologic findings compatible with cat-scratch disease. The "English-Wear bacillus" was demonstrated by the Warthin-Starry stain in 10 of 14 skin or lymph node specimens. Of the 15 patients without encephalopathy, two children with facial nerve paresis displayed cranial nerve symptoms and/or signs, 10 patients had cat-scratch disease neuroretinitis, and three women had peripheral neuritis. All 76 patients recovered within 12 months; 78% recovered within 1 to 12 weeks. There were no neurologic sequelae. Treatment consisted of control of convulsions and supportive measures. Commonly used antibiotics administered to more than half of the patients were apparently ineffective. 
5	Empiric treatment of fungal infections in the neutropenic host. Review of the literature and guidelines for use. Persistent fever that is refractory to broad-spectrum antibacterials is common in neutropenic patients undergoing induction chemotherapy of acute leukemia. Clinical experience suggests that many of these patients are infected with fungi. Until recently, data supporting the role of empiric antifungal therapy in this setting were limited to small groups of patients or postmortem reports. Evolving evidence in larger patient populations supports data from smaller series: febrile neutropenic patients who have failed to respond to a 4- to 7-day course of broad-spectrum antibacterials may benefit from the early initiation of antifungal therapy. Patients with fungal colonization or pulmonary infiltrates and adult patients who have not received previous fungal prophylaxis may especially benefit from the early use of antifungal drugs. Amphotericin B has been the "gold standard" for empiric antifungal therapy, although the newer azoles may be useful in certain situations. 
1	Transcatheter oily chemoembolization in the management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis: results of a Western comparative study in 60 patients. Transcatheter oily chemoembolization is widely used as palliative therapy for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma in high-incidence Asiatic areas. To assess its usefulness in the Western form of this cancer, 30 French patients were treated between 1987 and 1990 by intraarterial hepatic injection of a Lipiodol-doxorubicin emulsion followed by embolization with 0.5 to 1 mm gelatin sponge particles. The number of procedures ranged from one to five. All patients had advanced, symptomatic and inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (Okuda's staging: I, n = 8; II, n = 14; III, n = 8); none was found under systematic screening. All had underlying cirrhosis (Child-Pugh's class: A, n = 15; B, n = 12; C, n = 3) that was alcoholic in origin in 27 cases and posthepatitic B in origin in 3 cases. The results of the treatment were assessed by comparison with a group of 30 untreated patients admitted to the same unit between 1984 and 1987. Patients of both groups were closely matched for clinical presentation, global disease staging and precise anatomical extension. The overall 1- and 2-yr survival rate was 59% and 30%, respectively, for the treated patients vs. 0% at 1 yr for the untreated patients. The latter all died from local disease with end-stage liver failure and/or uncontrollable variceal bleeding. In the former, the three patients with Child's class C cirrhosis died after the first procedure. During the follow-up (range = 3 to 26 mo), 11 additional patients died, 8 from metastatic generalization. 
1	Incidence, causes and mechanism of hypercalcaemia in a hospital population in Hong Kong. To determine the incidence and causes of hypercalcaemia in a hospital population in Hong Kong, all 29,107 samples received in the laboratory in one year were analysed for plasma calcium and albumin, and samples with a plasma calcium concentration adjusted for albumin greater than 2.55 mmol/l were investigated. Plasma calcium greater than 2.55 mmol/l was found in 462 patients. Repeat samples were received from 302 of these and hypercalcaemia was confirmed in 183. The main causes of hypercalcaemia were malignancy (72.1 per cent), tuberculosis (6.0 per cent), and primary hyperparathyroidism (5.5 per cent). In the malignant hypercalcaemia group, carcinoma of lung was the most common (31.8 per cent) and carcinoma of breast was uncommon (3.0 per cent). Secondary deposits in bone were detected in 35 of the 122 solid tumours. In order to identify the mechanism of hypercalcaemia the contributions of renal tubular reabsorption and increased bone resorption to the plasma calcium concentration were calculated. Increased tubular reabsorption was the main contributor to hypercalcaemia in primary hyperparathyroidism and carcinoma of liver (none of whom had bony metastases) and it contributed significantly to hypercalcaemia in carcinoma of lung without bony metastases and carcinoma of oesophagus. We conclude that in Hong Kong (a) primary hyperparathyroidism is uncommon, (b) tuberculosis is an important cause and (c) humoral factors may be responsible for a relatively high proportion of cases of malignant hypercalcaemia. 
5	Increased microvascular permeability in vivo in response to intradermal injection of neutrophil-activating protein (NAP-2) in rabbit skin. Neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP-2), an NH2-terminally processed form of the platelet-release product beta thromboglobulin (beta TG), was purified to homogeneity from stimulated human blood leukocytes. In the presence of a vasodilator substance (PGE2, CGRP) picomolar (pmol/l) amounts of NAP-2 induced neutrophil accumulation and plasma leakage on intradermal injection in rabbit skin, whereas the longer forms, beta TG itself and connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III), had no such effect. NAP-2-induced increased in microvascular permeability was neutrophil dependent and fast in onset, with a half-life of 65 to 75 minutes, comparable to that previously reported for the structural-related neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin-8 (NAP-1/IL-8). However NAP-2 showed a lower potency in that more protein was needed to provoke skin reactivity. Nevertheless the finding that a platelet release product can elicit neutrophil-mediated inflammation further narrows the gap between thrombotic events and inflammatory disorders. 
4	Thromboxane mediates diapedesis after ischemia by activation of neutrophil adhesion receptors interacting with basally expressed intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Ischemic injury is characterized by neutrophil (PMN)--endothelial cell adhesion and diapedesis associated with thromboxane (TX) generation. Neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction is regulated in part by the leukocyte adhesion receptor CD 18 glycoprotein complex and the endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This study tests the role of TX in ischemia-induced diapedesis and evaluates whether the diapedesis is regulated by neutrophil or endothelial adhesion receptors. Plasma derived from rabbit hind limbs made ischemic for 3 hours (n = 6) and reperfused for 10 minutes had increased levels of TXB2 3,450 pg/ml, which was higher than sham rabbit (n = 6) values of 653 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). When introduced into abraded skin chambers placed on the dorsum of other normal rabbits (n = 6), this ischemic plasma induced 1,000 pg/ml of new TX synthesis and diapedesis of 1,235 PMN/mm3. The total TX concentration and PMN accumulations in blister fluid were correlated (r = 0.88, p less than 0.05). In contrast, sham rabbit plasma induced no TX synthesis and diapedesis of only 77 PMN/mm3 (p less than 0.05). Administration of 50 ng/ml of authentic TXB2 into blisters induced an accumulation of 453 PMN/mm3, which was higher than that in saline controls (18 PMN/mm3) (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment of normal rabbits used for the diapedesis assay (n = 4) with the TX synthetase inhibitor OKY 046 (2 mg/kg/hr) limited ischemic plasma and authentic TXB2 induced diapedesis to 142 and 76 PMN/mm3, respectively (both p less than 0.05). 
4	Clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics of patients with antidromic circus movement tachycardia in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Antidromic circus movement tachycardia was documented in 36 of 345 consecutive patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome undergoing detailed electrophysiologic evaluation. Twenty-six patients were men and 10 were women (mean age +/- standard deviation 26 +/- 12 years [range 12 to 45]). Multiple accessory pathways were identified in 12 of these 36 patients (33%). Ten of the patients (67%) with clinically documented antidromic tachycardia had multiple accessory pathways. Dizziness and syncope occurred in 61 and 50% of patients with antidromic circus movement tachycardia. Six patients had clinical documentation of atrial fibrillation, and 4 patients (11%) were resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation. In the 36 patients, 56 distinct antidromic tachycardias were recorded and several different pathways were observed. Orthodromic tachycardia was the most frequently associated arrhythmia (72%). Dual atrioventricular nodal pathways were present in 12 patients (33%); however, atrioventricular nodal tachycardia could be initiated in only 2 of them. Interruption of the accessory pathway was successfully performed in all 20 patients undergoing surgery. 
5	Neurological sequelae of cerebral malaria in children. Out of 604 Gambian children admitted with falciparum malaria to one hospital between September and December, 1988, 308 had cerebral malaria and 203 were severely anaemic (haemoglobin less than 60 g/l). 14% of those with cerebral malaria died, as did 7.8% of those with severe anaemia. 32 (12%) of children surviving cerebral malaria had residual neurological deficit. 69 other children were admitted with clinical features strongly suggestive of cerebral malaria but with negative blood films; 16 of these died and 3 had residual neurological deficits. The commonest sequelae of cerebral malaria were hemiplegia (23 cases), cortical blindness (11), aphasia (9), and ataxia (6). Factors predisposing to sequelae included prolonged coma, protracted convulsions, severe anaemia, and a biphasic clinical course characterised by recovery of consciousness followed by recurrent convulsions and coma. At follow up 1-6 months later over half these children had made a full recovery, but a quarter were left with a major residual neurological deficit. Cerebral malaria in childhood may be an important cause of neurological handicap in the tropics. 
5	Melanocytic hyperplasia of the oral mucosa. Lesions that exhibit melanocytic hyperplasia are uncommon in the oral mucosa. They are even more rare than the various morphologic types of nevomelanocytic lesions. This article reports the clinicopathologic features of oral lesions diagnosed as lentigo simplex, junctional lentigo ("jentigo"), atypical melanocytic hyperplasia (melanoma in situ), and melanocanthoma. The proper terminology for these lesions is also discussed. 
3	Safety, stability, and effectiveness of immunoadsorption under membrane plasmapheresis treatment for myasthenia gravis. Nine patients (five women and four men, average age 50.4 years) with refractory myasthenia gravis (MG) underwent thymectomy and were then treated with immunoadsorption under membrane plasmaphersis (IAP). Thymic histology showed hyperplasia in nine patients. An immunoadsorption column (ASAHI, Med, Co) was made with tryptophan. A Plasouto 1,000 (ASAHI, Med, Co) was used as the machine. The plasma separator was a first filter (ASAHI, Med, Co), and immunoadsorption columns were used for plasma perfusion. IAP treatment was performed three times weekly for a total of six times, after which IAP was done every 3 weeks. The removal rate of anti-Ach-R titer was 54 +/- 12%; IgG, IgA, and IgM levels improved in nine of nine patients after IAP treatment, and improvement of gait disturbances were seen in two of two. Muscle strength improved in all nine patients, whereas speech disturbances improved in two of three. Eye ptosis improved in nine of nine patients. Subjective improvement was reported by nine of nine patients, and none had severe side effects with IAP. In conclusion, IAP is a safe, stable, effective, and clinically useful treatment. for MG. 
5	Perianal appearances associated with constipation. The perianal appearances were studied prospectively of 136 constipated children (mean age 3.9 years, 67 boys, 69 girls). Anal dilatation, fissures, tags, warts, perianal oedema, redness, blueness, and veins were recorded. It was noted whether dilatation occurred immediately or at 30 and 60 seconds with the buttocks minimally separated, and on subsequent firm lateral traction of the buttocks. The degree of faecal loading was assessed in all children. Anal dilatation was found in 24 (18%) and first appeared on lateral traction in eight (6%). In three quarters of the children with dilatation faecal loading or perianal signs were present. Fissures were found in 35 (26%) children and tags in seven (5%). Perianal redness was more likely to be associated with fissures, and blueness with dilatation. We conclude that there are no pathognomonic perianal signs in childhood constipation and that the technique of anal examination should be standardised. 
5	A preliminary study of dye-enhanced laser photosclerosis. Laser ablation of veins after injection of wavelength-specific dyes to enhance and localize energy absorption could provide a useful adjunct to current treatment options. To enhance the absorption of diode laser energy at 808 nm, ear veins of 41 rabbits were infused with 2 to 3 ml of indocyanine green dye (maximum absorption, 805 nm) and exposed for 2 to 20 seconds. Animals were killed between 0 and 28 days after operation. Discrete time intervals of laser exposure exist during which various-sized vessels can be ablated without significant thermal injury to the overlying tissue. Small vessels (0.2 mm in diameter) blanch after 2 to 3 seconds of exposure, whereas medium-sized vessels (2 mm in diameter) require 8 to 10 seconds. Vessels can be ablated with a power density as low as 11.1 W/cm2. Specimens taken immediately after laser exposure show vessel wall thinning and a reirradiation effect, created as laser energy initially absorbed by dye is reemitted. By the seventh day after operation, a brisk inflammatory response and acanthosis of the overlying epidermal layer develop. The lumen is partially filled by thrombus with cellular invasion. By postoperative day 28, the epidermal thickening and inflammatory reaction have resolved; the vessel walls are fibrotic. The use of low-power, air-cooled diode lasers, in conjunction with wavelength-specific dyes, may provide a simple, viable, and cosmetically appealing alternative to the treatment of superficial varicosities of the extremities. 
2	Gaucher's disease complicated by bleeding esophageal varices and colonic infiltration by Gaucher cells. We report a 10-yr-old child with Gaucher's disease who developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices, as well as hemorrhage from a colonic polyp infiltrated with Gaucher cells. Both the varices and polyp were treated endoscopically, and the outcome was successful. Although gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to portal hypertension is considered a rare complication of Gaucher's disease, colonic infiltration with Gaucher cells has not been recognized previously. 
1	Comparison of neuropsychologic functioning and clinical indicators of neurotoxicity in long-term survivors of childhood leukemia given cranial radiation or parenteral methotrexate: a prospective study. We prospectively compared neuropsychologic functioning and clinical indicators of neurotoxicity in 49 consecutive childhood leukemia patients in long-term continuous complete remission (CR) who had received two different regimens of CNS prophylaxis by random assignment. Twenty-three patients were treated with 1,800 cGy cranial radiation and intrathecal methotrexate (RT group) and 26 with parenteral methotrexate only (MTX group). Over half of the RT group had somnolence syndrome, and four developed cerebral calcifications late in their clinical course. Abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs) were seen in 15 patients in the MTX group, and six had early, transient white-matter hypodensities apparent on computed tomographic (CT) scans. Mean scores on standard tests of intelligence and academic achievement, administered after remission induction and again at a median of 6 years after treatment cessation, did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, statistically significant decreases in overall and verbal intelligence quotients (IQs) and in arithmetic achievement were found within both treatment groups. Sixteen of 26 in the MTX group and 14 of the 23 in the RT group had clinically important decreases (greater than or equal to 15 points) on one or more neuropsychologic measures. These changes did not correlate with findings on CT scans, EEGs, or other clinical signs of neurotoxicity. We conclude that 1,800 cGy cranial radiation and parenteral methotrexate, as used in this study, are associated with comparable decreases in neuropsychologic function. 
5	Late potentials in progressive muscular dystrophy of the Duchenne type. This study describes the late potentials (LPs) obtained by signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) in 66 patients with Duchenne's progressive muscular dystrophy (DMD). It also assesses the possible relationships between LPs and the severity of DMD, and the findings of two-dimensional echocardiography, as well as ventricular arrhythmias examined with the Holter system. SAECGs were performed with a Marquette MAC-1 unit. Based on Swinyard-Deaver's system of stages, ranging from the mildest, S1, to the most severe, S8, one patient each could be assigned to S2 and S4, 6 to S5, 20 to S6, 21 to S7, and 17 to S8. LPs were observed in 21 of the 66 patients (32%), including 3 of the 20 assigned to S6 (15%), 10 of the 21 in S7 (48%), and 8 of the 17 in S8 (47%). The total wall motion index evaluated by the method of Hegar was significantly greater in the patients with LPs (8.4 +/- 4.4) than in those without LPs (5.8 +/- 3.1) (p less than 0.05). The incidence of LPs was found to be higher in the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) type (8 of 12;67%) than in the normal type (9 of 41;22%) (p less than 0.01). The incidence of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) was significantly higher in patients with LPs (13 of 21;62%) than in those without LPs (13 of 45;29%) (p less than 0.05). No sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) was observed, although nonsustained VT was noted in three patients with LPs. The LPs in patients with DMD were thus associated with left ventricular dysfunction, and the presence of LPs might be correlated with the extent of myocardial derangement in DMD. 
5	Epidemiology of pelvic inflammatory disease in parous women with special reference to intrauterine device use. Up to the end of 1989, 206 parous women in the Oxford Family Planning Association contraceptive study had been referred to hospital with a first episode of pelvic inflammatory disease. Of these, 65 suffered from definite disease described as acute, 81 from definite disease not described as acute and 60 from 'other disease'. Considering all forms of disease together, referral was less common in those aged 25-29 and in those aged 45 or more than in those aged 30-44. Referral was more common in those of low social class, in those who smoked and in those who married young. All these factors were taken into account in analyses considering the effects of contraceptive methods. In these analyses, women currently using the contraceptive pill, the diaphragm, the sheath, female sterilization or an intrauterine device (IUCD) were compared with those currently using other methods or no method of contraception. IUCD ex-users were, however, placed in a separate category, irrespective of their current method of contraception. The relative risks obtained in these analyses, with 95% CI, were as follows: contraceptive pill 0.5 (0.2-0.9), diaphragm 0.6 (0.3-1.2), sheath 1.2 (0.6-2.4), female sterilization 0.7 (0.3-1.5), non-medicated IUCD 3.3 (2.3-5.0), medicated IUCD 1.8 (0.8-4.0), IUCD ex-users 1.3 (0.7-2.3). These data suggest that oral contraceptives, the diaphragm and female sterilization protect against pelvic inflammatory disease and that IUCDs increase the risk. Medicated devices, however, appear to carry only about half the risk of non-medicated devices, and the elevation of risks in IUCD ex-users appears to be small. Special analyses examined the risk associated with use of a Dalkon Shield. Among women currently using an IUCD (of any kind), those who had used a Dalkon Shield (at any time) had nearly five times as great a risk of hospital referral for pelvic inflammatory disease as those who had never used a Dalkon Shield (relative risk 4.7, 95% CI 2.1-9.0). 
2	Intrathoracic Nissen fundoplication: long-term clinical and pH-monitoring evaluation. From 1976 until April 1989, 31 intrathoracic total fundoplications were performed for reflux esophagitis and irreducible hiatus hernia. In the first 16 patients (group 1) the operation was complicated with acute perforation of the wrap in 4 cases, bronchogastric fistula in 1, and herniation of the wrap higher in the chest in 1. Technical modifications were applied to 15 more recent patients (group 2). These are enlargement of the hiatus, looseness of the wrap and its appropriate anchorage, avoidance of forceps when handling the stomach, care with the vagi, and efficient gastric decompression in the postoperative period. The postoperative course was always uneventful in group 2. Twenty-six patients, who still have their initial wrap, were considered for clinical evaluation: 11 from group 1 (mean follow-up, 81.5 months) and 15 from group 2 (mean follow-up, 32.8 months). All are free from any symptom of reflux; gas-bloat syndrome is infrequent and dysphagia is relieved. Twenty-four-hour pH monitoring, performed in 14 patients (3 from group 1 and 11 from group 2) (mean follow-up, 42 months), was normal in 13; a pathological upright reflux (time pH less than 4, 8.4%) was demonstrated in one symptom-free woman in whom endoscopy was unremarkable. Mechanisms of complications experienced in group 1 are analyzed in the light of the technical evolution of the procedure, and the place of the intrathoracic total fundoplication in the management of short esophagus is defined, considering the other available surgical techniques. 
5	Bilateral intrapulmonary hematomas. A 67-yr-old man, known to have chronic obstructive lung disease, developed bilateral localized pulmonary densities on chest radiographs after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. An autopsy disclosed bilateral intrapulmonary hematomas without communication with bronchi, pulmonary arteries, or pleural cavities. We suggest blunt pulmonary injury is the most probable cause of the hematomas and discuss its pathogenic mechanism. Intrapulmonary hematomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary densities developing after a vigorous resuscitation. 
4	Admissions to the intensive care unit after complications of anaesthetic techniques over 10 years. 2. The second 5 years Compared with the first 5 years there was a 19% increase in general anaesthetics, a 171% increase in local and (or) sedation techniques and a 9% increase in obstetric epidurals with no increase in anaesthetic staffing. In this second 5-year period, 46 patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit as a result of a complication of an anaesthetic technique. These patients represented 1 in 2371 anaesthetic techniques carried out in the District compared with the previous 5 years where the incidence was 1 in 1543. Seven patients died (15.2%). The complication was considered to be wholly or partially avoidable in 14 instances (30.4%). Four of these subjects died. 
1	Carcinoma of the male breast: a review of 41 cases. We reviewed the cases of 41 consecutive men treated for breast carcinoma from 1950 through 1987 at Vanderbilt University Affiliated Hospitals to examine controversies in and methods of therapy for this disease. Twenty-two patients (52%) had stage I or II lesions potentially curable by operative therapy. The overall 5-year survival rates were 100% for stage I, 65% for stage II, 56% for stage III, and 0% for stage IV. Radical mastectomy offered no advantage over modified radical mastectomy in terms of survival or rate of recurrence. Diagnosis at an early clinical stage and no finding of disease in axillary lymph nodes were important factors in survival in this series of patients. All tumors evaluated for hormone receptors were positive. Although experience was limited, encouraging results were obtained with the use of tamoxifen citrate in adjuvant as well as palliative roles. With the exception of a predominance of centrally located lesions and a uniquely high frequency of positive hormone receptor status, carcinoma of the male breast appears biologically similar to the disease in women, and treatment should be guided by similar principles. 
2	Severe hypertension after liver transplantation in alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Five children with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and terminal liver disease received liver grafts; all five became hypertensive and four developed hypertensive encephalopathy. There was evidence of renal disease preoperatively and renal biopsy specimens showed variable glomerulonephritic histology with IgA nephropathy in one, mesangial-proliferative changes in two, and mesangio-capillary glomerulonephritis type I in two. Four hypertensive episodes were preceded by a fall in creatinine clearance. The association of glomerulonephritis with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency in children is more common than has been recognised. Affected patients are prone to severe hypertension of probable renal origin after liver transplantation and the renal lesion may affect long term prognosis. 
1	Power drills to fenestrate exposed bone to stimulate wound healing. Power drills can be used to stimulate the formation of granulation tissue over exposed cortical bone. These tools allow for the rapid fenestration and selective abrasion of large areas of exposed bone; fenestration and abrasion create the multiple bleeding points essential for the production of granulation tissue. The granulation tissue thus produced is allowed to grow out through the holes to cover bone. This procedure can be performed in an outpatient setting, usually without the need for either local or general anesthesia; it is particularly useful for patients considered to be poor risks for general anesthesia. Healing by granulation tissue is a somewhat slow process, but it has a high success rate, causes few complications, and produces very good cosmetic results. Two cases illustrate the method of fenestration of exposed cranial bone to stimulate granulation tissue. Specific instructions describe the needed care of exposed bone. 
3	Carbamazepine-induced antinuclear antibodies and systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. A 20-year-old woman developed a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like syndrome and a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) soon after initiation of carbamazepine (CBZ) therapy. Symptoms and serology became normal after CBZ was discontinued. CBZ-induced SLE is an important but underecognized phenomenon. 
3	Outpatient sedation: an essential addition to gynecologic care for persons with mental retardation. Routine gynecologic care for persons with mental retardation may be difficult to provide, especially to those women who do not allow a pelvic examination to be performed. Of 275 women referred to a multidisciplinary clinic addressing the reproductive health concerns of mentally retarded women, 61 patients (22%) did not allow a gynecologic examination to be performed. The administration of ketamine alone, midazolam alone, or a combination of midazolam and ketamine allowed for the successful performance of a gynecologic examination in 81% of previously uncooperative women. No adverse effects of the medications were noted. We conclude that sedation of difficult-to-examine, mentally handicapped women can be safely performed in the outpatient setting, thus avoiding the need for general anesthesia and its inherent risks. 
4	Clinical spectrum of symptomatic external iliac fibromuscular dysplasia. External iliac fibromuscular dysplasia is a rare and usually asymptomatic disorder. We report eight symptomatic patients seen over a 15-year period and review pathophysiologic mechanisms accounting for the three following distinct lower extremity ischemic sequelae: (1) Emboli--episodic focal digital ischemia (blue toe) was seen in three patients. Resection and primary anastomosis of focal iliac ulcerative fibromuscular dysplasia (one patient) or resection and replacement (two patients) removed the embolic source and relieved the symptoms. (2) Chronic ischemia--gradual onset of full leg claudication in four patients was treated by operative graduated intraluminal dilation in three patients and prosthetic bypass in one. Arteriography subsequently showed a remodeled lumen in the three patients who underwent dilation. (3) Dissection--acute onset leg ischemia resulted from presumed dissection of the external iliac segment. After 4 months of conservative management of antiplatelet agents and exercise, symptoms resolved completely, and arteriogram showed spontaneous restoration of a normal lumen in the dissected segment. The clinical presentation of fibromuscular dysplasia may mimic other arterial processes such as atherosclerosis. Diagnosis is made only by arteriography with specific magnification views of the external iliac arteries and careful surveillance of the renal arteries. Appropriate treatment should be tailored to the clinical presenting symptom. For microembolic disease, resection and replacement are required. For chronic ischemia, intraluminal dilation is generally sufficient and durable and has proved to be a simpler and acceptable alternative to replacement or bypass. In acute dissection, surgical intervention may be deferred if the limb is viable to allow spontaneous healing and remodeling. Persistent symptoms may be the only indication for intervention in this ischemic manifestation of external iliac fibromuscular dysplasia. 
5	Pregnancy outcome in hematologic malignancies. By means of a mail questionnaire, information on a series of 56 pregnancies i in 48 women diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma was collected from ten hospitals. Seven patients conceived while receiving treatment for their neoplasms; in 22 patients, the hematologic disease was diagnosed during pregnancy, and the remaining 27 patients became pregnant after completion of the antineoplastic treatment. When a comparison was made of the evolution of these pregnancies to that of pregnancies in a healthy population, no increase in the incidence of complications was observed: 64% of the pregnancies went to term, 9% resulted in spontaneous abortion, and 5% resulted in premature births. The observed incidence of one major malformation in 56 pregnancies did not differ from the frequency of malformations in the offspring of healthy individuals. There were no fetal losses in six pregnancies in which conception occurred during the first year after chemotherapy. In spite of the inherent limitations derived from the design of this type of study and the type of subject analyzed, the data here support the hypothesis that the cytostatic treatment of hematologic malignancies, if deemed necessary, should not be postponed because of pregnancy. Moreover, the authors agree with advice recommending that no antifolic or alkylating agents be used for prolonged periods and that radiotherapy be avoided, especially to those fields involving the pelvic area. 
5	Hilger facial nerve stimulator: a 25-year update. Percutaneous nerve excitability testing using the Hilger facial nerve stimulator was introduced about 25 years ago. The test is reliable, easy to use, and inexpensive; it continues to be the most frequently used method for predicting prognosis of facial nerve disorders. Between 1966 and 1974, we recorded 10,243 nerve excitability tests on 865 patients with a mean of 3.29 tests for each peripheral branch and 3.43 for the trunk. Using a multiple regression model, we determined the effect on nerve stimulation values of age, sex, race, diabetes, hypertension, partial or complete clinical paralysis, diagnosis of herpes zoster, year of testing, and eventual facial paralysis recovery profile. We discuss statistical reliability, provide a table of interpretive results, and offer "tips and traps" invaluable to the practitioner. A prospective study of 25 patients with residual facial paralysis was evaluated by two separate otolaryngologists to determine intertester reliability. 
5	Endoscopic treatment of biliary tract strictures in sclerosing cholangitis: a larger series and recommendations for treatment. We report a group of 35 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis who had long-term follow-up after endoscopic treatment of major ductal strictures in the primary or secondary biliary ducts. Our patients were all symptomatic with ascending cholangitis or jaundice. There was significant improvement as measured by clinical parameters of hospitalization rates and laboratory data and comparable radiography. Long-term follow-up averaged 24 (+/- 2.8 months). We believe endoscopic treatment of sclerosing cholangitis should be attempted in selected symptomatic cases with major ductal strictures before liver transplantation. 
1	Inactivation of the retinoblastoma gene in human lymphoid neoplasms. The absence of wild type retinoblastoma (Rb) gene expression in a wide variety of human solid tumors suggests an etiologic role for this tumor suppressor gene in human cancer. We have evaluated the involvement of Rb gene inactivation in the pathogenesis and progression of human lymphoma and leukemia. We examined the genomic configuration and transcription of the Rb gene in cultured cell lines and primary cases of T- and B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. By Southern analysis, abnormalities of the Rb locus were identified in 1 of 5 T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL) cell lines, 1 of 26 primary cases of T-ALL, 1 of 40 primary cases of chronic lymphocytic lymphoma/well-differentiated lymphoma (CLL/WDL), and 1 of 15 primary cases of intermediately differentiated lymphoma (IDL). By Northern analysis, markedly reduced or abnormal expression of the Rb gene was identified in 2 of 5 T-ALL cell lines, 1 of 7 primary cases of T-ALL, 1 of 5 primary cases of CLL/WDL, and 1 of 6 primary cases of IDL. These findings show that Rb gene inactivation can be associated with a broad range of lymphoid neoplasms and that loss of the tumor suppressor function of Rb may influence the pathogenesis and progression of lymphoma/leukemia. 
1	Metastatic small cell tumor of bone with 'true' rosettes and glial fibrillary acidic protein positivity. A 15-year-old black girl was admitted to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital with a lytic lesion involving the right fourth metacarpal bone with a solitary metastasis to the ipsilateral axillary lymph node. Histologic examination of both the primary lesion and metastasis revealed a primitive small round cell lesion. Abundant rosettes with central lumina were present in the metastasis. Immunohistochemical stains performed on sections of the metastasis were strongly positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and negative for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S-100 protein, and Leu-7. Electron microscopic examination of the metastasis revealed lumen formation with apical microvilli and juxtaluminal junctional complexes. This tumor exhibits features that are suggestive, but not definitive, of primitive ependymal differentiation and further expands the morphologic and immunophenotypic range of small round cell tumors of bone. 
1	A simple and sensitive microtiter plate estrogen bioassay based on stimulation of alkaline phosphatase in Ishikawa cells: estrogenic action of delta 5 adrenal steroids. We have developed an estrogen bioassay using the Ishikawa human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line growing in 96-well microtiter plates. Alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity (AlkP) in these cells is markedly stimulated by estrogens, and this enzyme can be easily quantified in situ using a chromogenic substrate. These cells are very sensitive to estrogens; estradiol induces AlkP at levels as low as 10(-12) M. Antiestrogens completely block the action of estradiol. Various estrogens stimulate AlkP with potencies comparable to those achieved in vivo. The induction of AlkP is specific for estrogens; no other type of steroid, including androgens, progestins, mineralocorticoids, or glucocorticoids produce this effect. The stimulation of AlkP in Ishikawa cells is specific for estrogens, is highly reproducible and sensitive, and permits large numbers of samples to be assayed with ease. We have used this assay to investigate the estrogenic action of the adrenal delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroids. While pregnenolone is inactive, dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate ester induce AlkP slightly. However, the C19 steroid, 5-androstene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol is considerably more estrogenic in this assay, although it stimulates Ishikawa AlkP with a potency of 1/30,000 that of estradiol. The stimulation by 5-androstene-3 beta,17 beta-diol is inhibited by antiestrogens, but it is not blocked by the delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid isomerase/dehydrogenase inhibitor, cyanoketone, or by the aromatase inhibitor, 4-hydroxy-androstenedione. Thus, neither conversion to a delta 4-3-ketone nor aromatization is required for the action of this unusual estrogen. 
5	Systolic wall stress and ventricular arrhythmia: the role of acute change in blood pressure in the isolated working rat heart. 1. The effect of a sudden acute change in blood pressure upon arrhythmia provocation has been studied in an isolated working heart model from the Wistar-Kyoto strain of rat. Twenty-four hearts were studied. 2. They were perfused with two different, modified, Krebs-Henseleit solutions at a fixed left atrial pressure. 3. Acute changes in pressure, both increases and decreases, were arrhythmogenic. Whilst ectopic activity was more predictably produced by pressure reductions, this consisted of simple ventricular ectopics only. Pressure increases, in contrast, were capable of provoking more complex and sustained arrhythmias. 4. The effect of pressure changes were highly dependent upon electrolyte concentrations in the perfusate. Low potassium and magnesium concentrations increased the amount of arrhythmia provoked by pressure increases but tended to reduce that provoked by pressure reductions. 5. We conclude that the direct effect of an acute change in pressure upon the myocardium is arrhythmogenic. However, the myocardial response to a pressure change is interdependent upon prevailing electrolyte concentrations. 
3	A comparative trial of three agents in the treatment of acute migraine headache. STUDY OBJECTIVES: A study was conducted to evaluate the relative efficacy of three non-narcotic agents, chloropromazine, lidocaine, and dihydroergotamine, in the treatment of migraine headache in an emergency department setting. DESIGN: The trial was randomized and single blinded. SETTING: The study was conducted in two university-affiliated EDs. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All patients had an isolated diagnosis of common or classic migraine. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were pretreated with 500 mL (IV) normal saline before randomization. Study drugs as administered were dihydroergotamine 1 mg IV repeated after 30 minutes if the initial response was inadequate; lidocaine 50 mg IV at 20-minute intervals to a maximum total dose of 150 mg as required; or chloropromazine 12.5 mg IV repeated at 20-minute intervals to a total maximum dose of 37.5 mg as required. Patients were asked to grade headache severity on a ten-point scale before and one hour after the initiation of therapy. Follow-up by phone was sought the following day. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 76 patients completing the trial, 24 were randomized to receive chloropromazine, 26 to receive dihydroergotamine, and 26 to receive lidocaine. Reduction in mean headache intensity was significantly better among those treated with chloropromazine (P less than .005). Persistent headache relief was experienced by 16 of the chloropromazine-treated patients (88.9%) contacted at 12 to 24 hours follow-up compared with ten of the dihydroergotamine-treated patients (52.6%) and five of the lidocaine-treated group (29.4%). CONCLUSION: The relative effectiveness of these three antimigraine therapies appears to favor chloropromazine in measures of headache relief, incidence of headache rebound, and patient satisfaction with therapy. 
4	Influence of catheter technology and adjuvant medication on acute complications in percutaneous coronary angioplasty. We report on the complication rates in 660 consecutive coronary angioplasties (725 lesions) performed using four procedures that differed with respect to catheter technology and adjuvant medication. After the PTCA regimen in our laboratory had been changed from conventional steerable systems to the monorail technique, we observed a significant increase in the incidence of transient vessel occlusions from 2.6% to 7.7%, of permanent occlusions from 3.6% to 8.8%, and of intracoronary thrombus-formation from 2.6% to 5.5%. This was associated with the frequent observation of thrombotic material on the partially Teflon-coated guidewires. Coronary perfusion with urokinase (1,670-6,670 U/min) lead to a further increase in the complication rates (10.4%/10.3%/6.5%). Our present percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)-regimen (monorail technique with P.E.T. balloons, fully silicon-coated guidewires, no urokinase) shows an incidence of 3.8% for intermittent and recurrent coronary occlusions and 1.9% for permanent occlusions. Urokinase did not prevent intracoronary thrombus formation with the monorail technique. Furthermore, we suspect that in the case of PTCA-induced regional intimal dissection, fibrinolysis can prevent reestablishment of intima adherence to the vessel wall. Because five procedural deaths were observed in the 212 patients treated with i.c. urokinase as opposed to three deaths in the 448 procedures without urokinase, we feel that i.c. urokinase in PTCA is a potentially harmful regimen. We suggest that the monorail technique should be performed with fully silicon-coated guidewires and without urokinase. 
2	Natural history and prognostic factors for chronic hepatitis type B. One hundred and five hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients presenting with chronic persistent hepatitis (n = 46) or chronic active hepatitis without cirrhosis (n = 59) were followed longitudinally for one to 16 years (mean 5.5 years) and underwent follow up biopsy. During a mean histological follow up of 3.7 years, active cirrhosis developed in 21 (20%) patients one to 13 years after entry to the study with a calculated annual incidence of 5.9%. The probability of evolution to cirrhosis was significantly higher in patients with chronic active hepatitis and bridging hepatic necrosis than in those with moderate chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis (p less than 0.0001). Cox multiple regression analysis showed that the following three variables independently implied poor prognosis: older age, presence of bridging hepatic necrosis, and persistence of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum (p less than 0.0001). These findings indicate that patients with severe chronic active hepatitis and persistent hepatitis B virus replication are at very high risk of rapid progression to cirrhosis. 
4	The management of atypical non-cardiac chest pain. Atypical, non-cardiac chest pain is common and disabling, and often persists despite negative medical investigations. Aetiology is disputed and management is difficult. A multi-causal model in which both psychological and physical factors play a part is helpful; a fundamental factor is continued misinterpretation of minor physical symptoms as evidence of heart disease. We report supportive evidence and describe a psychological treatment derived from the model. In a randomized trial, cognitive behavioural methods were effective in reducing chest pain, disability and use of medication, in patients both with and without psychiatric disorder. The clinical implications are discussed. 
1	Undifferentiated carcinomas of salivary glands. Undifferentiated carcinomas of salivary glands are those epithelial malignancies whose light-optic histopathologic features are not sufficient to place them in other defined classes of carcinoma. They are ultrastructurally heterogeneous and can manifest neuroendocrine differentiation. With or without the latter, the carcinomas are biologically high-grade and rank with salivary duct and high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas in terms of morbidity and mortality. 
4	Incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia detected by different electrocardiographic systems To determine the extent to which different electrocardiographic systems account for differences in reported incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia, the authors simultaneously recorded in 109 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) the V5 or modified CM5 lead on five ECG systems by means of a specially constructed common V5 lead. The systems included a Spacelabs Alpha 14 Model Series 3200 ECG Cardule at bandwidths of 0.05-125 Hz and 0.5-30 Hz (a typical operating room monitor), a Marquette Electronics MAC II ECG at 0.05-40 Hz and 0.05-100 Hz (a standard ECG), and a Del Mar Holter recorder at 0.1-100 Hz. Relative ST-segment position and incidence of new ischemia compared to the preoperative ECG were determined in 109 sets of preinduction traces and 877 sets of intraoperative traces. ST-segment position on the three recording systems conforming with the American Heart Association (AHA) low-frequency response recommendations (0.05 Hz) were similar. Compared to the standard ECG, ST-segment position on the Spacelabs at 0.5-30 Hz was consistently more negative. Displacement on the Holter was consistently less negative and less positive. By the 0.1-mV displacement criterion for diagnosis of myocardial ischemia on any one ECG system, 16.5% of patients on arrival and 32.1% of patients intraoperatively suffered new myocardial ischemia. Based on the operating room monitor, arrival and intraoperative ischemia were present in 15.6 and 27.5% of patients, respectively. Ischemia at the same periods was less frequent by the standard ECG system (5.5 and 12.8%, respectively) and least frequent by the Holter recorder (4.6 and 8.3%, respectively). 
5	Receptor changes in the spinal cord of sheep associated with exposure to chronic pain. There is evidence that post-injury hypersensitivity is partly due to changes in the central nervous system. Sheep with foot rot were used to investigate the effect of chronic pain on some receptors thought to be involved in spinal nociceptive processing systems (alpha 2 adrenoceptor and mu and delta opioid receptors). Saturation binding studies showed a variable distribution of [3H] clonidine (alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist) in the spinal cord of normal sheep. The number of receptors (Bmax) present in areas thought to be involved in nociceptive processing, laminae I and II and lamina X, increased to 131% and 169% of control sheep values respectively in animals exposed to chronic pain. The affinity of the receptors (KD), however, remained unchanged at approximately 2 nM. There was less [3H]DAGO (mu opioid agonist) and [3H]DPDPE (delta opioid agonist) binding in the sheep spinal cord. Both opioid receptor types being mainly located in the superficial dorsal horn. The [3H]DPDPE binding was unchanged in the sheep with foot rot, whilst the number (Bmax), but not the affinity, of the [3H]DAGO binding sites increased in laminae I and II in lame animals to 130% of the control sheep values. Hence, in animals in chronic pain, the number of alpha 2 adrenoceptors and mu opioid receptors increased mainly in areas of the sheep spinal cord associated with nociception. 
5	Antenatal phenobarbital for the prevention of periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhage: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multihospital trial. To determine whether the neuroprotective properties of phenobarbital would alter the incidence and severity of intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants, we randomly assigned 110 women at less than 31 weeks of gestation to receive 10 mg/kg phenobarbital or placebo in a blinded fashion before delivery. Infants were examined postnatally with real-time ultrasonography for evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Maternal demographics, pregnancy complications, antenatal management, and route of delivery did not differ between the phenobarbital group (n = 50) and the placebo group (n = 60). The total incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage did not differ between the phenobarbital-treated (n = 54) and the placebo-treated (n = 67) infants. However, the frequency of grade 3 and grade 4 hemorrhages was 15% (10 infants) in the placebo group and 3.7% (2 infants) in the phenobarbital group (p less than 0.05). There were no differences in the severity of associated conditions in the babies to explain the difference in the incidence of severe hemorrhage between the study groups. We conclude that antenatal administration of phenobarbital appears to be effective in decreasing the severity of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage in infants delivered at less than 31 weeks of gestation. 
5	Frequency of low-grade residual coronary stenosis after thrombolysis during acute myocardial infarction. The clinical, angiographic and demographic characteristics of 42 patients with low-grade (less than 50%) residual stenosis at the infarct lesion after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction (MI) were assessed. The study group (group I) represented 21% of 198 consecutive patients receiving thrombolytic therapy over a 59-month period. Data on the 156 remaining patients were pooled for comparison (group II). Group I patients were predominantly men (86%) who were cigarette smokers (81%). Group II patients were predominantly men (75%, p greater than 0.10) but were significantly older (52 +/- 12 vs 56 +/- 10 years, p = 0.02). Prior acute MI or angina was unusual in group I. Sixty percent had no significant (greater than 50%) residual coronary artery disease while 25% had residual single artery disease. Average significant (greater than 50% diameter stenosis) residual vessel disease was 0.6 +/- 1.0 for group I and 1.9 +/- 0.9 for group II (p less than 0.001). In group I, average residual infarct lesion diameter stenosis was 36 +/- 7% in the right anterior oblique and 34 +/- 8% in the left anterior oblique views. Thirty-nine group I patients were discharged with medical therapy and 100% follow-up was obtained over a mean interval of 18 +/- 17 months. Fifteen patients experienced chest pain after acute MI accounting for 17 discrete events. Fifty-nine percent of group I had a benign course on follow-up. Eight events were classified as unstable angina, 4 as acute MI and 5 as atypical angina. Documented coronary vasospasm occurred in 3. 
1	Kaposi's sarcoma of the rectum in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We retrospectively reviewed eight patients with biopsy-proven anorectal Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) treated between 1984 and 1989 at San Francisco General Hospital. All patients were homosexual men with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The average age was 34 years. Three patients had primary rectal KS without metastases. Five patients had disseminated KS with lesions throughout the alimentary tract, viscera, skin, or local lymph nodes. Three patients were treated with radiation or chemotherapy. Five patients had disseminated KS with lesions throughout the alimentary tract, viscera, skin, or local lymph nodes. Three patients were treated with radiation or chemotherapy. Five patients with advanced AIDS received no specific treatment for anorectal KS. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 5 years. Three of the untreated patients and the three patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy were alive 1 month to 5 years after diagnosis. Aggressive surgical treatment of anorectal KS is not indicated. 
2	Gastroesophageal reflux in infants. Clinically significant gastroesophageal reflux occurs in one in 500 infants. Symptoms resolve in 60 to 80 percent of infants by 18 months of age. Thickened formula and position changes are often recommended. Medication and surgical intervention may be needed in refractory cases. 
4	Lacunar transient ischaemic attacks: a clinically useful concept? Lacunar ischaemic stroke syndromes are clinically, pathophysiologically, and prognostically distinguishable from cortical ischaemic stroke syndromes. Could cerebrovascular transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) share similar heterogeneity? 130 patients with TIAs were prospectively studied, 71 of whom underwent carotid angiography. Symptoms were associated with a 50% or greater stenosis of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery in 36 (67%) of 54 patients with presumed cortical TIAs, but in only 1 (6%) of 17 patients with presumed lacunar TIAs (p less than 0.0001). These findings support the view that cortical TIAs are associated with ipsilateral extracranial internal carotid artery atheromatous disease, whereas patients with lacunar TIAs may have absent or insignificant large-vessel disease, and probable intracranial small-vessel disease. Accurate distinction between lacunar and cortical events may have implications for investigation and treatment of patients with TIAs. 
5	Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function in patients with the premenstrual syndrome. Patients with primary affective disorders, such as melancholic depression and anorexia nervosa, frequently have a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, characterized by hypersecretion of CRH and a blunted ACTH response to exogenous CRH. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a luteal phase dysphoric disorder characterized by primarily affective and behavioral disturbances. HPA axis function was compared in PMS patients and control women, respectively, diagnosed by DSM3-R criteria or found to have no current psychiatric disorders, determined by the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime Interview. Urinary free cortisol excretion was the same in PMS and normal women, and no differences in urinary free cortisol excretion between the follicular and luteal phases occurred in either group. Two HPA axis abnormalities, however, were noted when PMS patients were compared to normal women. First, basal evening cortisol concentrations in plasma were significantly decreased, while the time-integrated response of plasma cortisol to ovine (o) CRH was significantly increased. Second, the negative correlation between time-integrated plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH and basal luteal progesterone concentrations present in normal control women was not seen in the PMS patients. These changes in basal and oCRH-stimulated plasma cortisol levels in association with normal urinary free cortisol excretion suggest that women with PMS might have transient or episodic disturbances of their HPA axis, which appear adequately corrected by this system's servomechanisms. This probably explains the maintenance of regular menstrual cycles in PMS patients, which contrasts with the irregular menses observed in patients with depression, anorexia nervosa, or women who participate in chronic strenuous exercise. 
3	Cyst of the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricle: case report and review of the literature. We report an intraventricular cyst in a 2-year-old boy who had myoclonic jerks of the extremities. The cyst had no communication with the ventricular system or subarachnoid space. Total removal of the cyst adhering to the choroid plexus was accomplished. The glial cyst wall was lined in part by flattened or cuboidal epithelium. The preoperative and postoperative computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance images are presented, and congenital benign cysts in the lateral ventricle are reviewed and discussed. 
5	A prospective, randomized study of three surgical techniques for treatment of acute ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament. Treatment of ACL tears is controversial. Recent reports on nonoperative treatment have shown poor results. Results after primary repair have deteriorated with time, leading to augmentation procedures that seem to have improved the results. However, there have been few prospective, randomized studies in this field. Our goal was to compare primary repair with a bone-patellar tendon-bone augmentation method and with a new method using the Kennedy Ligament Augmentation Device. One hundred fifty patients aged 16 to 50, all of whom had acute ACL tears, were randomized with the closed envelope method to one of three groups treated with open surgical methods. Fifty patients were treated with primary repair, 50 patients with patellar tendon augmentation, and 50 patients were augmented with the Kennedy Ligament Augmentation Device. All patients were operated on within 10 days of injury. The rehabilitation protocol was identical, consisting of a long leg cast for 2 weeks, followed by a brace with no weight-bearing and limited motion for 6 weeks. The patients were followed prospectively by one surgeon (LE) using the Lysholm functional score, Tegner activity level score, clinical evaluation and KT-1000 arthrometer at 6 months, 1, and 2 years. Three patients were lost to followup. There was no age or activity level difference between the groups. Sport activities led to 85% of the injuries, with skiing, soccer, and European handball representing 80% of injuries. All three groups reduced their activity level the 1st year. The repair group remained at the same level after 2 years. 
3	Randomized comparison of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime in Lyme neuroborreliosis. In this prospective, randomized, open trial, 33 patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis were assigned to a 10-day treatment with either ceftriaxone, 2 g intravenously (iv) every 24 h (n = 17), or cefotaxime, 2 g iv every 8 h (n = 16). Of the 33 patients, 30 were eligible for analysis of therapeutic efficacy. Neurologic symptoms improved or even subsided in 14 patients of the cefotaxime group and in 12 patients of the ceftriaxone group during the treatment period. At follow-up examinations after a mean of 8.1 months, 17 of 27 patients examined were clinically asymptomatic. In one patient Borrelia burgdorferi was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 7.5 months after ceftriaxone therapy. CSF antibiotic concentrations were above the MIC 90 level for B. burgdorferi in nearly all patients examined. Patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis may benefit from a 10-day treatment with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. However, as 10 patients were symptomatic at follow-up and borreliae persisted in the CSF of one patient, a prolongation of therapy may be necessary. 
2	A case of cecocolic intussusception with complete invagination and intussusception of the appendix with villous adenoma. Villous adenoma of the appendix is a rare neoplasm and intussusception of the appendix is a rare pathologic condition. A very rare case seen in a 35-year-old male with pain in the right lateral abdomen is reported. In this patient, the appendix along with the villous adenoma intussuscepted and invaginated into the cecal lumen, and presented as cecocolic intussusception. A polypoid lesion was diagnosed in the cecum by fiberoptic colonoscopy. Unlike polypoid lesions at other sites in the large intestine, polypoid lesions of the cecum may accompany intussusception and invagination of the appendix. Consequently, caution is required in performing endoscopic polypectomy in cases of polypoid lesions of the cecum. 
2	Dysphagia as a manifestation of occult hypoxemia. The role of oximetry during meal times. A 25-year-old woman with severe kyphoscoliosis reported a six-month history of increasing dysphagia to both liquids and solids. A barium swallow and esophageal motility studies showed no significant gastrointestinal abnormalities. Trials of antispasmodic agents were unsuccessful in relieving her symptoms. Pulmonary function tests showed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect (vital capacity = 0.67 L) with adequate oxygenation and alveolar ventilation as reflected by arterial blood gas testing during quiet wakefulness. However, continuous noninvasive oximetry demonstrated desaturation to 85 percent while eating. These transient episodes of desaturation were abolished by the administration of supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal prongs. Following the prescription of supplemental oxygen, dysphagia resolved immediately, with weight gain following over several weeks. We conclude that dysphagia may be a presenting feature of hypoxemia. This case report draws attention to the usefulness of continuous noninvasive monitoring of oxygenation and the clinical importance of at least some transient hypoxemic events. 
5	Clinical and physiological study of anal sphincter and ileal J pouch before preileostomy closure and 6 and 12 months after closure of loop ileostomy. Spontaneous evolution of pouch and anal function, and absorption features has been assessed in 15 patients who underwent proctocolectomy with J ileal pouch anastomosis without conservation of a rectal muscular cuff. All the patients were studied before preileostomy closure and six and 12 months after the closure of the protection loop ileostomy. Stool frequency was identical at six and 12 months (mean +/- SEM: 5.0 +/- 0.4 and 5.3 +/- 0.5/day, respectively). Sixty-six percent of patients at six months and 40% of patients at 12 months need to defecate at least one time during night. Stool weight as well as steatorrhea decreased significantly six months after the closure of loop ileostomy (P less than 0.05). Mean resting anal pressure remained unchanged six and 12 months after closure of the loop ileostomy (41 +/- 6 and 45 +/- 5 cm H2O, respectively). Maximum squeeze anal pressures increased significantly at six (P less than 0.05) and 12 months (P less than 0.05). The rectoanal inhibitory reflex was always absent at the same period. The maximum pouch capacity increased significantly during the first six months (P less than 0.01) from 142 +/- 17 to 279 +/- 27 ml. The maximum infused volume during a saline continence test was not significantly different at six and 12 months; the percentage of evacuation of the reservoir and the volume at which the first ileal contraction appeared in the reservoir increased significantly (P less than 0.05) at six and 12 months. In conclusion, in patients with ileoanal anastomosis and pouch reservoir, the closure of the loop ileostomy is associated with spontaneous modifications of the anal and pouch parameters. 
1	Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in invasive bladder cancer: the evolving role of surgery. The role of an operation in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for clinically localized but invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder currently is evolving. An operation is essential for case selection and evaluation of local response but it also contributes to bladder preservation and survival. The procedure that is necessary to select for and assess response to chemotherapy may itself alter the actual or proceed to evolution of invasive bladder cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a reasonable therapeutic strategy in selected patients but it remains to be seen whether the results will prove to be superior to those achieved with standard endoscopic and open operations. 
1	Malignant melanoma presenting as nasal obstruction. Mucosal melanomas arising in the nasal cavity are rare tumors comprising less than 1 percent of all melanomas. Often, the common clinical symptom is nasal obstruction. Grossly, they may or may not be pigmented and frequently attain large sizes. Histologic diagnosis of these tumors may be difficult, requiring immunohistochemical or electron microscopic confirmation. Aggressive surgical management is the treatment of choice in clinical stage I disease. Subsequent surveillance for recurrence is mandatory. Markers such as 5-S-cysteinyldopa may prove useful in staging, prognosticating, and postoperative surveillance for early recurrence, but their exact role has yet to be delineated. Ultimate prognosis is poor. 
1	Application of 1 nm gold probes on paraffin wax sections for in situ hybridisation histochemistry. An in situ hybridisation technique that uses 1 nm immunogold reagents and silver enhancement was devised to detect biotinylated DNA viral probes in formalin fixed, paraffin wax sections of human cervix. DNA probes labelled with biotin-11-deoxyuridine triphosphate were detected after hybridisation to nucleic acid sequences by an antibiotin antibody, followed by a gold labelled secondary antibody. Silver enhancement then permitted visualisation of the signal at the light microscopic level. The method was reliable and produced less background staining than previously described methods. The signal could be enhanced by epi polarisation microscopy. Furthermore, biotinylated DNA probes may be detected directly by a 1 nm gold labelled goat antibiotin antibody without loss of labelling intensity, and this may be preferable to the longer two layer technique, previously described. 
2	The Indian experience with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. A study of 58 consecutive Indian infants operated for congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis revealed an accentuated male predominance in the incidence of the disease and far less preoperative hemetemesis as compared to that in their Western counterparts. 'Pyloric tumor' was palpable in 89% of cases. Only 34.5% of these infants were first born. Postoperative vomiting occurred in 13.8% of patients and wound sepsis was not encountered. Air contrast radiography confirmed the diagnosis in clinically doubtful cases. 
3	Cytosolic free calcium during focal cerebral ischemia and the effects of nimodipine on calcium and histologic damage. The role of calcium as a mediator in neuronal death during ischemia is now quite strong. Evidence supporting this link includes studies in cell cultures and measurements of calcium accumulation in the mitochondria during ischemia, as well as direct measurements of shifts in extracellular calcium using microelectrodes. Since it is dangerously high concentrations of the intracellular free calcium that have been hypothesized to lead to neuronal damage, direct in vivo measurements of this parameter in ischemia are important. A technique for the measurement of intracellular free calcium is described, along with data from studies that dramatically demonstrate the time course of changes in intracellular free calcium induced by focal ischemia. Additional data are also presented that indicate that cellular damage can be attenuated by the use of agents that block calcium channels (nimodipine, which blocks voltage-sensitive calcium channels, and MK-801, which blocks receptor-operated channels) and support the concept that these agents owe their beneficial effects to their ability to reduce the accumulation of intracellular calcium. 
5	Mutation of the p53 gene in human acute myelogenous leukemia. Heterogeneity of p53 protein expression is seen in blast cells of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). p53 protein is detected in the blasts of certain AML patients but not in others. We have identified p53 protein variants with abnormal mobility on gel electrophoresis and/or prolonged half-life (t 1/2). We have sequenced the p53 coding sequence from primary blast cells of five AML patients and from the AML cell line (OCIM2). In OCIM2, a point mutation in codon 274 was identified that changes a valine residue to aspartic acid. A wild type p53 allele was not detected in these cells. Two point mutations (codon 135, cysteine to serine; codon 246, methionine to valine) were identified in cDNA from blasts of one AML patient. Both mutations were present in blast colonies grown from single blast progenitor cells, indicating that individual leukemia cells had sustained mutation of both p53 alleles. The cDNAs sequenced from blast samples of four other patients, including one with prolonged p53 protein t 1/2 and one with no detectable p53 protein, were fully wild type. Thus, the heterogeneity of p53 expression cannot be explained in all cases by genetic change in the p53 coding sequence. The prolonged t 1/2 of p53 protein seen in some AML blasts may therefore reflect changes not inherent to p53. A model is proposed in which mutational inactivation of p53, although not required for the evolution of neoplasia, would confer a selective advantage, favoring clonal outgrowth during disease progression. 
4	Postangiographic femoral artery injuries: nonsurgical repair with US-guided compression Ultrasound-guided compression repair (UGCR) of catheterization-related femoral artery injuries was evaluated as a possible new imaging-guided interventional procedure. Thirty-nine femoral artery injuries (35 pseudoaneurysms, four arteriovenous fistulas) were detected with color Doppler flow imaging in patients with enlarging groin hematomas and/or groin bruits 6 hours to 14 days after catheterization procedures. UGCR was not performed in 10 patients due to spontaneous thrombosis (n = 4), infection (n = 1) or skin ischemia (n = 1), unsuitable anatomy (n = 3), or excessive discomfort (n = 1). The remaining 29 patients underwent a full trial of compression therapy, and the lesion was eliminated in 27. Follow-up color flow scans were obtained after 24-72 hours in all 27 successful cases and at 1-15 months in 19; no recurrences or complications occurred. UGCR for acute injuries is safe and technically simple and is promising as a cost-effective, first-line treatment for uncomplicated catheterization-related femoral artery injuries. UGCR is probably not appropriate for long-standing injuries. 
2	A videofluoroscopy chair for the evaluation of dysphagia in patients with severe neuromotor disease. Due to the difficulties encountered in positioning severely neurologically impaired individuals for videofluoroscopic studies, the Rehab Tech Video FluoroChair was developed. The purpose of the chair is to provide the severely disabled patient with safe, stable postural support in an upright position for videofluoroscopic studies, with anterior-posterior, lateral, and rotational views easily performed. The chair features a removable headrest, a full back support, armrests, lateral truncal supports, and a patented base which is clamped to the footboard of the radiology table and allows for 200 degrees rotation of the patient. Two case studies illustrate the practical use and versatility of the Rehab Tech Video FluoroChair. 
1	Plasma cell granuloma of the nasal cavity treated by radiation therapy. Plasma cell granuloma is a rare, benign tumor most commonly found in the lungs in patients younger than 30 years. Although presentation has been reported at a number of other anatomic sites, this report is the first of plasma cell granuloma of the nasal cavity. The tumor was initially resected, but progression was seen at 1-month follow-up. Because further surgery to completely eradicate the tumor would have been extensive and disfiguring, 40-Gy external beam radiation was given in 20 fractions using a three-field wedge technique. Most recent clinical follow-up at 27 months showed local control. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for plasma cell granuloma when the disease can be completely resected. However, irradiation can also be effective in patients with recurrent or inoperable local disease. 
3	Syringomyelia as a postoperative sequela of the resection of a chordoma of the clivus: case report. Syringomyelia has been described frequently in association with various abnormalities of the skull base but rarely with tumors of the skull base. Syringomyelia as a postoperative sequela of surgery of the skull base has not been reported. The authors describe a case of cervical syringomyelia developing after the partial resection of a chordoma and combined conventional and proton beam irradiation. The possible mechanisms causing this abnormality are discussed. 
5	Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and angioplasty in the management of clotted hemodialysis grafts: early and late clinical results. The results of pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and angioplasty of 121 thrombosed hemodialysis grafts were reviewed. The initial pharmacomechanical method (used in 65 cases) employed clot maceration with hook-shaped catheters and clot lacing with highly concentrated urokinase. The current technique (used in 56 cases) consisted of pulsed-spray injection of urokinase into the clot. All fully treated grafts (117 cases) underwent complete or near-complete thrombolysis, and 93% remained patent after 1 day. Mean time for pulsed-spray lysis was 46 minutes +/- 21. One patient (less than 1%) had gastrointestinal bleeding and received a transfusion; minor complications occurred in 3% of patients. Primary and secondary graft patency rates for both methods at 1 year were 26% and 51%, respectively. While graft age and results of angioplasty did not influence future graft patency, shorter intervals between graft thromboses was predictive of earlier subsequent graft failure. Results suggest that pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and angioplasty provide rapid, consistent, and safe recanalization of clotted hemodialysis grafts and represent a promising additional therapeutic approach to long-term graft management. 
2	Integration of hepatitis B vaccination into rural African primary health care programmes. OBJECTIVE--To determine the efficacy of hepatitis B vaccine when added to the routine expanded programme on immunisation under field conditions in rural Africa. DESIGN--Infants were immunised according to two schedules--an early schedule at birth, 3 months, and 6 months and a later schedule to correspond with routine vaccination in the expanded programme on immunisation at 3 months, 4 1/2 months, and 6 months. SETTING--Venda, northern Transvaal, South Africa, a self governing region of 7460 square kilometers varying from rural villages to small towns. SUBJECTS--The 1989 birth cohort of Venda. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Coverage for hepatitis B vaccine at first, second, and third doses; serological assessment of vaccine efficacy by prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen in infants who had completed the three dose course of immunisation; antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen to determine if natural infection occurred. RESULTS--Vaccine coverage for hepatitis B dropped sharply from 99% to 53% to 39% for the first, second, and third dose respectively. In contrast, vaccine coverage was maintained at 97-99% for the three doses of poliomyelitis vaccine. Serological evaluation of vaccine efficacy showed that only 3.5% of recipients of all three doses failed to develop antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen. Only 6.6% of vaccine recipients were vaccinated according to either the early or later schedules whereas 93.4% received their doses of vaccine at intervals beyond the limits of either of the planned schedules. There was, however, no significant difference in seroconversion to the surface antigen between the "unscheduled" or scheduled groups of those who were vaccinated according to the early or late schedules. The pattern of prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, which showed a sharp fall in children aged over 7 months, suggested that the antibodies were acquired passively rather than by active infection. CONCLUSIONS--Supplementation of the present expanded programme on immunisation with hepatitis B vaccine in rural Africa is fraught with difficulties. However, the vaccine was effective within a fairly wide spacing of dosage. Adding hepatitis B vaccine to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis as a tetravalent vaccine is proposed as a means of effectively integrating it into the expanded programme on immunisation in Third World settings. 
5	Multifocal gastric carcinoma arising from hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps. This paper is a presentation of the unusual case of a 61-yr-old woman operated on for multiple gastric cancers. Two of the cancers were found in the hyperplastic polyps and one in the adenoma. Apart from cancers that arose from these polyps, there were four separate polypoid or flat gastric carcinomas and three other hyperplastic polyps with no signs of malignancy, in this case. The presentation is followed by a detailed discussion focusing on the possible development of carcinoma in gastric hyperplastic polyps in view of the data from the literature. 
5	Acute myocarditis simulating myocardial infarction in a child. Pediatric chest pain usually occurs in benign conditions. However, this case portrays the dramatic electrocardiographic appearance of acute myocardial ischemia in a boy with biopsy-proven myocarditis who had only mild chest pain. This underscores the need for eliciting a detailed history when evaluating a patient with chest pain. If the pain cannot be clearly attributed to chest wall phenomena, or if there are historical or physical findings suggestive of an arrhythmia or angina, then further investigation with a chest radiograph and a 12-lead electrocardiogram is recommended. Myocarditis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of any child whose electrocardiogram is indistinguishable from an acute myocardial infarction. Finally, endomyocardial biopsy allows early diagnosis and institution of therapy, which may have beneficial effect on decreasing morbidity and mortality. Further follow-up and research is still needed to evaluate the effect of early treatment of myocarditis on long-term myocardial function and the development of chronic cardiomyopathy. 
2	The clinical importance of drug interactions with antiulcer therapy. The overall safety of a given drug is determined by its toxicity, side effects, and drug-drug interactions. Thus, a clarification of the mechanisms, importance, and clinical implications of any drug-drug interaction with antiulcer therapy is critical to the use of antiulcer medications. Drug-drug interactions may occur as a result of changes in absorption, metabolism, distribution, or excretion. Fortunately, drug distribution or protein binding is unchanged by antiulcer therapy. Antiulcer drugs may affect absorption by several mechanisms. Ionized medications may bind to the divalent cations of antacids and sucralfate to result in poorly absorbed complexes. Reduced gastric acid may decrease the absorption of medications that are weak bases while enhancing the absorption of weak acids. Drug absorption may be impaired by delayed gastric emptying. Several H2-receptor antagonists, including cimetidine and to a lesser extent ranitidine, and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, may reduce the hepatic degradation of drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. The degree to which such agents alter drug metabolism is determined by the patient's age, genetics, duration of therapy, degree of cytochrome P450 binding, and the regimen. Because the clinical importance of this interaction cannot always be predicted, caution is recommended whenever drugs metabolized by this system are used concurrently. Development of an understanding of the ways in which drug metabolism interactions occur may lead to more effective and safe use of these medications. 
3	A single cholesterol measurement underestimates the risk of coronary heart disease. An empirical example from the Lipid Research Clinics Mortality Follow-up Study. In prospective epidemiologic studies of coronary heart disease, a single measurement of cholesterol is made to assess its relationship to the risk of coronary disease. Statistical theory states that if this measurement is subject to within-individual variability, the strength of the relationship will be underestimated. This is empirically shown for the example of plasma cholesterol. For the Lipid Research Clinics Follow-up Study population (comprising 2170 white men over 30 years of age), the age-adjusted coronary heart disease mortality regression coefficient increases from .453 to .496 if the average of two cholesterol measurements is used instead of a single measurement. Since the correlation between the two repeated cholesterol measurements is .815, an increase in the regression coefficient up to .556 would be expected if the true cholesterol values were available. Thus, epidemiologic studies have substantially underestimated the strength of the relationship between cholesterol levels and the risk of coronary disease by calculating the relationship on the basis of a single cholesterol determination. 
5	Infectious mononucleosis presenting as bilateral acute dacryocystitis. A case of infectious mononucleosis presenting as bilateral acute dacryocystitis in a 7-year-old girl is reported. Acute dacryocystitis is uncommon in this age group, and an underlying systemic illness should be suspected particularly when it is bilateral. 
4	Regional wall thickening of left ventricle evaluated by gated positron emission tomography in relation to myocardial perfusion and glucose metabolism. Regional wall thickening was assessed by electrocardiographically gated positron emission tomography (ECG-gated PET) in 26 patients with coronary artery disease. The standardized percent count increase from end-diastole to end-systole (S-percent Cl) was calculated as an index of wall thickening. The S-percent Cl was 77.8% +/- 28.9% in the segments with normal perfusion at rest, 51.9% +/- 29.5% in those with mild hypoperfusion, and 32.8% +/- 30.9% in those with severe hypoperfusion (p less than 0.001, each). Among the segments with resting hypoperfusion, the S-percent Cl was 38.9% +/- 31.5% in those without stress-induced ischemia and 48.7% +/- 30.9% in those with ischemia (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, among resting severe hypoperfusion, the S-percent Cl was 23.0% +/- 23.9% in the segments without fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and 37.8 +/- 32.9% in those with FDG uptake (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that stress-induced ischemia and FDG accumulation correlated with wall thickening. Thus, quantitative analysis of regional wall thickening seems to be useful for combined analysis of regional function, perfusion and metabolism in coronary patients. 
4	Susceptibility to Coxsackievirus B3-induced chronic myocarditis maps near the murine Tcr alpha and Myhc alpha loci on chromosome 14. This study was undertaken to determine the genetic control of host susceptibility to coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced chronic myocarditis in a mouse model. An autosomal recessive autoimmune myocardial disease (amd) gene (possibly more than one gene), which determined susceptibility to CVB3-induced chronic myocarditis in the A/J and DBA/2J inbred mouse strains, was mapped to a segment of chromosome 14. Data from both the AXB/BXA recombinant inbred (RI) strains and the B10.D2(57N) H-8b congenic mice supported this linkage relationship. Analysis of the AXB/BXA RI strain distribution patterns suggested that amd maps distal to the Np-2, Tcr alpha, and Myhc alpha loci. 
5	Nortriptyline treatment of depressed cardiac transplant recipients. The safety of tricyclic antidepressants in cardiac transplant recipients has not been established. The author used nortriptyline to treat major depressive episodes in eight cardiac transplant recipients. Nortriptyline therapy was associated with increased QRS interval and heart rate but did not significantly affect other hemodynamic or ECG variables or cyclosporine dose requirements. It appears that nortriptyline may be used safely in depressed cardiac transplant patients. 
5	Titration streptomycin therapy for bilateral Meniere's disease. Follow-up report. Initial reports of the use of parenteral streptomycin for bilateral Meniere's disease (MD) have demonstrated success in reducing the vestibular symptoms and, in some patients, stabilizing hearing. The long-term follow-up (mean, 5.1 years) of 19 patients treated with intramuscular streptomycin for bilateral MD is presented. The amount of streptomycin administered (5 to 50 g) was determined by clinical symptoms and by serial testing of the reduction in the slow-phase velocity on electronystagmography. Episodic vertigo was totally relieved in 12 patients and improved in severity and frequency in an additional 4 patients. Permanent posttreatment dysequilibrium occurred in 47% of the patients treated. The changes in hearing (speech reception threshold) were independent of the therapeutic effect of streptomycin on the vestibular system. The overall results suggest that the intramuscular titration of streptomycin should continue to be considered as one of the therapeutic options in patients with disabling vertigo due to bilateral MD. 
5	Altered waveform of plasma nocturnal melatonin secretion in premenstrual depression. The nocturnal secretion of plasma melatonin was determined under dim to dark conditions in eight patients with prospectively confirmed premenstrual syndrome and in eight age- and menstrual cycle phase-matched normal control subjects. Plasma samples for melatonin were collected every 30 minutes from 6 PM to 9 AM during the early follicular, late follicular, midluteal and late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Compared with normal controls, patients with premenstrual syndrome had an earlier (phase-advanced) offset of melatonin secretion, which contributed to a shorter secretion duration and a decreased area under the curve. No statistically significant differences were found between women with premenstrual syndrome and normal controls for melatonin onset or peak concentration, or for estradiol or progesterone levels. The data demonstrate that women with premenstrual syndrome have chronobiological abnormalities of melatonin secretion. The fact that these patients respond to treatments that affect circadian physiology, such as sleep deprivation and phototherapy, suggests that circadian abnormalities may contribute to the pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome. 
5	Rett syndrome: cerebellar pathology. The cerebellar pathology at autopsy of 5 patients with Rett syndrome is described. The patients ranged in age from 7-30 years. All had markedly reduced brain weights with proportionately small cerebella. Microscopic examination revealed loss of Purkinje cells, atrophy, astrocytic gliosis of the molecular and granular cell layers, and gliosis and loss of myelin in the white matter. Cortical atrophy occurred focally along the folia and was often more marked in the tips of the folia. The 2 oldest patients had been treated with phenytoin which may have contributed to the morphologic changes. Atrophy and gliosis increased with age or in patients without phenytoin treatment; the youngest patient demonstrated only minor microscopic changes. In addition to the generalized alterations, 1 patient had several adjacent folia with severe atrophy. The results indicate that cerebellar changes in Rett syndrome consist of general hypoplasia with the addition of atrophy beginning in childhood and progressing over many years. 
3	Delayed anterior decompression in patients with spinal cord and cauda equina injuries of the thoracolumbar spine. Forty-nine patients with complete and incomplete injuries of the spinal cord or cauda equina who had undergone anterior decompression at a minimum of 3 months after injury were examined. Follow-up was from 12 months to 19 years. Postoperative neurologic improvement occurred in 46.5% of patients with incomplete injuries. If the surgery was performed less than 2 years after injury, neurologic improvement occurred in 68% with an improvement in Frankel grade of 32%. Bladder function improved in 27% of patients and if operated on less than 2 years after injury improvement occurred in 43%. Conus medullaris decompression resulted in a 50% improvement. There was an 83% improvement in the pattern of pain after decompression. Of 23 patients with preoperative spasticity, 10 improved but 6 were worse after surgery. 
4	Angioedema from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors: a cause of upper airway obstruction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have several side effects of concern to the otolaryngologist. Angioedema is a rare, but potentially lethal adverse effect when associated with upper airway obstruction. Four cases of ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema, three with significant upper airway obstruction, are reported. Angioedema secondary to ACE inhibition appears to be mechanism based. The probable link is the potentiation of bradykinin, which results in vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and angioedema. Since angioedema can progress to upper airway obstruction, otolaryngologists must be aware of this association. The differential diagnosis and treatment of this adverse effect is discussed, as well as a review of ACE inhibitors and other causes of angioedema. 
5	Heat induced radial segmentation of leukocyte nuclei in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica and other inflammatory diseases. Heat induced radial segmentation of leukocyte nuclei is an in vitro phenomenon accompanying inflammatory diseases. We studied 62 patients with suspected polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) to determine, whether heat induced radial segmentation can help in discriminating PMR from other conditions. At the initial presentation patients with PMR had more radial segmentation formation than patients with other inflammatory conditions. Prednisone induced a rapid and marked decrease in radial segmentation formation in patients with PMR. This latter finding was much less marked in patients with other inflammatory conditions. We conclude that heat induced radial segmentation at the initial presentation and during prednisone treatment can help in discriminating PMR from other inflammatory conditions. 
5	Nuclear DNA profiles in primary melanomas and their metastases. DNA-aneuploid primary melanomas are said to show a greater propensity to metastasize than those without an aneuploid profile. A higher aneuploid rate has also been reported in metastatic melanomas than in primary lesions. The ploidy profile was determined of 26 primary melanomas and their first subsequent secondaries on Feulgen-stained sections from routinely processed material using a computerized video image-analysis system. In 18 of 26 cases, both primary and secondary tumor showed similar corresponding DNA patterns. These were aneuploid in 13 of 18 of the cases. A hyperdiploid pattern was present in one case in both the primary and its metastasis, and a diploid pattern was seen in four cases. There were only eight cases in which a disparity between the nuclear ploidy profile in the primary and secondary tumor was evident. Although the results suggest that ploidy studies are not useful for predicting the metastatic potential of a primary melanoma, the maintenance of similar DNA profiles in the metastases in most of these cases was interesting in regard to tumor biology. 
4	New calcium antagonists: relevance of vasoselectivity. The calcium antagonists are a heterogeneous class of drugs used to treat a number of cardiovascular disorders. A new generation of calcium antagonists under development have a higher degree of selectivity for vascular smooth muscle and coronary vasculature compared with verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem. The clinical relevance of vasoselectivity and its impact on drug selection are discussed. The newer calcium antagonists are important alternatives to older agents and may be associated with improved tolerance and a reduced incidence of adverse effects. Their place in therapy has yet to be defined by comparative studies of efficacy and safety. 
2	Postoperative analgesic requirements in patients exposed to positive intraoperative suggestions. OBJECTIVE--To establish whether positive suggestions given to a patient under general anaesthesia reduce postoperative pain and analgesic requirements. DESIGN--Prospective double blind randomised study. SETTING--Operating theatre and gynaecology ward of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--63 Woman undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy were randomised to be played either a tape of positive suggestions or a blank tape during the operation through a personal stereo system. INTERVENTIONS--Three women were withdrawn from the study. Anaesthesia was standardised for all of the women. Postoperative analgesia was provided through a patient controlled analgesia system for the first 24 hours. Pain scores were recorded every six hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Morphine consumption over the first 24 hours after the operation; pain scores. RESULTS--Mean morphine requirements were 51.0 mg (95% confidence interval 42.1 to 60.0 mg in the women played positive suggestions; and 65.7 mg (55.6 to 75.7 mg) in those played a blank tape. The point estimate (95% confidence interval) for the difference of means was 14.6 mg (22.4%) (1.9 (2.9%) to 27.3 mg (41.6%] (p = 0.028). Pain scores were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION--Positive intraoperative suggestions seem to have a significant effect in reducing patients' morphine requirements in the early postoperative period. 
2	Differential alpha-fetoprotein lectin binding in hepatocellular carcinoma. Diagnostic utility at low serum levels. The reactivity of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) from 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with immobilized lentil lectin was examined and found to be significantly greater (39% +/- 18%) than that of the same protein from seven patients with chronic liver disease (CLD, 11.2% +/- 3.3%), seven with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF, 10% +/- 8.4%), and eight normal pregnant women (4.1% +/- 2.7%). The reactivity with Concanavalin A (Con A) was also significantly greater for AFP from HCC patients (44.5% +/- 12.5%) than that from FHF patients (7.7% +/- 4%) and normal pregnant women (5.3% +/- 3.3%), but not from patients with CLD. The reactivity with lentil lectin permitted distinction between those with HCC (31.3% +/- 14.1%) and those with uncomplicated CLD (11.2% +/- 8.4%) even when the absolute levels of serum AFP were in the same range (80-400 ng/ml). Evaluation of the alterations by lectin binding methodology may be useful in overcoming problems associated with distinguishing between malignant and CLD, particularly at moderate serum AFP elevations. 
4	Intravital detection of skin capillary aneurysms by videomicroscopy with indocyanine green in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis and related disorders. Conventional capillaroscopy and infrared fluorescence videomicroscopy with indocyanine green were performed at the nailfold in 12 healthy controls and 38 patients with microangiopathy due to systemic sclerosis or related disorders. Saccular aneurysms featuring head and neck (type 1) and aneurysmatic enlargements (type 2) were defined. Microaneurysms were located at the apex or near the apex of capillary loops and were significantly more common in patients than in controls (p less than 0.02 for type 1 and p less than 0.001 for type 2). Combination of the two lesions was found only in patients and appears to be a valuable new diagnostic sign for the presence of microangiopathy. In comparison with conventional capillaroscopy, about twice as many microaneurysms were detected by videomicroscopy with indocyanine green coupling almost completely to plasma proteins. The new technique allows visualization of capillary aneurysms even when filled only by plasma. 
5	Catheterization laboratory events and hospital outcome with direct angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction To assess the safety of direct infarct angioplasty without antecedent thrombolytic therapy, catheterization laboratory and hospital events were assessed in consecutively treated patients with infarctions involving the left anterior descending (n = 100 patients), right (n = 100), and circumflex (n = 50) coronary arteries. The groups of patients were similar for age (left anterior descending coronary artery, 59 years; right coronary artery, 58 years; circumflex coronary artery, 62 years), patients with multivessel disease (left anterior descending coronary artery, 55%; right coronary artery, 55%; circumflex coronary artery, 64%), and patients with initial grade 0/1 antegrade flow (left anterior descending coronary artery, 79%; right coronary artery, 84%; circumflex coronary artery, 90%). Cardiogenic shock was present in eight patients with infarction of the left anterior descending coronary artery, four with infarction of the right coronary artery, and four with infarction of the circumflex coronary artery. Major catheterization laboratory events (cardioversion, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, dopamine or intra-aortic balloon pump support for hypotension, and urgent surgery) occurred in 10 patients with infarction of the left anterior descending coronary artery, eight with infarction of the right coronary artery, and four with infarction of the circumflex coronary artery (16 of 16 shock and six of 234 nonshock patients, p less than 0.001). There was one in-laboratory death (shock patient with infarction of the left anterior descending coronary artery). 
5	Early identification of hearing loss: listen to parents. Families of 49 hearing-impaired children responded to a questionnaire requesting information about the identification of their child's hearing loss. Parents were the first to suspect the hearing loss in 48 cases but more often than not were told that the child would outgrow it or was too young to test. When professionals agreed with the parents and attended to their concerns, confirmation of the hearing loss occurred significantly more rapidly than when they disagreed with parents and ignored their concerns. A child whose hearing loss is not clearly identified and whose communication is inadequate or nonexistent, causes frustration and stress within the family and prevents the child from receiving the maximum benefit from early language input and amplification. It would benefit both the child and family if professionals would listen to parental concerns regarding their child and assist in the early identification process. 
3	Embolic stroke after smoking "crack" cocaine. A 39-year-old woman had an embolic upper division middle cerebral artery branch occlusion 3 hours after smoking the free base of cocaine ("crack"). Radionuclide ventriculography demonstrated cardiomyopathy, and echocardiography documented a left atrial thrombus. This case demonstrates that embolism is one mechanism of ischemic stroke after cocaine use, and that cardiomyopathy, possibly cocaine induced, may be the source of embolus. A cardiac source of embolus should be sought in patients with cocaine-associated cerebral infarction. 
3	Acceleration of scrapie in trisomy 16----diploid aggregation chimeras. We studied the susceptibility to prion infection of the trisomy 16----diploid chimeric mouse, a putative model of Down syndrome. When weanling chimeras were inoculated intracerebrally with scrapie prions, the time until appearance of the first symptoms of scrapie was reduced by 17 days (from a mean control time of 153 days) and the time to death was reduced by 30 days (from control time of 170 days). Our results with trisomy 16 chimeras argue that the susceptibility to central nervous system degeneration caused by prions can be modulated by chromosome imbalance. 
5	The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the Peoples Republic of China. Meta-analysis on data from 16 (two volunteer and 14 endoscopic) studies ahs been performed to investigate the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the stomachs of individuals within the Peoples Republic of China. In this survey covering 2216 cases (89 volunteers and 2127 endoscopy patients), the incidence of H. pylori infection in 15- to 22-yr-old healthy volunteers, and in 13- to 88-yr-old symptomatic patients undergoing gastroscopy was 49.4% and 64.5%, respectively. The frequency of H. pylori infection in chronic gastritis (63.6%), gastric ulcer (71.9%), and duodenal ulcer disease (73.1%) differed significantly from that in histologically normal individuals (8.2%), confirming the relationship of H. pylori infection with those disease states. We found no significant association between H. pylori infection and symptoms. 
4	Skeletal muscle depressed calcium and phosphofructokinase in chronic heart failure are upregulated by captopril--a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, after treatment for 5-6 weeks with 25 mg t.i.d., were studied in 12 patients with stable moderate heart failure. Five patients received placebo treatment, and the two groups were comparable at baseline. Angiotensin II levels decreased in response to captopril therapy. Skeletal muscle potassium, magnesium and chloride levels did not differ from reference values. Calcium was subnormal (P less than 0.0001), but increased to the reference range during captopril treatment. Phosphofructokinase, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, was in the lower reference range and increased (P less than 0.04) in response to captopril therapy. In conclusion, stable moderate heart failure is associated with low levels of skeletal muscle calcium and phosphofructokinase activity, these metabolic changes tending to return to normal levels with captopril treatment. 
2	Normeperidine-induced seizures in hereditary coproporphyria. Seizures are common in acute exacerbations of hepatic porphyria, even though the etiology is not identified in most cases. We have reported a case of normeperidine-induced seizures in a patient with hereditary coproporphyria. Although meperidine is commonly used for pain control during acute attacks in these patients, this report suggests that meperidine is not a good analgesic choice in porphyria. Normeperidine-induced seizures in patients with porphyria may be treated by withdrawal of meperidine therapy and selective use of anticonvulsants. 
2	Impairment of esophageal emptying with hiatal hernia. Concurrent videofluoroscopy and manometry were used to analyze esophageal emptying during barium swallows in 22 patients with axial hiatal hernias and in 14 volunteers. Subjects were divided into three groups: (a) volunteers with maximal phrenic ampullary length less than 2 cm (controls); (b) patients or volunteers with maximal ampullary/hiatal hernia length greater than or equal to 2 cm that reduced between swallows (reducing-hernia group); and (c) patients with hernias that did not reduce between swallows. Complete esophageal emptying without retrograde flow was achieved in 86% of test swallows in the controls, 66% in the reducing-hernia group, and 32% in the nonreducing-hernia group (P less than 0.05). Impaired emptying in the reducing-hernia group was attributable to "late retrograde flow," whereby barium squirted retrograde from the hernia during emptying. Impaired emptying in the nonreducing-hernia group was attributable to "early retrograde flow" that occurred immediately after LES relaxation. The nonreducing-hernia group also had longer acid clearance times than the controls (P less than 0.05). We conclude that gastroesophageal junction competence is severely impaired in patients with nonreducing hiatal hernias, suggesting a mechanism whereby this subgroup of hiatal hernia is involved in the pathogenesis of reflux disease. 
4	Cardiovascular risk reduction: the role of antihypertensive treatment. The effects of antihypertensive drugs on mortality from stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), and nonvascular causes have been studied in 14 trials involving more than 37,000 patients. In the treated patients, blood pressure was 5 to 6 mm Hg lower than that in placebo-treated patients, and whereas mortality from stroke was reduced by 42%, CAD mortality was reduced by only 14%. A major reason for this lack of effect on CAD mortality is apparently the adverse effects of the primary drugs used in these trials (diuretics and beta blockers) on glucose tolerance, lipid levels, and insulin resistance. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors favorably influence many CAD risk factors, and their use can be expected to reduce CAD mortality in patients treated for hypertension. 
4	Septal ventricular pacing in the immature canine heart: a new perspective. Cardiac pacing initiated from epicardial or transvenous apical right ventricular electrodes causes asynchronous ventricular contraction. This alters myocardial stress vectors and results in adverse cellular and subcellular changes in the experimental animal. Clinically, such changes may contribute to the adverse hemodynamics reported with long-term ventricular pacing. To determine the feasibility of direct stimulation of the ventricular specialized conduction systems and therefore the potential for maintenance of normalized depolarization patterns, 13 beagle puppies were studied. Baseline ventricular activation and contraction patterns were obtained using intracardiac electrograms and multigated nuclear acquisition (MUGA) imaging. Septal electrode insertion from the aortoatrial groove was accomplished by use of two-dimensional echocardiography and continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring of the surface ECG during pacemaker implantation in five puppies. Standard right ventricular epicardial electrodes were implanted in five additional animals, with three remaining as age-matched non-paced controls. After 4 months of observation, repeat MUGA imaging and intracardiac electrograms demonstrated nearly normal biventricular activation and contraction patterns among the septal-paced group. Histopathologic examination illustrated normal cellular morphology in the septal-paced animals. This study demonstrates that pacing electrode insertion into the proximal interventricular septum is feasible and results in utilization of the normal ventricular conduction pathway. Such an approach to initiation of ventricular stimulation may attenuate the adverse effects of long-term ventricular pacing. 
3	Fundoplication and gastrostomy in familial dysautonomia. Fundoplication with gastrostomy has become a frequent treatment for patients with familial dysautonomia, so we evaluated the use of both procedures in 65 patients. Although patients differed widely in presenting signs and age, from 5 weeks to 40 years, gastroesophageal reflux was documented in 95% of patients by cineradiography or pH monitoring. Panendoscopy was a useful adjunct. Preoperative symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux included vomiting, respiratory infections, and exaggerated autonomic dysfunction. Severe oropharyngeal incoordination frequently coexisted and resulted in misdirected swallows with aspiration, dependence on gavage feedings, or poor weight gain and dehydration. Follow-up after surgical correction ranged from 3 months to 11 years; 55 patients (85%) were available for a 1-year postoperative assessment. We had no instances of surgical death. The long-term mortality rate was 14%, primarily related to severe preexisting respiratory disease. Beyond the first postoperative year, 30 patients had pneumonia attributed to continued aspiration, exacerbation of preexisting lung disease, or recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux. Of 11 patients who vomited postoperatively, six had recurrence of reflux. Recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux was documented in eight patients (12%), and we revised the fundoplication in three patients. The number of patients with cyclic crises was reduced from 18 to 7; retching replaced overt vomiting in all but two of these seven patients, neither of whom had recurrence of reflux. Because oropharyngeal incoordination was prominent, concomitant use of gastrostomy and an antireflux procedure was especially effective in the treatment of younger patients with familial dysautonomia, before the development of severe respiratory disease. Despite the development of severe morning nausea in 15 patients, the combination procedure resulted in significantly improved nutritional status, decreased vomiting, and decreased respiratory problems. Appropriate use of gastrostomy feedings also contributed to success of the operation. The generally good outcome of fundoplication with gastrostomy confirms the benefit of this procedure in familial dysautonomia. 
5	Diffusing capacity of the lung and nifedipine in systemic sclerosis. Lung involvement in systemic sclerosis may be due in part to a functional abnormality of the pulmonary vasculature. To investigate the possible role of a pulmonary vasospastic process in this disorder, 21 non-smoking patients who had no evidence of cardiac disease or pulmonary hypertension were evaluated with pulmonary function tests prior to administration of nifedipine, 30 minutes after a single oral dose of nifedipine (20 mg), and after 4 weeks of treatment with nifedipine (10 mg 3 times daily). Treatment with nifedipine did not significantly change any of the pulmonary function values, except for the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO). The linear trend between the individual DLCO values at baseline and their changes immediately following the initial 20-mg dose of nifedipine (r = -0.603, P = 0.02) and after 4 weeks of treatment (r = -0.636, P = 0.01) showed that the lower the DLCO value at baseline, the greater the improvement caused by nifedipine. These findings support the hypothesis of a potentially reversible pulmonary vasospasm in systemic sclerosis and suggest that nifedipine may be useful in the treatment of lung disease in these patients; however, further studies are needed. 
5	Emergency laparoscopy. Unnecessary abdominal explorations in severely injured patients can be reduced by employing emergent or urgent laparoscopy in blunt abdominal trauma and the obscured, acute abdominal cases. In 150 blunt abdominal trauma cases, a mini-laparoscopy was used in the emergency room or the intensive care unit without major complications. In 56%, the findings were negative. In 19%, the laparoscopic findings were corroborated by surgery. In 25%, a minimal to moderate hemoperitoneum was found and the laparoscopic impression dictated close observation. Unnecessary exploration was avoided except in one case. In the elderly high-risk patient with a poor history, abdominal examination can be noninformative. Laparoscopy can detect acute appendicitis or organ perforation. In the young female, appendicitis can be differentiated from pelvic inflammatory disease. Laparoscopy is more accurate and gives a larger latitude for decision-making than lavage. It can also be useful in the obscured problematic abdominal case. 
4	Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a fungal aneurysm of the vertebral artery as a complication of intracranial aneurysm clipping. Case report. Intracranial aneurysms are an uncommon manifestation of fungal infection. A case is described in which the formation of an aneurysm followed an intracranial intraoperative Aspergillus infection attributable to a long period of preoperative antibiotic medication and immunosuppressive therapy with steroids. 
3	Trends in systolic blood pressure, 24-hour sodium excretion, and stroke mortality in the elderly in Belgium. Data from six surveys of systolic blood pressure conducted in Belgium between 1967 and 1986 were analyzed. The mean ages of the six groups of 3,328 subjects ranged from 70 to 81 years. The prevalence of systolic blood pressure levels above 159 mm Hg decreased between 1967 and 1986 from 51% to 21% in men and 66% to 22% in women; severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 220 mm Hg) nearly disappeared. During the same period, body mass index increased 1.1 kg/m2 in men and was unchanged in women; mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 159 to 142 mm Hg in men and from 171 to 147 mm Hg in women; the proportion of subjects receiving treatment for hypertension increased from 10% to 36% in men and from 18% to 41% in women; and the mean standardized 24-hour sodium excretion decreased from 265 to 188 mmol in men and from 208 to 160 mmol in women. Systolic blood pressure levels were significantly and independently related to sodium excretion in the 1967 and 1972 studies. The decrease in systolic blood pressure in Belgium was influenced by the combined effects of more and better treatment for hypertension and a decrease in sodium intake. 
5	Comparison of the Goode T-tube with the Armstrong tube in children with chronic otitis media with effusion. Treatment of otitis media with effusion is focused on reaeration of the middle ear cavity. In achieving long-term aeration, the insertion of ventilation tubes that have a long duration of stay can be beneficial. The results are presented of a trial in which the Goode T-tube was compared with the Armstrong tube. Fifteen children were treated between 1981 and 1986 with a T-tube in one ear and a conventional tube in the other. The results are different with regard to duration of stay in the tympanic membrane. Re-insertions were necessary in 47 per cent in the Armstrong group and in 20 per cent in the T-tube group. Otorrhoea occurred in 20 per cent of the Armstrong and 13 per cent of the T-tube intubated ears. A persistent perforation was present in 6 per cent of the ears in both groups. It is concluded that the Goode T-tube is indicated primarily in cases when long-term ventilation is needed. 
2	Scleroderma esophagus. Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by thickening and fibrosis of the skin and visceral involvement that may include the heart, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. At least 40-50% of patients with scleroderma experience esophageal symptoms such as heartburn and dysphagia, while up to 90% of patients have esophageal dysfunction on objective testing at some point in their disease. The disease results in smooth muscle dysfunction that causes esophageal aperistalsis and reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressures. Gastroesophageal reflux with poor acid clearance results with an increased incidence of complications such as peptic stricture and Barrett's esophagus. Aggressive medical therapy is necessary to prevent these and other complications of gastroesophageal reflux. 
4	Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm masquerading as occlusion of the inferior vena cava. Inflammatory aneurysms are an uncommon disorder that represent between 5% and 10% of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Their presentation is often variable and may include pain and obstruction of adjacent anatomic structures. This report describes a 68-year-old man who sought treatment after insidious onset of progressive bilateral lower extremity edema over a 6-month period. Noninvasive studies were suggestive of bilateral iliac vein occlusion, and a venogram showed a nearly obstructed vena cava from external compression. A CT scan showed a thick-walled infrarenal abdominal aneurysm. At exploration an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm was found. Because of the presence of dense inflammatory changes surrounding the aneurysm and extending into the pelvis, the surgical procedure of choice was an aortobifemoral bypass graft done with Dacron. The aneurysmal wall was debrided from the vena cava. His postoperative course was uneventful, his edema resolved, and follow-up noninvasive studies were normal. Postoperative venography showed resolution of the extrinsic compression of the vena cava. 
5	Safety and efficacy of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A prospective analysis of 100 initial patients Laparoscopic cholecystectomy quickly emerged as an alternative to open cholecystectomy. However its safety, efficacy, and morbidity have yet to be fully evaluated. During the first 6 months of 1990, we performed 100 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies with no deaths and a morbidity rate of 8% (8 of 100 patients; 4 major, 4 minor). There were 81 women and 19 men, with a mean age of 46.1 years (range, 17 to 84 years). All patients had a preoperative history consistent with symptomatic biliary tract disease, and most had proved gallstones by sonography. This included four patients with acute cholecystitis. Mean operating time improved significantly from month 1 to month 6 (122 +/- 45.4 minutes versus 78.5 +/- 30 minutes, respectively), indicating a rapid learning curve. Mean hospital stay was 27.6 hours, reflecting a policy of overnight stay. Postoperative narcotic requirements were limited to oral or no medications in more than 70% of patients. A regular diet was tolerated by 83% of the patients by the morning following the procedure. Median time of return to full activity was 12.8 +/- 6.8 days after operation. In addition analysis of the hospital costs of these 100 cases demonstrates a modest cost advantage over standard open cholecystectomy (n = 58) (mean, $3620.25 +/- $1005.00 versus $4251.76 +/- $988.00). There was one minor bile duct injury requiring laparotomy and t-tube insertion, two postoperative bile collections, and one clinical diagnosis of a retained stone that passed spontaneously. Four patients required conversion to open cholecystectomy because of technical difficulties with the dissection. Although there is a significant learning curve, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and effective procedure that can be performed with minimal risk. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed by surgeons who are trained in biliary surgery and knowledgeable in biliary anatomy, and, as with all operations, it should be performed with meticulous attention to technique. 
1	Nasal midline masses in infants and children. Dermoids, encephaloceles, and gliomas. Nasal dermoids, gliomas, and encephaloceles are uncommon congenital lesions that result from aberrant embryologic development. We have treated 46 children with these nasal lesions. In view of the potential intracranial connection, patients are at risk for intracranial infection, and early surgical correction is thus imperative. Neuroimaging studies may help to predict intracranial involvement. 
3	Physical and pharmacologic restraint of nursing home patients with dementia. Impact of specialized units This case-control study of 31 specialized dementia units and 32 traditional units in five states investigated use of physical and pharmacologic restraints among 625 patients with the diagnosis of dementia. Physical restraints were observed in use on 18.1% of dementia unit patients and on 51.6% of comparison unit patients who were out of bed during the day (adjusted odds ratio, 0.283;95% confidence interval, 0.129 to 0.619). Pharmacologic restraints were routinely given to 45.3% of dementia unit patients and 43.4% of comparison unit patients (adjusted odds ratio, 0.950; 95% confidence interval, 0.611 to 1.477). We used multivariate logistic regression to identify residence in a nonspecialized nursing home unit, nonambulatory status, transfer dependency, mental status impairment, hip fracture history, and a high nursing staff-to-patient ratio, which we found to be independent predictors of physical restraint use. Physically abusive behavior, severe mental status impairment, and frequent family visitation were found to be significant predictors of pharmacologic restraint use, while advanced patient age, large nursing home size, and patient nonambulatory status were protective against such use. These results support the conclusion that physical and pharmacologic restraint constitute separate treatment modalities with different risk factors for use, and indicate that specialized dementia units are successful in reducing the use of physical but not pharmacologic restraints. 
2	Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome. A multisystem mitochondrial disorder in infancy. Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome (McKusick No. 26056) is a fatal disorder of hitherto unknown etiology involving the hematopoietic system, exocrine pancreas, liver, and kidneys. The observation of high lactate/pyruvate molar ratios in plasma and abnormal oxidative phosphorylation in lymphocytes led us to postulate that Pearson's syndrome belongs to the group of mitochondrial cytopathies. Since rearrangements of the mitochondrial genome between direct DNA repeats were consistently found in all tissues tested, our results show that this disease is in fact a multisystem mitochondrial disorder, as suggested by the clinical course of the patients. Based on these observations, we would suggest giving consideration to the hypothesis of a defect of oxidative phosphorylation in elucidating the origin of other syndromes, especially those associated with an abnormal oxidoreduction status in plasma. 
5	Extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver in sudden infant death syndrome. Liver extramedullary hematopoiesis was examined in 54 victims of sudden infant death syndrome and in 21 infants who died of other causes in an attempt to confirm Naeye's findings of increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in cases of sudden infant death syndrome. Our data showed greater extramedullary hematopoiesis in victims of sudden infant death syndrome (F = 23.52), supporting Naeye's hypothesis that victims of sudden infant death syndrome have suffered a subtle, chronic hypoxemic condition before death. 
2	Management of perineal wounds following abdominoperineal resection with inferior gluteal flaps. Our experience treating perineal wounds secondary to abdominoperineal resection, either for inflammatory bowel disease or cancer, is presented. A total of 16 patients were treated either on a delayed basis or at the same time as the abdominoperineal resection. All wounds were closed using the inferior gluteal myocutaneous flap. Fifteen of 16 patients have achieved healing, eight of whom had no complications. Only minor revisions or local wound care were required in the remaining patients, with only one patient failing to heal. Our results compare favorably with previous reports of treatment of this difficult problem. 
4	Deposits of crystalline material containing silicon in surgically excised human valves. Ninety-seven surgically excised natural cardiac valves were examined by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray energy spectroscopy to assess the occurrence of crystalline deposits that contain the element silicon. Valves examined included 33 mitral valves, 63 aortic valves, and 1 tricuspid valve. To reduce the possibility of surface contamination, the deep layers of some valves were examined after exposure by fracture of the valve. Crystalline material containing silicon was observed in the deep tissue. Such crystalline material was sometimes entwined within subendothelial fibers. Crystalline deposits that contained silicon were associated with 34 of 97 of these valves (35%). Among the 34 valves that showed silicon, 24 (71%) also showed microdeposits of calcific material. In view of evidence that silicon may participate in the calcification of bone, and is found in the intima of arteries, a role for this element in ectopic calcification of valves may exist. 
3	Lyme disease: neurologic and ophthalmic manifestations. Lyme disease is tick-borne infection which produces early and late manifestations in many organ systems. Prominent symptoms and signs occur in skin, heart, joints and nervous system. Many ocular and neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities recently have been attributed to Lyme disease, but some cases have not been well established as direct sequelae. This review of the contemporary state of knowledge about Lyme disease was undertaken so that more rigorous criteria can be applied in future diagnosis. 
4	Long-term outcome and prognostic indicators in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. We examined 61 patients an average of 9.6 years (range 5 to 18 years) after an episode of childhood hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Twenty-four (39%) had one or more abnormalities. Seven (11%) had proteinuria and six (10%) had low creatinine clearance as solitary abnormalities. Eight (13%) had both proteinuria and reduced creatinine clearance; three (5%) had a combination of hypertension, proteinuria, and low creatinine clearance. Abnormalities sometimes appeared after an interval of apparent recovery. Logistic regression analysis showed that duration of anuria was the best predictor of disease at follow-up. No patients who had anuria lasting longer than 8 days or oliguria exceeding 15 days escaped chronic disease. However, 45% of those with disease had no anuria, and a third had no oliguria. Physicians should therefore be cautious in assuming recovery from HUS on the basis of a single evaluation and should periodically evaluate patients for an extended period. 
1	Successful treatment of metastatic thymic carcinoma with cisplatin, vinblastine, bleomycin, and etoposide chemotherapy. Thymic carcinomas are rare malignant neoplasms of the thymic epithelium that are distinguished from the malignant thymomas by the presence of cytologic atypia. Thymic carcinomas may metastasize outside of the thorax and are associated with a very poor prognosis. Complete responses of thymic carcinoma to chemotherapy alone have not been reported. A 21-year-old man with metastatic undifferentiated carcinoma of probable thymic origin is presented who achieved a pathologic complete response with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin chemotherapy. Additional consolidative chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide was administered. The patient remains disease-free 5 years after diagnosis. Cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin chemotherapy appears to have significant activity against thymic carcinoma. 
5	Postoperative myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. S.P.I. Research Group. Cardiac morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery continue to be significant problems. To determine the prevalence, characteristics, and prognostic importance of postoperative myocardial ischemia after CABG surgery, the authors monitored 50 patients continuously for 10 perioperative days with the use of two-lead electrocardiography (ECG). ECG changes consistent with ischemia were defined as a reversible ST depression of 1 mm or greater or an elevation of 2 mm or greater from baseline, lasting at least 1 min. Baseline was adjusted for positional changes and temporal drift. All episodes were verified, with the use of the ECG monitor printout (ECG complexes), by two independent blinded investigators. Clinical care was not controlled by study protocol, and clinicians were unaware of the research data collected. Twenty-six of 50 patients (52%) had 207 episodes of perioperative ischemia (3,409 ischemic minutes). Postoperatively, ischemia developed in 48% of patients, compared with 12% preoperatively and 10% intraoperatively before bypass. Postoperative ischemia was most common in the early period (postoperative days [PODs] 0-2; 38% of patients), peaking during the first 2 h after revascularization, and less common during the late postoperative period (PODs 3-7; 24% of patients). Almost all (120 of 122; 98%) postoperative episodes (after tracheal extubation) were asymptomatic: only 9 of 70 (13%) early episodes were detected by clinical ECG monitoring. Postoperative ischemia did not appear to be related to acute changes in myocardial oxygen demand: only 39% of the postoperative episodes were preceded by a greater than 20% increase in heart rate. However, tachycardia persisted throughout the postoperative week (22-33% of all heart rates greater than 100 beats per min), and patients with postoperative ischemia (POD 0) more frequently had tachycardia (median 43% vs. 12% of the time; P less than 0.01). Five adverse cardiac outcomes occurred on the day of surgery; all five were preceded by postoperative ischemia, three by intraoperative ischemia before bypass, and none by preoperative ischemia. Patients with late postoperative ischemia did not have an adverse cardiac outcome. The authors conclude the following: 1) ischemia is more prevalent postoperatively than preoperatively or intraoperatively before bypass; 2) the incidence of postoperative ischemia peaks shortly after revascularization, during which time it is symptomatically silent, difficult to detect, and related to adverse cardiac outcome; 3) late postoperative ischemia also is silent, but it is less prevalent and not associated with in-hospital adverse cardiac outcome; and 4) a relationship between ischemia and persistently elevated postoperative heart rate may exist and warrants additional investigation. 
5	Effects of carotenoids in cellular and animal systems. It has been suggested that carotenoid pigments may function as chemopreventive agents for reducing the risk of cancer in humans. Part of this suggestion rests on epidemiological evidence, and part rests on work done in cellular and animal systems. In this article, the experimental evidence for carotenoid inhibition of mutagenicity, malignant transformation, tumor formation, and immunoenhancement is reviewed. Although a mechanism for these effects cannot yet be identified, it is clear that the overwhelming evidence in these systems would indicate that carotenoids exert an important influence in modulating the actions of carcinogens. 
3	Postauricular cerebellar encephalocoele secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media and mastoid surgery. Cerebellar herniation into the mastoid through the posterior aspect of the temporal bone as a result of chronic suppurative otitis media and mastoid surgery is a rare event. A case is reported in which such a hernia presented subcutaneously behind the pinna; its repair is discussed. 
3	Glossopharyngeal neuralgia associated with cardiac syncope: long term treatment with permanent pacing and carbamazepine. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia associated with cardiac syncope developed in a 53 year old man. Symptoms were controlled with temporary and permanent transvenous pacing and carbamazepine. 
1	Disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma not associated with HIV infection in a bisexual man. We report a 42-year-old white bisexual man with disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma limited to the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Results of several serum tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies have been negative. The CD4/CD8 ratio has remained normal, and his Kaposi's sarcoma has had a benign clinical course during 30 months of follow-up. Similar reports of disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma with a benign clinical course in homosexual or bisexual men without demonstrable HIV infection are reviewed. Some cellular immune impairment that might be more prevalent in the homosexual population may be implicated in the pathogenesis of this type of Kaposi's sarcoma. 
5	Naloxone and spinal fluid drainage as adjuncts in the surgical treatment of thoracoabdominal and thoracic aneurysms. Forty-seven patients who were treated for thoracoabdominal or thoracic aneurysms over a 5 1/2-year period were analyzed for neurologic deficit risk. Patients were divided into two groups for analysis. Twenty-four patients, who were treated from January 1984 to December 1986, did not undergo spinal fluid drainage or naloxone administration (group A). Twenty-three patients, who were treated from January 1987 to August 1989, had spinal fluid drainage (group B); 12 patients in this group also received naloxone as an intravenous drip at 1 microgram/kg/hr for 48 hours after surgery. Permanent neurologic deficits occurred in seven (29%) group A patients but in only one (4%) group B patient, who did not receive naloxone (p less than 0.03). The first two group B patients to receive naloxone showed complete reversal of neurologic deficits on waking from anesthesia. This significant reduction in neurologic deficit was associated with an increased 1-year survival rate (72% in group A, 91% in group B). We conclude that the use of naloxone and spinal fluid drainage reduces the incidence of neurologic deficit that is associated with repair of thoracoabdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysms. This reduction in neurologic deficit is associated with improved survival in the long term. The observed reversal of postoperative neurologic deficits with naloxone implicates opiates as a major factor in the pathophysiology of spinal cord ischemia. 
5	The effects of methoxamine and epinephrine on survival and regional distribution of cardiac output in dogs with prolonged ventricular fibrillation This study compares the effects of methoxamine, a pure alpha 1-agonist, and epinephrine on cerebral and myocardial blood flow, central hemodynamics, and survival in a randomized placebo-controlled fashion during prolonged ventricular fibrillation (VF) in a canine model. Twenty-four anesthetized and ventilated adult mongrel dogs were instrumented for regional blood flow determinations using radio-labeled microspheres. The dogs were randomized to receive either 20 mg of methoxamine as a single intravenous bolus or repeated boluses of 0.02 mg/kg of epinephrine, 0.2 mg/kg of epinephrine, or normal saline solution placebo beginning at three minutes following induction of VF and initiation of closed chest cardiac massage (CCCM). Organ blood flow measurements were determined during normal sinus rhythm and after five and 20 minutes of VF. All six dogs receiving methoxamine were successfully resuscitated in contrast to only one in each of the epinephrine-treated groups and none of the dogs receiving placebo (p less than .01). Although epinephrine was associated with significantly higher blood pressures than placebo during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), blood pressures achieved with methoxamine were significantly higher than those observed in the other three treatment groups (p less than .001). Cerebral blood flow was significantly higher with both methoxamine and high-dose epinephrine (p less than .05). Mean left and right ventricular myocardial flows were highest with methoxamine but this did not achieve statistical significance. In contrast, organ flows measured in the animals receiving the lowest dose of epinephrine were not significantly higher than those associated with placebo. Cardiac output after 20 minutes of CPR was significantly lower with high-dose epinephrine than with methoxamine or placebo (p less than .05). Our results suggest that methoxamine significantly improves regional cerebral blood flow and survival during CPR and although high-dose epinephrine is associated with comparable improvements in regional cerebral blood flow, this treatment is associated with deterioration in central hemodynamics during prolonged VF and does not enhance survival. 
5	Use of the diaphragm to reinforce anastomosis of the intestines. Use of a diaphragmatic flap to buttress and help secure persistent intestinal fistula is described. The potential for the use of muscle flaps in the management of recurrent intestinal fistula is presented. 
4	Incidence and clinical significance of transient creatine kinase elevations and the diagnosis of non-Q wave myocardial infarction associated with coronary angioplasty. To assess the incidence and clinical significance of elevated total plasma creatine kinase (CK) and MB isoenzyme fraction after apparently successful coronary angioplasty, a prospective study of 272 consecutive elective procedures was undertaken. Total CK (normal less than 100 IU/liter) and CK MB isoenzyme (normal less than 4%) were measured immediately after successful completion of the procedure and every 6 h for 24 h. All nonelective procedures and results not fulfilling all American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Task Force guideline criteria for a successful result were excluded from analysis. Of the 272 elective procedures, 249 (92%) were successfully; abnormally elevated CK or CK MB serum levels, or both, were found in 38 (15%) of the successful outcomes. Three patterns of abnormal enzymes were identified: 15 patients with CK greater than or equal to 200 IU/liter and CK MB greater than or equal to 5% (group 1), 4 patients with CK greater than or equal to 200 IU/litter and CK MB less than or equal to 4% (group 2) and 19 patients with CK less than 200 IU/liter and CK MB greater than or equal to 5% (group 3). The three groups were distinguishable by the nature of the complications causing the enzyme release (in particular, the etiology and clinical manifestations). There were significantly more clinically apparent events in group 1 than in the other groups (13 of 15 versus 11 of 23, p less than 0.01) and more events associated with persistent electrocardiographic changes (p = 0.05) and chest pain (p less than 0.05). However, no clinically important sequelae were recognizable in any group at hospital discharge. Thus, abnormal cardiac serum enzyme release after apparently successful coronary angioplasty is 1) relatively common; 2) has many possible causes, including both minor complications and early reversibility of impending major complications; and 3) results in no permanent clinical sequelae. 
1	Vestibular papillae of the vulva. Lack of evidence for human papillomavirus etiology. Vestibular papillae of the vulva are usually considered as anatomical variants of the vestibular mucosa. Clinically, however, they are quite often interpreted as condylomata acuminata and recent studies have suggested that they could be related to human papillomavirus infection. This prompted us to search for human papillomavirus DNA using the Southern blot hybridization technique, by analyzing biopsy specimens taken from 29 patients who presented with papillae of the vestibular mucosa. Human papillomavirus sequences were detected only in two (6.9%) cases. By the same technique, human papillomavirus sequences were detected in 24 (96%) of 25 vulvar warts used as the control specimens. Thus, it appears unlikely that vestibular papillae are related to human papillomavirus infection. They are usually distinguishable from condylomata acuminata by clinical examination alone. 
4	Bretylium tosylate versus lidocaine in experimental cardiac arrest Bretylium tosylate has been shown effective in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation and in the prevention of its recurrence. However, lidocaine is generally preferred because bretylium could have adverse hemodynamic effects related to its antiadrenergic action. To explore further the differences between these two antiarrhythmic agents, the authors compared the effects of bretylium, lidocaine, and saline on a standardized dog model of ventricular fibrillation followed by electromechanical dissociation (EMD). The protocol included three successive episodes of cardiac arrest in each animal. Three minutes before each episode of ventricular fibrillation, 5 mg/kg of bretylium tosylate (n = 11), 1 mg/kg of lidocaine (n = 9) or saline (n = 12) were administered blindly. There was no difference in the duration of cardiac arrest (bretylium, 8 min 18 sec; lidocaine, 7 min 54 sec; saline, 8 min 20 sec) or the total doses of epinephrine required to resuscitate the animals. Both bretylium and lidocaine appeared to preserve cardiac function 5 minutes after recovery, as stroke volume increased from 17.8 +/- 6.7 to 18.7 +/- 6.7 mL (NS) after bretylium and from 17.7 +/- 7.7 to 19.0 +/- 7.0 mL (NS) after lidocaine, but decreased from 19.0 +/- 5.3 to 14.6 +/- 6.0 mL (P less than .05) after saline. During the first 10 minutes of EMD, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia recurred in 4 dogs treated with lidocaine, 3 dogs treated with saline, but no dog treated with bretylium (P less than .05 between bretylium and saline). 
1	Combined hepatic and vena caval resection with autogenous caval graft replacement. Right-sided and caudate hepatic lobectomy with resection of the retrohepatic vena cava were performed in a 34-year-old woman with recurrent adrenal carcinoma. The vena cava was replaced with a graft constructed from autogenous superficial femoral vein. Included herein is a review of the literature detailing the three previously reported cases of combined hepatic and caval resection; to our knowledge, there are no prior reports of the use of an autogenous vein graft in this setting. With surgical and anesthetic techniques, including total vascular exclusion of the liver and venovenous bypass, methods that were developed in large part through experience in liver transplantation, this type of surgery can be performed with a high rate of success. 
3	Participation of serotonergic mechanisms in the pathophysiology of experimental neoplastic spinal cord compression. We evaluated the role of serotonin (5-HT) in neoplastic cord compression in paraplegic rats harboring a thoracolumbar epidural tumor. We measured serotonin and its major metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), in the C-1 to C-7, T-1 to T-6, T-7 to T-12, and T-13 to L-3 spinal segments of tumor-free and tumor-bearing rats. In normal controls, a consistent rostral-to-caudal gradient for 5-HT and 5-HIAA was evident, but the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio remained constant. In paralyzed rats, 5-HT levels were unchanged, but the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was elevated, especially in the compressed segments. Treatment with either dexamethasone or indomethacin delayed onset of paraplegia but had no effect on 5-HT metabolism. Blocking 5-HT receptors by cyproheptadine, evaluated 30 hours after onset of paralysis and treatment, resulted in a reduction in the high water content, vascular permeability, and prostaglandin E2 synthesis in the compressed cord. Early administration of cyproheptadine effectively delayed the onset of paraplegia. These data indicate that receptor-activated serotonergic mechanisms participate in the disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier and that these effects can be manipulated pharmacologically. 
5	Treatment of chronic facial palsy by transplantation of the neurovascularized free rectus abdominis muscle. We performed neurovascularized free rectus abdominis muscle transplantations in two patients with chronic facial palsy. In one patient, the postoperative course was uneventful, but the patient died from rupture of esophageal varices. In the other patient, both morphologic and functional results were satisfactory. Therefore, the rectus abdominis muscle is considered to be a suitable donor for muscle transplantation for the treatment of chronic facial palsy. The rectus abdominis muscle is advantageous in that (1) simultaneous operations by two teams are possible with the patient in the supine position, (2) it is supplied by long nerves and long and large vessels, (3) it is flat and consists of segments with appropriate lengths, (4) the force and distance of contraction are appropriate, and (5) the tendinous intersections are suitable for anchoring sutures. 
4	Percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted balloon angioplasty: initial clinical and quantitative angiographic results in 50 patients. The initial clinical experience and quantitative angiographic results of percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted balloon angioplasty are described for 55 lesions in 50 patients. With use of a xenon chloride (308 nm) excimer laser generator and 1.5 to 1.75 mm catheters, excimer laser angioplasty was attempted at 135 ns pulse width, 25 to 40 Hz repetition rate, 2 to 5 s laser delivery time and 30 to 60 mJ/mm2 energy fluence. Laser success (greater than 20% reduction in absolute percent diameter stenosis) was achieved in 41 (75%) of 55 lesions, with 100% subsequent balloon angioplasty success (less than 50% residual stenosis). By quantitative digital caliper technique, the percent diameter stenosis (mean +/- SE) was reduced from 81 +/- 1% to 50 +/- 3% after excimer laser angioplasty (p less than 0.001) and to 20 +/- 1% after balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001); minimal luminal diameter increased from 0.56 +/- 0.04 to 1.46 +/- 0.08 mm (p less than 0.001) and 2.03 +/- 0.07 mm (p less than 0.001), respectively. By videodensitometric techniques, the percent area stenosis decreased from 86 +/- 2% to 54 +/- 3% after excimer angioplasty (p less than 0.001) and to 26 +/- 3% after balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001). There were no perforations, need for emergency bypass surgery or deaths. The overall incidence of abrupt closure (3.6%), dissection (1.8%), embolization (1.8%), filling defect (6%), myocardial infarction (5.5%), side branch occlusion (3.6%) or spasm (3.6%) was infrequent and more related to subsequent balloon angioplasty than to the laser procedure. 
1	Surgical indication and significance of portal vein resection in biliary and pancreatic cancer. Tumor and vascular resection was carried out in 27 patients with biliary and pancreatic cancer. Vascular resection included resection and reconstruction of the both the portal vein and hepatic artery in two of the patients. Portal vein resection only was carried out in 23 patients, and resection of the side wall and plasty of the portal vein was carried out in the other two patients. The technical limit of portal vein resection without graft was 4 cm in the hepatic hilus and 7 cm after total pancreatectomy or pancreatoduodenectomy without grafts. On temporary occlusion of the portal vein between resection and reconstruction, simple occlusion was sufficient if it occurred within 30 minutes. In occlusion of more than 30 minutes, simultaneous occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery is better to prevent congestion of the intestine. If occlusion of more than 60 minutes is anticipated, a bypass between the superior mesenteric vein and the femoral vein with Anthron tube is recommended. The postoperative course was uneventful in 20 of the 27 patients. Two patients died within 1 month after surgery. The mortality rate for this aggressive surgery was 8.4%. Minor complications such as hydrothorax, small bile leakage, and localized abscess were observed but soon subsided in five patients. Fourteen of 27 patients survived or are alive after more than 1 year, and 9 of 14 patients survived or are alive after 2 years. Forty-seven percent of the patients who had no lymph node metastasis or peritumor lymph node metastasis without cancerous invasion of the portal vein intima survived more than 2 years. The longest length of survival of a patient with nonfunctioning islet cell carcinoma of the pancreatic head was 5 years 9 months. The longest surviving patient with ductal cell carcinoma of the pancreas is still living after 4 years. This approach is recommended in certain patients with vascular involvement but without lymph node metastasis or those patients with only peritumor lymph node involvement. Frozen section of mesenteric and paraaortic nodes should be standard practice before this aggressive resection. 
2	Gallstone clearance: a randomized study of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and chemical dissolution Following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy it is not known whether gallstone fragments are cleared from the gallbladder without the use of oral dissolution therapy. To assess the efficacy of lithotripsy and dissolution therapy, alone or in combination, 35 patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups: lithotripsy alone, dissolution therapy alone or combined lithotripsy and dissolution therapy. All patients had symptomatic gallstones, functioning gallbladders and comparable stone profiles. Lithotripsy was administered using a piezoelectric lithotripter. Dissolution therapy consisted of combined bile acid and terpene. Clearance was assessed at 6 months using ultrasound and oral cholecystography. Patients with less than 50 per cent stone clearance at the end of 6 months were considered failures. The number of patients with total or partial clearance in the combined group (7/10) was significantly greater than those in the lithotripsy alone group (0/10, P less than 0.002). Gallstone clearance following lithotripsy appears to be dependent upon dissolution therapy. 
1	Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal. Progress in the prognosis of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal has followed the use of multimodality therapy. From 1977 to 1985, 42 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal were treated with mitomycin C (15 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m2) on day 1, 5-FU (750 mg/m2/d) alone on days 2 to 5, and radiation therapy (3000 cGy) on days 7 to 28. They were evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after completion of the chemotherapy/radiation therapy protocol and received local excision, abdominoperineal resection, or both. Patient follow-up times ranged from 7 to 161 months, with a mean follow-up time of 71 months. Pathologic examination showed no residual carcinoma in 19 (45%) patients. The authors could not predict, based on clinical evaluation, which patients would have a complete response. Of the patients with a complete clinical response, 44% had tumor in the pathology specimen. Wide local excision was the most common initial operation (23 of 42 patients; 55%), with five of these patients subsequently requiring abdominoperineal resection. Anal continence was retained in 18 of 42 (43%) patients. Eleven patients experienced recurrent disease: six local recurrences, one distant, and four both local and distant. The 5-year overall survival rate was 82% and the 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 87%. There were no treatment related deaths. Preoperative tumor size was the only factor significantly related to survival. Contrary to other reports, tumor in the pathology specimen did not adversely affect long-term survival. Hence, patients should be treated after chemotherapy/radiation therapy with surgical therapy sufficient to control local disease. 
1	Chordoma: a 20-year clinicopathologic review of the experience at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. Eighteen chordomas (11 females and 7 males) were seen over a 20-year period; 61% of the tumors occurred in the sphenoid region. The youngest patient was 3 years old and had a family history of chordoma. Histologically, the tumors were divided into classical (epithelial) and chondroid variants, which in this series, had no effect on outcome. Follow-up on 12 patients ranged from 3 to 170 months, and they were treated with various combinations of surgery and radiotherapy. One patient was administered the neutron beam and died after 94 months. The mean survival of this series is 73.4 months, with a survival rate of 50% (6 out of 12 patients alive). Surgical resection offers the best chance of survival, but chordomas have a propensity to metastasize, hence have a poor prognosis. 
1	Characterization of astrocytomas, meningiomas, and pituitary adenomas by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Phosphorus magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy allows noninvasive measurement of phosphate-containing compounds and pH within brain cells. The authors obtained localized phosphorus MR spectra from 10 normal brains, four low-grade astrocytomas, six glioblastomas, four meningiomas, and three pituitary adenomas and found differences in the spectra of each tumor type. Compared to normal brain, the spectra from low-grade astrocytomas showed a significant reduction of the phosphodiester (PDE) peak. Glioblastomas were characterized by a significant reduction of the PDE peak, elevation of the phosphomonoester (PME) peak, and a relatively alkaline intracellular pH. The spectra from meningiomas and pituitary adenomas were markedly different from the glial tumors. Meningiomas showed significant reductions in phosphocreatine, PDE, and inorganic phosphate, as well as a relatively alkaline pH. Pituitary adenomas resembled meningiomas, but had a much higher PME peak. Although the number of tumors studied was small, there appears to be a characteristic spectrum associated with these different tumor types. The present findings can be useful in the preoperative identification of these tumors and in furthering understanding of their growth and metabolism in vivo. 
5	Effect of closing dead space on incidence of seroma after mastectomy. Seromas are a significant cause of morbidity after modified radical mastectomy. The effect of closing dead space by suturing skin flaps to underlying muscle combined with early removal (48 hours postoperatively) of closed suction drains on formation of the seroma was evaluated prospectively in 37 patients. Thirty-three underwent modified radical mastectomy for invasive carcinoma while four underwent total mastectomy with a level 1 axillary dissection for multifocal intraductal carcinoma. Seromas occurred in three, all were minor, two required one aspiration only and one required two aspirations. Two were seromas of the lower flap while one was an axillary seroma. Except for one patient who had a wound hematoma develop, no other instances of morbidity were noted. Closing dead space by suturing skin flaps to underlying muscle combined with early removal of closed suction drains is associated with a low incidence of seroma formation after mastectomy. Use of this technique has important economic and clinical implications for patients who had mastectomy. 
5	Reoperation for myocardial revascularization using the internal mammary artery. From October 1984 up to February 1989, 40 patients had "redo" myocardial revascularizations using one or both internal mammary arteries (IMA) in over 1000 cases operated upon in our Department for coronary bypass grafts. Thirty-one patients had a further operation for unstable angina difficult to control with drugs. Mean interval of recurrence of angina after previous surgery was 48.5 months for all the cases, but the mean interval before the second bypass operation was 68 months. Severe disease of previous vein grafts was the reason for surgery in 25 patients and progressive atherosclerosis in native coronary arteries in 15 patients. Twenty-one patients had a single mammary artery; both mammary arteries were used in 19. Two cases had endarterectomy on left anterior descending (LAD). Four patients had peroperative acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 3 a low cardiac output syndrome, postoperative bleeding occurred in 3 cases and wound infection in one case. An intraaortic balloon pump was used preoperatively in one case and coming off bypass in two others. One patient died on the second day postoperatively from cardiac arrest following bilateral pneumothorax. There were no late deaths. At a mean follow-up of 20.5 months, 28 patients are free of symptoms but 11 are complaining of angina, 5 during exercise and 6 at rest. An exercise test was positive in 8 patients. 
4	Frequency of myocardial indium-111 antimyosin uptake after uncomplicated coronary artery bypass grafting. The reported incidence of myocardial damage after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is highly related to the methods used. Since indium-111 monoclonal antimyosin antibody scintigraphy has been shown to be highly specific and sensitive for myocardial necrosis, even in small lesions, uptake of this radiotracer was evaluated after CABG. In 23 consecutive patients without previous myocardial infarction who underwent CABG for stable angina, 80 MBq indium-111 antimyosin was injected on the third postoperative day. Planar images were obtained 48 hours later and analyzed for myocardial uptake of indium-111 antimyosin. Scintigraphic results were related to creatine kinase MB levels, duration of both aortic cross-clamping and cardiopulmonary bypass, and electrocardiographic changes. In all patients surgical procedure and postoperative course was uncomplicated. Indium-111 antimyosin uptake was present in 19 of 23 patients (82%). It was diffused in 7 patients and localized in 12. No pathologic Q waves occurred postoperatively. Fourteen patients exhibited ST-segment changes. No good relation was found among indium-111 antimyosin uptake and creatine kinase MB levels, duration of cross-clamping or bypass, and ST-T changes. It is concluded that some degree of myocardial damage, though silent, is common after CABG. 
3	Cerebral infarction and release of platelet thromboxane after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate and the release of thromboxane B2 were studied in 68 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage during the second week after the hemorrhage, when delayed ischemic deterioration most often occurs. Follow-up computed tomographic scans were performed later than 1 month after subarachnoid hemorrhage to reveal permanent hypodense areas consistent with cerebral infarction. Occurrence of hypodense lesions on the follow-up computed tomographic scan was significantly associated with the presence of delayed ischemic deterioration (DID) (P less than 0.01). Patients with subcortical or cortical cerebral infarctions due to DID released more platelet thromboxane B2 than those with no evidence of a hypodense lesion on the computed tomographic scan (P less than 0.05). Hypodense areas caused by an intracerebral hematoma or small, deep-seated infarcts due to DID were not associated with significantly elevated release of thromboxane B2, but the lacunar type infarcts were associated with increased aggregation of platelets. The results suggest that augmented platelet function may be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction due to DID. 
5	Acute lead poisoning in nursing home and psychiatric patients from the ingestion of lead-based ceramic glazes. To our knowledge, acute inorganic lead poisoning from single ingestions of lead compounds has been only rarely reported. During a 14-month period, we were contacted regarding eight instances of acute ingestions of liquid lead-based ceramic glazes by mentally impaired residents of nursing homes or psychiatric facilities participating in ceramic arts programs. While some ingestions did not cause toxic effects, some patients developed acute lead poisoning characterized by abdominal pain, anemia, and basophilic stippling of red blood cells. In the blood of several patients, lead concentrations were far above normal (4 to 9.5 mumol/L). Urinary lead excretions were tremendously elevated during chelation therapy, with one patient excreting 535.9 mumol/L of lead during a 6-day period, the largest lead excretion ever reported in a patient suffering from acute lead poisoning, to our knowledge. All patients recovered following supportive care and appropriate use of chelating agents. Lead-based glazes are commonly found in nursing homes and psychiatric facilities. We suspect that acute or chronic lead poisoning from the ingestion(s) of lead-based ceramic glazes may be an unrecognized but not uncommon problem among such residents. We urge physicians to take ingestions of lead-based glazes seriously and to consider the diagnosis of lead poisoning in nursing home and psychiatric patients who have participated in ceramic crafts programs. 
5	Ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction during pregnancy. Many women with cerebrospinal fluid shunts are now reaching reproductive age. Shunt malfunction may occur during pregnancy, and management requires a well-planned, combined neurosurgical and obstetrical approach. We present a case of ventriculoperitoneal shunt obstruction manifesting during the third trimester managed successfully in a conservative fashion. The literature on ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction during pregnancy is reviewed. 
5	Myocardial preservation using lidocaine blood cardioplegia. Prevention of ventricular fibrillation after aortic unclamping using lidocaine hydrochloride as an additive to cold potassium blood cardioplegia was studied prospectively in 46 patients undergoing elective myocardial revascularization. Patients were similar with respect to age, ventricular function, severity of coronary artery disease, cross-clamp time, completeness of revascularization, frequency of internal thoracic artery grafting, systemic temperature at the time of cross-clamp removal, and mean infusate volume and temperature. Patients receiving lidocaine blood cardioplegia (group 1, 23 patients) had a significant reduction in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (22% versus 74%; p less than 0.0005) and in the mean number of cardioversion attempts required to defibrillate the heart (0.5 +/- 1.3 versus 1.9 +/- 0.97; p less than 0.0005) after cross-clamp removal compared with controls (group 2, 23 patients). There were no differences between the two groups postoperatively with regard to cardiac enzyme release, hemodynamic measurements, or clinical outcome. Patients receiving lidocaine blood cardioplegia tended to have a lower incidence of new postoperative atrial fibrillation (9% versus 26%). Ventricular function was preserved equally in both groups. We conclude that lidocaine is a safe additive to potassium blood cardioplegia and significantly reduces the incidence of ventricular fibrillation after aortic unclamping. 
2	The freckle sign--an endoscopic feature of the cecum. Mucosal spots, or "freckles," surrounding the appendiceal orifice are an endoscopic feature of the cecum. These are clusters of 1 to 2 mm round or oval slightly raised spots, each with a pale center and an erythematous border. They correlate microscopically with subepithelial and submucosal lymphoid follicles. The freckling pattern, identified in about one third of colonoscopies, was seen best with the videoendoscope and was identified more commonly in patients with systemic illness. Recognition of mucosal freckling around the appendiceal orifice helps identify the cecum and may be useful in the evaluation of cecal and appendiceal pathology. 
3	Coronary bypass surgery: is the operation different today? Patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting have undergone an evolution in recent years. To document this change, we analyzed two groups of patients in 1981 (n = 1586) and 1987 (n = 1513) to document preoperative and postoperative variables important in determining immediate morbidity and mortality after isolated coronary bypass. Between 1981 and 1987, patients were found to be older (greater than or equal to 70 years, 8.7% versus 21.8%, p less than 0.0001), more often diabetic (15% versus 24%, p less than 0.0001), have a greater prevalence of triple vessel disease (14.5% versus 46.1%, p less than 0.0001), and have more left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 0.60 +/- 14 versus 0.54 +/- 13, p less than 0.0001). To facilitate analysis and because of overlap between subgroups, we subdivided patients into three subgroups for statistical comparison of the years 1981 and 1987: subgroup I, no prior procedure (n = 1546 in 1981 and 1396 in 1987); subgroup II, optimal group (n = 503 in 1981 and 292 in 1987, and defined as no prior procedure, ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 and age less than 65 years); subgroup III, patients having reoperations (n = 40 in 1981 and 117 in 1987). Internal mammary artery grafting was infrequently used in 1981 but was used in 72.1% in 1987. Major postoperative morbidity between the 2 years for the total population increased significantly: need for intraaortic balloon pumping, 1.4% versus 4.7%, p less than 0.0001; myocardial infarction 3.5% versus 5.5%, p less than 0.008; stroke, 1.4% versus 2.8%, p less than 0.008; and wound infection, 1.0% versus 3.0%, p less than 0.001. Wound infection (all types) in 1987 was increased sevenfold in patients having a perioperative myocardial infarction (0.7% versus 5%, p less than 0.0001). For young patients with good left ventricular function (subgroup II), there was no increase in these morbid events between 1981 and 1987. Hospital mortality in the total population increased significantly between 1981 and 1987 from 1.2% to 3.1% (p less than 0.0002), respectively. It was lowest for the patients in optimal condition (subgroup II) in both years, 0.8% versus 1.1%, and highest for reoperative patients, 5.3% versus 4.3%. In 1981, 58% of patients (503/870) were in the optimal group compared with 35% (292/828) in 1987 (p less than 0.0001). The last six years have seen a progressive trend in surgically treating older, sicker patients who have more complex disease, with a significant reduction in the best candidate group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	The headache-specific locus of control scale: adaptation to recurrent headaches. This paper describes the development, psychometric properties, and construct and incremental validity of a Headache-Specific Locus of Control Scale (HSLC). The HSLC is a 33 item scale designed specifically for recurrent headache sufferers. It assesses the individual's perceptions that headache problems and headache relief are determined primarily by: the individual's behavior (Internal factors), Health Care Professionals, or Chance factors. The psychometric properties of the HSLC were satisfactory. Among our findings were that: (1) the belief that headache problems and relief are determined by chance factors was associated with higher levels of depression, physical complaints, reliance on maladaptive pain coping strategies (p less than .001), and greater headache-related disability (p less than .01); (2) the belief that headache problems and relief are influenced primarily by the ministrations of health care professionals was associated with higher levels of medication use (p less than .01) and preference for medical treatment (p less than .001); and (3) the belief that headache problems are determined by the individual's responses and behaviors was associated with a preference for self-regulation treatment (p less than .01). These findings suggest adaptation to headache problems is influenced not only by the frequency and severity of the headache episodes, but by locus of control beliefs. The assessment of locus of control beliefs may provide useful information not typically obtained from standard medical evaluations. 
2	Renal scintigraphy in the diagnosis and surgical management of a patient with caliceal colic: a case report. A patient with persistent renal colic and a caliceal stone is presented. Furosemide renography, commonly used to differentiate functional stasis from mechanical obstruction of an entire kidney or duplicated collecting system, can make this determination at the caliceal level. As in this case such determination can affect clinical management of the patient. 
4	Vagal schwannoma associated with syncopal attacks and postural hypotension: a case report. A case of vagal schwannoma in the cerebellomedullary angle is reported. Preoperatively, the patient had paroxysmal episodes of postural hypotension with syncope. After total removal of the vagal tumor, her systemic blood pressure returned to normal. 
4	Effect of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the circadian occurrence of ischemic cardiovascular events. Clinical observations suggest that beta-adrenergic blocking agents can modify the circadian occurrence of a variety of ischemic events. Morning awakening is associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure and pulse, serum catecholamine content and platelet activation, at a time of decreased blood thrombolytic activity. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have the potential to modify many of these events. Current data indicate that these agents modify blood pressure and pulse, but do not prevent their early morning increase. In addition, beta-adrenergic blocking agents decrease ventricular ectopy and its circadian variation. Recent studies in humans indicate, however, that metoprolol does not affect the circadian increase in platelet activity or serum catecholamines. The specific mechanism by which beta blockers affect the circadian occurrence of ischemic events remains uncertain. 
5	Time course and prognostic significance of serial signal-averaged electrocardiograms after a first acute myocardial infarction. The prognostic significance of serial signal-averaged electrocardiograms recorded during the first 3 days (period 1), in the second week (period 2) after a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 6 months later (period 3) was prospectively assessed in 190 patients. No patients were treated with thrombolytic therapy. Patients with conduction disturbances were excluded. Mean age of the 190 patients was 57 years (range 34 to 74) and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 40 + 6% (range 12 to 70). Eighty-four patients had an anterior wall AMI and the remaining 106 patients an inferior wall AMI. After a mean follow-up of 24 months, 16 patients developed sustained symptomatic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, 7 patients were resuscitated from an episode of ventricular fibrillation, and 10 patients died suddenly. Multivariate regression analysis using continuous variables showed that the strongest predictor of sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was the left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.0001) followed by the duration of QRS complex on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram recorded during the first 3 days of AMI (p less than 0.0005). Sudden death was only predicted by left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.02). 
5	Doppler echocardiographic assessment of the St. Jude Medical prosthetic valve in the aortic position using the continuity equation. To test whether the continuity equation can be applied to the noninvasive assessment of prosthetic aortic valve function, Doppler echocardiography was performed in 67 patients (mean age, 58 +/- 14 years) within 10 +/- 6 days after valve replacement with St. Jude Medical valves. All patients were clinically stable and without evidence of valve dysfunction. Valve size ranged from 19 to 31 mm, and ejection fraction ranged from 30% to 75%. With the parasternal long-axis view, the left ventricular outflow diameter measured just proximal to the prosthetic valve correlated well with valve size (r = 0.92). Doppler-derived maximal gradients ranged from 9 to 71 mm Hg. Effective prosthetic aortic valve area by the continuity equation ranged between 0.73 cm2 for a 19-mm valve and 4.23 cm2 for a 31-mm valve. With analysis of variance, effective orifice area differentiated various valve sizes (p less than 10(-14)) better than did gradients alone (p = 0.003) and correlated better with actual valve orifice area (r = 0.83 versus - 0.40). A Doppler velocity index, the ratio of peak velocity in the left ventricular outflow to that of the aortic jet, averaged 0.41 +/- 0.09 and was less dependent on valve size (r = 0.43). Thus, the continuity equation can be applied to the assessment of prosthetic St. Jude valves in the aortic position. By accounting for flow through the valve, it provides an improved assessment over the sole use of gradients in the evaluation of prosthetic valve function. 
1	AIDS-associated polyclonal lymphoma: identification of a new HIV-associated disease process. High-grade non-Hodgkins B-cell lymphoma is one of the principle malignancies that occurs in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Immunoblastic lymphomas that arise in immunosuppressed transplant patients have been described as both monoclonal and polyclonal, and occur in association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. To test whether polyclonal lymphoma occurred in patients with AIDS we studied tumors from multiple sites in three patients who died with widespread AIDS-associated large cell or large cell immunoblastic lymphoma. All biopsy specimens contained invasive lymphoma. Tumor cells were mature IgM-positive immunoblasts by immunohistochemical analysis, with the same B-cell phenotype observed in all tumor sites. Only a minority of sites from all patients analyzed were monoclonal as measured by immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, with one case having several foci of monoclonal disease with other histologically identical metastases showing no evidence of monoclonal proliferation. Similar to the transplant-associated polyclonal B-cell proliferations. EBV gene sequences were present in multiple sites from one autopsy. In the other two autopsies, polyclonal B-cell proliferations occurred in the absence of EBV involvement except at one site, where a minor clone of EBV-infected cells was found. In contrast to HIV-associated Burkitt's lymphoma, no c-myc rearrangements were found at any site. These studies describe the occurrence of polyclonal lymphoma in AIDS and suggest that EBV-negative polyclonal lymphoma may be a distinct disease entity unique to HIV-infected individuals. 
4	Comparison of labetalol versus enalapril as monotherapy in elderly patients with hypertension: results of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. PURPOSE: This study compared the safety and efficacy of labetalol and enalapril as antihypertensive therapy for elderly patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized, open-label, parallel controlled trial was conducted. After completing a 4-week placebo phase, 79 elderly (65 years or older) patients with an average standing diastolic blood pressure (BP) 95 mm Hg or above and 114 mm Hg or less were randomized to receive a 12-week course of either labetalol or enalapril in an open-label design. The patients' BP and heart rate were evaluated biweekly by trained observers unaware of the treatment status, and drug dosage was titrated (up to 400 mg twice a day of labetalol or 40 mg daily of enalapril) to achieve a standing diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg and a decrease of 10 mm Hg from baseline. Patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) at the end of the placebo phase and again after 8 weeks of active treatment. RESULTS: The treatment groups were comparable in their reduction of supine diastolic BP, with no significant differences between the two treatments. Labetalol demonstrated a significantly greater reduction (p less than 0.05) in standing diastolic BP at the end of the titration period compared to enalapril, but this difference was not significant by the end of the study period. Based on 24-hour ABPM readings, labetalol reduced mean 24-hour diastolic BP (p less than 0.05) and mean heart rate (p less than 0.05) more than enalapril. The labetalol-treated patients were significantly less often above their diastolic BP goal throughout the 24-hour ABPM period (p less than 0.01). The two treatments were equally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that labetalol and enalapril are equally effective in lowering supine diastolic BP in the elderly, but labetalol is more effective in lowering ambulatory BP and heart rate throughout the day. 
5	Evaluating hematuria in children. Where to start and how to proceed. Bleeding from somewhere along the urinary tract is not unusual in children. Of the many causes, systemic infection and trauma are among the most common. History taking and physical examination should be careful and complete, because the results obtained help direct the laboratory evaluation. Diagnostic testing always begins with urinalysis but may progress to intravenous urography, voiding cystourethrography, endoscopic procedures in the upper and lower urinary tract, sonography, arteriography, or renal biopsy. Some cases remain unexplained and require follow-up to assess renal function. 
5	Experience with photocoagulation in Behcet's disease. Between 1973 and 1987 we examined both eyes of 300 patients with the uveoretinitis-type lesions characteristic of Behcet's disease. Of the 556 eyes whose fundus could be examined, 38 eyes (6.8%) in 33 patients (11%) had developed retinal capillary nonperfusion, branch retinal vein occlusion, or retinal or disc neovascularization. These eyes were treated by photocoagulation, primarily to forestall vitreous hemorrhage and the development of neovascular glaucoma, as well as to decrease the macular edema resulting from vein occlusion. The treatment, which was well tolerated, was successful in closing retinal capillary nonperfusion areas and eliminating retinal neovascularization. Disc neovascularization was resolved completely in some cases, and partially in others. 
2	Effects of aging on the swallowing mechanism. Normal swallow involves a number of closely coordinated neuromuscular events. Investigators have identified some small temporal changes in the swallow of older adults as compared with young adults. Further research is needed to define completely the primary effects of aging on deglutition. Many medical conditions that commonly affect the elderly can cause dysphagia. These are discussed in terms of their effects on swallow physiology. Diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia in the elderly should be pursued as aggressively as in the younger adult. 
5	Neurologic assessment. Neurologic nursing assessment requires the knowledge of anatomic and physiologic principles as well as the mastery of complex assessment skills. The nurse who is often the first and most consistent health team member interacting with clients may provide the key to the early recognition, prevention, and treatment of neurologic problems. The nurse, as the dynamic member of the health team, may then be the first line of defense in initiating cost-effective and perhaps life-saving measures in neurologically impaired clients. 
1	Bronchial anomaly of the right upper lobe. This case report presents a rare anomaly of right upper lobe bronchial anatomy. During routine right upper lobe resection for carcinoma, a common right upper and middle lobe bronchus was found. The resection was completed as a right upper and middle bilobectomy. Knowledge of this uncommon variant was beneficial in performing the pulmonary resection. A review of the literature is presented. 
4	Therapeutic cardiac catheterization in children Cardiac catheterization, once the mainstay of diagnosis in children with congenital heart disease, has become a therapeutic modality for many conditions. Balloon dilatation can now open stenotic valves and vessels, coils and umbrellas can now close unwanted communications, and emboli can be withdrawn without surgical intervention. 
5	Recovery from vegetative state of six months' duration associated with Sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa). Certain pharmacologic interventions may improve outcome for brain injury in animals and humans. Medications affecting the dopaminergic pathway appear to be important. We present the case of a 24-year-old man with traumatic brain injury who remained unresponsive to commands and unchanged for six months despite periodic aggressive therapy. Within days of beginning Sinemet (levodopa/carbidopa), the patient became conversant and responsive. The reported low likelihood of spontaneous recovery of cognition in patients who are vegetative for six months suggests that Sinemet was responsible for this patient's recovery. In this case, the relatively small risk of side effects from Sinemet was greatly outweighed by the change in functional outcome. 
1	The significance of low-grade prostate cancer on needle biopsy. A radical prostatectomy study of tumor grade, volume, and stage of the biopsied and multifocal tumor. Twenty-one cases showing only low Gleason grade prostate carcinoma on needle biopsy were identified. In 15 cases radical prostatectomy was performed with the entire prostate embedded for thorough evaluation of grade, volume, and stage of tumor at the needle biopsy site as well as of multifocal tumor. Eight specimens had solitary low grade and low volume tumor, with only one of these cases showing minimal capsular penetration and the others confined to the prostate. Four cases had low-grade tumor at the biopsy site, yet multifocal higher grade tumor. All of these tumor nodules were low volume and confined to the prostate. In three cases there was both low-grade and high-grade tumor in the nodule sampled by needle biopsy. In two of these cases the tumor was large and in the third it was small but mostly higher grade, with two of these cases showing capsular penetration. Although transrectal ultrasound and repeat needle biopsy would most likely have identified either the tumors' large size or high-grade component in these latter three cases, it is unlikely that these techniques would have identified the cases of multifocal higher grade tumor because of their relatively small size. Furthermore, preoperative serum prostate specific antigen levels and clinical stage failed to distinguish those cases with higher grade tumor. Because of the difficulty in identifying these areas of high-grade tumor preoperatively, it is uncertain whether expectant therapy could be recommended even for patients with very low-grade cancer on needle biopsy. 
1	Lymph nodes in incipient adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma with Hodgkin's disease-like histologic features. Lymph nodes were examined from four patients with incipient adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) who had mild lymphadenopathy, fatigue, no or a few atypical lymphocytes in their peripheral blood, and integrated proviral human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I) DNA in the nodes. The HTLV-I DNA was detected by southern blot analysis and/or polymerase chain reaction in the lymph nodes of all cases. The nodal architecture was preserved. Some scattered or aggregated highly lobular, cerebriform, or Reed-Sternberg-like giant cells were observed, with occasional mitoses and diffuse infiltration of small to medium-sized lymphocytes, with no or minimal nuclear abnormalities in the enlarged paracortex. The giant cells were usually positive for Ki-1 and also for UCHL-1 and other T-cell markers but negative for Ber-H2. Rearrangement and/or deletion of T-cell receptors were found in three of four patients. All patients died within 2 years, with transformation to overt leukemia-lymphoma occurring in three patients, and pulmonary carcinoma in one. The incipient or prelymphomatous phase of ATLL should be differentiated from Hodgkin's disease because of the distinctly different prognoses of these two diseases. 
1	Long-term (5 to 20 years) Evolution of nongrafted aplastic anemias. The Cooperative Group for the Study of Aplastic and Refractory Anemias. In the presence of aplastic anemia (AA), therapeutic choices should be determined while taking into account not only changes for immediate improvement, but also both the risks for late-occurring complications and the following quality of life. We report here data concerning a long-term clinical survey (5 to 18 years with a median of 12 years) including 156 nongrafted patients receiving androgen therapy; all patients were alive more than 5 years after diagnosis (40% of patients included at time of diagnosis in our multicentric analysis). Between the 5th and the 13th year follow-up, 21 patients died of various causes either related to AA or to its treatment: 12 of infection or hemorrhage secondary to pancytopenia (6 relapses and 6 that had never been improved; 2 with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH]); 5 of leukemia; 1 of a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; 2 of late side effects following transfusion (1 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and 1 chronic B hepatitis); and a single case of myocardial infarction (the latter could possibly result of androgen therapy). Thirteen patients in total developed PNH (among which 10 had clinical symptoms including 2 deaths, and 3 exhibited only biologic abnormalities). Few long-term side effects of androgens could be noticed. Adult height was normal in patients treated during childhood and so was young women's fertility. No malignant hepatoma occurred. This survey allows the recording of late spontaneous hematologic improvement (between 5 and 10 years of evolution). This occurred in 50% of patients that had remained cytopenic 5 years after diagnosis. Although bone marrow stem cell concentration remained abnormal after 10 years of evolution. 85% of patients had a normal red blood cell count, 80% a normal polymorphonuclear count, and 66% a normal platelet count. All patients who did not show late complications had an excellent quality of life. 
5	Causes, diagnosis, and treatment of pharyngitis. Pharyngitis is a common disease of the respiratory tract that can be caused by several different viruses and bacterial organisms. Clinically speaking, the most important causative agent is group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes). Although rare, postpharyngitis complications arise as a result of disease caused almost exclusively by group A streptococcus. Because group A streptococcal pharyngitis usually responds well to antimicrobial treatment, it is important to diagnose it. Penicillin, erythromycin, and peroral first-generation cephalosporins have been documented to be effective. In addition to group A streptococcus, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae have also been detected in patients with pharyngitis. The possibility of diagnosing these organisms is limited at the present. Clinical surveys are still needed, moreover, to evaluate the effect of antimicrobial treatment on the disease caused by these organisms. Although routine viral diagnostic methods do not help primary care physicians in treating patients with pharyngitis, information on bacteria and viruses in the immediate environment could prove to be of great help in daily clinical work. 
1	The influence of drug interval on the effect of methotrexate and fluorouracil in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer The importance of the interval between methotrexate (MTX) and fluorouracil (5-FU) was studied in 168 patients with previously untreated, measurable, advanced colorectal cancer. They were randomized to receive MTX 200 mg/m2, followed by 5-FU 600 mg/m2 either 24 hours (arm A) or 1 hour (arm B) after MTX. All patients received leucovorin (LV) 24 hours after MTX, 10 mg/m2 orally every 6 hours for six doses. The regimen was repeated every 2 weeks, with 5-FU escalation as tolerated. Arm A was significantly better than arm B with respect to overall response rate (29% v 14.5%, P = .026), time to progression (TTP; median, 9.9 months v 5.9 months, P = .009), and survival (median, 15.3 months v 11.4 months, P = .003). Significant differences between arms were not found in response rate, median TTP, or median survival for the subgroup of patients with rectal primaries who comprised 20% of the patients in each arm. Significant factors prognostic for survival were performance status and number of metastases, as well as treatment. Age did not influence survival. Toxicity was similar in both arms and was primarily gastrointestinal. More mucositis was seen in arm A. There were four toxic deaths secondary to neutropenia and infection (one from arm A and three from arm B) and three other deaths (two from arm A and one from arm B) that were possibly drug-related. The combination of MTX with LV rescue and 5-FU is an active regimen in advanced colorectal cancer; its efficacy is increased in colon, but not rectal cancer, when the interval between MTX and 5-FU is long (24 hours) rather than short (1 hour). 
2	Medical treatment of esophageal achalasia. Double-blind crossover study with oral nifedipine, verapamil, and placebo Calcium channel blockers have been previously shown to decrease lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and improve symptoms in achalasia. We performed a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study to assess the effects of oral nifedipine and verapamil on LES pressure, amplitude of esophageal body contraction, and clinical symptomatology in eight patients with symptomatic achalasia diagnosed by endoscopy, barium swallow, and manometry. Patients were randomized to receive up to 20 mg nifedipine, 160 mg verapamil, or placebo and underwent esophageal manometry before (baseline) and after four weeks on each drug. Diary cards were kept to record and grade symptoms and drug plasma level determinations were correlated with manometric and clinical findings. Both nifedipine and verapamil caused a statistically significant decrease in mean LES pressure, but only nifedipine caused a significant decrease in the amplitude of contractions of the smooth muscle portion of the esophagus. No statistically significant differences in the overall clinical symptomatology were noted with any of the drugs, although some individual improvements in dysphagia and chest pain were noted. We conclude that, despite the reduction in LES pressure and contraction amplitude of the distal esophageal body, oral nifedipine and verapamil do not significantly alter the clinical symptomatology of patients with achalasia. 
1	A clinicopathological study of the paraneoplastic neuromuscular syndromes associated with lung cancer. The highest incidence of remote neuromuscular disorders in cancer has previously been reported in lung carcinoma. The clinical incidence of neuromuscular disorder was estimated and correlated with muscle histology and the histological type of lung tumour in 100 patients with lung carcinoma who were studied prospectively. Thirty-five patients had small cell carcinoma and 65 patients non-small cell lung cancer. Clinically, 33 patients had a polymyopathy, of whom 18 had a cachectic myopathy and 15 had a proximal myopathy (two patients had Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, one presented with dermatomyositis and one had evidence of ectopic ACTH production). Cachexia was more common in non-small cell cancer; proximal myopathy was more common in small cell cancer. Ninety-nine patients had abnormal muscle histology; 74 had type II atrophy, 12 had type I and II atrophy, one had type I atrophy and 12 had necrosis. The majority of patients were affected sub-clinically and the clinical entities of cachectic and proximal myopathy did not correspond to previous pathological classifications. Atrophy was not related to the duration of tumour symptoms, ageing, clinical type of myopathy or histological type of lung tumour, and was statistically different from that seen in controls. Qualitatively, the presence of weight loss, muscle wasting and metastatic disease were not factors in the development of atrophy. Similarly, necrosis was not related to the type of lung tumour, the presence of metastases, ageing, weight loss, muscle wasting, duration of tumour symptoms or the clinical form of myopathy. This study demonstrates that lung carcinoma has a direct effect on the motor unit, including atrophy, a necrobiotic myopathy and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Clinical assessment does not accurately assess the 'remote' neuromuscular effects of cancer on the motor unit. 
5	Reference values for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in octo- and nonagenarians The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used in a population survey of all inhabitants of Leiden, the Netherlands, over 85 years (n = 1258). In this paper we report on 532 subjects without neurological or psychiatric disease. Results show that the median score and lowest quartile cut-off score remain high until the tenth decade (median score = 28, lowest quartile cut-off score = 26). Thus age, in itself, is not a major limitation in using the MMSE. In this study a comparatively low level of education (the majority had 6 to 7 years of education) did not affect the results on the MMSE in a negative way, nor did we find an association with the use of psychoactive drugs. 
5	Active vs passive rhythms as an explanation of bigeminal rhythm with similar P waves. We describe the criteria for differential diagnosis between 3:2 sinoatrial block from atrial bigeminy due to an ectopic focus in the sinus or parasinus zone. In the 3:2 sinoatrial block the RR interval of the basic rhythm is similar to the short R-R interval of the paired rhythm. In atrial bigeminy, the R-R interval of the basic rhythm is similar to the long R-R interval of the paired rhythm. 
3	Coccidioidomycosis during human immunodeficiency virus infection. A review of 77 patients. Through a retrospective review, we identified 77 previously unreported cases of coccidioidomycosis during HIV infection. Patients were classified into 1 of 6 categories based on their primary clinical presentation: 20 had focal pulmonary disease (Group 1), 31 had diffuse pulmonary disease (Group 2), 4 had cutaneous coccidioidomycosis (Group 3), 9 had meningitis (Group 4), 7 had extrathoracic lymph node or liver involvement (Group 5), and 6 has positive coccidioidal serology without a clinical focus of infection (Group 6). Coccidioidal serologies were positive on initial testing in 83% of the patients in whom such serologic testing was performed. Sera from 39% of patients were positive for TP antibodies while 74% had CF antibodies. Eleven of 12 seronegative patients had pulmonary disease (Group 1 or 2). Serologic results of other patients sent to a single reference laboratory were similar, with 26% positive for immunodiffusion TP antibodies and 79% positive for immunodiffusion CF antibodies. For the 77 patients in this study, the CD4-lymphocyte count was below 0.250 X 10(9) cells/L in 46 of the 55 patients who had this test performed, and a low CD4 count was significantly associated with mortality (p less than 0.01). At the time of follow-up, 32 of the 77 patients (42%) had died. There were significantly more deaths in those with diffuse pulmonary disease (Group 2) than in other groups (p less than 0.001). Amphotericin B, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole were all used as antifungal therapies. Outcome could not be related to the therapy used. Of note, 3 patients developed coccidioidomycosis while receiving ketoconazole for other conditions. 
4	Flosequinan: a vasodilator with positive inotropic activity. Flosequinan is an oral arterial and venous vasodilator that is currently under investigation for the treatment of congestive heart failure. The effects of flosequinan on ventricular performance and myocardial contractility were studied in 10 patients with severe congestive heart failure during right and left cardiac catheterization. Sixty minutes after a 100 mg oral dose of flosequinan, the peak rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (dP/dt) increased from 940 +/- 180 to 1050 +/- 240 mm Hg/sec (p less than 0.05), while left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased from 32 +/- 5 to 26 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), and cardiac index increased (2.1 +/- 0.4 to 2.3 +/- 0.5 L/min/m2, (p less than 0.05). The mean pulmonary artery pressure and vascular resistance decreased from 40 +/- 8 to 33 +/- 12 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and from 330 +/- 240 to 290 +/- 170 dyne-sec/cm5 (p less than 0.05), respectively. Heart rate, mean aortic pressure, right atrial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and serum norepinephrine levels did not change significantly. The increase in left ventricular peak dP/dt that was concomitant with a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and no change in systemic arterial pressure or sympathetic tone, argue for a direct positive inotropic effect of flosequinan. 
3	Onset phase of spinal bupivacaine analgesia assessed quantitatively by laser stimulation. Analgesia was assessed quantitatively at various dermatomes (C7, T8, T10, T12, L1, L3, S1) for the first 30 min after subarachnoid administration of 0.5% bupivacaine 3.5 ml. Stimulation with 10 needles and laser stimulation could evoke pain in dermatomes with adequate analgesia to single needle stimulation. Analgesia was assessed by thresholds (sensory and pain) and by pain-related brain potentials (amplitude and latency) to laser stimulation. Little analgesia was found at T10, but it increased gradually towards caudal segments. The dermatome related to the site of the injection (L3) was not blocked to a greater extent than the surrounding dermatomes. Conduction time (the latency of the evoked brain potential) was increased relatively more from the S1 dermatome compared with L1. 
5	Interpleural analgesia after thoracotomy. We examined the effects of the following variables on interpleural analgesia after thoracotomy: addition of epinephrine to local anesthetic, thoracostomy drainage, two-catheter placement, and location of catheter tips. Twenty patients were randomized to have one catheter (paravertebral tip location) or two catheters (paravertebral and lateral thoracic wall tip locations). Interpleural catheters were sutured to the parietal pleura by the surgeon at time of wound closure. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine through the single catheter or 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with or without 1:200,000 epinephrine through each of the two catheters while supine. Bupivacaine concentrations in whole blood and in thoracostomy drainage fluid were assayed by gas chromatography. Actual content of bupivacaine in the drainage fluid was calculated. Degree of analgesia was assessed by verbal numerical pain scores over the first 4 h and opioid demand thereafter. Addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine did not influence the degree of analgesia. Approximately 30%-40% of any administered dose of bupivacaine was lost via the thoracostomy tube over a 4-h period. There was no correlation between the true initial dose (100 mg minus thoracostomy drainage) and Cmax. Use of two catheters resulted in significantly less opioid requirements after an initial 8-h period. Failure to achieve adequate interpleural analgesia in postthoracotomy patients may be related to loss of anesthetic via thoracostomy drainage, presence of extravasated blood and tissue fluid in the pleural space, and possibly sequestration and channeling of flow of local anesthetic by restricted motion of an operated lung. 
4	Endocarditis due to ampicillin-resistant nontyphoid Salmonella: cure with a third-generation cephalosporin. A case of ampicillin-resistant salmonella bacteremia complicated by endocarditis in a 78-year-old man is presented. Previous rheumatic valvular heart disease and the lack of response to initial treatment with chloramphenicol prompted us to consider this diagnosis. There was a good clinical response after treatment with ceftriaxone alone and corresponding improvement on the echocardiogram. This case demonstrates the possible endovascular complications of salmonella bacteremia in elderly people and that endocarditis should be included among the invasive infections due to ampicillin-resistant Salmonella that could potentially be treated with the newer cephalosporins. 
5	Hypertension after operative correction of club-foot deformity. Severe hypertension occurred as a postoperative complication after correction of a club-foot deformity in four children (seven feet) who were between the ages of two and three years and had no history of hypertension. The hypertension subsided slowly after administration of antihypertensive medications or more rapidly after release of the correction that had been obtained operatively. 
5	Acute leukemia and related entities. Impact of new technology. Twenty-seven cases of acute leukemia and related entities were evaluated by morphologic examination, cytochemical study, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase study, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic analysis, ultrastructural cytochemical study, and gene rearrangement analysis to determine the impact on the determination of the French-American-British (FAB) classification and the definitive diagnosis. The definitive diagnosis contained prognostic, diagnostic, and treatment information beyond the FAB classification that affected the disease course and patient management. All diagnostic variables were evaluated in each case and were labeled essential, ambivalent, supportive, or noncontributory. Except for gene rearrangement analysis, all variables we studied contributed essential data to establish the definitive diagnosis. Ambivalent findings were rare but could be explained with the knowledge of the total data. All variables, except cytochemical study, whose results were almost always essential, contributed supportive data. Noncontributory data only occurred with cytogenetic analysis in cases that demonstrated normal karyotypes. The FAB classification was established in 20 (74%) of the cases by use of morphologic examination, cytochemical study, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase study. With use of the same variables, however, the definitive diagnosis, whose determination required all data, was established in only 15 (55.5%) of the cases. The addition of immunophenotyping increased the definitive diagnosis to 25 (92.5%) of the cases. The use of ultrastructural myeloperoxidase and platelet peroxidase analysis enabled us to definitively diagnose the remaining two cases (27 cases [100%]). Cytogenetic analysis revealed four cases in which essential information was added to the diagnosis. However, because the cytogenetic information usually was not immediately available, the result did not affect the immediate diagnosis or treatment. Surprisingly, the gene rearrangement studies did not yield essential data in any case and in a few cases contributed ambivalent data. This finding should not exclude gene rearrangement analysis in selected cases; however, the data should always be interpreted in light of all clinical and laboratory findings. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of a multifaceted approach to the understanding of the acute leukemias and related entities and shows the impact of newer technologies on reaching a definitive diagnosis. 
1	Sphincter preservation in rectal cancer by local excision and postoperative radiation therapy. The authors report the preliminary results of 14 patients with localized, mobile, resectable rectal cancer treated with local excision and postoperative radiation therapy (RT). All had negative surgical resection margins and two received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The median follow-up was 29 months (4-43 months). The 3-year actuarial survival was 88%. The incidence of local failure was 7% (only site of failure) and 21% (component of failure). The incidence of local failure increased with T stage (T1, 0/3 [0%]; T2, 1/7 [14%]; and T3, 2/4 [50%]) and tumor size (greater than 3 cm, 33%, versus less than or equal to 3 cm, 0%). Three patients developed local failure at 6, 15, and 21 months. Three underwent a salvage abdominoperineal resection and were locally controlled at 2 and 28 months following salvage surgery. One patient underwent an abdominoperineal resection for a clinically presumed local failure; however, no tumor was found in the specimen. Therefore, the 13 patients who either were initially locally controlled or underwent salvage or nonsalvage surgery had no evidence of disease in the pelvis at the time of last follow-up. Local excision and postoperative RT may be an alternative to standard surgery in selected cases. However, additional follow-up and more experience are needed in order to determine if this approach will ultimately have local control and survival rates similar to those of a low anterior resection or an abdominoperineal resection. 
1	Status of sex steroid hormone receptors in large bowel cancer. To determine the potential role of sex steroid hormones in the development of colorectal tumors in humans, specific androgen (AR), estrogen (ER), and progesterone (PGR) receptors were investigated in normal mucosa (NM) and in tumor (T) paired biopsy specimens from 94 patients. Androgen receptors were detected in 98% and 96% of NM and T samples, ER in 91% and 83% of NM and T biopsy samples, whereas PGR were detected only in 14% and 10% of NM and T specimens, respectively. These incidences are independent of the sex and age of the patients. They are not related to tumor localization, histologic grade, or stages of Dukes' classification. Scatchard analysis of labeled ligand binding indicated the existence of one single class of high affinity binding sites; the calculated dissociation constant (Kd) was 1.7 +/- 0.6 10(-9) molar concentration (M) for 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and 0.6 +/- 0.3 10(-9) M for estradiol (E2). These values were identical in NM and T tissue for both AR and ER. The binding capacity for DHT was 148 +/- 67 and 93 +/- 43 fmol/mg of cytosol protein in NM and T tissues, respectively (P less than 0.05). The ER content was lower and similar in NM and T biopsy specimens: 19 +/- 9 and 18 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The PGR content was 10 +/- 4 in NM versus 17.5 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein in T specimens. It is observed that the elevated AR in normal mucosa is not related to any known function for androgens in the digestive tract. The receptor pattern observed in tumors does not support the hypothesis previously raised in the case of chemically induced colonic tumors in rodents. 
1	The efficacy of comprehensive neck dissection with or without postoperative radiotherapy in nodal metastases of squamous cell carcinoma of the upper respiratory and digestive tracts. Neck recurrence-free curves corrected for local recurrence were compared for 494 patients who underwent 565 comprehensive neck dissections. In 42 dissections, no radicality could be obtained. Of the 523 histologically radical dissections, examination revealed tumor in 352 cases. Patients in whom three or more positive nodes or extranodal spread in one or more nodes were found received postoperative radiotherapy. In the histologically N0 group, the incidence of neck recurrence after 5 years was 3%; in the N+ group as a whole, it was 10%. Analysis of the influence of extranodal spread and the number of positive nodes showed that the group with one or two positive nodes without extranodal spread (that did not receive postoperative radiotherapy) did not statistically differ from the other groups. This suggests that the results of the group with one or two positive nodes without extranodal spread can be improved by postoperative radiotherapy. 
5	A randomized, controlled trial of prophylactic ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus pulmonary infection in recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants; The City of Hope-Stanford-Syntex CMV Study Group BACKGROUND. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated interstitial pneumonia is a major cause of death after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We conducted a controlled trial of ganciclovir in recipients of bone marrow transplants who had asymptomatic pulmonary CMV infection. We also sought to identify risk factors for the development of CMV interstitial pneumonia. METHODS. After bone marrow transplantation, 104 patients who had no evidence of respiratory disease underwent routine bronchoalveolar lavage on day 35. The 40 patients who had positive cultures for CMV were randomly assigned to either prophylactic ganciclovir or observation alone. Ganciclovir (5 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) was given twice daily for two weeks and then five times per week until day 120. RESULTS. Of the 20 culture-positive patients who received prophylactic ganciclovir, 5 (25 percent) died or had CMV pneumonia before day 120, as compared with 14 of the 20 culture-positive control patients (70 percent) who were not treated prophylactically (relative risk, 0.36; P = 0.01). No patient who received the full course of ganciclovir prophylaxis went on to have CMV interstitial pneumonia. Four patients treated with ganciclovir had maximal serum creatinine levels greater than or equal to 221 mumol per liter (2.5 mg per deciliter), as compared with none of the controls (P = 0.029). Of the 55 CMV-negative patients who could be evaluated, 12 (22 percent) had CMV pneumonia--a significantly lower rate than in the untreated CMV-positive control patients (relative risk, 0.33; P = 0.003). The strongest predictors of CMV pneumonia were a lavage-fluid culture that was positive for CMV and a CMV-positive blood culture, both from specimens obtained on day 35. CONCLUSION. In recipients of allogeneic bone marrow, asymptomatic CMV infection of the lung is a major risk factor for subsequent CMV interstitial pneumonia. Prophylactic ganciclovir is effective in preventing the development of CMV interstitial pneumonia in patients with asymptomatic infection. 
1	The prognostic value of modal deoxyribonucleic acid in low grade, low stage untreated prostate cancer. We selected for a prospective surveillance study 167 patients with untreated grades 1 and 2 prostate cancer. The tumors were classified regarding modal deoxyribonucleic acid value (ploidy) by flow cytometry, cytological grade by transrectal fine needle aspiration biopsy and local tumor stage. Of the patients 146 could be evaluated. Mean followup was 50 months. The initial ploidy was statistically correlated to cytological grade but not to initial local tumor stage, prostatic acid phosphatase activity or patient age. Initial ploidy and cytological grade had a prognostic value regarding local tumor progression when considered as single predictors and in combination. Two patients with diploid and 8 with nondiploid tumors initially had metastases during the surveillance. Five patients (1 with diploid and 4 with nondiploid disease) died of prostatic cancer. Modal deoxyribonucleic acid value and cytological grade were of prognostic value in untreated prostate cancer. 
5	Skin responses to intradermal histamine and leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and in normal subjects. Mast cell inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, and newly formed compounds, such as the leukotrienes, cause wheal and flare when they are injected intradermally into normal subjects and may therefore play a role in the formation of urticaria. The effects of intradermal injections (50 microliters) of six different concentrations of histamine (range, 3.3 x 10(-4) to 3.3 x 10(-9) mol/L) and the leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 (range, 2 x 10(-4) to 2 x 10(-9) mol/L) have been compared in 10 normal subjects and in 10 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Wheal-and-flare sizes were measured at timed intervals up to 4 hours, and area under the curve for each response over time was calculated. There were no significant differences in leukotriene-induced responses between groups. Maximum sizes of histamine-induced wheal and flare were similar in each group of subjects. There were, however, significant increases in mean areas under the response curve of histamine wheal and flare in the patients with urticaria (wheal, p less than 0.001; flare, p less than 0.001; analysis of variance). These findings demonstrate a prolongation of skin responses to histamine in patients with urticaria and suggest an impaired clearance of histamine (or other vasoactive agents released by histamine) from the skin of these patients. 
1	Two distinct loci on the short arm of chromosome 16 are involved in myeloid leukemia. We report a case of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) M5 with the characteristic t(8;16)(p11;p13). The breakpoint in the short arm was regionally localized using nonradioactive in situ hybridization with a series of cosmids of chromosome 16. The results show that a difference exists between the breakpoint in chromosome 16(p13) in this t(8;16) and the breakpoint involved in the short arm in the characteristic inversion 16 (p13;q22)) that occurs in ANLL M4eo. Two different loci appear to be involved in these chromosomal rearrangements. 
1	Oral squamous cell carcinoma arising in a patient with long-standing lichen planus. A case report. The risk of malignant transformation of oral lichen planus remains a controversial point. Many previous reports have been discounted on the basis of inadequate information or lack of histologic confirmation of lichen planus. We report a well-documented case of long-standing cutaneous and oral lichen planus in which squamous cell carcinoma of the dorsal portion of the tongue occurred. There is an apparent difference in the sites of oral carcinomas in patients with lichen planus compared with the general population. This suggests that lichen planus increases the risk of oral cancer in affected sites. 
1	The pattern of intrathoracic Hodgkin's disease assessed by computed tomography. Computed tomography (CT) was used to define the sites of intrathoracic abnormality in Hodgkin's disease, determine a pattern of progression of disease in the thorax, and establish the place of this pattern of spread in the differential diagnosis of thoracic abnormalities. One hundred eight patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease were studied by chest CT. Seventy-seven patients had intrathoracic abnormalities. The pattern seen was one of contiguous spread from the anterior mediastinal/paratracheal area to the other mediastinal lymph node groups (aortopulmonary, subcarinal, posterior mediastinal, and internal mammary), to the hila, and then into the lung by extension or as discrete nodules. Involvement of the pleura, pericardium, or chest wall occurred only after the anterior mediastinal/paratracheal mass had enlarged to greater than 30% of the thoracic diameter. The probability that this pattern of contiguous lymph node spread occurred by chance alone was very small. Hodgkin's disease spreads from the anterior mediastinal/paratracheal area in a contiguous manner. Exceptions are unusual enough that when they occur, diagnoses other than Hodgkin's disease are more likely. 
4	Time course of hemodynamic responses to sodium in elderly hypertensive patients. Thirty-one patients with essential hypertension (81.6 +/- 6.9 years old) were studied during two different regimens of sodium intake: 120 meq/day for 8 weeks and 344 meq/day for 2 weeks. Systemic hemodynamic data were measured with Doppler echocardiography from which the mitral flow velocity integral, cardiac index, and total peripheral resistance were calculated. The salt-sensitive patients in whom the increase in total peripheral resistance was greater than the increase in cardiac index with salt loading were termed SST. In the salt-sensitive patients termed SSC, the increase in cardiac index was greater than the increase in total peripheral resistance with increased sodium intake. All SST patients on day 7 of the high sodium diet remained in the SST group on day 14. Nine of 13 patients in the SSC group on day 7 remained in the SSC group on day 14, and the remaining four patients in the SSC group on day 7 fell into the SST group on day 14. Four of eight non-salt-sensitive (NSS) patients on day 7 of the high salt regimen remained in the NSS group on day 14, whereas the remaining four patients in the NSS group on day 7 fell into the SSC group on day 14. Our data suggest a changing pattern with sodium loading of initially high cardiac index followed by a persistently raised total peripheral resistance. The celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries vasoconstricted with sodium repletion in both SST and SSC patients. With salt loading, the terminal aortic vascular bed vasodilated in the SSC patients and vasoconstricted in the SST patients. 
4	A simple method to improve the accuracy of non-invasive ultrasound in selecting TIA patients for cerebral angiography. A prospective study is reported of the ability of B mode ultrasound imaging and continuous wave Doppler flow studies to detect different degrees of stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) in 186 arteries in 99 patients with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) and minor ischaemic stroke. A simple mathematical equation has been developed which combines the image and flow data to provide a single predictor of the degree of angiographic stenosis which has advantages over either ultrasonic modality used alone. The sensitivity and specificity of the predictive model in the detection of stenosis greater than or equal to 25% was 73% and 98%, of stenosis greater than or equal to 50% was 90% and 93%, of stenosis greater than or equal to 75%, 65% and 99% and occlusion 100% and 94% respectively. The principal clinical value of ultrasound screening is to spare patients with "non-significant" stenosis the risk of unnecessary angiography. Thus a simple measure of the Duplex screening tests' performance is the proportion of all strokes occurring as a complication of angiography that are avoided by changing the investigation policy from "angiograms for all carotid TIA and minor ischaemic stroke patients" to "angiograms for all patients with abnormal ultrasound results". If Duplex scanning were used to select patients most likely to have a significant abnormality on angiography, depending on the degree of stenosis to be detected, 52-85% of angiographic strokes might be avoided. If the predictive equation were used 62-88% of angiographic strokes might be avoided. 
4	Splenorenal arterial shunt in the treatment of renovascular hypertension. Approach by a lumbar-retroperitoneal incision. In a period of 16 years, 29 consecutive patients were operated on for a splenorenal arterial shunt through a lumbotomy incision and a retroperitoneal approach. There were 18 males and 11 females with a medium age of 42 years. All cases had uncontrollable and severe hypertension for an average medium time of 48 months, 11 patients had variable degrees of renal insufficiency. The diagnosis was made utilizing standard methods including in all cases angiography of the abdominal aorta, celiac axis and renal arteries. One patient died after the operation due to intestinal infarction, the remaining have been followed for a medium time of 50 months. All patients improved or cured their renal insufficiency. The hypertension was cured in 23, improved in 4 and failed in 1, this latter patient was successfully autotransplanted. A precise exposition of the surgical technique is presented with comments about their advantages and indications. A review of the literature in surgical experience with the technique of splenorenal arterial anastomosis has been done. 
1	Perioperative blood transfusion adversely affects prognosis of patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. It has been speculated that blood transfusion might adversely affect prognosis in cancer patients by immunosuppression. To avoid the confounding affect of advanced disease, we tested this hypothesis in 117 patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. Mean and median follow-up were 49.7 months and 47 months, respectively. Patients who died during the postoperative period were not included. Perioperative transfusion was defined as administration of whole blood or packed cells within 30 days of operation. The overall cumulative 5-year disease-free survival rate was 67%. In patients with transfusion, it was 53% and in patients without transfusion it was 81% (p = 0.0055). A multivariate analysis was performed that included patient age, race, sex, cell type, extent of operation (pneumonectomy versus lobectomy/segmentectomy), operative blood loss, admission hematocrit, discharge hematocrit, and the presence or absence of perioperative transfusion. The only variable that significantly correlated with 5-year disease-free survival was the presence or absence of perioperative transfusion (p = 0.0278), and this effect was not related to the number of transfusions. Retrospective analysis of long-term results of patients surviving curative operation for stage I lung cancer shows that any perioperative transfusion significantly worsens the patient's prognosis and suggests very strongly that this association is due to an adverse effect of the transfusion rather than the transfusion serving as a marker for another risk factor. 
3	Clinical features and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical features and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). DATA SOURCE AND SELECTION: All articles on OSA published in French and English between 1970 and 1990 and indexed in Index Medicus were reviewed. Studies addressing the epidemiologic features and clinical aspects of OSA were selected, and special emphasis was given to articles reporting the effects of treatment on morbidity and mortality rates. MAIN RESULTS: OSA is characterized by episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep that result in repetitive hypoxemia and sleep disruption. OSA leads to various neuropsychologic and cardiovascular complications, including daytime hypersomnolence, cognitive impairment, systemic and pulmonary hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. There is suggestive evidence that the death rate among affected people is increased. The true incidence of OSA is unknown, but estimates have varied from 1% upwards among men. The current treatment with the greatest overall effectiveness and acceptability is nasal continuous positive airway pressure. CONCLUSION: This common, readily treatable disorder is associated with serious complications and therefore must be widely recognized by health professionals. 
4	Impact of orifice geometry on the shape of jets: an in vitro Doppler color flow study. To investigate the influence of orifice geometry on the three-dimensional shape of jets, an in vitro Doppler color flow study was performed. Jets were formed by discharging blood through round orifices and through orifices with major/minor axis ratios of 2:1, 3:1 and 5:1. These were repeated with orifice areas of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 cm2. For turbulent and laminar jets formed by these orifices, Doppler color flow images were obtained from two orthogonal scanning planes aligned with the major and minor orifice axes. Jet width was measured at 1 cm intervals from 0 to 5 cm from the orifice and used to calculate jet eccentricity (ratio of major to minor axis widths) and the rate of divergence of the jet walls. Jets were observed to diverge more rapidly along walls aligned with the orifice minor axis rather than along the major axis. This differential spreading led to the development of circular symmetry at a short distance from the orifice. Jet divergence (theta) occurred more rapidly for turbulent jets and for jets formed by larger orifices: theta (zero) = 0.80 + 6.3.A + 7.0.T + 0.47.E-OR (r = 95, p less than 0.0001, n = 48), where A is orifice area (cm2); T is 0 for laminar jets, 1 for turbulent jets and E-OR combines orifice eccentricity and scanning orientation, ranging from -5 for 5:1 orifices imaged along the major axis, 0 for circular orifices to 5 for 5:1 orifices imaged along the minor axis. Within the jet, eccentricity decayed approximately exponentially with distance from the orifice, more rapidly for turbulent jets, more slowly for the larger and more eccentric orifices. 
4	Usefulness of labetalol in chronic atrial fibrillation. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are useful in controlling excessive ventricular rate in chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) but often reduce exercise capacity. To investigate the advantage of labetalol--a unique beta blocker with alpha-blocking property--in chronic AF, 10 patients without underlying structural heart disease were studied with treadmill test, 12-minute walk and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Patients were randomized and crossed over to receive 4 phases of treatment (placebo, digoxin, digoxin with half-dose labetalol, and full-dose labetalol). Exercise durations were 14.1 +/- 1.5, 14.2 +/- 1.5, 16.1 +/- 1.1 and 15.6 +/- 1.1 minutes, respectively, indicating that labetalol did not reduce exercise tolerance. Although digoxin had no advantage over placebo in controlling maximal heart rate (177 +/- 2 vs 175 +/- 3 beats/min), labetalol, both as monotherapy or as an adjunct to digoxin, was advantageous (156 +/- 4 vs 177 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.01, and 154 +/- 4 vs 177 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.01, respectively). The rate-pressure product was consistently lowered by labetalol at rest and during exercise. At peak exercise, the addition of labetalol to digoxin reduced the maximal rate-pressure product achieved from 30,900 +/- 1300 to 24,100 +/- 2,000 mm Hg/min (p less than 0.01) and the maximal rate-pressure product was lowest with full-dose labetalol (22,300 +/- 1,600 mm Hg/min). During submaximal exercise on treadmill or during the 12-minute walk, the combination of labetalol and digoxin produced the best heart rate control, whereas labetalol monotherapy was comparable to digoxin therapy. 
2	Abnormal liver enzyme levels. Evaluation in asymptomatic patients. Chronic elevation of serum aminotransferase levels, even in the absence of symptoms, often reflects chronic hepatitis or other significant underlying liver disease. Patients with persistently abnormal alkaline phosphatase levels may have extrahepatic biliary tract disease or a chronic cholestatic disorder. Physicians can discover unsuspected liver disease without undue risk, expense, or inconvenience to the patient by means of the following: a carefully taken history and thorough physical examination, appropriate timing of follow-up blood tests, and timely referral for percutaneous liver biopsy or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. 
4	Effect of coronary hyperemia on Emax and oxygen consumption in blood-perfused rabbit hearts. Energetic consequences of Gregg's phenomenon. To assess the relation between increases in contractile function and oxygen consumption (VO2) during increased coronary flow (Gregg's phenomenon), we measured the end-systolic pressure-volume relation and the relation between VO2 and left ventricular systolic pressure-volume area (PVA, a measure of total mechanical energy output) in blood-perfused, isovolumically contracting rabbit hearts during control and intracoronary adenosine infusion. During adenosine infusion at a constant perfusion pressure (93 +/- 11 mm Hg), coronary flow increased by 99 +/- 76% (p less than 0.01), and the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, Emax (ventricular contractility index), increased by 18 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01). When compared at the same left ventricular volume, PVA increased by 20 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01) and VO2 by 19 +/- 15% (p less than 0.01) with adenosine. The VO2-PVA relation was linear under each condition (both median r = 0.98). With increased coronary flow, the VO2-intercept of the VO2-PVA relation (unloaded VO2) increased by 22 +/- 18% (p less than 0.01) without a change in the slope; that is, a parallel upward shift was observed, indicating that the contractile efficiency (energy conversion efficiency of the contractile machinery) remained constant. These increases in Emax and unloaded VO2 were not eliminated by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. We conclude that increased coronary flow with adenosine at a constant perfusion pressure augments both Emax and the nonmechanical energetic cost for excitation-contraction coupling and basal metabolism via nonadrenergic mechanisms, without changing contractile efficiency. 
3	Causes and consequences of blood pressure alterations in obstructive sleep apnea. The obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome has been considered to be a cause of both transient blood pressure elevations during sleep and sustained hypertension during the awake state. The purpose of this review was to examine critically the existing literature regarding (1) the blood pressure alterations associated with OSA, (2) causal mechanisms relating specific blood pressure alterations to OSA, and (3) potential consequences of the systemic circulatory abnormalities associated with OSA. Particular attention was directed at studies that assessed the prevalence of OSA in patients with hypertension and that examined the effects on blood pressure of treatment of OSA. We conclude that patients with OSA have abnormal sleep blood pressure patterns, manifested most frequently by apnea-associated blood pressure elevations. Confounding factors such as obesity and antihypertensive drug therapy, and conflicting evidence regarding changes in daytime blood pressure after therapy for OSA, make it premature to conclude that OSA and daytime hypertension are directly associated. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the blood pressure alterations that occur during sleep could contribute to the high cardiovascular morbidity in patients with OSA. Further research into the relationship between OSA and hypertension should improve the future care of patients with these conditions and enhance our understanding of cardiopulmonary pathophysiology. 
4	Severe hypotension due to intramyometrial injection of prostaglandin E2 Treatment of postpartum haemorrhage because of uterine atony with intramyometrial prostaglandin E2 1 mg, in an anaesthetised patient resulted in life-threatening hypotension. Anaesthetists should be aware of the potential cardiovascular side effects of prostaglandins. 
1	Constitutional symptoms in patients with germ cell neoplasms. A patient with a mediastinal germ cell neoplasm evidenced fever, weight loss, pruritus, and painful adenopathy on ingestion of alcohol. Retrospective review revealed that 9 percent of 104 patients with advanced germ cell neoplasm evidence constitutional symptoms at presentation. 
3	Impaired awareness of behavioral limitations after traumatic brain injury. Sixty-four traumatically brain injured patients were divided into three groups. Patients in Group I overestimated their behavioral competencies. Patients in Group II showed behavioral ratings similar to relatives' reports concerning behavioral competencies. Patients in Group III underestimated their behavioral competencies. Group I patients had greater evidence of bilateral and multiple-site lesions than group II and III patients. Speed of left-hand finger tapping was also worse in Group I than groups II and III, but other standard neuropsychologic test findings failed to separate the groups. Specific brain lesion sites were not related to group membership. Impaired awareness of behavioral limitations after traumatic brain injury may be related to neuropsychologic changes not measured by standard tests. Bilateral impairment of heteromodal cortex may be important to this phenomenon when it exists several months or years postinjury. 
1	A case of dyschondroplasia associated with brain stem glioma: diagnosis by stereotactic biopsy. We present a 24-year-old patient with multiple chondromas of both hands, the pelvis, the left leg, and an associated brain stem glioma. There was no evidence of hemangioma or dyschromia, and the condition was diagnosed as Ollier's disease, a special type of dyschondroplasia like Maffucci's syndrome and Kast's disease. An increased overall risk for development of malignant skeletal and nonskeletal tumors is associated with Maffucci's syndrome. The risk of malignant degeneration is lower in Ollier's disease. A glioma in the pons and the right lobe of the cerebellum was found in this patient. The literature describes an association with gliomas in only 12 cases of dyschondroplasia and an infratentorial localization in just one case. Signs of malignancy were histologically confirmed in 7 cases without significant preponderance of any one type. Our patient had a low-grade brain stem astrocytoma with fibrillar and gemistocytic components. A stereotactic serial biopsy made it possible to rule out malignant degeneration. Stereotactic brain tumor biopsy as a routine neurosurgical procedure is particularly valuable for deep space-occupying processes and forms the basis for therapy. In the present case, irradiation was not recommended. 
2	Factors influencing the development of metabolic bone disease in primary biliary cirrhosis. The prevalence, type, and factors that may influence the development of bone disease in primary biliary cirrhosis, have been investigated in 20 consecutive patients, who, in addition to liver function tests and mineral and vitamin D metabolism studies, were submitted to a transiliac bone biopsy after tetracycline double-labeling for quantitative histomorphometric examination. Intestinal calcium absorption was also assessed in 16 patients. Seven patients (35%) had reduced bone volume and were considered osteoporotic. Three also had bone mineralization impairment, but did not have criteria for osteomalacia. Bone formation was depressed in 15 patients, and bone resorption was low or normal in 19 cases. Eroded surfaces were reduced in all osteoporotic patients. Duration of primary biliary cirrhosis was significantly longer in patients with osteoporosis (6.3 +/- 0.6 yr) than in those without osteoporosis (2.6 +/- 0.6, p = 0.004). Moreover, osteoporosis was more prevalent in postmenopausal women, and in those who had intestinal calcium malabsorption, which was present in 80% of osteoporotic patients but in only 18% of nonosteoporotic patients (p = 0.03). Osteoporosis and mineralization bone impairment were unrelated to the severity of cholestasis. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D was significantly lower in those patients with intestinal calcium malabsorption. The results of this study indicate that osteodystrophy in primary biliary cirrhosis is characterized mainly by "low-turnover" osteoporosis, which is related to the duration of the liver disease, postmenopausal condition, and calcium malabsorption. 
3	Vasoactive peptide release in the extracerebral circulation of humans during migraine headache. The innervation of the cranial vessels by the trigeminal nerve, the trigeminovascular system, has recently been the subject of study in view of its possible role in the mediation of some aspects of migraine. Since stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion in humans leads to facial pain and flushing and associated release of powerful neuropeptide vasodilator substances, their local release into the extracerebral circulation of humans was determined in patients who had either common or classic migraine. Venous blood was sampled from both the external jugular and cubital fossa ipsilateral to the side of headache. Plasma levels of neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide were determined using sensitive radioimmunoassays for each peptide, and values for the cubital fossa and external jugular and a control population were compared. A substantial elevation of the calcitonin gene-related peptide level in the external jugular but not the cubital fossa blood was seen in both classic and common migraine. The increase seen in classic migraine was greater than that seen with common migraine. The other peptides measured were unaltered. This finding may have importance in the pathophysiology of migraine. 
1	Invasive migration of epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma cells in vitro. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a low grade malignant neoplasm which shows invasive growth and often occurs in immunosuppressed patients with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS; epidemic KS). It is also found in elderly men where it is usually limited to the skin (classic KS). The present study investigated the chemotaxis and invasive migration of epidemic KS cells in vitro and compared them to cells grown from classic KS lesions and to fibroblasts. Epidemic KS cells demonstrated invasive migration through reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) as well as through interstitial connective tissue (collagen I) in early passages, whereas fibroblasts did not invade either barrier. Epidemic KS cells in late passages did not show any invasive migration. Following pretreatment with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) there was no enhanced migration through the Matrigel and collagen I for epidemic KS cells, whereas classic KS cells showed an increased migration through the type I collagen barrier. 
3	Steroid anabolic drugs and arterial complications in an athlete--a case history. Serious side effects and complications have been attributed to anabolic and androgenic steroids when used for medical reasons or when taken in sports in hopes of increasing strength and, hence, performance. The author presents a case of an athlete who experienced two metachronous arterial complications after taking these drugs: a cerebrovascular accident caused by a carotid artery thrombus that partially embolized to the brain and, later, a severe ischemic episode in a lower limb caused by a diffused distal arterial thrombosis. This patient represents the first reported case of vascular events in an otherwise healthy athlete taking androgens to increase his skeletal muscle mass. 
5	Angioplasty of coronary bifurcation stenoses: immediate and long-term results of the protecting branch technique. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) of coronary stenoses involving major bifurcations carries a small but significant risk of side branch occlusion which can be avoided by simultaneously using multiple dilatation systems. Among 1,275 PTCA procedures performed between 1984 and 1988 in 1,035 consecutive patients, 42 double wire procedures were applied (4%) to protect and/or dilate major coronary side branches. A total of 80 coronary stenoses were attempted of which 76 were located on a bifurcation and 4 on other segments. In the first 11 patients (group A), 2 guiding catheters were used and PTCA of each vessel was successfully performed by means of separate double lumen over-the-wire balloon catheters. In the next 31 patients (group B), 2 guidewires were advanced through a single guiding catheter and PTCA was attempted using "Monorail" balloon catheters sequentially advanced over the wires. In group B, a successful PTCA was obtained in 29 patients (93%) but twisting of the wires hampered balloon progression in 5 cases, such that dilatation could only be performed by stepping back to a single wire technique. The procedure time in group B was significantly shorter than in group A: 144 +/- 30 versus 230 +/- 52 minutes (p = .01). Repeat angiography was performed in 35 out of 40 patients (87%) after a mean of 180 +/- 46 days following successful PTCA. Angiographic restenosis was present in 37% (24/65) of bifurcation segments which, in our experience, is not significantly different from the angiographic restenosis rate in less complex lesions (248/740; 34%; NS). 
1	Pancreatic involvement in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Involvement of the pancreas by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has not been adequately addressed and is the object of this review. I analyzed the English language literature, including single case reports of pancreatic involvement and larger series reporting detailed pathological findings of patients with HIV infection. Nonspecific pathological changes in the pancreas are frequently seen at autopsy of HIV-infected patients, but are not more common than in controls. Several types of infections (mainly cytomegalovirus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Mycobacteria) and neoplasms (lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma) can involve the pancreas because they are usually disseminated. Although the serum amylase may be elevated, the patient remains asymptomatic. Occasional instances of severe and even fatal pancreatitis have been reported with HIV infections and attendant drug toxicity. Pentamidine has a predictable incidence of hypoglycemic episodes and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine provokes pancreatitis in a minority of treated patients. Such drug toxicity seems to deserve greater clinical concern than opportunistic infections or neoplasms. 
1	Oral or intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunoprophylaxis in bladder carcinoma. A total of 71 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor. All patients had stage pTa or pT1 transitional cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ without other concurrent malignancies. The patients were assigned to 3 treatment groups: control group--transurethral resection discontinued within the study, oral bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) group--transurethral resection of bladder tumor plus BCG (Moreau) and intravesical BCG group--transurethral resection of bladder tumor plus BCG. Of 9 patients in the control group 8 (89%) experienced tumor recurrence during a mean followup of 20 months. Of the 28 patients in the oral BCG group 11 (39.3%) had recurrence during a mean followup of 36 months. Of the 34 patients in the intravesical group 6 (18%) had recurrence in a 24-month mean followup. The incidence of complications was higher in the intravesical (41.2%) than in the oral BCG group (28.5%). These results show that intravesical BCG is a more effective immunotherapy; however, oral BCG can be used in patients who do not accept intravesical BCG administration. 
5	The effect of established and gestational diabetes on pregnancy outcome. OBJECTIVE--To study the prevalence and type of glucose intolerance in pregnancy and the effect of different types on perinatal mortality and fetal size. DESIGN--A prospective case-control study with data collected by patient interview and examination of all available records during a 16-months period between 1984 and 1986. SETTING--A large maternity hospital in Kuwait where diabetes in pregnancy is common. SUBJECTS--The cases were a consecutive sample of 731 women, delivered during the study period, recorded in the labour ward register as being diabetic or having abnormal glucose tolerance, the control group was formed from the next woman in the register (provided she was not known to be diabetic). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Type of diabetes followed the WHO classification, with subdivision depending on level of fasting plasma glucose. Type of perinatal death was examined in detail and birthweight centile calculated. RESULTS--Of the 731 cases, 22% were established diabetics, most were treated with oral hypoglycaemic drugs before pregnancy and insulin during pregnancy. Of those discovered during pregnancy, 43% were classified as gestational diabetes and the remainder as impaired glucose tolerance. Overall, 50% of cases were treated with insulin. Established diabetics had a perinatal mortality rate nearly four times greater than non diabetics (RR, 3.7, 95% CI 2.6 to 6.4) and for gestational diabetics RR was 2.0 95% CI 1.2 to 3.7). Unexplained deaths were particularly common, both in established diabetics (RR, 18.4, 95% CI 3.9 to 85.7) and in gestational diabetics (RR, 13.4, 95% (CI 2.9 to 61.6). Cases with impaired glucose tolerance had no stillbirths and had a lower perinatal loss than the controls, though this was not statistically significant. Heavier babies were seen in all case groups compared with controls, though the impaired glucose tolerance group had lower birthweights than the other two case groups. CONCLUSIONS--Type 2 diabetes was found to be common, most cases being diagnosed in pregnancy. Under the conditions found in Kuwait, diabetes, in the sense of a raised fasting glucose, is accompanied by a high rate of perinatal loss from unexplained stillbirth. This applies whether the condition was present before pregnancy or was discovered during pregnancy. Fetal macrosomia was also common in both situations. Impaired glucose tolerance, where fasting levels remain normal, does not appear to increase fetal loss, but may be associated with fetal macrosomia. As these women age they are likely to develop overt diabetes in the non-pregnant state, and subsequently to develop serious complications of this disease. Improving glycaemic control, both during preg. 
5	Therapy of diseased stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with nimodipine. We investigated the therapeutic effect of nimodipine or parathyroidectomy in old, diseased stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats by observing 98 male 1-year-old rats over 5 months. After stroke had occurred, the rats were divided into three groups: 1) parathyroidectomy, 2) nimodipine, and 3) controls. In the nimodipine group, the rats survived longer than those in the other groups. Blood pressure of the controls did not differ from the nimodipine-treated and parathyroidectomy animals. The increase in calcium content of brain and kidney tissues and of plasma renin activity, urea, and creatinine was attenuated by nimodipine or parathyroidectomy. The histology of the kidneys revealed widespread fibrinoid necrosis of arteries in all rats. In the nimodipine-treated or parathyroidectomy groups, healing of the lesions was detectable. Cerebral lesions were mainly characterized by fibrinoid necrosis. Nimodipine-treated as well as parathyroidectomied animals showed significantly fewer hypertensive cerebral lesions. In old, diseased stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, therapy with nimodipine or parathyroidectomy increased their survival rate. The cerebrovascular and renovascular lesions of treated animals were attenuated, and morphologic signs of healing were observed. Reduction of calcium overload by nimodipine or parathyroidectomy, even in an advanced stage of disease, had a therapeutic effect. 
5	Esophageal malignancies: is preoperative radiotherapy the way to go? During the period 1969 to 1988, 68 patients with esophageal malignancy were subjected to preoperative radiotherapy consisting of 30 Gy over 3 weeks followed by esophagectomy after a wait of 2 weeks. Sixty-two of 68 patients (91%) were followed up retrospectively (5-year survival rate, 17.2%; 10-year survival rate, 4.8%). Radiosensitivity of the tumor was graded by a radiation effect scoring method devised by us, and this was found to correlate with long-term prognosis (p = 0.05). Radiotherapy "sterilized" malignant involvement of adventitia and draining lymph nodes in 8 patients and thereby converted "palliative" into potentially "curative" resections with a mean survival of 57.2 months in this group of patients. Preoperative radiotherapy was found to increase the survival, decrease the incidence of residual tumor at the resected stump, reduce the incidence of local recurrence, and increase the resectability rate. 
5	Changes in interferon receptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic hepatitis B being treated with interferon. We studied the binding of 125I-labeled human interferon-alpha to peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the activity of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 21 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were treated with human interferon-alpha or interferon-beta. Fourteen patients were given interferon daily for 4 wk. Interferon receptors per cell decreased to about 50% of baseline but increased to baseline by 2 wk after therapy ended. The activity of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase rose about fivefold during therapy, decreasing to baseline by 1 wk after the end of therapy. The seven other patients were given interferon daily for 2 wk, no interferon for 2 wk and then interferon daily for 2 wk more. During both periods of therapy on this schedule, interferon receptors decreased to about 50% but returned to baseline 1 wk after the interferon was stopped. The activity of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase increased about fivefold during both the first and second periods of therapy and decreased to baseline 1 wk after interferon was stopped. Close negative correlation existed between the number of interferon receptors and the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity. The results of interferon therapy could not be predicted by either the numbers of interferon receptors before therapy or by the decrease in this number during therapy. 
1	Risk factors for breast cancer. Despite the numerous risk factors for the development of breast cancer that have been investigated, only a few demonstrate a clear association with breast cancer development. Female gender and increasing age are the most important factors, followed by factors involving a woman's menstrual, reproductive, and family history. The risks related to menstruation and reproduction are probably related to the duration of estrogenic breast stimulation. The relationship of family history and breast cancer risk is unclear, but there may be a true genetic basis. The previous occurrence of breast cancer (invasive or in situ), the presence of proliferative pathological changes, especially with atypia, and the presence of other malignancies (e.g., primary ovarian and endometrial cancer) are histological risk factors for the development of new or recurrent breast cancer. Radiation exposure, the use of exogenous estrogens (both estrogen replacement therapy and oral contraceptives), diet (especially fat consumption), and alcohol intake may all play a role in cancer risk. Certain medications as well as patient demographics may also have a weak association. Cigarette smoking, caffeine consumption, and stress presently have little support for an association with breast cancer risk. It should be noted that in only one in four patients can breast cancer be accounted for by the known risk factors. This demonstrates that although presently known risk factors may help in screening for the early detection of breast carcinoma, in its possible prevention by modulation of influenceable factors, and in advising patients about their risks, these factors are merely strong associations with breast cancer incidence and not actual causations. The mechanisms of the development of breast cancer are as yet unknown. 
1	Increased expression of the laminin receptor in human colon cancer. It has been proposed that among the various cell-surface proteins capable of interacting with laminin, the 67-kd high-affinity laminin receptor plays a crucial role during tumor invasion and metastasis. In this study, the expression of laminin-receptor-precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) and 67-kd protein was analyzed in human colon adenocarcinoma. In 22 of 23 patients with colon cancer, we found a 2- to 23-fold increase in levels of laminin-receptor-precursor mRNA in the cancer tissues compared with those in matched normal adjacent colonic mucosa. In 10 of 11 cases studied, the level of 67-kd laminin receptor, detected by affinity-purified anti-laminin-receptor synthetic peptide antibodies on immunoblots of matched tumor and normal tissue extracts, was higher in the colon carcinoma tissue. Immunodetection of laminin receptor in tissue sections using anti-laminin-receptor-peptide antibodies confirmed that the increased expression of laminin receptor was specifically associated with the cancer cells. In a series of 72 paraffin sections of colon lesions, we observed a correlation between the expression of the laminin receptor and the Dukes' classification. Our observations indicate that increased expression of laminin-receptor-precursor mRNA is associated with enhanced levels of the 67-kd laminin receptor as well as with the invasive phenotype of colon carcinoma. Detection of this metastasis-associated gene product may be a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of human colon cancer. 
4	Synchronous reconstruction for combined aortoiliac and femoropopliteal occlusive lesions. The role of proximal bypass. Between January 1984 and December 1986, 31 patients underwent synchronous revascularization (SR) because of the serious clinical condition of a lower limb and presence of arteriographically visible lesions. Average follow-up was 30 months. Operative mortality was 10%. Two patient populations were identified: Group I (N = 13): patients who underwent ilio-femoral or aorto-femoral proximal revascularization (PR); Group II (N = 18): patients who had axillo-femoral PR. Group I patients were younger than those in Group II (64 yr versus 72 yr; p less than 0.01). An association of pre-operative risk factors (arterial hypertension; coronary, renal or respiratory insufficiency) was twice as frequent in Group II as in Group I (p less than 0.02). The rate of SR compared to PR alone was 15%. However, there was no statistically significant difference between Groups I and II. Comparison of the actuarial survival curves for patients ahd the patency rates of SR in Groups I and II failed to reveal any statistically significant differences. Axillo-femoral bypass can be used for PR when SR is necessary in high risk patients. 
5	Contracturing granulomatous myositis: a separate entity. Granulomatous muscle disease is most commonly seen in sarcoidosis, but may be seen in association with a wide variety of other disorders or in isolation. Patients with granulomatous myositis usually present with slowly progressive muscle pain and weakness affecting mainly proximal muscles. There are, however, a few reports of granulomatous muscle disease presenting with flexion contractures of the limbs. Two further patients with granulomatous muscle disease and flexion contractures of the limbs, but with no evidence of systemic granulomatous disease, is presented. It is suggested that such patients represent a separate clinical entity that is distinct from idiopathic granulomatous myositis presenting with muscle pain and weakness. The association of contracturing granulomatous myositis with a long-standing vasculitis in one patient suggests that the two conditions may be related. 
2	Group B streptococcus: an unusual cause of severe peritonitis in young children treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients is only rarely caused by beta-hemolytical streptococci species. We describe two young children, aged 15 months and 5 years, respectively, who presented an unusually severe course of peritonitis due to group B beta-hemolytical streptococci. This course of the disease showed a strong similarity with neonatal streptococcal septicemia. In neonates, IgG2 deficiency is thought to be partly responsible for the severity of this condition. This may also be true for young children treated with CAPD, since IgG2 deficiency has been established for children. 
1	Monomorphic adenomas of the major salivary glands: clinicopathological study of 44 cases. We report 44 cases of monomorphic adenoma (MA) of the major salivary glands observed during the years 1979-1989. All of these tumours were reviewed and classified on the basis of the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria. Histological type, site, sex and age were considered. 34 cases of adenolymphoma were observed, all of them located in the parotid glands; 10 MA without lymphoid stroma were located in both parotid and submandibular glands. Distinctive histological and clinico-pathological features of the latter group of tumours are discussed, as well as the diagnostic criteria in distinguishing these tumours from pleomorphic adenoma and adenoid-cystic carcinoma. 
2	Intracorporeal biliary lithotripsy. Most bile duct calculi can be removed with standard percutaneous or endoscopic techniques. Very large stones are the most common cause for failure. Intracorporeal lithotripsy, and EHL in particular, can be used safely in either the biliary tree or gallbladder to fragment these large stones and allow percutaneous removal or passage. Intracorporeal EHL requires direct vision to prevent damage to the bile duct mucosa. Intracorporeal laser lithotripsy may offer some safety advantages, but the laser requires much more expensive equipment than intracorporeal EHL. Additional studies are needed to determine the technique that is better in each circumstance. 
5	Delayed-onset dystonia due to perinatal or early childhood asphyxia. We report 10 patients with delayed-onset dystonia associated with perinatal asphyxia and 2 associated with asphyxia in childhood. In the perinatal group, the mean age of onset was 12.9 years. Among these patients, dystonia continued to progress for a mean of 7 years, and as long as 28 years. These patients had moderate motor disability; none was wheelchair-bound, and thus their prognosis was better than that of the childhood-onset idiopathic torsion dystonias. The most frequently beneficial drugs were anticholinergics. Since some of these patients closely resembled cases of idiopathic torsion dystonia, the prior occurrence of asphyxia should be used as a criterion of exclusion for that diagnosis. 
4	Intercostal arteriovenous fistula due to pleural biopsy A 32 year old woman had a pleural biopsy for a left pleural effusion, which showed caseating granuloma typical of tuberculosis. When the fourth biopsy specimen was removed considerable bleeding occurred from the puncture site. Four days later a bruit was audible over the punctured area, radiating to the back. Eight days after the procedure the patient had a massive bleed into the left pleural space. Selective aortic angiography showed an arteriovenous fistula between the 9th intercostal artery and vein and a pseudoaneurysm in the intercostal punctured area. Thoracotomy showed bleeding from the site of the pleural biopsy. The intercostal vessels were ligated and pleural decortication was performed, and the patient recovered uneventfully. 
1	Allograft reconstructions of the shoulder after bone tumor resections. Large skeletal defects resulting from tumor resections about the shoulder create reconstructive challenges for the orthopedic surgeon. Bone allografts offer several advantages compared with other reconstructive techniques, and functional outcomes are generally satisfactory. They may be used either as osteoarticular grafts, intercalated segments to create an arthrodesis, or in combination with standard proximal humerus metallic implants. Patient expectations and specific oncologic factors must be considered when selecting the optimal method of reconstruction. 
1	Surgical prophylaxis of malignant melanoma. A review of a 14-year experience with prophylactic pigmented skin lesion removal is presented. Data obtained during a 4-year interval of this 14-year experience is analyzed specifically. During this 4-year interval, 250 patients with melanoma were seen. Of these patients, 75 with a history of stage I (localized) melanoma and three patients with stage II (history of controlled regionally metastatic melanoma) underwent removal of multiple skin lesions on a prophylactic basis. Of the removed lesions, 28% showed hyperplasia, atypia, dysplasia, or melanoma. Nine unsuspected in situ, or level I melanomas, and three unsuspected invasive melanomas were removed from these 75 melanoma patients while excising lesions prophylactically during the 4-year interval. It is estimated that four to six additional melanomas were prevented by excision of precursor lesions. During the same 4-year interval, an additional 112 of approximately 1000 patients without a previous history of melanoma underwent prophylactic lesion removals. In 31% of the 112 patients, there was a history of melanoma in a first-degree relative. In 22% of the removed lesions there was hyperplasia, atypia, or dysplasia. Three cases of melanoma in situ were detected and it is estimated that an additional three to five cases of melanoma were prevented. Atypical findings occurred in 71, or 63%, of the patients biopsied, which represented 7% of the approximately 1000 patients screened. During the 4-year interval, an average of 17.7 lesions were removed from each of the 190 melanoma and nonmelanoma patients undergoing prophylactic skin lesion excision. This was accomplished in one to four sessions per patient. This average reflects only those patients who underwent one excision or more and does not include those patients treated without operation. When including the nonoperated patients screened during this interval, the average number of lesions removed was 2.7 per patient. Death from new melanomas was prevented during the 14-year period of this study as evidenced by the fact that no patient died or developed metastatic disease from a cutaneous melanoma that was not apparent or known about at the time of first examination. 
4	Angiography, angioscopy, and ultrasound imaging before and after percutaneous balloon angioplasty. We report two patients undergoing peripheral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in whom angiography, angioscopy, and ultrasound imaging were performed before and after balloon angioplasty. The first case with smooth atheroma diagnosed by angiography was found to have unrecognized partially occlusive thrombus by angioscopy. After angioplasty, an intimal tear was identified by angioscopy and ultrasound but it was not seen by angiography. The intravascular ultrasound image showed the tear to extend to the adventitia. In the second case, an apparently smooth intimal surface as imaged by angiography was found by angioscopy and ultrasound to have extensive damage, including subintimal hemorrhage, intimal flaps, and arterial dissection at the angioplasty site. These data suggest that the type of information derived from the three imaging techniques is quite different, and that each may have a specific role in intravascular diagnosis. 
4	Pregnancy-induced hypertension and acute fatty liver of pregnancy: atypical presentations. Severe pregnancy-induced hypertension and markedly elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase developed in a 29-year-old-woman in whom one pregnancy resulted in intrauterine death. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy developed with good fetal outcome in the next pregnancy. This case suggests that pregnancy-induced hypertension and acute fatty liver of pregnancy are part of a clinical spectrum. Moreover, classic abnormalities of liver function tests need not be present in acute fatty liver of pregnancy. 
5	Small-volume resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock in dogs: effects on systemic hemodynamics and systemic blood flow. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: This study compared canine systemic hemodynamics and organ blood flow (radioactive microsphere technique) after resuscitation with 0.8% saline (Na+ 137 mEq/L), 7.2% hypertonic saline (Na+ 1233 mEq/L), 20% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.8% saline, or 20% hydroxyethyl starch in 7.2% saline, each in a volume approximating 15% of shed blood volume. Twenty-four endotracheally intubated mongrel dogs (18 to 24 kg) underwent a 30-min period of hemorrhagic shock, from time 0 to 30 min into the shock period, followed by fluid resuscitation. Data were collected at baseline, 15 min into the shock period, immediately after fluid infusion, 5 min after the beginning of resuscitation, and at 60-min intervals for 2 hr, (65 min after the beginning of resuscitation, and 125 min after the beginning of resuscitation). The animals received one of four randomly assigned iv resuscitation fluids: saline (54 mL/kg), hypertonic saline (6.0 mL/kg), hydroxyethel starch (6.0 mL/kg) or hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch (6.0 mL/kg). RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure increased in all groups after resuscitation. Cardiac output increased with resuscitation in all groups, exceeding baseline in the saline and hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch groups (p less than .05 compared with hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch). Sixty-five minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, cardiac output was significantly (p less than .05) greater in either of the two colloid-containing groups than in the hypertonic saline group. After resuscitation, hypertonic saline and hydroxyethyl starch produced minimal improvements in hepatic arterial flow, hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch increased hepatic arterial flow to near baseline levels, and saline markedly increased hepatic arterial flow to levels exceeding baseline (p less than .05, saline vs. hydroxyethyl starch). One hundred twenty-five minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, hepatic arterial flow had decreased in all groups; hepatic arterial flow in the hypertonic saline group had decreased to levels comparable with those during shock. Myocardial, renal, and brain blood flow were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Small-volume resuscitation with the combination of hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch is comparable with much larger volumes of 0.8% saline, and is equal to hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch in the ability to restore and sustain BP and improve organ blood flow after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock. 
3	MRI, CT, SPECT, PET: their use in diagnosing dementia. The differential diagnosis of the dementia syndrome may pose a difficult clinical problem, since the most common dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is marked by normal laboratory tests. Neuroimaging has played an important role in evaluating the demented patient, and its uses are growing. Computed tomography (CT) is useful for excluding reversible and treatable causes of dementia, such as subdural hematoma and tumor. More recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has improved our ability to diagnose vascular disease and may show the presence of cerebral infarcts and white matter disease not visible on CT. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET), techniques that visualize such cerebral functions as glucose metabolism and blood flow, may provide positive evidence supportive of the diagnosis of AD. 
5	Omeprazole in the management of intractable esophageal ulceration following injection sclerotherapy. Transient esophageal ulceration is a common finding after sclerotherapy of varices. A small proportion of these ulcers become chronic and resistant to conventional therapy. Such chronic ulcers have been associated with pain, stricture formation, and recurrent hemorrhage. The use of omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, was examined in the current study in the treatment of 10 patients (6 women, 4 men; age range, 27-86 years) with cirrhosis (PBC, 4; sclerosing cholangitis, 2; chronic active liver disease, 2; alcohol, 1; and cryptogenic, 1) who developed an esophageal ulcer after a mean of 13 (range, 8-21) sessions of sclerotherapy. The ulcers had been present for 3-54 months despite prolonged treatment with high-dose H2-receptor antagonists and sucralfate. In each case one or more complications had occurred: severe pain in 3, stricture formation in 4, and recurrent hemorrhage in 7 cases. After an 8-week course of omeprazole, 40 mg daily, endoscopy confirmed complete healing of the ulceration in all 10 cases with symptom resolution. In 2 cases the ulcer recurred, with associated bleeding within 6 weeks of discontinuing the treatment in 1 patient. Both cases responded to repeat therapy. These results confirm the efficacy of omeprazole for postsclerotherapy ulceration and imply that acid-pepsin has a role in perpetuating such ulcers. 
5	The stroke syndrome of striatocapsular infarction. Striatocapsular infarction has recently been described as a distinct stroke entity and forms an important subgroup of subcortical infarctions. In a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients over a 10 yr period with this syndrome, clinical and neuropsychological features, pathogenesis and outcome were studied to provide information concerning management and prognosis. The most common clinical presentation was that of a stroke affecting mainly the upper limb with cortical signs such as dysphasia, neglect or dyspraxia. Evidence from EEG, angiographic and neuropsychological data supported a vascular/haemodynamic basis for the presence of the acute neuropsychological changes, while the chronic changes were more likely to be due to diaschisis. A study of risk factors and cerebral angiography enabled 4 pathophysiological subgroups to be identified: (1) cardiac emboli to the origin of the middle cerebral artery; (2) severe extra-cranial cranial carotid artery occlusive disease with presumed embolism to the same site and/or involvement of haemodynamic factors; (3) proximal middle cerebral artery abnormalities causing occlusion of multiple lateral striate arteries at their origins; (4) normal angiography where pathogenesis was uncertain. The risk factors of cardiac disease and smoking were significantly increased as compared with age and sex-matched controls with other forms of ischaemic stroke. Stroke or vascular death rate was 2.7% per yr during a mean follow-up period of 2.25 yrs. Predictors of an excellent recovery with return to normal lifestyle were younger age, only brachial or brachiofacial weakness with absence of cortical signs at presentation and minimal change on angiography. This stroke entity deserves particular recognition in the spectrum of subcortical infarctions because of its specific pathogenesis, distinct neuropsychological features and reasonable prognosis. 
1	Detection of loss of heterozygosity in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens by the polymerase chain reaction. A polymerase chain reaction-based procedure was used for the detection of DNA length polymorphisms generated by naturally occurring genetic deletions or insertions of known sequence. This method consists of a simple one-step assay that does not require any restriction enzyme analysis or Southern blot hybridization, allowing identification in ethidium bromide-stained gels. The procedure described here was used to detect loss of heterozygosity at various loci, including the Hbb beta-globin gene cluster, in chemically induced mouse skin tumors, using a variety of tissue preparations, including microdissection of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, short-term cultures, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting of epithelial populations. This approach may be useful in detecting tumor-specific reduction to homozygosity at polymorphic chromosomal loci, allowing the mapping of putative tumor-suppressor loci involved in carcinogenesis. 
4	Percutaneous right brachial artery approach with 5F catheters for studying coronary artery disease. We prospectively studied 60 ischemic patients with 5F catheters (Pigtail and Amplatz) using the percutaneous right brachial artery approach (group I), in order to compare this technique with two groups of 100 patients each randomly studied by the femoral route with either 5F (group II) or 8F (group III) catheters (Pigtail and Judkins). The following parameters were analyzed: need to change the initially elected catheter diameter or/and artery approach; technical difficulty for obtaining LV, LCA, and RCA angiograms; total time of X-ray exposure; quality image of LV, LCA, and RCA angiograms; incidence of arterial puncture related hematomas or total arterial occlusion; and duration of local compression after sheath removal. There were no differences between 5F brachial and femoral approaches except for the arterial compression time (p less than 0.01) and the X-ray exposure time (p = 0.03) which were longer with the brachial approach. Whatever the route used, 5F showed a mild increase difficulty (brachial p = 0.001; femoral p = 0.01) and a mild decreased quality image for LCA (branchial p = 0.006; femoral p less than 0.05). Mild hematomas were more frequent with 8F catheters (p less than 0.05). The procedure could be completed by the elected first artery and type of catheter (5F or 8F) in 57/60 patients in group I, in 95/100 in group II, and in 96/100 in group III (nonsignificant differences). Thus, the percutaneous right brachial artery approach using 5F catheters is similar to the femoral artery approach with the same catheters. Although both of them showed a mild increased technical difficulty and a mild decreased quality image compared to 8F, mainly for LCA angiograms, they allowed complete and reliable angiograms reading and analysis. 
5	Cholesterol cysts of the temporal bone: diagnosis and treatment. Cholesterol cyst (or granuloma) of the temporal bone, a recognized clinical entity distinct from cholesteatoma, is more common than previously thought. Apparently it is caused by obstruction of previously pneumatized temporal bone air cells. Surgical cure is achieved by drainage and reestablishment of normal pneumatization. This paper reviews 14 cholesterol cysts of the temporal bone, emphasizing the importance of preoperative imaging and surgical approach. Use of magnetic resonance imaging differentiates cholesterol cysts from cholesteatoma or other neoplasms. Computed tomography delineates the location of the lesion and defines temporal bone anatomy essential to surgical approach. The two studies together allow the surgeon to properly plan drainage, as in the case of a cholesterol cyst, versus excision or exteriorization, as in the case of cholesteatoma. The infralabyrinthine approach to a petrous apex cholesterol cyst is the procedure of choice when hearing preservation is desired. 
1	Brain tumors. Recent advances in experimental tumor biology are being applied to critical clinical problems of primary brain tumors. The expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, which are sparse in normal brain, is increased as much as 20-fold in brain tumors. Experimental studies show promise in using labeled ligands to these receptors to identify the outer margins of malignant brain tumors. Whereas positron emission tomography has improved the dynamic understanding of tumors, the labeled selective tumor receptors with positron emitters will enhance the ability to specifically diagnose and greatly aid in the pretreatment planning for tumors. Modulation of these receptors will also affect tumor growth and metabolism. Novel methods to deliver antitumor agents to the brain and new approaches using biologic response modifiers also hold promise to further improve the management of brain tumors. 
3	Rediscovering tactile agnosia. Eighty-four patients with damage to various levels of the nervous system, ranging from the peripheral nerves to the cerebral cortex, underwent somesthetic assessment in order to determine the degree to which basic and complex perceptual and motor disorders affect tactile object recognition (TOR) and to determine whether TOR can be impaired in the absence of more basic sensorimotor imperception. The results suggest that (1) basic and intermediate disorders of somesthetic function impair TOR but are commensurately more severe for any given degree of TOR impairment in patients with peripheral lesions than in patients with cortical lesions; (2) neither hemiparesis nor hemianopia alone precludes normal TOR; (3) hemineglect contributes substantially to TOR impairment; (4) impairment of TOR can occur in the absence of more basic somesthetic dysfunction and constitutes tactile agnosia; (5) tactile agnosia is a subtle, nondisabling disorder that should be distinguished from the nonagnosic, severe and disabling disorder, astereognosis; and (6) tactile agnosia results from unilateral damage to parietotemporal cortices, possibly including the second somatosensory cortex, in either hemisphere. 
1	Cancer mortality in workers exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin BACKGROUND. In both animal and epidemiologic studies, exposure to dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, or TCDD) has been associated with an increased risk of cancer. METHODS. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of mortality among the 5172 workers at 12 plants in the United States that produced chemicals contaminated with TCDD. Occupational exposure was documented by reviewing job descriptions and by measuring TCDD in serum from a sample of 253 workers. Causes of death were taken from death certificates. RESULTS. Mortality from several cancers previously associated with TCDD (stomach, liver, and nasal cancers, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) was not significantly elevated in this cohort. Mortality from soft-tissue sarcoma was increased, but not significantly (4 deaths; standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 338; 95 percent confidence interval, 92 to 865). In the subcohort of 1520 workers with greater than or equal to 1 year of exposure and greater than or equal to 20 years of latency, however, mortality was significantly increased for soft-tissue sarcoma (3 deaths; SMR, 922; 95 percent confidence interval, 190 to 2695) and for cancers of the respiratory system (SMR, 142; 95 percent confidence interval, 103 to 192). Mortality from all cancers combined was slightly but significantly elevated in the overall cohort (SMR, 115; 95 percent confidence interval, 102 to 130) and was higher in the subcohort with greater than or equal to 1 year of exposure and greater than or equal to 20 years of latency (SMR, 146; 95 percent confidence interval, 121 to 176). CONCLUSIONS. This study of mortality among workers with occupational exposure to TCDD does not confirm the high relative risks reported for many cancers in previous studies. Conclusions about an increase in the risk of soft-tissue sarcoma are limited by small numbers and misclassification on death certificates. Excess mortality from all cancers combined, cancers of the respiratory tract, and soft-tissue sarcoma may result from exposure to TCDD, although we cannot exclude the possible contribution of factors such as smoking and occupational exposure to other chemicals. 
5	Restricted heterogeneity of T lymphocytes in combined immunodeficiency with hypereosinophilia (Omenn's syndrome). We report the immunological characteristics of five patients with Omenn's syndrome, a rare inherited immunodeficiency also known as combined immunodeficiency with hypereosinophilia. The syndrome is characterized by T cell infiltration of skin, gut, liver, and spleen leading to diffuse erythroderma, protracted diarrhea, failure to thrive, and hepatosplenomegaly. Blood T cells as well as those infiltrating the skin and gut were found to express activation markers and were partially activated by mitogens but not by antigens. Although the lesions resembled those in graft-versus-host disease, the blood T cells were shown by DNA haplotype analysis using probes revealing variable number of tandem repeats to belong to the patients as well as the T cells infiltrating the gut and skin in one patient. A given T cell subset (TCR alpha beta+, CD4+/CD8+, or TCR gamma delta+) was predominant in each patient, with a specific distribution in the skin lesions. Moreover, the study of T cell receptor beta, gamma, and delta gene rearrangements in four patients revealed oligoclonality involving C beta 1, C beta 2, or different V gamma J gamma or V delta J delta genes. This indicates that restricted heterogeneity of the T cell repertoire, previously reported in one case, is a major feature of this syndrome. The occurrence of alymphocytosis-type severe combined immunodeficiency in the brother of one of the patients suggests that the restricted heterogeneity of T cell receptor gene usage in Omenn's syndrome may arise from leakiness, within the context of a genetically determined faulty T cell differentiation. 
5	Maternal feeding behavior and child acceptance of food during diarrhea, convalescence, and health in the central Sierra of Peru. Feeding patterns by mothers and child acceptance of food were measured in a Peruvian village to determine changes on days when children had diarrhea as compared to days of convalescence and health. Morbidity surveillance identified 40 children, aged 4-36 months, with diarrhea. Children were followed using twelve-hour in-home structured observations during two to four days each of diarrhea, convalescence, and health. Using scales of maternal encouragement to eat and child acceptance of food and cumulative logistic regression analyses, maternal encouragement to eat decreased significantly during convalescence compared to diarrheal days (OR: 0.54, 90% CI: 0.35, 0.82) and health compared to diarrhea (OR: 0.65, 90% CI: 0.46, 0.93). In contrast, child acceptance of food increased during health compared to diarrhea (OR: 1.55, 90% CI: 1.02, 2.35). Results illustrate the importance of carefully examining the behavioral aspects of nutritional intake. Decreases in intake during diarrhea are due to anorexia and not withdrawal of food by mothers. In response to reductions in child appetite during illness, mothers are more likely to encourage children to eat, while they tend to become more passive feeders after the diarrhea has stopped. Program efforts should focus on messages to feed children more actively especially after diarrhea episodes, when appetite levels increase. 
2	Crohn's disease in the city of Derby, 1951-85. An epidemiological survey of Crohn's disease in the city of Derby showed that the incidence of the condition increased from 0.7/10(5) per year between 1951 and 1955 to 6.67/10(5) per year between 1981 and 1985 but seemed to reach a plateau between 1976 and 1985. Large bowel Crohn's disease was more common in patients presenting aged 60-79 years than in those aged 20-39 years. The increase in incidence was not solely due to the detection of milder disease. There was no evidence that the Asian (Indian subcontinent) population of Derby was resistant to the development of Crohn's disease. 
4	Tongue ischemia from a soft-drink can: report of case. A young girl was brought to the emergency department because her tongue became entrapped while she was drinking from an aluminum soft-drink can. A dental drill was used to remove the can. The tongue was observed for 48 hours, during which an ischemic area recovered spontaneously. 
5	Cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem component. A report of seven cases. Seven patients had a cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem femoral component. Four patients died in the operating room, and three patients were successfully resuscitated. When the three survivors were eventually discharged from the hospital, they had no known permanent cardiac, pulmonary, or neurological sequelae. Factors that were common to all of the patients were advanced age, osteoporotic bone, a previously undisturbed intramedullary canal, and use of a long-stem femoral component and several batches of methylmethacrylate. Hip arthroplasty with a long-stem femoral component is associated with substantial risk in these patients. Excessive pressurization of cement should be avoided, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring should be used when the described conditions are present. 
1	Surgical management of islet cell dysmaturation syndrome in young children. Islet cell dysmaturation syndrome (ICDS) encompasses the causes of infantile hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia histologically described as islet cell hyperplasia, pancreatic adenomatosis and nesidioblastosis. Eleven infants underwent 14 pancreatic resections for ICDS from 1965 to 1990 at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center for severe hypoglycemia unresponsive to medical therapy. Seizures were the presenting symptoms of hypoglycemia in eight infants. Six patients had nesidioblastosis, four had islet cell hyperplasia and one patient had an adenoma with histologically normal pancreatic islet cells. Four neonates underwent 80 per cent pancreatic resection; three with nesidioblastosis required reoperation (90 to 95 per cent resection). Four older infants underwent 80 per cent pancreatic resection but required diazoxide for less than six months postoperatively. Three infants underwent 90 to 95 per cent pancreatic resection. None have required reoperation or postoperative medications. All infants are normoglycemic without pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and none had postoperative complications. Five infants had preoperative neurologic impairment, with three having severe retardation; all showed some improvement postoperatively, but only one infant now has normal findings on neurologic examination. Early diagnosis and aggressive surgical resection should minimize neurologic complications of the ICDS. 
5	Acute lobar atelectasis. A comparison of two chest physiotherapy regimens. Fourteen cases of acute lobar atelectasis were alternately allocated to one of two chest physiotherapy regimens for treatment. Treatment in group 1 comprised positioning, vibrations, hyperinflation, and suction, and in group 2, treatment consisted of hyperinflation and suction alone. Treatment in either group was given hourly for six hours. Patients in group 1 had a significantly higher mean percentage resolution of their atelectasis (mean value, 60.1 percent), as seen on chest roentgenogram, after one treatment intervention than patients in group 2 (mean value, 7.6 percent; p less than .006). After the intensive six-hour treatment period, the difference between the groups was marginally statistically significant, still favoring group 1 over group 2 (p less than .055). Follow-up roentgenograms at 24 and 48 hours revealed no significant difference between the treatment groups (p greater than .10 and greater than .20, respectively). These results suggest that, at least initially in the course of acute lobar atelectasis, positioning and vibrations add to the efficacy of a treatment of hyperinflation and suction alone. 
5	Percent tumor necrosis as a predictor of treatment response in canine osteosarcoma. The percent tumor necrosis was determined in 200 dogs with spontaneously occurring osteosarcoma. One hundred dogs had no treatment before amputation or death. One hundred other dogs were treated with either radiation therapy alone (n = 23), intraarterial (IA) cisplatin alone (n = 16), intravenous (IV) cisplatin alone (n = 6), radiation therapy plus IA cisplatin (n = 47), or radiation therapy plus IV cisplatin (n = 8). Eighty-nine of these 100 dogs had their tumors resected 3 weeks after the end of therapy (6 weeks after the initiation of therapy) and replaced with a cortical bone allograft. Dogs with preoperative treatment were evaluated for local tumor control and time to metastasis. The mean percent tumor necrosis in untreated osteosarcoma was 26.8%. The mean percent tumor necrosis for dogs receiving radiation only, IA cisplatin only, and IV cisplatin only was 81.6%, 49.1% and 23.8%, respectively. The mean percent tumor necrosis for dogs receiving radiation therapy plus IA cisplatin or radiation therapy plus IV cisplatin was 83.7% and 78.2%, respectively. There was no significant difference between percent tumor necrosis in untreated osteosarcoma compared with those receiving IV cisplatin, but there was a significant increase in percent tumor necrosis with all other treatments. A mathematic model for the effect of cisplatin and radiation dose was developed using multiple regression analysis. The radiation dose calculated to cause at least 80% tumor necrosis was 42.2 Gy (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.0 to 47.6 Gy) when radiation was given alone and 28.1 Gy (95% CI, 21.3 to 36.6 Gy) when radiation was combined with IA cisplatin. Areas of viable tumor tended to be most frequent adjacent to the articular cartilage and in the joint capsule. Percent tumor necrosis was strongly predictive for local tumor control; 28 of 32 dogs with greater than 80% tumor necrosis had local control, and only eight of 29 dogs with less than 79% tumor necrosis had local control (P = 0.0047). There was no correlation between percent tumor necrosis and time to metastasis. 
5	Early postoperative mortality following hysterectomy. A Danish population based study, 1977-1981. The main objective of this cohort study was to analyse the early postoperative mortality after 'simple' hysterectomy for benign indications and to compare it with that of a randomly selected reference group of women matched for age. Registry data covering the entire Danish female population were used. Included in the study were all patients operated in the period 1977-1981. Patients were only included if no cancer was diagnosed and if no major co-surgery was performed (29,192 patients). Cancer patients were also excluded in the reference group (16,182 women). Mortality was studied according to characteristics of patients, their residential area, the surgical approach and operating hospital. Overall 47 patients died within 30 days of admission for hysterectomy (overall mortality 16.1 per 10,000). Only seven deaths were expected on the basis of the population sample, and adjusted for age, the relative risk (RR) for hysterectomy patients was 6.38 (95% CI 4.33-9.39). Early postoperative mortality increased with age, and the risk was elevated among emergency patients (RR = 3.22; 1.72-6.04). Patients with more than one diagnosis at discharge (RR = 4.53; 2.12-9.70) were at high risk, but early postoperative mortality was independent of surgical approach. Causes of death are discussed. Compared to the general population, patients who undergo 'simple' hysterectomy are faced with a sixfold risk of dying within 30 days, but a complete assessment of the risks and benefits of hysterectomy requires prospective studies of survival and morbidity, including quality of life for longer periods of time following operations. 
1	trans-Activation of genes encoding activation-associated human T lymphocyte surface proteins by murine retroviral sequences. The mechanisms whereby RNA leukemia viruses cause T lymphocyte leukemias or lymphomas after a long latent period are not understood. We report here that infection of human T lymphocyte lines with a murine leukemia virus results in up-regulation of a number of lymphocyte-specific cell surface Ag. These proteins include CD2, CD3, CD4, the TCR, and MHC class I Ag. The expression of other cell surface proteins, such as LFA-3, are unaffected by the presence of the retrovirus. This up-regulation occurs at the level of the mRNA transcripts encoding these proteins, and is the result of increased transcription of the respective genes. The increases in transcription are the result of a trans-activation process by the leukemia virus. The transient introduction of chimeric genes consisting of MHC class I gene promoter sequences attached to the reporter gene CAT into human T cells containing murine retrovirus produces stimulated transcription of the reporter gene. Subgenomic portions of the murine leukemia virus containing the long terminal repeats and the 5' untranslated region are sufficient to produce transactivation of the same set of T cell genes as the whole leukemia virus. The finding that murine leukemia viruses enhance transcription and expression of a group of T cell surface proteins, all of which have been reported to be capable of transducing an activating signal to the lymphocyte, may be relevant to the pathophysiologic mechanisms whereby these viruses induce leukemias and lymphomas. 
1	Pattern of urological malignancy in Zambia. A hospital-based histopathological study. The pattern of urological malignancy among the indigenous population of Zambia (determined on the basis of histopathological reports from a major national hospital during an 8-year period) is presented. A total of 6514 malignancies were observed, of which 784 (12%) were of urological origin. Bladder carcinoma, predominantly squamous type, was the commonest urological tumour (51%), followed by carcinoma of the prostate (26%), carcinoma of the penis (18%), renal tumours (4.3%) and testicular malignancy (0.7%). In nearly 32% of the bladder tumours, bilharzial ova were demonstrated histopathologically. Nephroblastoma accounted for 70% of the renal tumours and from a total of 7 cases of testicular tumours 5 were embryonal carcinoma and 2 seminoma. A brief reference is made to the pattern and aetiology of urological malignancies in some neighbouring countries. 
4	Progressive inflammatory lesions of the brain parenchyma in localized scleroderma of the head. A patient with localized scleroderma of the head, uveitis, and Raynaud's phenomenon presented with generalized seizures, spastic hemiparesis, and local IgG production in the cerebrospinal fluid. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed progressive cortical and subcortical brain parenchymal lesions mainly adjacent to the cutaneous and bony lesions and probably of inflammatory origin. 
5	Edrophonium provocative test in noncardiac chest pain. Evaluation of testing techniques. Edrophonium chloride is used frequently as a provocative agent in the assessment of noncardiac chest pain (NCCP). However, the optimum dose and most appropriate method of interpreting test results is controversial. We studied 150 consecutive NCCP patients and 50 age-matched controls who alternately received either 80 micrograms/kg or 10 mg intravenous bolus doses of edrophonium preceded by saline placebo injections. Distal esophageal pressures were measured before and after drug injection in response to ten 5-cc wet swallows. Following 10 mg of edrophonium, 33% of patients and 4% of controls reported chest pain, while 29% of patients and no controls receiving the 80 micrograms/kg dose complained of chest pain. Amplitude changes after either dose were not significantly different for all comparisons, but the duration of response did distinguish the two doses in patients with chest pain. A significantly greater (P = 0.01) increase in distal contraction duration occurred after 10 mg (74 +/- 12%; +/- SE) compared to 80 micrograms/kg dose (43 +/- 6%). However, individual responses to the two doses overlapped considerably. If a positive test is redefined to include both chest pain and manometric changes that are significantly different from controls, the positivity rate changes drastically; 33% to 9% in the 10-mg group and 30% to 3% in the 80-micrograms/kg group. Side effects were similar between doses, but there was a significant (P = 0.02) linear relationship between intensity of side effects and the edrophonium dose per kilogram of body weight. 
2	Dissociation between systemic and mucosal humoral immune responses in coeliac disease. We examined humoral immunity in coeliac disease as expressed in serum (systemic immunity), and in saliva, jejunal aspirate, and whole gut lavage fluid (mucosal immunity). The aims were to define features of the secretory immune response (IgA and IgM concentrations and antibody values to gliadin and other food proteins measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) in active disease and remission, and to establish whether secretions obtained by relatively non-invasive techniques (saliva and gut lavage fluid) can be used for indirect measurements of events in the jejunum. Serum, saliva, and jejunal aspirate from 26 adults with untreated coeliac disease, 22 treated patients, and 28 immunologically normal control subjects were studied, together with intestinal secretions obtained by gut lavage from 15 untreated and 19 treated patients with coeliac disease and 25 control subjects. Jejunal aspirate IgA and IgM and gut lavage fluid IgM concentrations were significantly raised in patients with untreated coeliac disease; the lavage fluid IgM concentration remained higher in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls. Serum and salivary immunoglobulin concentrations were similar in the three groups. Patients with untreated coeliac disease had higher values of antibodies to gliadin compared with treated patients and control subjects in all body fluids tested; these were predominantly of IgA and IgG classes in serum, and of IgA and IgM classes in jejunal aspirate and gut lavage fluid. Values of salivary IgA antibodies to gliadin were significantly higher in untreated coeliacs, though antibody values were generally low, with a large overlap between coeliac disease patients and control subjects. 
5	Laryngeal framework reconstruction with miniplates. Defects of the laryngeal framework after trauma, cancer, and thyroplasty have been reconstructed with mini-reconstruction plates. Six patients had miniplates used to repair the thyroid cartilage defect after type I thyroplasty to prevent lateralization of the Silastic implant; three patients had miniplates used after hemilaryngectomy to bridge the thyroid cartilage remnants, resulting in better deglutition after hemilaryngectomy; and three patients had miniplates used to repair laryngeal fractures. The plates were tolerated well by the patients; there were no major complications. Rigid fixation using miniplates for laryngeal reconstruction has unique advantages over the use of wires. It offers the advantages of rigid and immediate stabilization with the ability to bridge large defects. It can be an alternative to existing techniques of laryngeal reconstruction. 
5	Growth hormone for short stature not due to classic growth hormone deficiency. The advent of recombinant DNA technology has resulted in potentially unlimited supplies of growth hormone. Sufficient quantities are now available not only for the long-term, uninterrupted treatment of GH-deficient children but potentially for the treatment of non-GH-deficient patients with other short stature or growth attenuating disorders. Short-term studies have demonstrated an improvement in the growth rates of subjects with isolated short stature, Turner syndrome, and chronic renal failure; and additional studies are under way to assess the efficacy of GH therapy of other short stature syndromes. However, the long-term efficacy and possible adverse effects of GH treatment in these situations is not known. Until there has been more experience, GH deficiency should remain the primary indication for GH treatment. Growth hormone should not be considered routine therapy for other conditions associated with or resulting in short stature. However, research should continue in these areas to define which children may benefit from GH treatment. 
5	Chronic upper lobe cavitary lung disease. Chronic upper lobe cavitary lung disease may be caused by infections, emphysema, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, sarcoidosis and rheumatologic syndromes. The diagnostic evaluation includes a complete history, a physical examination, a chest radiograph, and sputum examination and culture. In some cases, computed tomographic scanning and biopsy are required. 
5	Pharmacologic stress imaging. Pharmacologic stress imaging has increasingly been employed as an alternative to exercise imaging for detection of coronary artery disease and risk stratification particularly in patients who are unable to perform adequate exercise. Sensitivity and specificity of thallium 201 scintigraphy using intravenous dipyridamole infusion as a stress for coronary artery disease detection average 85% and 91%, respectively. Dipyridamole imaging is also useful for differentiating between ischemia and scar and identifying patients who have an increased risk for subsequent cardiac events. Dipyridamole imaging is particularly useful for preoperative risk stratification in patients undergoing surgery for peripheral vascular or aortic disease. Dipyridamole imaging is also useful for identifying residual myocardial ischemia after myocardial infarction and detecting restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Adverse side effects of dipyridamole are promptly reversed by aminophylline. Dipyridamole stress can also be employed in association with echocardiography for detection of ischemia-induced regional wall motion abnormalities. 
4	Transoesophageal echocardiography in the longitudinal axis: correlation between anatomy and images and its clinical implications. Transoesophageal echocardiographic imaging in the longitudinal axis is a recent addition to the non-invasive evaluation of congenital and acquired heart disease. The technique provides unique images of intracardiac anatomy but their interpretation remains difficult. A heart specimen was therefore cut according to the echocardiographic imaging planes to elucidate the morphological details. The results suggested that longitudinal transoesophageal imaging complements the transverse axis approach. It gave new imaging information on the right ventricular outflow tract and the pulmonary trunk, the atrioventricular valves, the interventricular septum, the cardiac apex, and the thoracic aorta. In particular, it showed the entire length of the right ventricular outflow tract. When longitudinal imaging was used in combination with transverse imaging almost all the thoracic aorta could be examined. Imaging in the longitudinal axis may also allow better assessment of the mechanisms of atrioventricular valve regurgitation. 
1	A recurrent pelvic desmoid tumor successfully treated with tamoxifen. A case of recurrent retroperitoneal desmoid tumor successfully treated with tamoxifen (Nolvadex tablets, ICI Pharma, Division of ICI Americas, Wilmington, DE) is reported. The patient presented late in her second pregnancy with a large retroperitoneal pelvic desmoid tumor that was treated with surgical excision and megestrol acetate. When the tumor recurred 12 months later, it was again treated with surgery, this time followed by radiation therapy. The desmoid tumor quickly recurred. The patient was then treated with tamoxifen, resulting in a complete tumor regression that has remained stable for 27 months. Tamoxifen should be considered as first-line therapy in recurrent desmoid tumors. 
5	Delayed facial nerve palsy after temporal lobectomy for epilepsy: report of four cases and discussion of possible mechanisms. Four cases of idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy were documented after 110 consecutive resections of the temporal lobe for intractable epilepsy. In 3 of the 4 cases, the palsy was ipsilateral to the side of the temporal lobectomy. The onset of facial weakness was delayed 7 to 13 days after surgery (mean, 9.7 days). One patient underwent facial electroneurography, which documented 17% of normal facial motor function at the height of his weakness and the absence of the acoustic stapedius reflex. All patients were treated with prednisone (60-80 mg per day by mouth for 10-14 days, tapering off throughout the subsequent week). Facial function recovered fully in all patients within 6 to 8 weeks. Possible mechanisms are discussed, including heat and/or mechanical trauma to the facial nerve near the geniculate ganglion during resection of mesial temporal lobe structures. 
5	Fascinating rhythm: a primer on chaos theory and its application to cardiology. Nonlinear dynamics is an exciting new way of looking at peculiarities that in the past have been ignored or explained away. We have attempted to give a general introduction to the basics of the mathematics, applications to cardiology, and a brief review of the new tools needed to use the concepts of nonlinear mathematics. The careful mathematical approach to problems in cardiac electrical dynamics and blood flow is opening a window on behaviors and mechanisms previously inaccessible. 
4	Enhanced chemiluminescence as a measure of oxygen-derived free radical generation during ischemia and reperfusion. It has been suggested that oxygen-derived free radicals may contribute to the myocardial injury associated with ischemia and reperfusion. As the presence of enhanced free radical generation is a prerequisite for such damage, several techniques have been used to provide evidence of increased oxygen free radical production during reperfusion; however, all such techniques have substantial limitations. In this study, we used enhanced chemiluminescence to evaluate oxygen free radical generation during ischemia and reperfusion in the isolated Langendorff-perfused rat heart. The chemiluminescent technique, which has high sensitivity and can monitor radical generation continuously, avoids some of the limitations of earlier methods. Chemiluminescence (expressed as counts per second) decreased from 219 +/- 11 at baseline to 142 +/- 9 during ischemia and markedly increased to a peak of 476 +/- 36 during the first 3-5 minutes of reperfusion. This was followed by a slow decline over 11-16 minutes to a steady-state level of 253 +/- 14 (each sequential change in chemiluminescence was highly significant; p less than 0.001). Superoxide dismutase (2,000 units/min) significantly decreased peak reperfusion chemiluminescence to 316 +/- 17 (p less than 0.01). Hearts subjected to a second period of ischemia and reperfusion had a higher peak chemiluminescence (626 +/- 62), which also was significantly attenuated by 1,000 units/min superoxide dismutase (398 +/- 16; p less than 0.01). 
5	The severity of coronary atherosclerosis at sites of plaque rupture with occlusive thrombosis. Atherosclerotic plaque rupture with superimposed thrombosis is recognized as the lesion causing greater than 90% of acute myocardial infarctions. To determine the severity of atherosclerosis at the site of plaque rupture, 184 coronary arteries from autopsies of 162 patients who died of acute myocardial infarction were studied. There were 102 men, 72 +/- 10 years old (mean +/- SD), and 60 women, 75 +/- 8 years old. All arteries were dissected from the heart, fixed, decalcified, cut at 2 to 3 mm intervals and processed routinely for histologic examination. A planimeter was used to measure artery, plaque, thrombus and luminal cross-sectional area at the site of plaque rupture with thrombosis in sections projected at x13.8 magnification. At the site of atherosclerotic plaque rupture with superimposed thrombosis, the degree of stenosis due to plaque was: 90 +/- 7% for the right (n = 67), 91 +/- 6% for the left anterior descending (n = 79) and 91 +/- 6% for the left circumflex (n = 38) coronary arteries. Plaque rupture in fatal acute myocardial infarction occurs at sites of severe narrowing (mean 91%, range 67% to 99%). Thus, plaque rupture with thrombosis is unlikely to cause the fatal acute myocardial infarction in patients with mild to moderate coronary stenosis. 
1	Quantitative analysis of antibody localization in human metastatic colon cancer: a phase I study of monoclonal antibody A33. A33 is a mouse immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that detects a heat-stable, protease- and neuraminidase-resistant epitope. The antigen is homogeneously expressed by virtually all colon cancers and in the colon mucosa but not other epithelial tissues. The biodistribution and imaging characteristics of iodine-131 (131I)-mAbA33 were studied in colorectal carcinoma patients with hepatic metastases. Antibody labeled with 2 to 5 mCi of 131I was administered intravenously (IV) 7 to 8 days before surgery at five dose levels, ranging from 0.2 mg to 50 mg, with three or more patients entered at each dose level. In addition, three patients received 2 mg 131I-mAbTA99 (an isotype-matched control mAb) together with 125I-mAbA33. Evaluation included whole-body imaging with a gamma camera, technetium-99 (99mTc)-human serum albumin blood pool scans, liver/spleen scans, abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scans, hepatic arteriograms, antibody pharmacokinetics, and assessment of antibody distribution in biopsied malignant and normal tissues. Selective mAbA33 localization to tumor tissue was demonstrated in 19 of 20 patients, and external imaging correlated with surgical inspection, pathologic examination, and tissue radioactivity. One week after antibody administration, tumor:liver ratios ranged from 6.9:1 to 100:1 and tumor:serum ratios from 4.1:1 to 25.2:1. 99mTc-albumin blood pool studies showed that liver metastases were hypovascular, emphasizing the selective localization of mAbA33 despite poor tumor-blood flow. Control mAbTA99 studies showed mAbA33 localization was antigen-specific; tumor:liver ratios were 2.3- to 45-fold higher for specific antibody. In metastatic lesions, radioisotope was localized primarily in the viable periphery; however, even the necrotic tumor core concentrated specific antibody. External imaging showed isotope visualization in some patients' large bowel; whether this represents specific antibody uptake or gastric iodine secretion is unclear. 
1	Flow cytometric determination of breast tumor heterogeneity. Flow cytometric analysis was done on the DNA content of nuclei obtained from different sites of small breast tumors. Although specimens for analysis were obtained within a few millimeters of each other, dramatic differences were occasionally observed in the DNA histograms. In a limited study involving 141 consecutive breast specimens submitted for flow cytometry, 52% (74) were found to have at least one DNA aneuploid population. In 18% of DNA aneuploid tumors, one or more specimens from areas grossly identified as tumor had no DNA aneuploid population. Because of the proposed correlation of aneuploidy with a poorer prognosis and possible responsiveness to chemotherapy, multiple sites should be assayed when flow cytometric DNA analysis is done. 
5	Pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema following the measurement of maximal expiratory pressure in a normal subject. Mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema have been reported as a consequence of deliberate manipulations of the breathing pattern producing a Valsalva-like maneuver in healthy subjects. We present a case of pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema occurring in a normal volunteer after repeated measurements of the PEmax. 
5	Predicting failure following shunting of pleural effusions. We placed 43 shunts in 34 patients in five years. Twenty-four had malignant effusions and ten had benign effusions. Thirty-one patients had unilateral shunts, three had bilateral shunts and six required revisions for shunt failure. Two patients died after shunt placement from disease progression. Of the nine patients who experienced poor results, one was noncompliant in operating the shunt and eight had occluded shunts. In the 30 patients, who were compliant and had adequate length of follow-up, five had excellent results, 12 had good results, and five had fair results. Two of the patients with occluded shunts had good results after shunt revision; 24 patients had some symptomatic relief with shunting. Evaluation of factors including a history of prior abdominal surgery, performance status, and pleural fluid cell counts, differential, chemistries, and cytology revealed no significant differences between the patients who experienced shunt failure and those who had patent shunts. Shunting of pleural effusions is well tolerated and has good success rates in properly selected patients. 
2	Role of epidermal growth factor, prostaglandin, and sulfhydryls in stress-induced gastric lesions. Epidermal growth factor promotes the growth of and protects gastric mucosa against various ulcerogens, including stress, but little is known about its role in the pathogenesis of stress ulcerations. In this study, Wistar rats with intact and resected salivary glands were exposed to water-immersion and restraint stress. During 2-14 hours of water-immersion restraint stress, the formation of gastric ulcerations increased progressively and the duration of stress was accompanied by a decrease in DNA synthesis in the gastric mucosa. Following sialoadenectomy, a significant increase in the number of stress ulcerations and further reduction in DNA synthesis were observed. Exogenous epidermal growth factor and dimethyl prostaglandin E2 significantly reduced the ulcerations in the stressed rats with intact salivary glands, but this reduction was significantly less pronounced after sialoadenectomy. Water-immersion restraint stress also resulted in about 50% reduction in mucosal prostaglandin E2 generation, and the pretreatment with indomethacin, which suppressed prostaglandin E2 by about 90%, almost doubled the number of stress ulcerations and abolished the gastro-protective effect of exogenous epidermal growth factor (but not dimethyl prostaglandin E2) against the stress lesions. An inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase activity by difluoromethyl ornithine also augmented stress-induced ulcerogenesis and abolished the protective action of epidermal growth factor while the administration of spermine almost completely prevented stress ulcerations in rats both without and with pretreatment with difluoromethylornithine. Water-immersion restraint stress also significantly reduced mucosal content of glutathione. Cysteamine increased tissue glutathione and reduced stress ulcerations but N-ethylmaleimide, an sulfhydryl blocker, decreased mucosal content of glutathione without affecting the stress ulcerations. This study indicates that the stress ulcers are accompanied by the reduction in mucosal synthesis of DNA, prostaglandin, and glutathione and that the presence of salivary glands attenuates the stress ulcerogenesis probably by releasing epidermal growth factor which acts, in part, by enhancing ornithine decarboxylase activity, mucosal growth, and prostaglandin and glutathione formation. 
5	11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency in hyperandrogenism. OBJECTIVE: to determine the 11-deoxycortisol (S) response and incidence of 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency in hyperandrogenism. DESIGN: Hyperandrogenic women prospectively and consecutively underwent acute adrenal stimulation studies. SETTING: Tertiary institution. PATIENTS: Two hundred sixty women complaining of hirsutism and/or hyperandrogenic oligomenorrhea were studied, excluding five unrelated families (1.9% of total) suffering from 21-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. Forty-one healthy premenopausal eumenorrheic women served as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Only two unrelated women (0.8%) had a poststimulation or net increment S level value greater than or equal to threefold the upper 95th percentile of controls and were presumed to suffer from 11 beta-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. One hundred nine (42%) of hyperandrogenic women had at least one S value above the 95th percentile of controls. These women also demonstrated higher basal (F0) and stimulated cortisol levels, but a similar increment compared with controls. RESULTS: Patients with high S measures had higher testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and androstenedione levels, but similar luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone ratios, than hyperandrogenic cohorts with no abnormal S measures. Basal values of S (S0), F0, or S0/F0 were not useful to predict an abnormal S response to stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Although adrenocortical hyperactivity was present in 42% of our hyperandrogenic patients, only 0.8% were presumed to suffer from 11 beta-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. A systemic search for this deficiency in hyperandrogenism is probably unwarranted. 
3	The association of hydrocephalus with intramedullary spinal cord tumors: a series of 25 patients. 171 patients with intramedullary spinal cord tumors were operated on, of which 25 patients (15%), mostly children, developed symptomatic hydrocephalus. Twenty patients (12%) had malignant tumors, with 13 of the 20 cases (63%) complicated by increased intracranial pressure and ventriculomegaly. Of the remaining 151 patients with benign tumors (89%), only 12 (8%) developed symptomatic hydrocephalus. In an effort to understand the relationship between hydrocephalus and intramedullary spinal cord tumor, the authors analyze the level and histology of the neoplasm, as well as its association with spinal cysts. A review of the neurosurgical literature reveals that 34 similar cases of hydrocephalus associated with intramedullary spinal cord tumors have been reported to date. The authors note that the presence of hydrocephalus in patients with malignant intramedullary astrocytomas is associated with a shorter rate of survival than in those patients with high-grade lesions but without hydrocephalus, apparently due to rapid tumor progression. The ventriculomegaly seen with benign spinal cord gliomas has no statistically significant effect upon long-term prognosis. 
5	Uterine rupture. Uterine rupture is a sudden, unforeseeable event that carries a high rate of maternal and perinatal mortality. When the diagnosis of uterine rupture is suspected, prompt surgical intervention with an experienced pelvic surgeon and blood product replacement should be considered. At the time of uterine rupture, the patient should be evaluated for possible repair or hysterectomy. It appears, based on the aforementioned information, that repair is a reasonable consideration. In those patients who have undergone a repair, early delivery by elective cesarean after assessment of fetal lung maturity at or around 36 weeks gestation would appear prudent. In those patients with a prior cesarean, continuous electronic fetal monitoring to detect intrapartum fetal distress would appear prudent. In these patients fetal distress is the most common sign or symptom of uterine rupture and frequently precedes any other clinical manifestations of this complication. 
1	A randomized trial of the effect of three non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents in ameliorating cancer-induced fever. Paraneoplastic fever is well known, and is not an uncommon problem in daily practice. In an effort to ameliorate tumour-induced fever we randomized 48 patients to receive three different non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs: Naproxen (500 mg d-1), Indomethacin (75 mg d-1) or Diclophenac sodium (75 mg d-1). All patients had solid tumours, and microbial infection had been excluded. All three drugs were equally effective in bringing the temperature down to normal for a period of 30-33 d. Naproxen had the most rapid effect. In cases of fever relapse with the first drug, when the other two drugs were given instead, both proved equally effective. No side-effects were observed. We conclude that Naproxen, Indomethacin and Diclophenac sodium are equally effective in ameliorating paraneoplastic fever. In relapse, a second drug given subsequently can be effective as well. 
1	Hyperplastic polyps seen at sigmoidoscopy are markers for additional adenomas seen at colonoscopy. Asymptomatic individuals undergoing screening flexible sigmoidoscopy were prospectively studied. Polyps were found in 185 subjects. The endoscopist recorded an opinion on the polyps' histology based on endoscopic appearance. No polyps were removed at sigmoidoscopy. All subjects with rectosigmoid polyps then underwent colonoscopy and polypectomy. Of them, 99 subjects (54%) had at least one rectosigmoid adenoma, 69 (37%) had only hyperplastic polyps, and 17 (9%) had other findings. The endoscopists' opinion of the histopathology of polyps at sigmoidoscopy was correct for 61% of the lesions. Of subjects with adenomatous rectosigmoid polyps, 29% had additional adenomas at more proximal sites. Proximal adenomas were found in 28% of patients with hyperplastic rectosigmoid polyps. Patients with rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps had the same risk for additional proximal adenomas as patients with rectosigmoid adenomatous polyps. 
5	Multiple cranial nerve deficits after ethylene glycol poisoning. We report the cases of two patients who developed cranial nerve palsies after drinking ethylene glycol. A 33-year-old man developed multiple cranial nerve deficits nine days after the ingestion of ethylene glycol in a suicide attempt. Clinical findings included profound bilateral cranial nerve VII palsies and severe dysfunction of cranial nerves IX and X. The neuropathy occurred despite treatment with hemodialysis. The dysphagia completely cleared within two weeks, but at six months a severe bilateral cranial nerve VII dysfunction persisted. A 22-year-old man undergoing hemodialysis for ethylene glycol-induced renal failure developed bilateral cranial nerve VII dysfunction 14 days after ingestion. At a three-month follow-up, the patient demonstrated only moderate functional recovery. The etiology of the cranial nerve deficits is unknown but may be related to oxalate crystal deposition of ethylene glycol-induced pyridoxine dysfunction. 
4	Wegener's granulomatosis presenting as temporal arteritis. A granulomatous giant cell vasculitis of the temporal artery was observed in a biopsy specimen from a patient with corresponding clinical symptoms. Within weeks, the new onset of pulmonary infiltrates and renal failure prompted biopsy of the patient's kidney. A necrotizing glomerulonephritis, compatible with a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, was present. Vasculitis of the temporal artery may be a feature of Wegener's granulomatosis. 
4	Beneficial effects of colestipol-niacin on coronary atherosclerosis. A 4-year follow-up. The Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial testing combined colestipol-niacin therapy in 162 subjects. Two-year results (CLAS-I) showed decreased atherosclerosis progression and increased regression. We now describe a subgroup of 103 subjects treated for 4 years (CLAS-II). Changes in blood lipid, lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein levels were maintained, and at 4 years significantly more drug-treated subjects demonstrated nonprogression (52% drug- vs 15% placebo-treated) and regression (18% drug- vs 6% placebo-treated) in native coronary artery lesions. Significantly fewer drug-treated subjects developed new lesions in native coronary arteries (14% drug- vs 40% placebo-treated) and bypass grafts (16% drug- vs 38% placebo-treated). These results confirm CLAS-I findings and indicate that regression can continue for 4 years. They reaffirm the need for early initiation of vigorous long-term lipid lowering therapy in coronary bypass subjects. 
5	Expression of a soluble and functional form of the human beta 2 integrin CD11b/CD18. Polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes (phagocytes) are a critical component of host defense against infections. However, these cells also play a significant role in host tissue damage in many noninfectious diseases, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury syndromes and rejection of transplanted organs. The leukocyte adhesion molecule family CD11/CD18 (beta 2 integrins) is critical to the function of polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes in inflammation and injury. Inherited deficiency of CD11/CD18 impairs phagocyte chemotaxis, adhesion and transmigration across endothelium, and clearance of invading microorganisms through phagocytosis and cell-mediated killing. Furthermore, murine monoclonal antibodies directed against the CD11b/CD18 (CR3) heterodimer have been shown to reduce, by 50%-80%, phagocyte-mediated ischemia-reperfusion injury in several organ systems, such as the myocardium, liver, and gastrointestinal tract and to inhibit development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Expression of CD11b/CD18 in a soluble and functional form might therefore be potentially useful as an anti-inflammatory agent. We have now expressed a recombinant soluble heterodimeric form of this human beta 2 integrin, normally expressed as two noncovalently associated membrane-bound subunits. The secreted receptor exhibited direct and specific binding to its ligand, iC3b, the major complement C3 opsonin, and inhibited binding of polymorphonuclear cells to recombinant interleukin 1-activated endothelium. 
2	Azathioprine in the treatment of children with inflammatory bowel disease. During a 6-year period, we treated 21 patients with azathioprine, 2 mg/kg/day, as an adjunct to their customary regimen. Nine patients had ulcerative colitis and 12 patients had Crohn disease; the patients' ages ranged from 3 to 17 years. The median duration of disease before the start of azathioprine therapy was 2 years, and median follow-up was 2 years. Sixteen patients seemed to respond to azathioprine therapy: six patients in each disease group had complete responses and four patients (one with ulcerative colitis and three with Crohn disease) had partial responses. Two patients with ulcerative colitis and three patients with Crohn disease did not respond. The median time until patients responded was less than 3 months for patients with ulcerative colitis and 4 months for those with Crohn disease. Reduction of corticosteroid dose was possible for all patients who responded to azathioprine therapy. Only minimal side effects were attributable to the drug. We conclude that azathioprine is an effective adjunctive agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in childhood, but because questions remain regarding its long-term safety, its use should be reserved for children with refractory disease or severe and unacceptable side effects of corticosteroids. 
3	Diffuse axonal injury: analysis of 100 patients with radiological signs. One hundred patients with head injuries who showed diffuse axonal injury on computed tomographic scans are reported. Evaluation of the Glasgow Coma Score, pupillary signs, and computed tomographic findings on admission led to an improved ability to forecast outcomes. Our relatively good results as compared with other series, can be explained by the high proportion of children and by the liberal use of computed tomography to evaluate head injuries, thus revealing that concussion may sometimes be regarded as an early form of diffuse axonal injury. 
5	Factor XIII deficiency and intracranial hemorrhages in infancy. We report an infant with Factor XIII deficiency who had 2 seemingly spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages. It is important to consider Factor XIII deficiency as a possible cause of unexplained intracranial hemorrhages in infancy. Ongoing factor replacement therapy is recommended to prevent further bleeding episodes. 
5	Management of infants at risk for occult bacteremia: a decision analysis. Because febrile infants with no obvious source of bacterial infection may have bacteremia, and because bacteremia is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds, we used decision analysis to evaluate whether such infants should be treated with antibiotics, tested further, or sent home. Using a simple decision tree, we found that the decision to give empiric antibiotic treatment is the decision of choice. The difference in quality-adjusted life expectancy between the "best" and "worst" decisions was only 11 days. However, this difference translated to prevention of death or permanent disability in 60 cases per 100,000 febrile children. Further, empiric treatment remained the best management alternative unless the probability of bacteremia was less than 1.4% (less than any published prevalence), or the efficacy of treatment was less than 21%. Our analysis demonstrated that a test with far greater sensitivity than leukocyte count or other tests currently in use is needed to justify testing rather than treating empirically. Further, an enormous patient population would be needed to find a difference of both clinical and statistical significance between treated and untreated patients in a controlled trial. In the absence of such trials, we recommend blood culture and empiric antibiotic treatment of all infants at risk for occult bacteremia. 
5	Anatomical relationship between the renal venous arrangement and the kidney collecting system. The anatomical relationships between the renal venous arrangement and the pelviocaliceal system were studied in 52, 3-dimensional polyester resin corrosion endocasts. In 53.8% of the cases, there were 3 large venous trunks and in 28.8% there were 2 venous trunks joining to form the main renal vein. Intrarenal veins demonstrated free anastomoses that were disposed in 3 systems of longitudinal arcades (stellate, arcuate and interlobar veins). There were large venous collars around caliceal necks and also horizontal arches crossing over calices to link anterior and posterior veins. In 84.6% of the cases the upper caliceal group was encircled anteriorly and posteriorly by venous plexuses, which coursed parallel to the infundibulum. In 50.0% of the cases the lower caliceal group also was enriched by 2 venous plexuses. A close relationship existed between a large inferior tributary of the renal vein and the anterior aspect of the ureteropelvic junction in 40.4% of the cases. In 69.2% of the cases there was a posterior (retropelvic) vein: in 48.1% this vein had a close relationship to the junction of the pelvis with the upper calix and in 21.1% it crossed the middle posterior surface of the renal pelvis. 
4	Transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of ostial left coronary artery stenosis. The diagnosis of ostial stenosis of the left main coronary artery is usually made by use of coronary angiography. However, positioning of the catheter across the obstruction may obscure this diagnosis during contrast injection. Although a damping of arterial pressure when the catheter enters the left coronary artery may suggest ostial stenosis, it may not be possible to make this diagnosis with certainty during cardiac catheterization. We report a series of four patients in whom the left coronary ostium and proximal left coronary arteries were visualized by means of transesophageal echocardiography. Both ostial narrowing by plaque and abnormally fast flow velocities were seen. In each case the echocardiographic findings contributed to the subsequent management of the patients. 
1	Primary lymphoma of bone: a clinicopathologic study of 25 cases reported over 10 years. Twenty-five cases of primary lymphoma of bone (PLB) reported over a 10-year period were reviewed. The presenting symptom was related to involvement of a single bone with or without regional nodal disease. None showed dissemination of lymphoma in the subsequent six months. Patients affected were 7-65 years of age. An equal predilection for the axial and appendicular skeleton was noted. Histologically, the commonest subtype was diffuse histiocytic lymphoma (DHL, 17 cases), whereas four were poorly differentiated lymphocytic (PDL) type and another four were unclassifiable. Follow-up was available in 18 out of 25 patients for periods ranging from 7 months to 8 years. On clinicopathologic correlation we found that 75% of disease-free patients had a DHL whereas 60% of those alive with disease had a PDL. This study reiterates the view that PLB has a good prognosis and the DHL subtype is especially amenable to complete eradication. 
5	Emerging techniques in the diagnosis of sinusitis. In recent years, the high prevalence of chronic sinusitis has been noted in isolation and in association with bronchial asthma, aspirin sensitivity, and perennial rhinitis. Many sinus-associated symptoms arise from nasal rather than sinus pathology; thus, it is important to detect the presence, extent, and nature of any disease within the sinus cavities. Conventional plain radiographs have limited sensitivity and have been supplanted by more widespread use of computerized tomography. The role of other modalities such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging has not yet been completely determined. Other tests such as cytology and endoscopy can detect the presence of infection without the need for invasive antral puncture. Practitioners should consider the impact of a negative imaging test on their therapeutic plan and order tests on that basis. 
1	Brake mechanics, asbestos, and disease risk. Health risks posed by inhalable asbestos fibers are known to exist in a variety of industrial and nonindustrial settings. Although early studies described an increased risk of asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma in asbestos-industry workers, subsequent research revealed the existence of a potential asbestos-related health hazard in nonasbestos industries such as the textile and railroad industries. Brake mechanics and garage workers constitute a large work force with potential exposures to levels of asbestos capable of producing disease. Unfortunately, the health risk faced by these workers has received little attention. This article briefly discusses currently available information on the asbestos health risks of workers in this setting, and highlights the need for further investigations of this occupational group. 
2	Microsurgical epididymovasostomy by tubule intussusception: a new technique in rat model. This experimental study on 15 adult male rats with bilateral epididymovasostomies evaluates a new technique of tubule intussusception as an improved form of end-to-end anastomosis. This paper describes in detail the steps in this technique and offers physiological, anatomical, and histological follow-up after 3 months. With this technique there is a 97% patency rate and a 23.3% incidence of macroscopic spermatic granuloma. Complications are discussed in detail. 
1	Preoperative cytology and mammography in patients with single-duct nipple discharge treated by surgery. Microdochectomy has been the routine management for single-duct nipple discharge. Our review of 176 consecutive patients surgically treated between 1975 and 1988 revealed eight patients with in situ carcinomas and seven with infiltrative carcinomas. Seventeen patients had multiple papillomas, two had atypical hyperplasia and two had atypical epitheliosis. Case selection for surgery has recently been advocated. In our study, nipple discharge cytology was helpful in 67 per cent of cases with underlying malignant pathology. Mammography was found to be unreliable, alerting suspicion in only two of 15 cases. 
4	Transient mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve prolapse accompanied by systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. A grade 4/6 systolic murmur, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM), and severe mitral regurgitation (MR) documented by two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography developed suddenly on the structurally normal heart of a patient with idiopathic portal hypertension. The patient did not have signs of congestive heart failure and the aforementioned phenomenon disappeared completely when the patient was in hepatic failure. This could be explained by a change in circulating blood volume either by gastrointestinal hemorrhage or hepatic failure. 
5	Frontal dysfunction and memory deficits in the alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome and Alzheimer-type dementia. This study investigated the intercorrelation of 8 'frontal' tests in 32 patients with Korsakoff's syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, and examined the relationship of frontal dysfunction to impaired release from proactive interference and impoverished retrieval from retrograde memory. Amongst the frontal tests, there were statistically significant intercorrelations between 3 'fluency' tests and 3 'card-sorting' tests, although the degree of shared variance was relatively low. The relationship of another test--picture arrangement errors--was more equivocal; performance for 'cognitive estimates' was unrelated to performance in the other frontal tests, possibly because it may reflect pathology at a different frontal site. There was no evidence in this study that variability in release from proactive interference was related to measures of frontal function in either patient group, and the conditions under which these patient groups fail to show 'normal' release appear to be tightly constrained. On the other hand, the defective retrieval of retrograde memories was correlated with frontal dysfunction in both patient groups. There was a suggestion of a double dissociation with a measure of nonverbal short-term forgetting, impairment at which was related to the degree of general cortical atrophy rather than frontal dysfunction. A stepwise regression equation based on 3 frontal tests could account for 64% of the variability in retrograde memory performance within the total patient group, 68.5% in the Korsakoff group and 57% in the Alzheimer group. By comparison, the severity of anterograde memory impairment predicted only 21% of the variance in retrograde memory performance. It is concluded that frontal dysfunction produces a disorganization of retrieval processes which contributes to the temporally-extensive retrograde amnesia of these two disorders. 
5	Glycolysis as primary energy source in tumor cell chemotaxis. The energy requirements via glycolytic pathways were directly measured in migrating tumor cells. Motility in the metastatic human melanoma cell line A2058, stimulated by insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I), depends on glycolysis in the presence of glucose as its principal source of energy. Motility in glucose-free medium was 75% reduced and utilized mitochondrial respiration (inhibited by oligomycin). With increasing (physiologic) glucose concentrations, there was a dramatic shift to anaerobic glycolysis as the energy source and 93% elimination of the oligomycin inhibition of motility. Oxamate, an inhibitor of glycolysis, inhibited motility at all glucose concentrations. CO2 production from glycolysis and from the hexose monophosphate shunt was measured in migrating tumor cells. The time course and glucose-dose dependence of glycolytic CO2 production correlated directly with motility. In contrast, mitochondrial CO2 production was inversely related to glucose concentration. A monoclonal antibody for the IGF-I receptor inhibited both motility and glycolytic CO2 production, indicating that both processes are receptor mediated. 
4	Occult cancer in patients with deep venous thrombosis. A systematic approach. The authors prospectively studied 113 consecutive patients with deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities to determine the most appropriate workup study for searching for a hidden cancer. After a careful physical examination, the following routine tests were performed: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), whole blood counts, biochemistry, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, chest radiograph, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan. If a malignant lesion was suspected, further appropriate studies were performed. After discharge, periodic follow-up was performed on all patients in the outpatient clinic. A malignant neoplasm was detected in 12 patients. Of these 12 patients, six were asymptomatic with the exception of experiencing thrombophlebitis. Cancer was found more commonly in patients with idiopathic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (7 of 31 versus 5 of 82 patients with secondary DVT; P = 0.012), and in those patients with abnormal lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (6 of 23 versus 6 of 90; P = 0.007). Abnormal CEA levels allowed diagnosis of two cases of colonic cancer (on colonoscopy). Both ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen showed two cases of urinary bladder carcinoma at a very early stage. Furthermore, two cases of adenomatous polyps in colon were found, a condition considered by most authors to be a colorectal cancer precursor. In addition, there were five patients with large benign pelvic tumors, and two patients with absent inferior vena cava. The most striking finding was that some cases of cancer were at a very early stage. It was concluded that blood cell counts, LDH, CEA, chest radiograph, and abdominal ultrasonography (or CT scan) should be routinely performed on all patients with deep venous thrombosis (particularly those with idiopathic DVT). Malignancy would not have been recognized in some patients if these tests had not been performed. 
2	Factors affecting the enterohepatic circulation of oral contraceptive steroids. Oral contraceptive steroids may undergo enterohepatic circulation, but it is relevant for only estrogens, because these compounds can be directly conjugated in the liver. Animal studies show convincing evidence of the importance of the enterohepatic circulation, but studies in humans are much less convincing. The importance of the route and the rate of metabolism of ethinyl estradiol are reviewed. Some antibiotics have been reported anecdotally to reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptive steroids, but controlled studies have not confirmed this observation. Although gut flora are altered by oral antibiotics, the blood levels of ethinyl estradiol are not reduced, and one antibiotic at least (cotrimoxazole) enhances the activity of ethinyl estradiol. 
4	Toxic carbamazepine concentrations following cardiothoracic surgery and myocardial infarction. Carbamazepine is being used more frequently in the U.S. as an initial agent of choice to treat generalized tonic-clonic, mixed, and partial seizures with complex symptomatology. Carbamazepine is extensively metabolized in the liver; however, there is little information available on its pharmacokinetics in patients following surgery or myocardial infarction, or in those with liver disease. We report a case of a patient who attained toxic carbamazepine serum concentrations (ranging from 18.2 to 21.5 micrograms/mL) two days after cardiothoracic surgery and an intraoperative myocardial infarction, and experienced lethargy, diplopia, dysarthria, diaphoresis, and horizontal and downgaze nystagmus. These alterations in serum carbamazepine concentration normalized ten days after surgery. They may have been due to a combination of changes in protein binding and decreased elimination due to altered intrinsic hepatic clearance. With carbamazepine achieving a more prominent place in anticonvulsant therapy, the influence of various procedures and disease processes on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of carbamazepine, as well as the clinical consequences of such changes, need further investigation. 
4	Coronary trapping of a complement activation product (C3a des-Arg) during myocardial reperfusion in open-heart surgery. Accumulation of complement factors has been found to occur in the myocardium after infarction. We studied the possibility that the complement activation product C3a des-Arg is trapped within the coronary circulation during reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium. In 11 patients undergoing routine coronary artery bypass grafting, arterial blood was sampled before, during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Blood was drawn from the coronary sinus concomitantly with arterial blood sampling 5 and 30 min after release of the aortic cross-clamp (n = 10). From a preoperative value of 92 +/- 13 ng/ml, C3a des-Arg rose during CPB to a maximum of 1816 +/- 393 at the end of CPB. Following reperfusion for 5 min, C3a des-Arg was 1284 +/- 232 ng/ml in arterial and 1106 +/- 100 in coronary sinus blood, a significant difference (p less than 0.05). The amount of C3a des-Arg trapped in the heart at 5-min reperfusion showed positive correlation with its arterial concentration (p less than 0.05). No significant difference was found after 30 min of reperfusion. Complement activation products trapped in the heart in the early reperfusion period may play a pathogenetic role in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. 
5	Dermatology and the human gene map. Chromosomal localization has been established for many genetic traits. Gene mapping may lead to the identification of disease genes, an understanding of pathogenesis, and the development of rational therapy, as well as facilitating antenatal diagnosis and genetic counselling. 'The new genetics' is therefore of great interest to the clinician. Unfortunately the complex technology and unfamiliar vocabulary of molecular biology often deter non-specialists from keeping abreast of these developments. This account explains the principles of gene mapping, discusses its relevance to dermatologists, and lists the established loci of dermatologically important genes. 
2	Can the blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio distinguish upper from lower gastrointestinal bleeding? We wanted to know if the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratio could help distinguish upper from lower gastrointestinal bleeding. We analyzed retrospectively patients admitted to our hospital for gastrointestinal bleeding over the past 5 years. A total of 126 patients represented 74 upper bleeds and 52 lower bleeds. The mean BUN/Cr ratio was significantly higher in upper than lower bleeders, 34.8 and 17.8 respectively (p less than 0.001). No lower bleeder had a ratio of greater than or equal to 36, whereas 38% of upper bleeders had a ratio of greater than or equal to 36. The BUN/Cr ratio may be an easy, cheap method of distinguishing upper from lower gastrointestinal bleeding in some cases. A BUN/Cr ratio of greater than or equal to 36 suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas a ratio of less than 36 is not helpful in locating the source of bleeding. 
5	Genetics and psychiatry: an unheralded window on the environment. Two recent reviews in the American Journal of Psychiatry and the British Journal of Psychiatry reported on progress in understanding the genetics of psychiatric disorder. Both reviews focused on this progress as a prelude to psychiatric diagnostics and therapeutics based on molecular biology. Neither review recognized that the latest data in behavioral genetics support environmental causes for abnormal development and psychopathology as much as they support genetic causes. Moreover, these genetic data point clearly to a type of environmental cause with central importance: the environment that is specific or unique to each sibling in a family. 
3	Neuromuscular diseases: evaluation with high-frequency sonography. Forty-four patients with clinically suspected neuromuscular disease and 12 healthy volunteers underwent high-frequency ultrasound examination of the rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and biceps brachii muscles, and the number of perimysial septa was determined. These numbers and muscle/soft-tissue ratios of the lower extremity were compared. Findings were correlated with results of muscle biopsy in all patients with suspected disease. Using the number of perimysial septa in the lower extremity, the authors found significant differences between the muscles of healthy volunteers and those of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophies, other muscular dystrophies, and spinal muscular atrophies: The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that an average of 12 perimysial septa within 1 cm of muscle is the ideal cutoff value to differentiate subjects without morphologic changes from those with pathologic findings. The authors conclude that this measurement is useful for differentiation of neuromuscular diseases and may be a noninvasive, reproducible means with which to evaluate disease progression. 
1	Free radical-derived quinone methide mediates skin tumor promotion by butylated hydroxytoluene hydroperoxide: expanded role for electrophiles in multistage carcinogenesis. Free radical derivatives of peroxides, hydroperoxides, and anthrones are thought to mediate tumor promotion by these compounds. Further, the promoting activity of phorbol esters is attributed, in part, to their ability to stimulate the cellular generation of oxygen radicals. A hydroperoxide metabolite of butylated hydroxytoluene, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroperoxyl-4-methyl-2,5-cyclohexadienone (BHTOOH), has previously been shown to be a tumor promoter in mouse skin. BHTOOH is extensively metabolized by murine keratinocytes to several radical species. The primary radical generated from BHTOOH is a phenoxyl radical that can disproportionate to form butylated hydroxytoluene quinone methide, a reactive electrophile. Since electrophilic species have not been previously postulated to mediate tumor promotion, the present study was undertaken to examine the role of this electrophile in the promoting activity of BHTOOH. The biological activities of two chemical analogs of BHTOOH, 4-trideuteromethyl-BHTOOH and 4-tert-butyl-BHTOOH, were compared with that of the parent compound. 4-Trideuteromethyl-BHTOOH and 4-tert-butyl-BHTOOH have a reduced ability or inability, respectively, to form a quinone methide; however, like the parent compound, they both generate a phenoxyl radical when incubated with keratinocyte cytosol. The potency of BHTOOH, 4-trideuteromethyl-BHTOOH, and 4-tert-butyl-BHTOOH as inducers of ornithine decarboxylase, a marker of tumor promotion, was commensurate with their capacity for generating butylated hydroxytoluene quinone methide. These initial results were confirmed in a two-stage tumor promotion protocol in female SENCAR mice. Together, these data indicate that a quinone methide is mediating tumor promotion by BHTOOH, providing direct evidence that an electrophilic intermediate can elicit this stage of carcinogenesis. 
1	Multiple spinal metastases from paraganglioma. Isolated vertebral body metastases from paraganglioma are exceedingly rare. They have been reported to occur in the presence of active primary tumor in the neck, local recurrence, or widespread metastases. A unique case of carotid body tumor (paraganglioma) is reported with the following features: (1) multiple vertebral body metastases (C6, T9, and L3) presenting with spinal cord compression, and no evidence of local recurrence or other metastatic disease; (2) absence of mitoses on the original specimen or the metastatic deposit; and (3) a prolonged interval (9 years) to the development of symptomatic metastases. 
5	Oxygen-exacerbated bleomycin pulmonary toxicity Bleomycin is an antineoplastic agent with potential for producing pulmonary toxicity, attributed in part to its free radical-promoting ability. Clinical and research experiences have suggested that the risk of bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury is increased with the administration of oxygen. We report a case in which the intraoperative administration of oxygen in the setting of previous bleomycin therapy contributed to postoperative ventilatory failure. Our patient recovered with corticosteroid therapy. Physician awareness of a potential interaction between oxygen and bleomycin may help reduce the morbidity and mortality related to bleomycin therapy. 
4	Mild ischemia predisposes the S3 segment to gentamicin toxicity. The purpose of these studies was to determine if a functionally insignificant ischemic insult, occurring prior to gentamicin administration, enhanced gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Bilateral renal pedicle clamp studies demonstrated that 15 minutes of ischemia did not increase the plasma creatinine yet markedly enhanced gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Further studies, in uninephrectomized rats, demonstrated that following fifteen minutes of renal ischemia and four hours of reperfusion inulin clearance, FENa+ and cellular morphology were normal. This model, therefore, was used in all subsequent studies. While the plasma creatinine concentrations were normal 24 hours following 15 minutes of ischemia and only slightly increased following gentamicin administration (100 mg/kg, i.p.) gentamicin administered four hours following 15 minutes of renal ischemia resulted in significantly increased 24-hour plasma creatinine values. Light microscopic quantitation of tissue injury, performed 24 hours following experimental manipulation, was notable for S3 segment damage in the ischemia plus gentamicin group. This was not observed in either the ischemia group or the sham operated gentamicin group. Cortical gentamicin levels were elevated in the ischemia plus gentamicin group, despite similar plasma gentamicin half-lives. However, the elevation in cortical gentamicin levels was dissociated from the enhanced nephrotoxicity seen following mild ischemic injury. Taken together these data indicate that mild renal ischemia, occurring prior to gentamicin administration, greatly enhanced gentamicin nephrotoxicity with the greatest damage occurring to S3 cells. 
1	Null cell adenoma of the pituitary with features of plurihormonality and plurimorphous differentiation. The case of a 35-year-old man with pituitary macroadenoma who was complaining of reduced sexual activity is presented. Histologic examination showed a chromophobic adenoma corresponding mainly to a null cell adenoma at the ultrastructural level. Focal plurihormonality and plurimorphous differentiation of adenoma cells were demonstrated by immunohistochemical and electron-microscopic studies. It is suggested that adenomatous null cells represent pluripotent progenitor cells capable of transforming to different hormone-producing cell types. The factors accounting for differentiating to various cell populations have yet to be elucidated. 
1	Lack of relationship between perioperative blood transfusion and survival time after curative resection for gastric cancer. To better comprehend the relationship between perioperative blood transfusion and survival time after curative gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer, the authors reviewed retrospectively data on 568 patients treated in their clinics from 1965 to 1983. Of these 568, 195 (34.3%) required no blood transfusion and 373 (65.7%) required transfusions within the perioperative period. Univariate analysis indicated that the survival time of the transfusion recipients was significantly less than that of the patients who had no transfusions (P less than 0.01). In subgroups of the authors' patients stratified to adjust for stage of disease, there was, however, no significant difference between the survival rates. Subsequently, multivariate analysis, using the Cox regression analysis, which adjusted for sex, age, and other covariates, indicated that perioperative blood transfusion was not a useful factor for predicting survival time. Multivariate analysis suggested that tumor size (P less than 0.01), degree of invasion into the gastric wall (P less than 0.01) and status of lymph node metastasis (P less than 0.01) were the most important covariates after curative gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer. The authors' findings revealed the lack of any relationship between perioperative blood transfusion and survival time of patients who underwent curative resection for advanced gastric cancer. 
5	Endoscopic palliative intubation of the esophagus invaded by lung cancer. Thirty-two patients with esophageal involvement by lung cancer were managed by endoscopic intubation. In 22 patients with extrinsic esophageal strictures, the success rate of intubation was 91%, and 82% were discharged with their dysphagia relieved and esophageal patency restored. The mean survival rate was 4.4 months. In 10 patients with esophago-bronchial fistulas, 3 had the fistulous tract obliterated and lived a mean of 5 months. This low success rate of closing fistulas is due to failure to seal off the space between the stent and the fistula because of absence of tumor-associated stenosis. The overall morbidity rate was 28.1% (18.8% perforation, 6.3% hemorrhage, and 3.1% tracheal obstruction). The overall mortality rate was 18.8%. Although complications were more frequent than in primary esophageal tumors, endoscopic intubation was the only way to palliate this desperate condition and provided 66.6% of patients with relief of symptoms, nutritional improvement, and a mean survival time of 4.5 months. 
1	Fourth ventricular schwannoma. Case report. A schwannoma arising from the dorsum of the pontomedullary junction and presenting as an exophytic mass in the fourth ventricle is described. A ventricular schwannoma has not previously been reported in the literature. The presenting clinical and radiographic features and the pathology of this tumor are summarized, and an explanation is sought for its unusual location. 
5	Addition of clonidine enhances postoperative analgesia from epidural morphine: a double-blind study. This study was undertaken to evaluate the analgesic effect of the combination of epidural morphine and clonidine versus epidural morphine alone in patients with postoperative pain. A randomized double-blind design was used, and 91 patients scheduled for post-operative pain relief by epidural morphine were studied. Patients received either a continuous epidural infusion of morphine and clonidine (group 1; n = 45) or morphine alone (group 2; n = 46) over the 72 h after major abdominal surgery. In the first 24 h, the dose of morphine was 6 mg per 24 h; during the second 24 h, it was decreased to 4 mg per 24 h; and in the final 24 h, it was decreased to 2 mg per 24 h in both groups. Group 1 patients received clonidine (450 micrograms) during each 24-h period. Additional epidural bolus injections of 2 mg morphine and intravenous meperidine were given on demand. The pain score, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and relative forced vital capacity were measured at fixed times during the first 72 h after operation. Total consumption of analgesics and side effects were recorded. Although the total consumption of analgesics was significantly higher in group 2 (P less than 0.05), pain scores were lower in group 1 than group 2 during the entire observation period (P less than 0.05). Epidural clonidine produced a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in heart rate and blood pressure, whereas the respiratory rate was not affected. Due to the better pain relief in group 1, the forced vital capacity was increased (P less than 0.05). 
1	Comparative epidemiology of cancer between the United States and Japan. A second look. Vital statistics were examined for the years 1955 through 1985 for Japanese natives and United States whites to elucidate changes in cancer mortality and related antecedent patterns of life-style in these two populations. Results show that lung cancer rates are rapidly accelerating among Japanese males as a consequence of their prior history of heavy cigarette smoking. Oropharyngeal cancer rates are also rising in Japan paralleling increases in alcohol and tobacco utilization. As the Japanese life-style and diet continue to become more "westernized," the rates of malignancies of the breast, ovary, corpus uteri, prostate, pancreas, and colon also continue to rise. Nevertheless, the mortality patterns of certain malignancies, viz., laryngeal, esophageal, and urinary bladder cancer, are discrepant with their established risk factor associations, suggesting the existence of other differences in risk factor exposure between the two countries. Epidemiologists and health educators need to develop innovative international programs of investigation and health promotion with preventive impact on common malignancies associated with risk factors of life-style. 
5	Procainamide-induced respiratory insufficiency after cardiopulmonary bypass. A 46-year-old man could not be weaned from ventilatory support while receiving procainamide. When the drug was discontinued, the patient was successfully weaned shortly thereafter. 
4	Stroke in systemic lupus erythematosus [published erratum appears in Stroke 1991 Mar;22(3):417] We investigated the clinical and pathologic characteristics of stroke in 234 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Thirteen patients (5.6%) developed cerebrovascular disease. Cerebral infarction was noted in eight, cerebral hemorrhage in two, and subarachnoid hemorrhage in three. In seven (54%) of these 13 patients, stroke occurred less than or equal to 5 years after systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed. Among the predisposing risk factors for stroke, hypertension was the most important. Lupus anticoagulant was detected in three (38%) and anticardiolipin antibody in three (43% of seven investigated) of the patients with infarction. Evaluation of the clinical manifestations and autoantibodies indicated that renal involvement and high titers of anti-deoxyribonucleic acid antibody were more frequent in the stroke group than in the non-stroke group. Autopsy studies on six of the patients with stroke revealed small infarcts and hemorrhages in all, but in no case was true angiitis observed. Libman-Sacks endocarditis was found in two of the three patients with infarction. In conclusion, the important contributory factor to the development of stroke in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is considered to be hypertension mediated by immunologic abnormalities. Antiphospholipid antibodies and Libman-Sacks endocarditis are closely associated with occlusive cerebrovascular disease. 
5	Stapling or suturing for anastomoses of the left side of the large intestine. Two hundred and fifty patients undergoing elective surgical treatment involving anastomoses of the left side of the colon or colon and rectum have been studied in a randomized trial in which the EEA (U. S. Surgical Corp.) circular stapler has been compared with single layer sutured anastomoses. Only patients in whom either technique was feasible were included in the analysis. The operative techniques were largely standardized. Patients were studied by means of a limited barium enema on the ninth or tenth postoperative day. The data have been analyzed for leakage rate (clinical and roentgenologic), other complications and degree of experience of the surgeon. Eleven patients were excluded from the analysis because the selected technique could not be carried out; of these, eight were in the stapled group in which it was possible to perform a sutured anastomosis. There were no instances in which it was possible to staple but not possible to suture. The remaining three exclusions were patients in whom either a coloanal anastomosis or a Hartmann procedure was performed. There was no over-all difference in the leakage rate--roentgenologic, clinical or total--between the two groups. However, when analyzed by the surgeon, the clinical leakage rate for surgeons in training was greater for sutured anastomoses than for stapled anastomoses (p = 0.053). Thus, it appears that the benefits of experience are more pronounced for sutured anastomoses but that, in experienced hands, neither technique is superior. 
4	Intraoperative assessment of cerebral ischemia during carotid surgery. One of the problems in carotid surgery is the intraoperative detection of brain ischemia. None of the methods (EEG; stump pressure) applied so far have been successful. Branston et al. (1974) found a threshold relationship between cortical cerebral blood flow and cortical somatosensory evoked potential (SEP). As the local blood flow fell below about 16 ml/100 g/min a progressive reduction occurred in the amplitude of the cortical evoked potential (N20/P25), implying a fundamental failure of neuronal function in the somatosensory cortex. We have monitored cortical SEP (somatosensory evoked potential) during 734 CEA's (carotid endarterectomies) in order to find an index of risk of incipient cerebral ischemia during carotid cross-clamping, to determine the need for shunting and the causes of early irreversible neurologic deficits. In 59 cases evaluation of SEP was not possible because of technical difficulties. During 586 CEA's no alteration of SEP occurred. However, 4 patients had an immediate postoperative neurologic deficit, while the SEP remained normal. Abnormal SEP occurred in 89 cases and in 6 of these an irreversible loss of SEP was seen. These patients awoke with a new neurologic deficit. We found a reversible abnormal SEP in 83 cases. Reversible changes of SEP occurred mainly during carotid clamping. The diagnostic sensitivity of intraoperative SEP monitoring in predicting neurologic outcome was 60% with a specificity of 100%. 
5	Life-threatening hemorrhage after placement of an endosseous implant: report of case This article reports an unusual but dangerous complication of implant surgery. Minimal perforations of the lingual plate and inferior border of the mandible had been considered previously to be benign occurrences. This report demonstrates the importance of managing acute airway problems resulting from perforations. 
3	Semantic deterioration in Alzheimer's: the patterns to expect. Differentiating language changes between the normal aged and those in the early stages of dementia is never simple. Knowing the differences and what to expect can aid in making this diagnosis. 
1	Selective hypersensitivity to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor by juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia hematopoietic progenitors. Juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) is a good model for the study of myeloproliferation because JCML hematopoietic progenitor cells grow in vitro at very low cell densities without the addition of exogenous stimulus. Previous studies have demonstrated that this proliferation is dependent on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and that removal of monocytes from the cell population before culture eliminates this "spontaneous" myeloproliferation, suggesting a paracrine role of monocyte stimulation. However, subsequent studies have shown that increased GM-CSF production from the JCML monocytes is not a consistent finding and therefore not a plausible sole mechanism. In examining hematopoietic growth factor dose-response curves, both JCML GM and erythroid nonadherent progenitor cell populations displayed a marked and selective hypersensitivity to GM-CSF. Responses to interleukin-3 and G-CSF were identical to control dose-response curves. This is the first demonstration of a myeloid leukemia in which hypersensitivity to a specific growth factor appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. 
5	Pediatric HIV disease. The newest chronic illness of childhood. HIV disease has emerged as a major chronic illness of childhood. Children with HIV infection and children with other chronic health impairments have much in common, including the need for comprehensive, multidisciplinary, coordinated care that includes special attention to the psychosocial effects on the child and family. However, because the mother and often the father and siblings share this lethal viral infection, the impact of HIV disease upon the family surpasses that of virtually all other chronic conditions. This is compounded by the association of the disease with drug use, its preponderance among the most disenfranchised populations in the United States, and the persistent public fear and discrimination surrounding AIDS. We have made substantial progress already in the medical management of this infection, and while we await the development of more effective therapies, we already have the tools and knowledge in hand to help these families. 
4	Esophageal contribution to chest pain in patients with coronary artery disease. We conducted a prospective study to determine the role of the esophagus in causing chest pain in patients with established CAD on optimum therapy. Thirty-two men with documented CAD who complained of frequent and usually daily retrosternal chest pain were evaluated. Following a standard esophageal manometry and acid perfusion test, simultaneous two-channel ambulatory Holter monitor and esophageal pH record tests were performed for 24 hours. Fifty-three episodes of chest pain were documented in 20 patients; 11 patients were free of pain. Of the 20 patients who complained of chest pains, 17 (85 percent) demonstrated at least one episode of PPR, defined as a drop in distal esophageal pH to less than 4 within ten minutes before or after the onset chest pain. Episodes of asymptomatic GER were common. The correlation of PPR with chest pain was 70 percent (37/53 episodes) and of ischemic ECG changes with chest pain 13 percent (7/53); in the remaining, there was no correlation with either. Two patients demonstrated simultaneous PPR and ischemic ECG changes. Seventeen esophageal motility abnormalities were observed in 14 patients (45 percent). It is our conclusion that esophageal disorders contribute to chest pain in patients with documented CAD. In this group, GER plays a greater role than in those with normal coronary arteries. In addition, esophageal motility disorders are common in these patients. Esophageal testing can be undertaken safely in these patients. 
4	Multivessel coronary angioplasty from 1980 to 1989: procedural results and long-term outcome From June 1980 to January 1989, 3,186 patients had coronary angioplasty of two (2,399 patients) or three (787 patients) of the three major epicardial coronary systems. A mean of 3.6 lesions (range 2 to 14) were dilated per patient, with a 96% success rate. Acute complications were seen in 94 patients (2.9%) and included Q wave infarction in 47 (1.4%), urgent coronary artery bypass surgery in 33 (1%) and death in 31 (1%). Multivariate correlates of in-hospital death included impaired left ventricular function, age greater than or equal to 70 years and female gender. Complete long-term follow-up data were available for the first 700 patients and the follow-up period averaged 54 +/- 15 months in duration. Actuarial 1 and 5 year survival rates were 97% and 88%, respectively, and were not different in patients with two or three vessel disease. By Cox regression analysis, age greater than or equal to 70 years, left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% and prior coronary artery bypass surgery were associated with an increased mortality rate during the follow-up period. Repeat revascularization procedures were required in 322 patients (46%). Restenosis resulted in either repeat angioplasty or bypass surgery in 227 patients (32%). Repeat coronary angioplasty was performed for isolated restenosis in 126 patients (18%), for restenosis and disease progression at new sites in 85 patients (12%) and for new disease progression alone in 54 patients (8%). Coronary bypass surgery was required in 110 patients (16%) during the follow-up period. 
4	Cardiovascular effects of the somatostatin analog octreotide in acromegaly. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cardiovascular effects of the somatostatin analog octreotide in patients with acromegaly. DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized study. SETTING: Referral-based endocrinology clinic. PATIENTS: Seven patients with active acromegaly, three of whom had refractory congestive heart failure. The other four patients were free of symptoms associated with heart failure. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated with octreotide, 100 to 500 micrograms subcutaneously three times daily. The three patients with heart failure continued to receive cardiovascular therapy (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, diuretics). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During octreotide therapy, patients showed a rapid decrease in growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1): Mean levels (+/- SD) fell from 28.1 +/- 32.7 micrograms/L to 5.2 +/- 8.3 micrograms/L and 740 +/- 126 micrograms/L to 372 +/- 64 micrograms/L, respectively (P less than 0.025). Plasma volume returned to normal and heart rate decreased significantly. In the four patients without heart failure, right-heart catheterization done before and after 3 months of octreotide therapy showed an 18.3% +/- 11% reduction in stroke volume and a return to normal of the cardiac index. The three patients with congestive heart failure, evaluated before and after 40 days and up to 2 years of therapy, showed a dramatic clinical improvement that was associated with an increase in stroke volume (by 24% to 51%). In these patients, the cardiac index remained in the normal range, filling pressures were markedly decreased, and pulmonary wedge pressure returned to normal. This improvement was sustained for up to 3 years in the two patients with heart failure who were receiving long-term treatment. CONCLUSION: The rapid and sustained cardiac improvement seen in our patients shows that octreotide therapy for patients with acromegaly may be highly beneficial, even in those patients with advanced cardiac failure. 
4	Neurologic abnormalities in a patient with human ehrlichiosis. Human ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne rickettsial disease characterized by fever, headache, myalgias, anorexia, and occasionally rash. In our patient, changes in mental status, upper motor neuron signs, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and increased serum protein levels were found in association with serologically confirmed ehrlichiosis and were most likely due to vasculitis involving the central nervous system. Intraleukocytic inclusions, although observed in our case, have been infrequently found in other reported cases of ehrlichiosis. 
5	The effect of long-acting somatostatin analogue on enzyme changes after endoscopic pancreatography. The effect of the long-acting somatostatin analogue, octreotide acetate (Sandostatin) on enzyme elevation after endoscopic pancreatography was studied in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. Sixty-three consecutive patients undergoing ERCP were randomly allocated to two group. In the control group, 34 patients received isotonic sodium-chloride, and in the treated group 29 patients received 0.1 mg of octreotide acetate subcutaneously before the pancreatography. After the endoscopy, amylase levels increased to pathological range in 15 of the controls and in 3 of the treated patients, whereas lipase levels showed a pathological rise in 17 of the controls and in 5 of the treated patients. A significant difference (p less than 0.01) was observed in the amylase and lipase changes between the two groups at 90 and 180 min after pancreatography. The enzyme levels showed at 90 min, mean +/- SD amylase: controls 540 +/- 185 units/liter, treated patients 261 +/- 108 units/liter; lipase: controls 304 +/- 98 units/liter, treated patients 198 +/- 88 units/liter. These findings suggest that the use of long-acting somatostatin analogue ameliorates the enzyme increases in the serum after endoscopic pancreatography. 
4	Surgical treatment of renovascular hypertension and respective late results. A twenty years experience. This paper presents the long term results following operative reconstruction for renovascular hypertension in 115 patients operated upon over a period of 20 years. There were 71 (61.7%) males and 44 (38.3%) females with a median age of 46 years (range 16-67). Renal revascularization was unilateral in 96 (83.4%) cases and bilateral in 19 (16.6%). Dacron knitted bypass grafts, were used in 51 and PTFE in 33 instances. Saphenous vein grafts were used in 11 patients. In 15 cases treatment was by local endarterectomy with concomitant angioplasty (12 unilateral and 3 bilateral). Simultaneous aortorenal reconstruction was undertaken in 38 (33%) patients. There were no deaths in the group with isolated renal artery reconstruction. In the group of aortorenal reconstructions, two deaths were encountered (5.7%). Postoperatively, blood pressure was either normal or improved in 83 (72%) patients at a mean follow-up period of 48.3 months (range 1-195 months). The best results were obtained in younger individuals with segmental renal artery lesions. Linear progression analysis, showed age to be a major determinant in the postoperative response to hypertension. There was a greater degree of long term success in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, as compared to individuals with atherosclerosis. Crude survival probabilities, were 78% and 61% at 5 and 10 years respectively. Late deaths encountered in the present series, were mostly attributable to myocardial infarction (7.8%). In this series, the best results were obtained in individuals younger than 50 years of age, with segmental renal artery lesions. 
3	Definition of the role of contemporary surgical management in cisternal and parenchymatous cysticercosis cerebri. With increasing immigration from endemic regions, the incidence of neurocysticercosis in North America is rising. This retrospective study was undertaken to examine the role of surgery in those cases presenting with large cystic parenchymal and cisternal lesions in the current era of anthelminthic agents administered orally. A total of 237 patients presented with newly diagnosed neurocysticercosis to our institution over a recent 5-year period (mean age, 31.2 years). Among those who presented with cystic mass lesions predominantly affecting the brain parenchyma and cisternal spaces, 20 (8.4%; mean age, 40.2 years) with large cystic lesions subsequently underwent surgical intervention, either because of an emergent presentation or because they were refractory to medical management. Clinical presentation included increased intracranial pressure, focal neurological deficit, and seizure. Radiographic imaging (computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging) demonstrated 12 cases with cisternal lesions, 7 with parenchymal lesions, and 1 involving both compartments. Based on imaging guidelines, 30 operative procedures (excluding shunt revisions) were performed (14 craniotomies, 8 cerebrospinal fluid diversions, 7 stereotactic procedures, and 1 burr hole drainage). Fifteen (75%) showed neurological or symptomatic improvement over a median follow-up period of 36.4 months. There were three surgery-related complications and no deaths. 
5	Measurements of right ventricular volumes during fluid challenge. The effects of fluid loading on RV function were studied in 41 acutely ill patients monitored with a modified pulmonary artery catheter equipped for measuring RVef. Hemodynamic evaluation was performed before and after infusion of 300 ml of 4.5 percent albumin solution in 30 min. Changes in SI did not correlate with Pra or Ppao but did with RVEDVI. For the entire group, RVef was unchanged (27 +/- 9 vs 27 +/- 9 percent). In the eight patients with an initial RVEDVI greater than 140 ml/m2, the fluid challenge increased Pra and Ppao and reduced LVSWI without any other significant effect. There was no significant correlation between RVEDVI and Pra and only a weak correlation between RVESVI and Ppa. However, there was a highly linear correlation between both RVEDVI and RVESVI and changes in RVEDVI and in RVESVI, suggesting that in the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension RV output is primarily dependent on RV preload. 
1	Pigmented Bowen's disease arising from pigmented seborrheic keratoses. We report three cases of pigmented Bowen's disease that clinically and histologically had features of seborrheic keratoses. We speculate about the mechanism of pigmentation in these lesions and suggest that they arise from pigmented seborrheic keratoses. 
5	Evidence that a receptor-operated event on the neutrophil mediates neutrophil accumulation in vivo. Pretreatment of 111In-neutrophils with pertussis toxin in vitro inhibits their accumulation in vivo. The role of neutrophil chemoattractant receptors in neutrophil stimulation in vitro is well established, however, the precise mechanisms underlying local neutrophil accumulation at inflammatory sites in vivo have not been defined. A fundamental question that remains open is whether chemoattractants act on the endothelial cell or the neutrophil to initiate the process of neutrophil migration in vivo. To address this question we have investigated whether neutrophil accumulation in vivo can occur if chemoattractant receptor occupancy is uncoupled from neutrophil stimulation. For this purpose we have used pertussis toxin (PT) as the pharmacologic tool. We have investigated the effect of in vitro pretreatment of rabbit neutrophils with PT on their responses in vitro and on their accumulation in vivo. Pretreatment of rabbit neutrophils with PT inhibited FMLP- and C5a-, but not PMA- induced increases in CD18 expression, neutrophil adherence, and degranulation in vitro. This pretreatment procedure with PT inhibited the accumulation of radiolabeled neutrophils in vivo in response to intradermally injected FMLP, C5a, C5a des Arg, leukotriene B4, IL-8, and zymosan in rabbit skin. Further, in contrast to the in vitro results, PT inhibited the PMA-induced 111In-neutrophil accumulation in vivo. Interestingly, pretreatment of neutrophils with PT also inhibited accumulation in response to intradermally injected IL-1, despite the reports that IL-1 lacks neutrophil chemoattractant activity in vitro. Although the experimental techniques used cannot distinguish the different stages of neutrophil migration involved, these results suggest that the accumulation of neutrophils induced by local extravascular chemoattractants in vivo depends on a pertussis toxin-sensitive receptor operated event on the neutrophil itself. Further, PMA and IL-1 may release secondary chemoattractants in vivo. 
5	Effect of motilin on gastric emptying in patients with diabetic gastroparesis. OBJECTIVES: Because disturbances of gastric emptying are a serious complication in insulin-dependent diabetic subjects with regard to the maintenance of good metabolic control, we wanted to assess the effectiveness of motilin as a potential treatment for gastric emptying disturbances. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The intestinal hormone motilin has been shown to accelerate gastric emptying in healthy subjects. Therefore, we examined the effect of intravenous motilin on gastric emptying of a 99mTc colloid-labeled semisolid test meal in 9 insulin-dependent diabetic patients with diabetic gastroparesis. All patients had a significantly delayed gastric emptying rate compared with a group of 11 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: During the infusion of motilin, gastric emptying was accelerated, and it was no longer significantly different from control values. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that motilin and related compounds such as erythromycin derivatives could be useful for the treatment of disturbed gastric emptying in diabetic subjects. 
4	Role of perfusion pressure and flow in major organ dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass. The role of perfusion pressure and flow during cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia and hemodilution in the development of new postoperative renal or clinically apparent cerebral dysfunction was examined in 504 adults. Cardiopulmonary bypass flow was targeted at greater than 40 mL.kg-1.min-1 and pressure at greater than 50 mm Hg. Flows and pressures less than target occurred in 21.6% and 97.1% of patients, respectively. Fifteen patients (3.0%) suffered new renal and 13 (2.6%) new central nervous system dysfunction. Low pressure or flow during cardiopulmonary bypass, expressed in absolute values or in intensity-duration units, were not predictors of either adverse outcome. Multivariate analysis identified use of postoperative intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (p less than 10(-6], excessive blood loss in the ICU (p less than 10(-4], need for vasopressors before cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 10(-4], postoperative myocardial infarction (p less than 10(-3], emergency reoperation (p less than 0.002), excessive postoperative transfusion (p less than 0.02), and chronic renal disease (p less than 0.03) as independent predictors of postoperative renal dysfunction. Independent predictors of postoperative central nervous system dysfunction were cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the intensive care unit (p less than 10(-6], intracardiac thrombus or valve calcification (p less than 0.02), and chronic renal disease (p less than 0.03). Age greater than 65 years (40.7% of patients) did not predict either outcome. We conclude that failure of the native circulation during periods other than cardiopulmonary bypass rather than the flows and pressures considered here is the major cause of renal and clinically apparent central nervous system dysfunction after cardiac operations. 
5	Chronic care needs to be a higher priority. Although acute care remains the focus of the U.S. health care delivery system, a shift is taking place toward chronic-illness mortality. Developing effective chronic-disease management processes is tough in the context of today's acute care orientation, according to William F. Henry, president of ForeSight Strategy Associates, St. Paul, MN. 
3	Ehrlichiosis in children. Tick-borne rickettsiae of the genus Ehrlichia have recently been recognized as a cause of human illness in the United States. In the years 1986-1988, 10 cases of ehrlichiosis were diagnosed in children in Oklahoma. Fever and headache were universal: myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia were also common. Rash was observed in six patients but was a prominent finding in only one. Leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were common laboratory abnormalities. Six patients were treated with tetracycline, three with chloramphenicol, and one was not treated with antibiotics: all recovered. The onset of illness in spring and early summer for most cases paralleled the time when Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis are most active, suggesting that one or both ticks may be vectors of human ehrlichiosis in Oklahoma. 
5	Treatment of vaginal candidiasis: orally or vaginally? Vaginal candidiasis continues to be the most common cause of vaginal discharge. A large variety of topical drugs and a selection of orally active antifungals are currently available. The choice between the use of oral drugs or intravaginal agents will depend on the therapeutic results obtained with the different agents, side effects, pregnancy status, and patient preference. The results obtained in the Maria Hospital, Tilburg, The Netherlands, and a review of foreign data suggest the following: (1) For acute infection oral and topical agents produce equivalent results. (2) For chronic infections oral medication is preferred. (3) Oral therapy should not be given to pregnant patients or to patients not using reliable contraceptive measures. (4) Half the patients prefer oral medication; only 5% prefer intravaginal therapy, and the others had no clear preference. 
5	The treatment of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome by limbic leucotomy. A patient with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and severe self-injurious compulsions who had failed to respond to drug treatment and behavioural therapy obtained a complete and sustained resolution of his destructive behaviour and improvement in his tics following bilateral limbic leucotomy. 
1	Serial immunocytologic analysis of blood for tumor cells in two patients with neuroblastoma. Tumor surveillance tests are used to determine whether malignant cells are responsive or resistant to therapeutic regimens. For patients with neuroblastoma, conventional methods of surveillance are not sensitive enough. Because tumor cells are shed into the circulation, immunocytologic analysis of blood may function as a sensitive monitoring system. In this study, five blood samples were obtained from two patients with disseminated neuroblastoma at diagnosis and during therapy. These samples were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies and immunoperoxidase staining to determine whether circulating neuroblasts were present. In both patients, the presence or absence of circulating neuroblasts yielded information that was more sensitive than that from conventional tests. The authors conclude that immunocytologic analysis of blood should be included with conventional monitoring methods for surveillance of patients with disseminated neuroblastoma. 
1	Large cystic optic glioma. A 5 1/2-year-old boy developed a huge cyst in his chiasmal glioma 4 years after radiation therapy. The cyst produced obtundation but was successfully treated. 
1	Leukocyte larceny: spurious hypoxemia confirmed with pulse oximetry Leukemic patients with extremely high white blood counts may exhibit the phenomenon of leukocyte larceny, in which white blood cells metabolize plasma oxygen in arterial blood gas samples (ABG) producing a spuriously low oxygen tension. We report the case of a leukemic patient with a white blood count in excess of 500,000 in whom multiple ABGs documented hypoxemia out of proportion to his clinical picture. Pulse oximetry was used to confirm higher hemoglobin oxygen saturation to establish the leukocyte larceny. 
1	Percent tumor necrosis as a predictor of treatment response in canine osteosarcoma. The percent tumor necrosis was determined in 200 dogs with spontaneously occurring osteosarcoma. One hundred dogs had no treatment before amputation or death. One hundred other dogs were treated with either radiation therapy alone (n = 23), intraarterial (IA) cisplatin alone (n = 16), intravenous (IV) cisplatin alone (n = 6), radiation therapy plus IA cisplatin (n = 47), or radiation therapy plus IV cisplatin (n = 8). Eighty-nine of these 100 dogs had their tumors resected 3 weeks after the end of therapy (6 weeks after the initiation of therapy) and replaced with a cortical bone allograft. Dogs with preoperative treatment were evaluated for local tumor control and time to metastasis. The mean percent tumor necrosis in untreated osteosarcoma was 26.8%. The mean percent tumor necrosis for dogs receiving radiation only, IA cisplatin only, and IV cisplatin only was 81.6%, 49.1% and 23.8%, respectively. The mean percent tumor necrosis for dogs receiving radiation therapy plus IA cisplatin or radiation therapy plus IV cisplatin was 83.7% and 78.2%, respectively. There was no significant difference between percent tumor necrosis in untreated osteosarcoma compared with those receiving IV cisplatin, but there was a significant increase in percent tumor necrosis with all other treatments. A mathematic model for the effect of cisplatin and radiation dose was developed using multiple regression analysis. The radiation dose calculated to cause at least 80% tumor necrosis was 42.2 Gy (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.0 to 47.6 Gy) when radiation was given alone and 28.1 Gy (95% CI, 21.3 to 36.6 Gy) when radiation was combined with IA cisplatin. Areas of viable tumor tended to be most frequent adjacent to the articular cartilage and in the joint capsule. Percent tumor necrosis was strongly predictive for local tumor control; 28 of 32 dogs with greater than 80% tumor necrosis had local control, and only eight of 29 dogs with less than 79% tumor necrosis had local control (P = 0.0047). There was no correlation between percent tumor necrosis and time to metastasis. 
2	Evidence for role of prostacyclin as a systemic hormone in portal hypertension. The possibility that prostacyclin could be a systemic hormone and could mediate the splanchnic hyperemia of chronic portal hypertension was evaluated in rabbits in a normotensive state and in rabbits with chronic partial ligation of the portal vein. In rabbits with portal hypertension (PHT), 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha, a prostacyclin degradation product) was elevated twofold in all vascular beds (systemic arterial, systemic venous, and portal venous) when compared with levels in control animals. In PHT rabbits, exogenous prostacyclin infusion after cyclooxygenase blockade through the systemic arterial, systemic venous, or portal venous route resulted in an equal elevation of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the reciprocal vascular beds and restored the original precyclooxygenase blockade hemodynamics. These hemodynamic changes were of equal magnitude irrespective of site of infusion in PHT. In controls there was no significant change in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha or hemodynamics with intraportal infusion. We conclude that prostacyclin achieves systemic levels by escaping hepatic degradation resulting from portosystemic shunting in the animal with chronic portal hypertension. 
1	Coeliac disease and malignancy of the duodenum: diagnosis by endoscopy, successful treatment of the malignancy, and response to a gluten free diet. A patient presented with subtotal villous atrophy and a malignant duodenal tumour of uncertain histogenesis. He was successfully treated by resection and chemotherapy and the small bowel mucosa recovered on a gluten free diet. The tumour was diagnosed at upper gastrointestinal endoscopy when barium studies and abdominal computed tomography were normal, thus making this one of the earliest coeliac malignancies diagnosed. 
1	The in vivo biologic effect of interleukin 2 and interferon alfa on natural immunity in patients with head and neck cancer. Given the association of deficient natural immunity with the risk of metastatic disease, the ability to activate natural killer cell function may have a therapeutic significance. The effect of continuous infusion of interleukin 2 plus intramuscular interferon alfa on natural immune status was, therefore, analyzed in eight patients with head and neck cancer. Also evaluated was the effect of interleukin 2-interferon alfa therapy on lymphokine-activated killer cell activity as well as total lymphocyte count, percent of lymphocyte subsets, and levels of both circulating immune complexes and antibody classes. Both the percent and absolute number of natural killer cells (ie, CD56+ CD3- lymphocytes) within peripheral blood as well as natural killer cell activity against K562 targets increased significantly with treatment. The remaining immune parameters were not significantly altered. The demonstrated capacity to modulate natural immune function supports the potential use of interleukin 2-containing regimens as a preventive measure against metastatic disease in patients with head and neck cancer. 
3	Platelet volume, aggregation, and adenosine triphosphate release in cerebral thrombosis. We compared whole blood platelet aggregation, adenosine triphosphate release, platelet count, platelet crit (percentage volume of platelets), and mean platelet volume during the acute, subacute, and chronic periods of cerebral thrombosis in 22 patients with value in 29 controls. During the acute and subacute periods, platelet aggregation, platelet count, platelet crit, and mean platelet volume were significantly less in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.05-0.01) while the adenosine triphosphate release rate per volume of platelets was significantly greater (p less than 0.05). During the acute period, infarct size showed a significant positive correlation with platelet aggregation (r = 0.59, p less than 0.01) and adenosine triphosphate release rate (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001) but a negative correlation with platelet count (r = -0.44, p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that platelet aggregation is reduced during the acute period due to the consumption of platelets during thrombogenesis but that the remaining individual platelets are hyperactive. Platelet consumption during the acute period increases with infarct size. During the chronic period, platelet crit and mean platelet volume were significantly less in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.01) while the adenosine triphosphate release rate was significantly greater (p less than 0.01), suggesting sustained platelet consumption and chronically enhanced secretion of individual platelets. 
1	A retinoic acid response element is part of a pleiotropic domain in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene. Several hormones, including insulin, glucagon, and glucocorticoids, regulate the expression of the rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [GTP: oxaloacetate carboxy-lyase (transphosphorylating); EC 4.1.1.32; PEPCK] in liver. In this report we demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) also regulates PEPCK expression by inducing a 3-fold increase in the rate of transcription of the PEPCK gene. A RA response element located between -468 and -431 in the PEPCK promoter mediates a 7-fold increase in expression of a chimeric construct containing the basal PEPCK promoter ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. This element confers RA responsiveness through the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter and functions relatively independent of position and orientation. An 18-base-pair core sequence (-451 to -434) (i) mediates an effect of RA on PEPCK gene expression and contains motifs found in two other RA response elements; (ii) corresponds to AF1, an accessory factor element that is an integral component of the complex glucocorticoid response unit in the PEPCK gene promoter; (iii) is in a region involved in the developmental expression of the PEPCK gene; and (iv) shows homology to elements involved in the tissue-specific regulation of genes, including the hepatic apolipoprotein genes and the alpha 1-antitrypsin gene. 
3	Diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease in sickle cell anemia by magnetic resonance angiography The study of blood flow by means of magnetic resonance techniques has led to a noninvasive magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) technique for imaging large cerebral vessels. Ten children with sickle cell hemoglobinopathy and a history of acute neurologic syndromes were studied with combined parenchymal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRA. Six had abnormal MRI findings and MRA-defined luminal lesions in the vascular distribution of these parenchymal infarctions. The three children with previous intraarterial angiography had MRA abnormalities that corresponded with vascular lesions on conventional angiograms. Four had normal MRI and MRA findings. We conclude that a combination of MRI and MRA provides a noninvasive screening test for large-vessel disease in this population. 
1	Chromogranin A: posttranslational modifications in secretory granules. The primary structure of chromogranin A indicates multiple domains which might be subject to posttranslational modification. We explored chromogranin A's proteolytic cleavage, glycosylation, and possible intermolecular disulfide links, using biochemical and cell biological approaches. Anti-chromogranin A region-specific immunoblots on chromaffin granules suggested bidirectional endoproteolytic cleavage of chromogranin A; control experiments ruled out artifactual cleavage during granule isolation or lysis. Isolation of chromogranin A-derived peptides by gel filtration chromatography or sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, established several cleavage sites, including at least two at dibasic sites. Secretion of chromogranin A from bovine chromaffin cells did not initiate further cleavage, nor did prolonged exposure of secreted chromogranins to the secretory cells. The chromogranin A cleavage pattern was qualitatively similar in other neuroendocrine tissues, though cleavage was more complete in adrenal medullary than in anterior pituitary hormone storage vesicles, and N-terminal fragments of 45 and 55 kilodaltons were more prominent in the hypothalamus. A similar cleavage pattern was seen in human pheochromocytoma granules, as judged by chromogranin A region-specific immunoblots, fragment isolation by SDS-PAGE, and microsequencing. The presence of full-length chromogranin A as the core protein of a chromaffin granule soluble proteoglycan was suggested in bovine (but not human) chromaffin granules by glycoprotein staining, chondroitinase ABC digestion, chemical deglycosylation, and region-specific immunoblotting. Human (but not bovine) chromogranin A displayed intermolecular disulfide crosslinks on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotting. These results document diverse structural paths that the chromogranin A molecule may take in endocrine secretory cells after its translation. 
5	Patient-related variables and restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty--a report from the M-HEART Group. As part of a randomized prospective study designed to investigate the restenosis process after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), the relation between patient-related variables and restenosis rate was examined. A total of 722 patients had successful PTCA. Angiographic follow-up was scheduled for 6 +/- 2 months after the procedure and achieved in 510 patients (71%), yielding 598 lesions for analysis. The overall restenosis rate was 40%. The rate was higher in patients undergoing early restudy for a clinical event than in those undergoing routinely scheduled follow-up restudy (71 vs 22%, p less than 0.0001). Age, sex, cigarette smoking history, diabetes mellitus and history of previous myocardial infarction were not associated with restenosis rate. Angina duration and severity before PTCA were also unrelated to restenosis rate. In summary, these variables, many of which have been previously implicated in restenosis, were not found to be predictors of restenosis. The decision to perform PTCA in individual patients should not be negatively influenced by the presence of these factors. 
3	Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) of the shoulder: a cause of shoulder pain? Shoulder pain is a common complaint and shoulder hyperostosis a frequent radiological condition. However, little is known about the association between the clinical and radiological findings. To evaluate the clinical relevance of shoulder hyperostosis we performed a controlled, blind study of 99 hospitalized probands with and without thoracospinal hyperostosis on lateral chest X-rays. The study included grading of the shoulder hyperostosis on the basis of three bilateral standard radiographs, assessing shoulder pain in a standardized way by an interviewer and recording extraskeletal causes of shoulder pain. The prevalence of shoulder hyperostosis was doubled in probands with thoracospinal hyperostosis compared to controls (chi 2 = 5.90, P less than 0.025, n = 99). Shoulder hyperostosis, irrespective of thoracospinal hyperostosis, predisposed to shoulder pain (40% versus 18%, chi 2 = 4.06, P less than 0.05, n = 74). Shoulder hyperostosis in combination with thoracospinal hyperostosis (shoulder DISH) predisposed to shoulder pain to an even greater extent (46% versus 12%, chi 2 = 6.64, P less than 0.01, n = 47). We conclude that shoulder hyperostosis is a radiological finding of potential clinical relevance. 
3	Bladder function in the mentally retarded. A group of 21 mentally retarded patients with severe, long-standing urinary symptoms underwent urodynamical investigation. The most common abnormalities were detrusor areflexia and detrusor hyper-reflexia. Of 11 patients treated surgically, 10 derived marked benefit. Drugs were successful in reducing micturition problems in 3/6 patients. Severely retarded patients with spastic quadriplegia are difficult to investigate and if this is associated with detrusor hyper-reflexia it is impossible to treat them in any way. Severely retarded patients with detrusor areflexia and infrequent voiding can benefit from bladder outlet surgery. Patients with moderate (especially mild) retardation can be investigated and treated in the same way as non-retarded people. 
3	Hydromyelic hydrocephalus. Correlation of hydromyelia with various stages of hydrocephalus in postshunt isolated compartments. The clinical features and pathophysiology of specific forms of hydromyelia are analyzed in this report together with the chronological changes of associated hydrocephalus. Nine patients were studied; all had hydromyelia with varying degrees of associated hydrocephalus. Clinically applicable classification systems were used to evaluate the progression of hydrocephalus (Stages I to IV) and to define the compartment isolated after shunting in the previously communicating cerebral ventricles (Types I to IV). Four patients had Stage IV disease (holoneural canal dilatation); one had Stage II and four had Stage I disease (both Stages I and II with supratentorial hydrocephalus). All patients were initially treated by ventriculoperitoneal shunting at an average age of 9.9 years. Five patients had progressive spinal symptoms before or after treatment of their hydrocephalus. Two patients had Type III isolation (an isolated rhombencephalic ventricle) with a functioning ventricular shunt; ventriculography confirmed a communication between the fourth ventricle and the hydromyelia, and both patients improved after placement of a shunt in the fourth ventricle. The remaining patients had Type IV isolation (isolated central canal dilatation) with a functioning ventricular shunt. This study indicates that in some cases the pathophysiology of hydromyelia is closely related to associated hydrocephalus. A new concept of the development of an isolated compartment after shunting is proposed to explain the progression of hydromyelia in these cases. 
5	Sensitivity to titanium. A cause of implant failure? Tissues from five patients who underwent revision operations for failed total hip replacements were found to contain large quantities of particulate titanium. In four cases this metal must have come from titanium alloy screws used to fix the acetabular component; in the fifth case it may also have originated from a titanium alloy femoral head. Monoclonal antibody labelling showed abundant macrophages and T-lymphocytes, in the absence of B-lymphocytes, suggesting sensitisation to titanium. Skin patch testing with dilute solutions of titanium salts gave negative results in all five patients. However, two of them had a positive skin test to a titanium-containing ointment. 
4	The incidence of deep vein thrombosis after cementless and cemented knee replacement. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis in 244 patients who had total knee replacement has been studied. In 120 the prosthesis was cemented and in 124 it was cementless. In all cases the replacement was primary and a porous-coated prosthesis with a porous-coated central tibial stem was used. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed by venography, and pulmonary embolism by perfusion scanning. The incidence of deep vein thrombosis in the cementless knees (23.8%) and in the cemented (25%) was approximately the same. The only significant predisposing factors for deep vein thrombosis in both groups were obesity, prolonged postoperative immobilisation, previous venous disease and hyperlipidaemia. 
3	Epidural morphine for analgesia after caesarean section: a report of 4880 patients This retrospective study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of epidural morphine in providing analgesia following Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia. The morphine was administered as a single bolus, following delivery, in doses ranging from 2 to 5 mg. The charts of 4880 Caesarean sections, performed on 4500 patients, were reviewed. The duration of analgesia and the occurrence of any symptoms which might be side-effects of the epidural morphine were recorded. The duration of analgesia was 22.9 +/- 10.1 hr and was not correlated with the dose of epidural morphine. Eleven per cent of the patients required no supplemental analgesia during the first 48 hr. Twelve patients (0.25 per cent) had respiratory rates less than 10 breaths per minute, on at least one occasion. No serious sequelae resulted from these periods of bradypnoea. Pruritus occurred in 58 per cent of patients, nausea and vomiting in 39.9 per cent and dizziness in ten per cent. Herpes simplex labialis was recorded in 3.5 per cent of patients. Epidural morphine is thus confirmed as an effective analgesic technique post-Caesarean section with 3 mg being the optimal dose. Even in this young healthy patient population, clinically detectable respiratory depression occurs so clinical respiratory monitoring is indicated. 
3	Aberrant regeneration in a case of syringobulbia: selective co-activation of abducens and facial nerves during saccades. A patient suffering from syringobulbia and syringomyelia exhibited a phasic contraction of the ipsilateral facial muscles, mainly the levator labii, whenever he looked to the left or right. Facial muscle twitches occurred exclusively with saccades. The selective co-activation of abducens and facial nerves is interpreted as the result of bilateral misrouting of regenerating neurons from the parapontine reticular formation to the facial nerve in the tegmentum pontis. 
5	The scimitar syndrome. The clinical spectrum of the scimitar syndrome ranges from severely ill infants to asymptomatic adults. The true incidence of the disorder is unknown because the syndrome may remain undetected in asymptomatic patients until a chest roentgenogram is obtained. We have presented the contrasting clinical experiences of two adult women, one with few symptoms and a benign course, and the other with exacerbation of her asthma from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections originating in the lower lobe of her right lung. Improvement resulted from surgical resection of this congenitally abnormal, bronchiectatic segment of lung. 
3	Flecked retina associated with ring 17 chromosome. We report the case of a mentally retarded male with a ring 17 chromosome who had subretinal drusen-like deposits in each eye. This is the second report of flecked retina in a patient with ring 17 chromosome, suggesting that there may be a causal relationship between abnormalities of chromosome 17 and retinal pigment epithelial or photoreceptor dysfunction. 
5	Low-dose bupivacaine does not improve postoperative epidural fentanyl analgesia in orthopedic patients [published erratum appears in Anesth Analg 1991 May;72(5):718] Epidural infusions of 10 micrograms/mL fentanyl combined with low-dose bupivacaine (0.1%) were compared with epidural infusions of fentanyl alone for postoperative analgesia after total knee joint replacement. There were no detectable differences between the two groups in analgesia (visual analogue scale ranging between 15 and 40 mm), infusion rates (which averaged 7-9 mL/h), or serum fentanyl levels (which reached 1-2 ng/mL). The incidence of side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and pruritus, was also similar. Of the patients receiving fentanyl and low-dose bupivacaine, one developed a transient unilateral motor and sensory loss, and one developed significant hypotension and respiratory depression. The addition of low-dose bupivacaine does not improve epidural fentanyl infusion analgesia after knee surgery and may increase morbidity. 
5	Clinical features and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical features and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). DATA SOURCE AND SELECTION: All articles on OSA published in French and English between 1970 and 1990 and indexed in Index Medicus were reviewed. Studies addressing the epidemiologic features and clinical aspects of OSA were selected, and special emphasis was given to articles reporting the effects of treatment on morbidity and mortality rates. MAIN RESULTS: OSA is characterized by episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep that result in repetitive hypoxemia and sleep disruption. OSA leads to various neuropsychologic and cardiovascular complications, including daytime hypersomnolence, cognitive impairment, systemic and pulmonary hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. There is suggestive evidence that the death rate among affected people is increased. The true incidence of OSA is unknown, but estimates have varied from 1% upwards among men. The current treatment with the greatest overall effectiveness and acceptability is nasal continuous positive airway pressure. CONCLUSION: This common, readily treatable disorder is associated with serious complications and therefore must be widely recognized by health professionals. 
2	Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in elderly persons [clinical conference] We have seen that UGI bleeding is a serious and apparently growing problem for seniors. Of special concern in the older patient are the frequency with which serious peptic disease presents silently, the limitation frequently imposed on adequate pain relief from NSAIDs, and the higher complication rates from most of the causes of UGI bleeding. Care of the elderly would be enhanced by research focused on defining those older patients most at risk of experiencing NSAID-induced peptic complications, improved methods for preventing or treating NSAID-induced ulceration that are well tolerated and cost-effective, and better regimens for preventing the recurrence of ulcers and UGI bleeding in these patients. In regard to the last, future investigation of the role of H. pylori, methods for successfully eliminating the organism, and the effect of eradication on patients' subsequent course may be particularly helpful. 
1	Mediastinal hibernoma, a rare tumor. Hibernoma is an uncommon soft tissue tumor that is derived from the remnants of fetal brown fat. Review of the world medical literature revealed 90 cases, 6 of which were intrathoracic. We present the seventh case of intrathoracic hibernoma; in this case, the hibernoma was within the mediastinum without direct invasion of other structures. 
4	Atherosclerotic carotid disease and the eye. The evaluation and management of retinal ischemia from atherosclerotic carotid disease is in a state of flux reflected by the change from emphasizing surgical management in the '70s toward skepticism about the benefit of surgery in the '80s. In addition, reliable noninvasive diagnostic testing of the carotid artery has reduced the risk. The decision to consider surgical versus medical management must be made on an individual basis based on the patient's health, age, and the risk of angiography and surgery at each institution. In children and young adults, amaurosis fugax is a benign condition. In the older population amaurosis fugax is often the sentinel event of diffuse atherosclerotic disease and possible early death from myocardial infarction. A team including the neurologist, internist, ophthalmologist, and surgeon optimizes care of the whole disease and not just the symptom. It is hoped that information in the next decade will supply additional guidance in the care of this multifaceted malady. 
5	Spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage: imaging and management. We report on 10 patients with spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage associated with underlying disease, including renal cell carcinoma (5), angiomyolipoma (2), malignant melanoma (1), periarteritis nodosa (1) and severe portal hypertension (1). The etiology could not be identified with computerized tomography (CT) in 5 cases (50%), including 2 renal cell carcinomas, 1 angiomyolipoma, 1 periarteritis nodosa and 1 portal hypertension. Arteriography demonstrated underlying lesions in 4 of these 5 cases (80%) including the case of vasculitis. CT combined with magnetic resonance imaging is accurate for the diagnosis of spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage but the underlying pathological condition is often undetectable in the acute phase due to the perinephric blood. CT should be the first study performed if this diagnosis is suspected. Arteriography is recommended if a renal mass is not detected. If a mass is not identified with these 2 imaging studies and the patient is clinically stable, followup thin slice CT should be performed. 
3	Correlation of clinical and computed tomographic findings in stroke patients. We evaluated the correlation between clinical features and computed tomographic findings in a prospective study of 1,191 consecutive patients with acute cerebrovascular disease seen during 1 year. In the 386 patients in whom symptoms and signs initially suggested a cerebrovascular disorder, computed tomography revealed a relevant lesion in 154 (hemorrhagic in 52 [33.8%], ischemic in 102 [66.2%]) and a significant nonstroke abnormality in 14 (3.1%). Among the remaining 805 patients with symptoms and signs suggesting some central nervous system disorder other than stroke, computed tomography revealed a cerebrovascular lesion in 38 (4.7%); 35 of these lesions were ischemic. The computed tomographic findings was compatible with the final clinical diagnosis in 192 (84.2%) of the 228 patients with lesions. In the entire sample of 1,191 patients, a cerebrovascular disorder would have been missed in 38 (3.2%) without computed tomography. On the other hand, computed tomography failed to visualize a cerebrovascular lesion in 40 patients in whom such a lesion was clinically obvious. Our results emphasize that both careful neurologic assessment and a policy of early computed tomography are of crucial importance in the diagnosis of stroke and for therapeutic considerations. 
5	Clinical features of adenovirus enteritis: a review of 127 cases. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features of 127 hospitalized pediatric patients whose fecal samples were positive for adenovirus (Ad) by electron microscopy during an 18-month period. Serotyping results obtained by microneutralization tests and restriction endonuclease analysis were available for 105 of 127 cases. There were 69 males and 58 females and 94% of patients were less than 4 years of age. The average body temperature was 38 degrees C rectal (range, 36.2-40.8 degrees C) with an average duration of fever of 1.6 days. The average duration of clinical illness was 8.8 days (range, 1 to 32 days). Although Ad 40 and Ad 41 were isolated in the majority of cases (59 of 105 (56%], Ad 31 was associated with 18 of 105 cases (17%). Of the 18 cases associated with Ad 31, 14 were nosocomial and associated with diarrhea. Our survey confirms the importance of fastidious enteric Ad in infantile diarrhea (Ad 40, Ad 41) and suggests that Ad 31 produces a clinical syndrome indistinguishable from that caused by Ad 40 and Ad 41. The occurrence of Ad enteritis in patients admitted for unrelated illnesses well after initial hospitalization suggests that Ad is also an important cause of nosocomial enteritis in our hospital. 
3	Relative validity of self-reported snoring as a symptom of sleep apnea in a sleep clinic population The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative validity of responses to three different questions about snoring as indicators for sleep apnea in a population referred to a sleep clinic. Secondary goals were to evaluate the meaning of a "don't know" response to these questions and to examine how the associations between snoring and sleep apnea are influenced by demographics. Results from 1,409 patients in a sleep clinic indicated that nearly all levels of estimated snoring frequency were associated with a greater likelihood of sleep apnea. In addition, a "don't know" response indicated a likelihood of sleep apnea. In the sample from this clinic, sensitivities approximating 90 percent were obtained in men, and specificities approximating 90 percent were obtained in women, but high diagnostic accuracy (high specificity in men; high sensitivity in women) could not be achieved with the three snoring questions used here. Generally, associations between snoring and sleep apnea were independent of age and sex. Single persons, persons living alone, and persons customarily sleeping alone of both sexes all showed associations between self-reported snoring and the presence of sleep apnea. 
3	Recurrent lateral rectus palsy in childhood. Five patients with recurrent, lateral rectus palsy in childhood, examined at the University of Iowa Hospitals over a period of 22 years, are reported. During the same period, 131 abducens nerve palsy patients, younger than 18 years of age, were evaluated. Eighteen similar patients, most single case reports, are reviewed from the literature. All reported patients, including our own, shared the following features: spontaneous recovery within 6 months in the majority of patients, ipsilateral recurrence, and painless palsy. There is female and left-sided preponderance. Etiology is undetermined. Hypotheses include viral etiology, neurovascular compression by aberrant artery, and migraine. 
5	Prevalence of angioid streaks and other ocular complications of Paget's disease of bone. Seventy randomly selected patients with Paget's disease of bone were examined for ocular complications. The prevalence of macular degeneration and cataract was 24.3%. Only one patient was found to have angioid streaks. Eight patients had peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy. These findings suggest that the prevalence of serious ocular complications of Paget's disease is not as high as previously thought. The significance of peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy requires further evaluation. 
2	Sterol-dependence of gastric protective activity of unsaturated phospholipids. The major aim of this study was to investigate the gastric protective effect of unsaturated phospholipids and to determine the ability of neutral lipids to enhance this activity. We found that although a liposomal suspension of unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) administered intragastrically failed to protect rats from acid-induced gastric ulcer formation, addition of cholesterol to unsaturated PC induced a dose-dependent protective response with the maximally effective dose, reducing lesion score greater than 70%. This effect also was seen with the plant sterol, beta-sitosterol (reducing lesion score by 81.6 +/- 36%) but was blocked if cholesterol was esterified to fatty acids of varying chain length. Addition of sterols to liposomes of saturated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, in contrast, attenuated the gastric protective action of the saturated PC. It appears that the protective mechanism elicited by sterols and unsaturated PC is not mediated by alterations in gastric emptying rate or prostaglandin biosynthesis, although maintenance of surface hydrophobicity may be involved. These results suggest that the sterol may promote the packing of adjacent unsaturated phospholipid molecules of either the cell membrane or a putative extracellular hydrophobic lining of the gastric epithelium to provide the mucosa with protection against luminal acid. 
5	The effect of graded doses of insulin on peripheral glucose uptake and lactate release in cancer cachexia. With the euglycemic clamp technique, we evaluated the effects of graded doses of insulin on glucose turnover rates and forearm lactate balance in five weight-losing patients with cancer before surgery and five age- and weight-matched healthy volunteers (control subjects). Insulin was infused sequentially at increasing rates of 0.5 (low physiologic), 1.0 (high physiologic), and 4.0 (supraphysiologic) mU/kg.min for 120 minutes each. Concurrently, rates of glucose appearance and disappearance were derived from [3-3H] glucose infusion. The mean postabsorptive rate of glucose appearance in patients (2.9 +/- 0.1 mg/kg.min) was significantly higher (p less than 0.02) than that of control subjects (1.98 +/- 0.16 mg/kg.min). Complete suppression of endogenous glucose production occurred at high physiologic insulin concentrations. With progressive insulin infusion, the rate of glucose disappearance increased to 3.6 +/- 1.2, 8.7 +/- 0.8, and 13.7 +/- 1.1 mg/kg/min in control subjects and 2.9 +/- 0.4, 5.3 +/- 0.3, and 10.9 +/- 0.9 mg/kg.min in patients, significantly different from that of control subjects (p less than 0.05) during the intermediate (high physiologic) insulin infusion. A comparable slight increase in arterial plasma lactate concentration was observed in both groups with progressive hyperinsulinemia. Baseline peripheral lactate flux was identical in patients (-272 +/- 56 nmol/100 gm.min) and in controls (-271 +/- 57 nmol/100 gm.min). Progressive physiologic hyperinsulinemia resulted in significantly (p less than 0.05) augmented peripheral lactate efflux in patients (-824 +/- 181 nmol/100 gm.min) compared with control subjects (-287 +/- 64 nmol/100 gm.min). Supraphysiologic insulin abolished this increased lactate efflux in patients. Postabsorptive rates of endogenous glucose appearance in weight-losing patients with cancer were elevated, but complete suppression was achieved with insulin concentrations in the physiologic range. Total body glucose use was diminished in these patients, consistent with a state of insulin resistance. This impaired insulin action on peripheral glucose use was associated with an increase in peripheral lactate release in patients. 
2	Cecal diverticulitis presented as a cecal tumor. Seven patients diagnosed as having acute appendicitis were operated on and a cecal wall mass due to cecal diverticulitis was found. In two patients the mass could not be separated from the cecal wall and right colectomy was performed. In five patients, in whom the mass could be separated from the cecum, conservative operations (three diverticulectomies and two wedge resections) were performed, thus avoiding needless, more extensive surgery. 
4	Time course of cellular enzyme release in dog heart injury. The transport time of enzyme from heart to plasma was studied in two experimental models. First, the enzyme alanine aminotransferase was slowly infused into the left ventricular wall in open-chest dogs. The half-life for the washout of alanine aminotransferase activity into plasma was 20 +/- 4 minutes (mean +/- SEM, n = 8) and was not different in ischemic and normally perfused tissue. From measurements of arteriovenous differences in alanine aminotransferase activity and left ventricular blood flow, it was concluded that 77 +/- 14% of total enzyme washout from ischemic tissue occurred by direct entry into the bloodstream. The corresponding value for the vascular permeability-surface area product was 264 +/- 55 ml.kg-1.hr-1. For a second model, we studied myocardial enzyme release into plasma after abrupt heart injury induced by 10 minutes of calcium-free coronary perfusion followed by reintroduction of calcium (calcium-paradox mechanism). The half-life for the release into plasma was 1.9 +/- 0.2 hours (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) and was again not influenced by sustained ischemia. Slower washout, as observed for this second model, is consistent with increased interstitial protein space and corresponds to a permeability--surface area product between 135 and 285 ml.kg-1.hr-1. These results were used to calculate the time course of cellular enzyme leakage from the rate of enzyme release into plasma in various forms of heart injury. Significant shifts between the time curves of evolving cellular injury and enzyme release into plasma are observed after 2 hours of ischemia followed by coronary reperfusion, but not after permanent ischemia. 
1	Mutagen sensitivity in patients with head and neck cancers: a biologic marker for risk of multiple primary malignancies. Eighty-four patients with head and neck cancers were evaluated for in vitro sensitivity to mutagens and then followed longitudinally for development of multiple primary malignancies. We assessed mutagen sensitivity by exposing lymphocytes to bleomycin in vitro and quantitating the bleomycin-induced chromosomal breaks per cell. The mutagen-hypersensitive patients, ie, those who expressed greater than 1.0 break per cell, were significantly more likely to develop multiple primary cancers than were patients who were less sensitive (less than or equal to 1.0 break per cell) (relative risk = 4.4; 95% confidence limits = 1.2, 15.8). This relationship was independent of age, sex, site, and treatment of first primary cancer and tobacco or alcohol exposures. Sensitivity to bleomycin-induced chromosomal damage serves as an indicator of genetic susceptibility to multiple primary malignancies in patients with head and neck cancers. 
4	Anorectal varices--their frequency in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. Anorectal varices in portal hypertension have been little studied: Seventy eight per cent of 72 patients with portal hypertension had anorectal varices shown at flexible sigmoidoscopy. Significantly more patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertension had these varices than patients with cirrhosis (89% v 56%, p less than 0.01). 
1	Common nonvenereal genital lesions. There are a wide variety of local and systemic skin diseases that produce lesions in the genitoanal region. These lesions may resemble those produced by sexually transmitted microorganisms. The purpose of this article is to make physicians aware of the common skin diseases that produce lesions on the genitalia to avoid the inappropriate diagnosis of a sexually transmitted disease. 
5	Advances in noninvasive detection of CAD. Advances in the noninvasive detection of myocardial ischemia are increasing our ability to diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD). Tomographic (SPECT) thallium imaging provides better identification of coronary arteries with atherosclerotic narrowing. Increased lung thallium uptake and transient ischemic dilatation of the heart are additional markers of severe CAD. Late thallium imaging, as well as reinjection imaging, provides more accurate identification of myocardial ischemia. Finally, new myocardial ischemia. Finally, new myocardial imaging agents, such as technetium Tc 99m sestamibi (Cardiolite), should improve detection of CAD by noninvasive methods. 
1	What to do when an x-ray film suggests lung cancer. The chest film is one of the most common methods of detecting lung cancer, which often appears as solitary nodules or hilar masses. Once the diagnosis is established, the most effective treatment can be determined and staging of the tumor can be done. Surgical resection is the only cure for non-small-cell carcinoma, although radiotherapy and chemotherapy may shrink some tumors. Because 90% of all cases are caused by smoking, a preventive approach to the disease is crucial. Screening of high-risk patients (ie, smokers with airflow obstruction) using chest films and sputum cytology may aid this approach. 
4	Elevated plasma noradrenaline concentrations in patients with low-output cardiac failure: dependence on increased noradrenaline secretion rates. 1. Plasma noradrenaline concentrations are elevated in patients with congestive heart failure; however, the pathogenesis of these elevated noradrenaline levels is controversial. 2. Possible mechanisms for elevated noradrenaline concentrations in patients with congestive heart failure include increased noradrenaline secretion, decreased clearance of noradrenaline, and a combination of increased secretion and decreased clearance. 3. In the present study, plasma noradrenaline clearance and apparent secretion rates were determined using a whole-body steady-state radionuclide tracer method in six otherwise healthy patients with moderate degrees of low-output cardiac failure and in six normal control subjects. 4. The venous plasma noradrenaline level was elevated in the patients with congestive heart failure as compared with the control subjects (4.18 +/- 1.34 versus 1.54 +/- 0.16 nmol/l, P less than 0.05). There was no stimulation of the adrenal medulla as evident by normal plasma adrenaline levels in both groups (0.19 +/- 0.04 versus 0.18 +/- 0.02 nmol/l, not significant). The apparent secretion rate of noradrenaline was elevated in the patients with congestive heart failure (4.75 +/- 1.95 versus 1.78 +/- 0.18 nmol min-1 m-2, P less than 0.05), whereas the clearance rate of noradrenaline was similar in the two groups (1.26 +/- 0.27 versus 1.16 +/- 0.02 l min-1 m-2, not significant). 5. We conclude that the high peripheral venous plasma noradrenaline concentrations in patients with mildly decompensated low-output cardiac failure are initially due to increased secretion, rather than to decreased metabolic clearance, perhaps in response to diminished effective arterial blood volume. 
3	Ethyl chloride and venepuncture pain: a comparison with intradermal lidocaine. One hundred and twenty unpremedicated patients undergoing gynaecological surgery were randomly allocated to one of three equal treatment groups to assess the effectiveness of ethyl chloride in producing instant skin anaesthesia to prevent the pain of venepuncture from a 20 G cannula. They received either no anaesthetic, 0.2 ml one per cent lidocaine plain intradermally or a ten-second spray of ethyl chloride at the cannulation site. Ethyl chloride produced skin anaesthesia that significantly reduced the pain of venepuncture. However, it was not as effective as intradermal lidocaine. It had no effect on vein visualisation or ease of cannulation. Ethyl chloride can be recommended as a method of producing instant skin anaesthesia. 
2	Radiology of esophagitis: a pattern approach. This article presents a pattern approach for diagnosing esophagitis at double-contrast esophagography. In patients with nodular elevations of the mucosa, discrete plaques should suggest Candida esophagitis, whereas poorly defined nodules should suggest reflux esophagitis and a distinctive reticular pattern of the mucosa should suggest Barrett esophagus, particularly if adjacent to the distal aspect of a high stricture. In patients with ulceration, one or more shallow ulcers at or near the gastroesophageal junction should suggest reflux esophagitis, whereas discrete, superficial ulcers in the midesophagus should suggest herpes or drug-induced esophagitis, depending on the clinical setting. In contrast, one or more giant, relatively flat ulcers should suggest cytomegalovirus esophagitis, particularly in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Finally, thickened longitudinal folds may be caused by esophagitis, varices, or, rarely, "varicoid" carcinoma, but these conditions usually can be differentiated on radiologic grounds. By carefully analyzing the appearance and location of nodules, plaques, ulcers, or abnormal folds in the esophagus, one can usually suggest a cause of the disease. 
5	Febrile status epilepticus As part of a study of status epilepticus in children (Maytal J, Shinnar S, Moshe SL, Alvarez LA. Pediatrics. 1989; 83:323-331); 44 children with febrile convulsions lasting more than 30 minutes were followed for a mean of 28 months (range 4 to 72). Thirty children were followed prospectively. Children with prior afebrile seizures or evidence of acute central nervous system infection were excluded. Nine (20%) children had prior neurological deficits. The duration of the febrile seizure was 0.5 to 1 hour in 41 cases (85%), 1 to 2 hours in 5 (10%), and greater than 2 hours in 2 children (5%). No child died or developed new neurological deficits following the seizures. The risk of recurrent seizures was increased, but only in the group with prior neurological abnormality. Six (66%) of these children had subsequent febrile seizures compared with 12 (34%) of the normal children (P = .08). Three (33%) had recurrent febrile status epilepticus compared with only 1 (3%) normal child (P = .023). The 2 children in the prospective arm of the study with recurrent febrile status epilepticus were both neurologically abnormal (P = .035). All 3 of the children who subsequently had afebrile seizures (2 prospective) were neurologically abnormal (P = .006 overall, P = .035 for prospective only). It is concluded that the occurrence of febrile status epilepticus in a neurologically impaired child is a risk factor for subsequent febrile as well as afebrile seizures. The occurrence of febrile status epilepticus in an otherwise normal child does not significantly increase the risk for subsequent febrile (brief or prolonged) or afebrile seizures in the first few years following the episode. 
5	Prognosis of hospital survivors after salvage from cardiopulmonary bypass with centrifugal cardiac assist. Since October 1986, 6 hospital survivors who were salvaged from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with the Sarns centrifugal pump were observed. Centrifugal assist was employed only after failure to wean with usual resuscitative measures, including multiple high dose inotropes and intraaortic balloon pumping. There were five men and one woman, 46-59 years of age (mean 61 years). All patients had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting, with two patients having had concomitant left ventricular aneurysmectomy and two aortic valve replacement. Five patients had left ventricular assist only and one had biventricular assist. Duration of assist ranged from 26 to 72 hr (mean 48 hr). Complications were ubiquitous, and the resultant prolonged hospitalization was resource intensive. All hospital survivors remain alive and are in New York Heart Association functional Class II, with an average follow-up of 24 months, (6-41 months). Compared with preoperative values, current left ventricular function is improved in 2 patients, has deteriorated in 3, and is unchanged in 1. Thus, the Sarns centrifugal pump will allow salvage of some patients who otherwise are not weanable from CPB. Survivors can expect a reasonable functional capacity as reflected by this experience. 
4	Complications of general anesthesia for Nd:YAG laser resection of endobronchial tumors. We studied the incidence and mechanisms of cardiovascular complications and postoperative respiratory insufficiency associated with GA and Nd:YAG laser endobronchial tumor resection. The records of 73 patients undergoing 87 procedures were reviewed. Preoperative status, anesthetic methods and perioperative complications were analyzed by multiple regression to determine predictors of outcome. Twenty-three percent of patients had greater than 90 percent mainstem bronchus obstruction. Longer serum elimination half-life of relaxant drug was significantly correlated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation after neuromuscular blockade reversal. Cardiovascular complications were noted in 24 procedures and often required therapeutic intervention. Variables predicting cardiovascular complications included longer duration of GA and increasing age. Perioperative respiratory and cardiovascular complications are common after GA for Nd: YAG laser resection. Short-acting neuromuscular relaxants, careful assessment prior to postoperative extubation, limiting duration of GA and cardiovascular monitoring are recommended when implementing GA for Nd: YAG laser resection of endobronchial tumors. 
4	The cutaneous manifestations in children with familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent hereditary polyserositis). A six-year study. In a six-year study of 46 children with familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent hereditary polyserositis), 20 children (43 per cent) developed cutaneous manifestations. Ten children had 18 episodes of erysipelas-like erythema which proved to be specific for the disease. Twelve children (26 per cent) had 31 episodes of non-specific purpuric rash and six children (13 per cent) had nine episodes of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Other manifestations included diffuse erythema of the face, and/or trunk, angioneurotic oedema, diffuse erythema of the palms and soles followed by mild desquamation of the skin, Raynaud's phenomenon and a subcutaneous nodule. The mean frequency of the cutaneous lesions was 1.6/patient/year before colchicine therapy and 0.4/patient/year after colchicine therapy (p = 0.0005). The high incidence of cutaneous manifestations and their response to colchicine strongly suggest that skin involvement is an integral part familial Mediterranean fever. 
2	Intestinal cryptosporidiosis: pathophysiologic alterations and specific cellular and humoral immune responses in rnu/+ and rnu/rnu (athymic) rats. In order to develop an experimental model of symptomatic cryptosporidiosis in an immunosuppressed mammal, we investigated the pathophysiology of infection with Cryptosporidium and the humoral and cellular host responses in rnu/rnu (athymic) rats and their heterozygous (rnu/+) littermates by challenging suckling rats with greater than or equal to 2.5 x 10(6) Cryptosporidium oocytes oro-gastrically. Normal and immunodeficient animals were followed for onset and duration of infection (fecal oocysts), physiologic consequences (diarrhea, impaired weight gain, brush-border enzyme activities), and immunologic response (both B- and T-lymphocyte-mediated). Homozygosity for the rnu gene was associated with protracted cryptosporidial infections; shedding for up to 52 days occurred, and delay in weight gain was noted in rnu/rnu-infected compared with rnu/rnu-uninfected rats (p less than 0.05). In contrast, cryptosporidial challenge of rnu/+ rats resulted in self-resolving infections, occasionally with transient diarrhea lasting four days or less occurring 10-15 days after oro-gastric challenge. The latter animals mounted a cell-mediated immune response to Cryptosporidium: three months after challenge, five of five rnu/+ rats demonstrated positive skin test responses to a subcutaneous 3.5 micrograms dose of cryptosporidial antigen. Further, sera from 6 rnu/+ rats taken two to three months after oro-gastric oocyst challenge exhibited specific anticryptosporidial immunoglobulin binding (A405 = 0.96), compared to that of seven uninfected rnu/+ controls (A405 = 0.09, P less than 0.02). Macromolecules of 150, 105, and 88 kD in the Cryptosporidium antigen preparation were bound by serum immunoglobulin from previously infected, recovered rnu/+ rats. Two brush-border enzymes (lactase and alkaline phosphatase) were markedly reduced in the ileum 8-10 days after oro-gastric challenge in rats with diarrhea and oocyst shedding. We find the rnu/rnu (athymic, nude) rat provides a useful model for study of prolonged cryptosporidial infection with impaired weight loss, brush-border enzyme alteration and intermittent diarrhea. These studies further suggest that a T-lymphocyte population is involved in recovery from Cryptosporidium infection and that this recovery is associated with both cellular and humoral immune responses to specific cryptosporidial antigenic macromolecules. This model should open further avenues for the study of the pathogenesis and protective immunity in cryptosporidial infection. 
5	Echographic diagnosis of dural carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas. I used standardized ophthalmic echography to identify specific abnormalities in four patients with low-pressure, low-flow dural arteriovenous malformations. In all of the patients, B-scan ultrasonography showed engorgement of the ipsilateral vertical vein. A-scan ultrasonography dynamically imaged rapid blood flow through the superior ophthalmic vein and enlargement of the culpable ocular muscles in patients with restrictive ophthalmopathy. The 30-degree test distinguished between venous engorgement of the optic nerve sheath and apical compression of the optic nerve by enlarged ocular muscles. 
4	Stress management in the treatment of mild primary hypertension. The use of simple relaxation-based stress management procedures in the treatment of mild primary hypertension has been the subject of extensive study. Stress management appears to lead to reliably greater reductions in pressure than a variety of control procedures. The mechanisms underlying these effects are obscure, and research has not identified which patients will benefit most from treatment. Preliminary data suggest that stress management may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, but much research must be done if this is to be confirmed. It is suggested that such research should take into account the possibility that stress management may have beneficial effects on more than just hypertension-related aspects of the cardiovascular disease process. 
3	Traumatic retinal detachment. Seventy-seven patients developed retinal breaks following an episode of ocular contusion, and 65 (84.4%) of these developed rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Surgical treatment successfully restored or maintained retinal apposition in 74 (96.1%) of the eyes. Thirty-six (46.8%) eyes recovered visual acuity of 6/9 or better. Of the retinal breaks recognised dialysis at the ora serrata was observed in 49 eyes, of which 28 were situated at the lower temporal quadrant. Seventeen eyes had irregular breaks arising within necrotic retina at the site of scleral impact. Twenty-four (31.2%) patients had retinal break or retinal detachment diagnosed within 24 hours of injury and 49 (63.6%) within six weeks. Immediate retinal detachment was a feature of necrotic retinal breaks, while inferior oral dialyses led to a slow accumulation of subretinal fluid. Delayed diagnosis of retinal detachment was due either to opaque media or to failure to examine the retina after injury. Visual prognosis was good when retinal break or detachment were diagnosed within six weeks of injury. However, those patients who escaped initial retinal examination and were lost to follow-up had a less favourable visual outcome. 
3	HLA class II antigens and DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism in myasthenia gravis in Japan. Human leukocyte phenotypes and genes in the HLA class II regions were studied in 46 Japanese patients with myasthenia gravis. When the HLA phenotypes of the patients with myasthenia gravis were compared with the controls, an increased frequency of HLA-DRw53 was observed in females less than 30 years of age. The genomic DNAs of the HLA-DRw53-positive patients and DRw53-positive controls were analyzed by using four complementary DNA probes for HLA class II genes. With DQB complementary DNA as the probe, a higher incidence of the 6.5-kb or 8.2-kb BamHI fragment was observed in the patients (76.0%) compared with the controls (19.0%). In contrast, no significant difference was observed between patients and controls when complementary DNAs for DRB, DQA, and DPB were used as probes. These results indicate that the genetic background of Japanese females with early-onset myasthenia gravis is different from other patients with myasthenia gravis, and that DQB genes can greatly influence the onset of myasthenia gravis. 
5	Embolism during caesarean section. We investigated the occurrence of gas embolism during Caesarean section using a Doppler ultrasound probe and found that it occurs between uterine incision and delivery. Embolism is less common during general anaesthesia than has been reported during regional anaesthesia. Both ruptured membranes and a protracted uterine incision to delivery interval predispose to embolism. 
4	A study of the effects of delapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the diurnal variation of arterial pressure in patients with essential hypertension using indirect and direct arterial pressure monitoring methods. In order to investigate the effect of delapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the diurnal variation of arterial pressure in patients with essential hypertension, this study examined 24 h arterial pressure using an indirect or a direct monitoring system. When the effect of twice-a-day administration of delapril at daily doses of 30 to 90 mg was examined using the indirect monitoring system in 12 outpatients, delapril decreased systolic and diastolic arterial pressures significantly only at limited points during the day. However, each of the averaged 24 h daytime and nighttime arterial pressures showed significant reductions. The 24 h intraarterial pressure monitoring demonstrated that delapril decreased systolic and diastolic arterial pressure at most of the measurement points. The arterial pressure reductions during daytime and nighttime were not significantly different, that is, there was no excessive reduction in nighttime arterial pressure. Heart rate and its variability were virtually unaffected by the delapril treatment in either monitoring study. No adverse reactions were observed in the indirect or direct monitoring studies. Thus, it is concluded that twice-a-day administration of delapril at daily doses of 30 to 90 mg brings about a safe and stable antihypertensive effect, without affecting the diurnal variation of arterial pressure. 
5	Unusual cerebral manifestations in hereditary fructose intolerance. Five children with hereditary fructose intolerance developed symptoms of neurological impairment. In three of them, neurological involvement was related to the acute hepatic toxicity of fructose (hypoglycemia, abnormal coagulation, cardiovascular collapse); in the other two, such a relationship could not be demonstrated. Neurological impairment is not classic in hereditary fructose intolerance, but its occurrence in the acute phase of the disease is possible and does not constitute an argument against the diagnosis. 
5	Phenotypic relationships of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive prostatic carcinoma. Thirty-one snap-frozen human prostate specimens containing examples of benign hyperplasia, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and invasive carcinoma were analyzed using a panel of 24 antibodies and one lectin. Twenty-seven additional routinely processed radical prostatectomy specimens were studied using selected probes known to work on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material. Three probes, anticytokeratin KA4, anti-vimentin V9, and the lectin from Ulex europaeus (UEA-1), demonstrated phenotypic similarities between PIN and invasive carcinoma. Whereas the luminal cells of normal or hyperplastic prostatic epithelium are minimally reactive with KA4 (4%) or UEA-1 (0%) and strongly reactive with anti-vimentin (91%), both the PIN and invasive carcinoma are reactive with KA4 (89% and 93%, respectively) and UEA-1 (96% and 93%, respectively) and minimally reactive with anti-vimentin (15% and 0%, respectively). The increased KA4 staining was shown to be in part due to detection of cytokeratin 19, by using cytokeratin-19-specific antibodies, 4.62 and LP2K. The reasons for the increased expression of this cytokeratin and the decreased expression of vimentin are unclear but seem to indicate a phenotypic relationship between the PIN lesions and invasive carcinoma. 
4	A predominantly adrenaline-secreting phaeochromocytoma. A 61-year-old woman who presented with diabetes, nausea, weight loss and sweating was found to have a phaeochromocytoma secreting adrenaline, with a small amount of N-methyladrenaline. There was no significant increase in noradrenaline secretion. She was normotensive, and developed profound hypotension in response to the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine. These features are unusual in phaeochromocytoma, but similar features occurred in the very few previous reported cases of pure adrenaline-secreting phaeochromocytoma. We conclude that it is important to identify such patients, so that they should not be given alpha-adrenergic antagonist drugs. 
1	Epidermoid cyst (monodermal teratoma) of the testis. We report 14 patients with epidermoid cyst of the testis (monodermal teratoma). In 7 patients (5 treated within the last 5 years) the mass was excised and adjacent testicular tissue was biopsied. Seven patients underwent radical inguinal orchiectomy. Carcinoma in situ was not detected in any testicular tissue examined. There was no evidence of tumour recurrence in any patient after a mean follow-up of 10 years. Ultrasonographic appearance was not specific for a diagnosis of epidermoid cyst and exploratory surgery was required in all cases. Excision of the tumour and biopsy of adjacent testicular tissue to determine the presence or absence of carcinoma in situ is adequate treatment for this rare testicular neoplasm. 
5	Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of gastroepiploic artery graft. The right gastroepiploic artery is being used as a third arterial conduit for coronary artery bypass surgery. Presented here is a case demonstrating successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the gastroepiploic artery graft. This successful accomplishment may avoid repeat surgical revascularization in case of failure of the gastroepiploic artery graft, hence may encourage people to use it more often. 
1	Reoperation for colorectal carcinoma. In the management of the patient with intra-abdominal recurrence of colorectal carcinoma, surgery remains the primary mode of therapy when cure or significant palliation is anticipated. Appreciation of the importance of close follow-up after primary resection coupled with improved diagnostic modalities has allowed the surgeon not only to detect earlier recurrence but also to select the patients most likely to benefit from resection of recurrent disease. Improved surgical techniques with resultant decreases in the rates of morbidity and mortality have allowed safe hepatic resection of metastatic disease. In selected patients, this procedure produces 5-year survival rates approaching 50%. Although a clear consensus has not been reached, most studies agree that positive prognostic indicators include absence of extrahepatic disease, a small number of intrahepatic lesions, a low CEA level, and a better Dukes stage of the primary. Likewise, in the patient with recurrent disease locally, surgery provides the only means of cure and also plays a significant role in palliation. Aggressive resection with generous surgical margins in patients with contained disease may yield 5-year survival rates approaching 35%. In patients with unresectable disease and even in those with carcinomatosis, palliation can be obtained by surgical therapy. Judgment is necessary in treating these patients both preoperatively and intraoperatively. Surgical intervention for obstruction, perforation, or other anatomic or physiological compromise is often indicated and can improve the quality of life of the patient with intra-abdominal recurrence. 
5	Sudden death and sleeping history among Finnish men. An autopsy was performed in 460 consecutive cases of sudden death among 35- to 76-year-old men. The closest cohabiting individual known to each decreased subject was interviewed. Snoring history was obtained in 321 of the 371 interviews. In 86 cases there was a history of 'habitual' (almost always or always) snoring, and 88 men snored 'often'. The mean age of subjects was 55.4 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.3 kg m-2. Among the obese snorers (n = 82), apnoeas had been observed 'occasionally', 'often', or 'habitually' in 49 cases. Death was classified as cardiovascular in 186 (40.4%) cases. Cardiovascular cause of death was more common among those who snored habitually or often than among those who snored occasionally or never (P less than 0.05). 'Habitual' snorers died more often while sleeping (P less than 0.05). Habitual snoring was found to be a risk factor for morning death (P less than 0.01). The possibility of obstructive sleep apnoea as a cause of sudden death should at least be considered if the decreased is known to have been a habitual snorer. 
3	Migraine and vertebrobasilar ischemia. I studied 9 patients with migraine and posterior circulation ischemia. Inclusion criteria were (1) brainstem or cerebellar infarcts or transient ischemic attacks, (2) satisfactory vertebrobasilar angiograms, and (3) migraine. Excluded were patients with only occipital lobe ischemia, known arteriosclerosis, or other nonmigrainous vascular disease. Two women and 7 men, ages 6 to 58 years (mean, 34.7), had transient attacks only (2), single strokes (4), single stroke followed by attacks (1), or multiple strokes (2). Five had antecedent classic, 2 common migraine, and classic migraine began only after the initial ischemic event in the other two. The 7 stroke patients all had CT- or MRI-documented brainstem (4) or cerebellar (6) infarcts. Angiography was normal (3) or demonstrated basilar artery (BA) narrowing (2) or occlusion (4), or branch occlusion (1). In 3 patients the initially occluded BA later reopened. At follow-up (average 4.3 years, range 1 to 9 years), 5 were normal and 4 had important clinical deficits. I conclude that (1) "basilar migraine" is not always benign; it affects both sexes and a wide age range; (2) the pattern of headaches, attacks, and strokes varies; (3) migraine may appear only after ischemia; (4) some patients have BA occlusion or diffuse narrowing; and (5) BA occlusion can be temporary. 
5	Sweet's syndrome with lung involvement. Severe dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates were associated with recurrent episodes of Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) in a 54-yr-old woman with myelodysplasia. Lung and skin biopsies revealed a sterile infiltration of the interstitial tissues by mature neutrophils. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in rapid clinical improvement; however, recurrent episodes were increasingly resistant to therapy, and she ultimately died from respiratory failure. Sweet's syndrome involving the lung is rare, with only two previously reported cases documented by lung biopsy. Prompt recognition of Sweet's syndrome with lung involvement is important because of the potential for severe respiratory compromise. 
5	Structural and ultrastructural study of the ovary in childhood leukemia after successful treatment. Ovarian biopsy specimens from ten girls (three postmenarcheal) who had undergone antiblastic treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and were in complete remission were examined by light microscope. The biopsy specimens from four of these patients (three postmenarcheal) were also observed by electron microscope. The structural and ultrastructural analysis showed a reduction in the number of follicles which were otherwise normal. No follicles were found in the thin sections from two of the three postmenarcheal girls, whereas normal follicles were observed in the third. The cortical stroma showed moderate to severe signs of fibrosis and changes of capillaries. All of these alterations were more evident in patients where ALL was diagnosed at an older age and this finding suggests that they are at a higher risk for low fertility or early menopause. 
1	Endometrial ablation for the treatment of menorrhagia: a comparison of patients with normal, enlarged, and fibroid uteri. One hundred sixty-one patients underwent endometrial ablation with the Nd:YAG laser for the treatment of refractory menorrhagia. Patients were divided into one of three groups: those with a normal-sized uterus; those with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm); and those with uterine fibroids, which had been documented clinically, ultrasonographically, or by a combination of hysteroscopy and laparoscopy or by one or the other. All patients were considered candidates for hysterectomy. Both preoperatively and postoperatively, patients monitored their menstrual cycles and evaluated their flow according to predetermined categories of amenorrhea, light flow, normal flow, heavy flow, and severe flow. After treatment, 68% of patients with normal-sized uterus and 91% of patients with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm) and 88% of patients with uterine fibroids became amenorrheic or had light flow. None of the patients in this last group have had to undergo hysterectomy. This study indicates that the patient with an enlarged or fibroid uterus may not have contraindications for endometrial ablation. Endometrial ablation may be effective in at least temporarily controlling bleeding in those patients with enlarged or myomatous uterus. 
4	The value of pulmonary artery and central venous monitoring in patients undergoing abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery: a comparative study of two selected, randomized groups. One hundred two patients undergoing abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery were prospectively, randomly allocated to two groups, one of which was monitored with a central venous catheter and the other with a pulmonary artery catheter. Patients with uncompensated cardiopulmonary or renal disease were excluded from the study. General anesthesia was administered for the surgical procedure, and the patients were followed through hospital discharge. No statistically significant differences occurred between the two groups with regard to morbidity (perioperative cardiac, pulmonary or renal sequelae), mortality rate, duration of intensive care, postoperative hospital stay, or cost of hospitalization. The one statistically significant difference between groups was the professional fee charged for anesthetic care, which was higher for patients with pulmonary artery catheters than for those with central venous catheters. In conclusion, we prospectively gathered data from most patients presented for abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery. Our data seem to indicate that the choice of central venous catheter or pulmonary artery catheter monitoring makes little difference in outcome after abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery, and that for many patients pulmonary artery catheters are not necessary to give appropriate, adequate care. Because of the size of the sample, however, declarations of epidemiologic significance would be unfounded. Therefore large-scale, multicenter studies addressing such outcomes remain necessary. 
5	Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of the caecum in children with the Trichuris dysentery syndrome. Caecal biopsy specimens from Jamaican children with the Trichuris dysentery syndrome (TDS) and age matched Jamaican controls were investigated by immunohistochemistry and by light microscopy. Biopsy specimens from all children (with TDS and controls) showed a mild to moderate increase in inflammatory cells. Except in the vicinity of the worm, where the epithelium was flattened, there was no other epithelial abnormality. Compared with controls, children with TDS had increased IgM lamina propria plasma cells and decreased intraepithelial T cells. There was also an increase in crypt epithelial cell proliferation. Lamina propria T cells (both activated and non-activated) were no more common in children with the Trichuris syndrome than controls. Epithelial cell HLA-DR and VLA-1 expression (which are increased in other colitides) were the same in both groups. Despite the presence of large worm burdens and chronic dysentery, therefore, only minor changes were seen in the caecal mucosa of children with TDS. 
4	Salvage from cardiogenic shock by atherectomy after failed emergency coronary artery angioplasty. In this case report of a patient undergoing angioplasty for cardiogenic shock during acute myocardial infarction, recurrent occlusion resulted in recurrence of shock. Atherectomy reestablished lasting patency and reversed the patient's hemodynamic collapse. Atherectomy deserves further investigation as a means to salvage vessel patency during unsuccessful coronary angioplasty. 
3	Late effects of paralytic poliomyelitis in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We identified a cohort of 300 individuals who had paralytic polio between 1935 and 1955. All lived in Olmsted County, Minnesota. From the 247 survivors, we selected 50 subjects for detailed historical, functional, psychological, clinical, and electrophysiologic evaluation. Sixty-four percent of these 50 survivors complained of new symptoms of muscle pain, fatigue, and weakness after a period of prolonged stability. This led to changes in lifestyle or activity in only 18%. The likelihood of expressing new complaints was not related to present age or interval since polio, and electrophysiologic testing did not distinguish between those with or without new problems. The development of new difficulties in a limb was most strongly predicted by significant paralysis of that limb at the time of the acute illness. Patients with leg weakness were twice as likely to complain of new problems compared to those with arm weakness. Elevated creatine kinase levels were present only in those with new complaints. 
1	Bladder cancer. Human leukocyte antigen II, interleukin-6, and interleukin-6 receptor expression determined by the polymerase chain reaction. The prediction of tumour biology rarely rests upon a single characteristic of the malignancy. The analysis of a single gene can complement standard histologic evaluation. The investigation of new parameters as well as the routine clinical analysis of gene expression is often limited because of the small amount of tissue available. This is particularly true of de novo human bladder cancers because they are generally small or handled in such a way as to hinder the analysis of multiple different parameters. Analysis of expressed mRNA by the polymerase chain reaction (RNA/PCR) is a method that allows the development of a profile of bladder cancer gene expression. The authors report the use of the RNA/PCR method to examine in bladder cancer the expression of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II gene family (HLA-DR, DQ, and DP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). All de novo transitional cell carcinomas, one squamous carcinoma, and two transitional cell carcinoma cell lines expressed the majority of HLA class II genes. All samples expressed IL-6R RNA whereas production of IL-6 message was limited to one of the cell lines and to the high-grade bladder cancers. These results were combined with stage, grade, and DNA content to develop a profile of the cancers examined. Although an improved predictive index based on gene expression analysis by RNA/PCR has not been realized, a broader survey of human tumors for expression of these genes and others is likely to refine the classification of bladder cancer. 
4	Cardiac disease in the alcoholic patient. Ethanol in acute low doses is believed to be relatively nontoxic to the normal myocardium, despite data indicating low-level contractility impairment. In patients with myocardial disease, or as the serum ethanol concentration is increased to high levels, angina, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia may be potentiated. Chronic ethanol use, at moderate doses, may be protective against coronary artery disease, despite increased rates of hypertension. Alcohol consumption at high doses may result in dilated cardiomyopathy and a dismal prognosis. Alcohol abuse is associated with increased mortality. 
5	Primary peritoneal sarcoidosis. A 14-year-old male was admitted for the evaluation of tense exudative ascites. Despite thorough evaluation, the diagnosis remained cryptic until peritoneoscopy revealed diffuse studding of the entire visualized peritoneum with multiple miliary nodules, and peritoneal biopsy demonstrated multiple noncaseating epithelioid granulomas. After other causes were excluded, a diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered and confirmed with classic endobronchial findings at bronchoscopy. Involvement of the peritoneum with sarcoidosis is rare and, to our knowledge, only one other case describes this as the initial manifestation of this disease. 
3	Reversible nerve conduction block in patients with polyneuropathy after ultrasound thermotherapy at therapeutic dosage. This study investigated the effect of ultrasound on nerve conduction in patients with polyneuropathy. Eight able-bodied controls (Group C) and 16 patients with clinical and physiologic evidence of polyneuropathy were tested. Eight patients (Group NP) had no aching pain symptoms; eight patients (Group P) had severe aching pain, burning sensation, unpleasant tingling, and/or hyperesthesia in the lower extremities. For two minutes, therapeutic ultrasound in doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5W/cm2 were applied over the anterior surface of the leg along the pathway of the deep peroneal nerve. Peroneal nerve conduction studies were performed before, during, and after ultrasound treatment. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was recorded from the extensor digitorum brevis muscle. Nerve conduction studies on all eight patients in Group P revealed a significant decrease (41.4% and 44% reduced for doses of 1.0W/cm2 and 1.5W/cm2, respectively; p less than .05) in amplitude of CMAP (from baseline to the first negative peak), and an increase (6.4% and 6.7% increased for doses of 1.0W/cm2 and 1.5W/cm2, respectively; p less than .05) in proximal latency one minute after ultrasound application with a dose of 1.0 or 1.5W/cm2, but not with a dose of 0.5W/cm2 (p greater than 0.1). Changes returned to pretreatment values within five minutes of cessation of ultrasound therapy. In Groups C and NP, there were no significant changes in amplitudes of CMAP or proximal latency before, during, or after ultrasound therapy at a dose of 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5W/cm2. It was concluded that ultrasonic therapy with therapeutic dosage may cause a reversible conduction block on patients with painful polyneuropathy. 
5	Limitations of faecal chymotrypsin as a screening test for chronic pancreatitis. Faecal chymotrypsin was measured in patients with chronic pancreatitis and in healthy black urban and rural control subjects. In the patients, significantly lower values of faecal chymotrypsin were obtained (mean (SD) 2.4 1.79 U/g stool) whereas in urban control subjects, values were within the normal range (mean (SD) 13.2 (11.9)). In rural black control subjects, however, the faecal chymotrypsin value was significantly lower (mean (SD) 7.1 (5.1)) than in urban black control subjects. It is suggested that faecal pH may influence faecal chymotrypsin values. The mean faecal pH in rural black subjects (pH 6.14) was significantly lower than that in urban control subjects (pH 6.77) and in patients with chronic pancreatitis (pH 6.61). Moreover, mean faecal chymotrypsin is high (20.0 U/g stool) at a pH greater than 7. Between pH 6 and 7 the mean value drops to 8.6 U/g stool and below pH 6 mean faecal chymotrypsin is in the abnormal range (4.4 U/g stool). Hence, low values for faecal chymotrypsin may be due to lower faecal pH (less than 6) in healthy control subjects. For diagnostic purposes, the faecal pH value should be determined if a low faecal chymotrypsin value is obtained. 
5	Levels of serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in patients with infections. To clarify the physiologic roles of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in infectious states in vivo, we examined the serum levels of G-CSF in patients with infection. Serum samples from 24 patients in the acute stage of infection (14 men and 10 women, age 65 to 101, without hematologic disorders), as well as samples from 32 age-matched normal elderly volunteers were investigated. Sixteen of the initial 24 patients were reexamined after the recovery phase. G-CSF levels were examined by quantitative enzyme immunoassay. The G-CSF level in normal elderly controls, 25.3 +/- 19.7 pg/mL, was not different from that reported in other findings. There was no statistically significant relationship between their G-CSF level and peripheral white blood cell count or neutrophilic granulocyte count. The G-CSF level in the acute stage of infection was 731.8 +/- 895.0 pg/mL, with a range of 30 to 3,199 pg/mL. There was no significant difference in G-CSF levels between patients with respiratory tract infection and those with urinary tract infection. In all 16 cases examined, the serum G-CSF level in the acute stage of infection was significantly higher than that after recovery phase, the latter being the same as the level in normal elderly controls. G-CSF must therefore play a significant role in human infectious states in vivo. 
4	Collateral circulation in Kawasaki disease with coronary occlusion or severe stenosis. Forty patients with Kawasaki disease with severe coronary sequelae were investigated. All had at least a 90% reduction in the diameter of the major coronary artery. Collateral vessels were seen in 32 of 33 (97%) patients with total occlusion. All patients with severe stenosis but not total occlusion had no or poorly developed collateral vessels. Analysis according to the presence or absence of collateral vessels showed no significant differences in the results of treadmill stress testing and myocardial imaging between these two groups. In patients treated surgically, the abnormalities recognized by these tests were normalized or improved when the bypass was patent. These data indicate that collateral circulation in patients with Kawasaki disease cannot be seen angiographically unless there is total occlusion and the presence of collateral circulation cannot provide protection against stress-induced myocardial ischemia. 
3	Examination by logistic regression modelling of the variables which increase the relative risk of elderly women falling compared to elderly men. In a community based, prospective study to determine risk factors for falls, 465 women and 296 men 70 years and over were followed for 1 year and 507 falls were documented. A greater proportion of women (32.7%) than men (23.0%) experienced at least one fall in which there was no or minimal external contribution. Using unconditional logistic regression models we investigated the effect of physical and sociological variables on the sex difference in fall rate. Controlling for the variables age, use of psychotropic drugs, inability to rise from a chair without using arms, going outdoors less than daily and living alone decreased the relative risk of women falling compared to men from 2.02 (95% CI, 1.40-2.92) to 1.55 (95% CI 1.04-2.31). Some of the increased risk of falling associated with being a women was able to be explained and is potentially correctable. But even after controlling for the physical and social variables which we had assessed, women compared to men still had a significantly increased relative risk of falling. 
5	Mutations in the K-ras oncogene induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in preneoplastic and neoplastic rat colonic mucosa. These experiments were conducted to determine whether point mutations activating K-ras or H-ras oncogenes, induced by the procarcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), were detectable in preneoplastic or neoplastic rat colonic mucosa. Rats were injected weekly with diluent or DMH at 20 mg/kg body wt for 5, 10, 15, or 25 wk, killed, and their colons dissected. DNA was extracted from diluent-injected control animals, histologically normal colonic mucosa from carcinogen-treated animals, and from carcinomas. Ras mutations were characterized by differential hybridization using allele-specific oligonucleotide probes to polymerase chain reaction--amplified DNA, and confirmed by DNA sequencing. While no H-ras mutations were detectable in any group, K-ras (G to A) mutations were found in 66% of DMH-induced colon carcinomas. These mutations were at the second nucleotide of codons 12 or 13 or the first nucleotide of codon 59 of the K-ras gene. The same type of K-ras mutations were observed in premalignant colonic mucosa from 2 out of 11 rats as early as 15 wk after beginning carcinogen injections when no dysplasia, adenomas, or carcinomas were histologically evident, suggesting that ras mutation may be an early event in colon carcinogenesis. 
2	Percutaneous catheter drainage of infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections. Operative drainage is the cornerstone of therapy for pancreatic abscess. Recently it has been suggested that successful percutaneous catheter drainage of infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections may serve as definitive therapy. We undertook therapeutic, computed tomography-directed percutaneous drainage in a selected group of 29 patients with infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections. Twenty-three patients (79%) were successfully treated with percutaneous drainage. Of six patients (21%) representing failures of percutaneous drainage, four died and two recovered after operative drainage. The four patients who died had a mean APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II score of 23 and five of Ranson's prognostic signs. Ranson's signs and APACHE II scores were predictive of success and mortality. We conclude that in selected patients, infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections can be treated definitively with therapeutic percutaneous catheter drainage. Based on this experience, recommendations regarding patient selection are included.
