Changing pattern of pulmonary metastases with adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma: results from the multiinstitutional osteosarcoma study. The multiinstitutional osteosarcoma study (MIOS), a randomized trial of adjuvant therapy for osteosarcoma with a concurrent control group, registered 113 patients from June 1982 to August 1984. Preliminary analysis of the study indicated a significant event-free survival advantage favoring immediate adjuvant chemotherapy, (P less than .001). For patients treated with surgery alone or with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, the lungs were involved in more than 80% of the relapses. Patients relapsing after surgery alone tended to relapse earlier (P less than .01), had more pulmonary nodules (P less than .01), and had more frequent bilateral pulmonary involvement (P less than .01) than those treated with immediate postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy. However, patients relapsing after treatment with surgery alone experienced a significantly longer interval to further disease progression (P less than .01) and improved survival after relapse (P = .01) when compared with patients who relapsed after treatment with immediate adjuvant chemotherapy. The only factor predictive of survival after relapse was if the patient could be made surgically disease-free after initial relapse (P = .03). 
Prediction of major cardiac events after peripheral vascular surgery using dipyridamole echocardiography. Patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery are at increased risk of postoperative cardiac complications. To evaluate the role of dipyridamole echocardiography in predicting major cardiac events, 109 unselected patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgery were prospectively studied. Preoperative dipyridamole echocardiograms were interpreted by an echocardiographer unaware of all clinical data. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge by research physicians without knowledge of dipyridamole echocardiography results. Outcomes were classified using strict predefined criteria by reviewers unaware of other clinical and echocardiographic data. Of the 109 patients, 9 (8%) had positive studies defined as development of new regional wall motion abnormalities or worsening of preexistent wall motion abnormalities. Of these 9 patients, 7 had postoperative events, including 3 cardiac deaths, 1 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 2 with unstable angina, and 1 with pulmonary edema. Only 1 event occurred among the 100 patients with negative studies. The sensitivity and specificity of dipyridamole echocardiography for predicting cardiac events after vascular surgery were 88 and 98%, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 78 and 99%. The relative risk of having a cardiac event if dipyridamole echocardiography was abnormal was 78 (95% confidence interval, 11 to 564; p less than 0.0001). If these results are extended and confirmed by other investigators, preoperative dipyridamole echocardiography may be an important screening test for patients undergoing elective peripheral vascular surgery. 
Value of computed tomography of the lung in the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The treatment of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains controversial, since recurrence and the ultimate need for thoracostomy cannot be predicted. In the current study, computed tomography (CT) of the lung was performed prospectively on 26 consecutive patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax to determine whether the size and/or the number of apical blebs would correlate with recurrence and/or need for thoracostomy. Both the number of blebs and the bleb score (calculated by the number of blebs multiplied by a numeric value assigned a range of bleb sizes) of the affected lung was significantly greater in patients with a history of recurrent pneumothorax and/or ultimate need for thoracostomy as treatment. CT of the lung may be useful in predicting the natural history of pneumothorax. 
Intrahepatic recurrence after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma complicating cirrhosis. To determine whether a careful evaluation of tumor extension by preoperative computed tomography scan after intra-arterial injection of ultrafluid lipiodol and by intraoperative ultrasound examination reduced the recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma after resection, a series of 47 cirrhotic patients with a single tumor operated on from 1984 was studied. Alphafetoprotein level was less than 100 ng/mL in 26 patients (55%), size of the tumor was less than 5 cm in 28 patients (59%), and capsule was present in 30 patients (63%). The resection was performed with free margin measuring 1 cm or more. The overall cumulative survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 35% and 17%, respectively. Intrahepatic recurrence was observed in 28 patients (60%), located less than 2 cm from the resection margin in only four patients. The cumulative intrahepatic recurrence rate at 3 years was 81% and was significantly higher in patients with tumor greater than or equal to 5 cm and in patients with preoperative alphafetoprotein level of greater than or equal to 100 ng/mL. In this series the cumulative intrahepatic recurrence rate at 5 years was 100%. This high recurrence rate after resection, even with careful evaluation of tumor extension, indicates that liver transplantation might be envisaged for the treatment of cirrhotic patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Preclinical Parkinson's disease: detection of motor and nonmotor manifestations. The advent of possible protective therapies for Parkinson's disease has created a need for methods of diagnosing the disease before the clinical features become fully evident. As a number of motor and nonmotor manifestations of the disease emerge months to years before a diagnosis can be made, a battery of clinical tests might be sufficient to identify individuals at an earlier stage than is currently possible using the standard history and physical examination. A list of questions regarding possible risk factors, specific symptoms, and observations of family members could be combined in a self-administered questionnaire that might identify individuals with a high probability of early, but otherwise undiagnosable, Parkinson's disease. Identification of subtle motor features is another possible screening method. For example, handwriting and speech are commonly affected prior to diagnosis; thus, automated analysis of these motor actions might also provide detection of incipient disease. 
Heart rate variability in patients with ventricular arrhythmias: effect of antiarrhythmic drugs. Antiarrhythmic Drug Evaluation Group (ADEG). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether heart rate variability could be reliably assessed in patients with ventricular arrhythmias and to evaluate whether it is affected by antiarrhythmic drugs. The study was based on an analysis of 239 ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings obtained from 67 patients with frequent and complex ventricular arrhythmias enrolled in the Antiarrhythmic Drug Evaluation Group (ADEG) study. In each recording, after exclusion of premature ventricular complexes, the number of times during a 24 h period in which two consecutive sinus RR intervals differed by more than 50 ms was calculated. The total 24 h count from each recording was then used as an index of heart rate variability. This method is a reliable marker of cardiac parasympathetic activity. Recordings were analyzed at baseline (n = 56), during long-term treatment with amiodarone (n = 17), flecainide (n = 22) or propafenone (n = 17) and after washout in selected patients (n = 5). Despite the presence of a different number of arrhythmias, total 24 h counts in the same patient appeared reproducible over time (r = 0.83 between two different recordings, n = 49, p less than 0.0001). Baseline counts (median 1,698, range 26 to 13,648) were not correlated (r = 0.15) with the number of arrhythmias. The three antiarrhythmic drugs had a disparate effect on total 24 h counts: no change was observed in patients treated with amiodarone (median percent change [delta %]-8, p = NS), whereas a significant (p less than 0.025) decrease occurred in patients treated with flecainide (median delta % -56%) or propafenone (median delta % -64%). 
Blood transfusion and survival after laryngectomy for laryngeal carcinoma. Survival of patients with surgically treated malignancy may be adversely affected by blood transfusion. Immune suppression due to transfusion has been implicated but remains unproven. We conducted a study of 240 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx undergoing laryngectomy to assess the effect of per-operative blood transfusion on survival. 
Inclusion body myositis with cricopharyngeus muscle involvement and severe dysphagia. A patient with inclusion body myositis (IBM) is presented. Unusual aspects of this case include a myopathy of 36 years duration, severe dysphagia due to cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction, improvement with cricopharyngeus myotomy, and a diagnostic cricopharyngeus muscle biopsy. 
Apnoea, bradycardia, and oxygen saturation in preterm infants. To analyse the effects of apnoea and bradycardia on the oxygen saturation (SaO2) of preterm infants and to make recommendations for apnoea alarm limits, polygraphic recordings were made on 89 occasions of 27 preterm infants; 1029 apnoeic episodes were analysed. Reduction in SaO2 was positively correlated with duration of apnoea, but the scatter of results was such that reductions in SaO2 of up to 40% occurred with apnoeas of less than 10 seconds duration. The median initial SaO2 was significantly lower in those episodes that resulted in bradycardia (92% compared with 95%), and there was also a significantly greater reduction in median SaO2 (9% compared with 5%). This study illustrates the difficulty of setting alarm limits for the detection of apnoea. We suggest that rather than simply detecting apnoea it is more appropriate to monitor heart rate and SaO2 in infants with recurrent apnoea. 
Visual field changes following hepatic transplantation in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis. A case of severe visual field restriction complicating primary biliary cirrhosis is described. The clinical features demonstrated vitamin A deficiency which did not respond to oral supplements of vitamin A. Hepatic transplantation restored the visual fields to near normal. 
Repeat infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in patients with acute myocardial infarction and early recurrent myocardial ischemia. When conventional treatment of patients with early clinical reinfarction after thrombolytic therapy fails, mechanical revascularization may be attempted. An alternative strategy, repeat thrombolytic infusions, is reported. Fifty-two patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with one or two additional thrombolytic infusions of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) because of nonsustained ischemia after initial treatment with rt-PA or streptokinase. Thirty-five patients received the second infusion within 1 h of the first; 13 patients received the second infusion 1 to 72 h after the first and 4 patients received it later during their hospitalization. Bleeding complications occurred in 10 patients (19%); however, most of these were minor (no intracranial bleeding) and only 2 patients required blood transfusion. In 14 patients in whom the decrease in fibrinogen and plasminogen levels was measured after the first and second infusions, this decrease was only 25% and 63%, respectively--only slightly higher than the 22% and 53% decreases measured in 63 patients who had only one rt-PA infusion. In 44 patients (85%), the acute ischemia resolved completely within 1 h after initiation of the second infusion. In 23 patients (44%), pain and ST segment elevation did not recur and invasive coronary intervention was avoided. Thus, repeat rt-PA infusions can stabilize a substantial number of patients with acute reinfarction and, even when relief is temporary, repeat rt-PA infusions can minimize myocardial damage while patients await mechanical revascularization. 
Aortic sepsis: is there a role for in situ graft reconstruction? Conventional extraanatomic reconstruction for aortic sepsis is associated with a significant risk of operative death, as well as frequent late complications. We evaluated in situ aortic grafting in the treatment of primary or graft-related aortic infection. Eleven selected patients underwent in situ aortic graft reconstruction in the setting of mycotic aneurysm (n = 5), secondarily infected aortic aneurysm (n = 1), primary aortoenteric fistula (n = 1), and secondary aortoenteric fistula (n = 4). All patients survived: follow-up from 10 to 130 months reveals no evidence for graft thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm, new or recurrent aortoenteric fistula, or subsequent aortic operations in any patient. A literature review produced 110 cases of aortic sepsis managed by in situ aortic reconstruction during the last decade. Thirty-two patients (29%) either died in the operative period or suffered a lethal late complication associated with their aortic reconstruction. This mortality rate declined to 21% if patients undergoing incomplete removal of a contaminated graft were excluded, and to 19% with the addition of our 11 patients. Both our experience and that described in the literature suggest that, in properly-selected patients, in situ aortic graft replacement may be a rational treatment option for localized or circumscribed aortic sepsis. 
Cardiac tamponade early after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction: a rare but not reported hemorrhagic complication. Among 392 consecutive patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and treated with thrombolytic drugs, 4 patients (1%) developed an early hemorrhagic pericardial effusion (without ventricular wall rupture) evolving within 24 h to cardiogenic shock consequent to cardiac tamponade. They all suffered from a large anterior myocardial infarction treated within 4 h after onset of symptoms with intravenous anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (one case), recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (two cases) or streptokinase (one case), anticoagulation with heparin (all cases) and aspirin (three cases). As soon as pericardial effusion was established by echocardiography, emergency percutaneous pericardiocentesis was performed at the bedside 20 +/- 6 h after thrombolytic therapy was started. This corrected immediately the clinical and hemodynamic status of each patient and a catheter was left in the pericardial space for 34 +/- 18 h. Thus, in the presence of unexplained clinical and hemodynamic deterioration occurring during the first 24 h after thrombolytic treatment of a large myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade should be suspected. Immediate percutaneous pericardiocentesis followed by continuous drainage is a simple and definitive treatment for this complication. 
The GTPase superfamily: a conserved switch for diverse cell functions. Proteins that bind and hydrolyse GTP are being discovered at a rapidly increasing rate. Each of these many GTPases acts as a molecular switch whose 'on' and 'off' states are triggered by binding and hydrolysis of GTP. Conserved structure and mechanism in myriad versions of the switch--in bacteria, yeast, flies and vertebrates--suggest that all derive from a single primordial protein, repeatedly modified in the course of evolution to perform a dazzling variety of functions. 
Cavernosometry: methodology and reproducibility with and without pharmacological agents in the evaluation of venous impotence. Venous impotence can be evaluated by cavernosometry, although this is a controversial issue. We have evaluated various techniques for cavernosometry: with and without intracavernous papaverine, with different dosages and modalities, with different modes of induction flow and at various intracavernous pressures. A standardised technique was tested and retested in 32 impotent men. If pharmacocavernosometry is accepted as the most reliable test and a maintenance flow less than 20 ml/min indicates optimal venous occlusion, plain cavernosometry gave 6% false positive and 16% false negative results. Pharmacocavernosometry was found to be highly reproducible with regard to maintenance flow for patients thought to have optimal venous occlusion and for those with supposed leakage. The induction flow was of no diagnostic value. After injection of papaverine the maintenance flow became a reproducible parameter for quantifying venous outflow and could be measured with an intracavernous pressure equivalent to systolic blood pressure to minimise cavernous arterial inflow and increase reproducibility. 
Immediate postoperative aspirin improves vein graft patency early and late after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. A placebo-controlled, randomized study. BACKGROUND. The efficacy of aspirin for prevention of thrombotic graft occlusion after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) depends both on the dosage and time window of administration. Early and late graft patency were therefore assessed in a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin, 324 mg daily, given within 1 hour of CABG. METHODS AND RESULTS. Angiographic graft patency was determined at 1 week (231 patients) and 1 year (219 patients) after CABG. The early vein graft occlusion rate was 1.6% on aspirin and 6.2% on placebo (p = 0.004), and late graft occlusion rate was 5.8% on continued aspirin and 11.6% on placebo (p = 0.01). New graft occlusion between 1 week and 1 year was less common in patients on aspirin than on placebo (4.3% versus 7.4%, p = 0.013). The protective effect of aspirin against occlusion persisted in most subgroups of graft type, graft flow, diameter of recipient artery, location of grafted artery, and endarterectomy. Mean chest tube blood loss for the first 24 hours was 571 ml for the aspirin group and 563 ml for the placebo group. Red cell transfusion requirements were 902 ml in the aspirin group and 934 ml in the placebo group (p = NS). The reoperation rate was 4.8% in the aspirin group and 1% in the placebo group (p = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS. Immediate postoperative administration of aspirin (324 mg) improves early graft patency and, with continued usage, protects against further occlusion up to 1 year after CABG. Postoperative blood loss was similar in the two groups; however, aspirin was associated with a nonsignificant higher rate of reoperation. 
An autopsy study of the incidence of lacunes in relation to age, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis. We investigated selected features of lacunes in 1,086 necropsy cases. Lacunes were found in brains from patients above the age of 40 years and were most common in brains from persons in their sixties but decreased in number in brains from older persons. The most common site of lacunes was the frontal lobe white matter, followed by the putamen, pons, parietal lobe white matter, thalamus, and caudate nucleus in descending order of frequency. By dividing the 1,086 cases into three groups according to blood pressure, we found more lacunes in the hypertensive and borderline hypertensive groups than in the normotensive group; the average number of lacunes per brain in each group was 3.61, 2.77, and 1.15, respectively. Diastolic hypertension was more closely related to the number of lacunes than was systolic hypertension. The extent of arteriolosclerosis of the medullary arteries in the frontal lobe white matter was measured and compared with the number of lacunes. There was a close correlation between lacunes and arterioloslerosis in all age groups. 
Gonadotropin-secreting pineal teratoma causing precocious puberty. A case of precocious puberty in a 7-year-old boy with a tumor of the pineal region is reported. Human chorionic gonadotropin levels were elevated in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Endocrinological evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis demonstrated a normal prepubertal response. The tumor was resected and proved to be an immature teratoma. Human chorionic gonadotropin levels were markedly elevated in the tumor cyst fluid. Sexual precocity regressed and human chorionic gonadotropin levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid fell to normal after surgery, suggesting that the precocious puberty was secondary to ectopic human chorionic gonadotropin production by the pineal teratoma. 
Paroxysmal tremor and orofacial dyskinesia secondary to a biopterin synthesis defect. We report a child with a systemic biopterin synthesis defect due to an absence of 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase who had an unusual presentation, with three episodes of coarse "rubral-like" tremor in arms and legs orofacial dyskinesia between the ages of 3 and 6 months. Response to levodopa therapy and CSF neurotransmitter metabolite concentrations before and after therapy suggests that his clinical syndrome resulted from a secondary dopamine deficiency. 
Stenoses of vascular anastomoses after hepatic transplantation: treatment with balloon angioplasty. Vascular complications after liver transplantation include occlusion or stenosis at the sites of anastomosis in the hepatic artery, portal vein, and vena cava. From our experience with more than 600 liver transplants, vascular stenoses have been identified in 10 patients and treated by balloon angioplasty in nine. Three patients with hepatic artery stenosis and deteriorating graft function were treated by balloon angioplasty with a coaxial technique. A specially designed catheter facilitated a successful femoral artery approach. Portal vein stenoses in three patients resulted in portal hypertension. These were treated by balloon dilatation via transhepatic catheterization of the portal vein. Stenoses of the suprahepatic caval anastomosis were dilated in three patients with severe lower limb edema. Technical success was achieved in all three cases of hepatic artery stenosis with improvement in graft function. Recurrent stenoses in two patients were successfully treated with repeated dilatations. Portal hypertension resolved in two of three patients after portal venoplasty. Dilatation of a caval stenosis resulted in the resolution of leg edema in all three cases. Repeated dilatation was required in one case. No reduction in the portal venous pressure gradient occurred after venoplasty in one case, and an ultimately fatal caval thrombosis developed in one patient with caval stenosis before venoplasty could be performed. Our experience suggests that balloon angioplasty of arterial and venous stenoses complicating hepatic transplantation carries little risk and is a useful procedure for the treatment of these problems. 
Superior vena caval obstruction in patients with gut failure receiving home parenteral nutrition. Clinical suspicion and venographic conformation were used to diagnose 15 cases of superior vena caval obstruction (SVCO) in 107 home parenteral nutrition (HPN) patients over 379 cumulative years of HPN (3.9 cases/100 patient-years). Patients with SVCO had been on HPN a mean of 51.5 months and had used 6.2 (range 1-50) central catheters, including short- and long-term, before SVCO was diagnosed. The frequency of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with SVCO was approximately the same as that in our general HPN population. Positive blood cultures were present immediately preceding the diagnosis of SVCO in 40% (six of 15) of cases. Atypical line placements were noted in two cases. The most common management strategies employed were conversion to enteral feedings in five patients and placement of a new catheter directly into the right atrium by thoracotomy in another five patients. Two of the five with right atrial catheters experienced a postpericardiotomy syndrome (fever, pericardial rub, and pulmonary infiltrates) that responded promptly to indomethacin. The most significant long-term sequela of SVCO was the need for a left jugular vein to right atrial appendage bypass in one patient with chronic venous congestion from her SVCO. Once the SVCO is confirmed, systemic heparinization provides immediate antithrombotic effect and minimizes the risk of pulmonary embolism. The use of streptokinase may result in rapid thrombolysis. 
The spectrum of vertical gaze palsy following unilateral brainstem stroke. A single unilateral lesion, near the midline, may interrupt the pathways involved in vertical gaze just before and after they decussate, inducing an anatomically unilateral, but functionally bilateral, lesion. We report 11 patients with supranuclear vertical gaze palsies (two with conjugate upgaze palsy, four with combined up- and downgaze palsies, two with monocular elevation palsy, and three with vertical "one-and-a-half" syndrome) due to unilateral midbrain strokes. 
Lung asbestos fiber content and mesothelioma cell type, site, and survival. All ascertainable cases of malignant mesothelioma in Australia were notified to a national surveillance program in the period January 1, 1980 to December 31, 1985. There were 854 cases obtained and 823 confirmed on clinical (77) or histologic (746) ground. Tumor site was known in 759 cases (685 pleural and 74 peritoneal). Lung fiber content analyses by light microscopy and analytic transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray analysis were done on 226 cases in which postmortem material was available, using the method of Rogers. Cell type was determined by a five-member expert panel of pathologists appointed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. There was a statistically significant trend between lung fiber content (fibers/g dry lung) and cell type from epithelial (low fiber content) through mixed to sarcomatous (high fiber content). This trend was most apparent for total uncoated fibers (chi-square = 6.8, df = 1, P less than 0.01) and crocidolite (chi-square = 6.7, df = 1, P less than 0.01). Lung fiber content also was associated with tumor site; higher lung fiber content being associated with peritoneal tumors. This relationship was significant for all fiber content measures except chrysotile and was independent of the fiber content-cell type relationship (log-linear analysis). Survival from time of provisional diagnosis was significantly longer for epithelial (mean, 13 months; standard deviation [SD], 12.8) and mixed (mean, 10.2 months; SD, 8.7) types than sarcomatous cell types (mean, 5.8 months; SD, 6.5; P less than 0.0001, by analysis of variance on log10 survival time). Survival time was significantly greater for pleural tumors (mean, 11.4 months; SD, 13.4) than peritoneal tumors (mean, 8.6 months; SD, 12.5) (P less than 0.005, by Student's t test on log10 survival time). 
Rates of vertebral bone loss before and after liver transplantation in women with primary biliary cirrhosis. Atraumatic fractures caused by osteoporosis may be a serious complication of primary biliary cirrhosis. Mean (+/- S.D.) bone mineral density in the lumbar spine in 210 ambulatory women with primary biliary cirrhosis was 1.02 +/- 0.19 gm/cm2, 7% lower than that in 139 age-matched normal women (after adjustment for age and body weight) (p less than 0.001). Bone mineral density in the lumbar spine was inversely related to a risk score index of liver disease severity (r = -0.29, p less than 0.001). The mean rate of bone loss in 105 of these 210 women was 2%/yr +/- 4%/yr, twice as great as in the 139 normal women (p less than 0.02). In 20 women with primary biliary cirrhosis followed up after orthotopic liver transplantation, bone mineral density in the lumbar spine decreased at 3 mo (p less than 0.01), and this decrease may have resulted in atraumatic fractures in 13 of them. Bone mineral density in the lumbar spine then increased (p less than 0.01) so that by 12 mo the median bone mineral density in the lumbar spine was similar to that before transplantation and by 24 mo it was 5% above it. Therefore we conclude that the progressive bone loss observed in primary biliary cirrhosis (which is further accentuated immediately after transplantation) may be halted, and the bone mass may be restored toward normal within 2 to 3 yr after orthotopic liver transplantation. 
Association of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in carcinoma of the breast with infiltrating lobular carcinoma. An autopsy study. We analyzed the autopsy records of 261 patients with breast carcinoma, who died at The Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, for the presence of metastases to the central nervous system, particularly for the presence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Metastases to the central nervous system were found in 41 (18.1%) of 226 patients who had metastatic cancer. In 24 cases (10.6%), metastases were seen in brain parenchyma; in 11 cases (4.9%), only dura mater was involved, and in six cases (2.6%), leptomeningeal carcinomatosis was found. All patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis showed some symptoms of central nervous system involvement while alive. The patients died between 2 weeks and 2 months after the onset of central nervous system symptoms. Four of six patients with such a complication presented with locally advanced or disseminated carcinoma on the first admission. With regard to histologic findings, three patients had infiltrating lobular carcinoma, two had infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and one had mixed infiltrating lobular and ductal carcinoma, with a metastasizing lobular component. Metastases to the brain parenchyma were found exclusively in infiltrating ductal carcinoma. We stress that infiltrating lobular carcinoma represents a distinctive type of breast cancer with an unusual propensity to disseminate into leptomeninges, as this occurred in almost 14% of all cases of infiltrating lobular carcinoma in our series in contrast to a 1% incidence in cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma. 
Primary anetoderma associated with a wide spectrum of autoimmune abnormalities. Although the underlying pathologic mechanisms of primary anetoderma have not yet been identified, data suggest the participation of an immunologic mechanism in some cases. In a woman with clinical and histopathologic features of primary anetoderma (Jadassohn-Pellizzari type) of 30 years' duration, laboratory investigation disclosed positive antinuclear factor, hypocomplementemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, granular deposits of immunoreactants along the dermoepidermal junction, and fibrillar deposits in the papillary dermis. In addition, she was found to have autoimmune hemolysis and circulating lupus anticoagulant associated with recurrent deep-vein thrombosis and a history of Graves' disease (starting 5 years after onset of primary anetoderma). To our knowledge, none of the latter three autoimmune conditions has been previously associated with primary anetoderma. 
Value of ultrasound in differentiating causes of persistent vomiting in infants. A prospective study of abdominal ultrasound was undertaken in 100 consecutive infants who presented with a history of persistent vomiting aged 5 to 90 days. Each infant had a 'test feed' followed by an ultrasonographic scan of the pylorus at the cotside. On test feeding a palpable tumour was evident in 38 infants. On real time ultrasound using the criteria for diagnosing pyloric stenosis, these 38 infants as well as six others were documented as having pyloric stenosis. In the other 56 patients the vomiting settled in six and a barium examination was performed on the remaining 50. This confirmed gastro-oesophageal reflux in 46, two of whom had an associated hiatus hernia, one with a duodenal malrotation, and three were reported as normal. Ultrasound of the abdomen is an accurate, reliable, and rapid screening method to differentiate the causes of severe vomiting in infancy. 
Factors affecting the patency of stents in malignant biliary obstructive disease: univariate and multivariate analysis. To investigate the factors affecting the patency of biliary stents, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses in 370 straight stents with diameters of 10- to 12-French gauge which had been inserted singly as palliative treatment in 228 patients with malignant biliary obstructive disease. In the analysis of 226 first stents, advanced age of patients and higher serum bilirubin levels before insertion were found to be significant unfavorable factors limiting the duration of stent function. Overall, older age, male sex, no stent cleaning, and insertion on three or more occasions were significant unfavorable prognostic factors for patency. The risk of occlusion for stents inserted on three or more occasions was 2.32 times that of the first stent insertion. The median duration of patency of first, second, and subsequent stents was 177, 98, and 97 days, respectively. Diagnosis and the area of stenosis were unrelated to patency. No predictive significance of length or size of stent between 10- and 12-French gauge was found in our study. 
Biological significance of tissue plasminogen activator content in brain tumors. Fresh brain-tumor samples were obtained at operation and analyzed for their content of tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) using an activity assay (gel chromatography zymogram) and an enzyme-linked immunospecific assay. The specimens were taken from 23 glioblastomas, 35 metastatic tumors, 42 meningiomas, 16 low-grade gliomas, and seven acoustic neurinomas; seven specimens were from normal brain. A strong correlation was found between the results of the two assays (r = 0.77, p less than 0.0001). There was a threefold difference in the tPA content of the benign tumors as compared to malignant tumors (p = 0.0006), the latter having less tPA. Histologically benign meningiomas contained higher tPA than malignant meningiomas (p = 0.01); however, the difference between low-grade gliomas and high-grade gliomas was less evident. Overall regression analysis data have shown an inverse relationship between the tissue content in tPA and the presence and degree of tumor necrosis and peritumoral brain edema (p = 0.004 and p = 0.0004, respectively). This finding was most consistent in the glioblastoma group where the correlation coefficient values were r = 0.53 and r = -0.55, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the tissue tPA content and the age and sex, steroid use, or plasma tPA of the patients or the duration of symptoms. In summary, this is the first demonstration of tPA in a large series of human brain tumors and in normal brain. The differences observed have clear biological significance and, although the source of tPA in tumor tissue is still unknown, a relative reduction in tPA in tumor tissue may play an integral role in the development of tissue necrosis and tissue edema. The lack of tPA in tumor necrosis was not due to tissue destruction and cell death since urokinase was readily detectable in that tissue. 
Does selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract prevent multiple organ failure? An experimental study. Gut bacteria have been incriminated as causing or contributing to generalized sepsis with multiple organ failure in severely ill patients, and selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract of Enterobacteriaceae has been claimed to decrease septic complications in these patients. We studied the effects of selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract on survival and organ function in an experimental model of sepsis with multiple organ failure. Wistar rats were inoculated intraperitoneally with zymosan and randomized into control or treatment groups (trimethoprim or streptomycin sulfate). Selective decontamination effectively prevented bacterial translocation of Enterobacteriaceae. However, only early mortality was decreased, and only so in the streptomycin-treated rats. Selective decontamination did not result in a significantly better condition of the surviving animals on day 12. 
Polycystic ovaries: do these represent a specific endocrinopathy? Serum pituitary gonadotrophins, oestradiol, testosterone and insulin pulse patterns were examined at 15-min intervals for 6 h in 40 women with a previous diagnosis of polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) based on clinical, endocrinological and ultrasound data. Age, duration of symptoms, body mass index (BMI) and ovarian volume showed no correlation with the 6-h mean value of any hormone and testosterone blood levels did not correlate with those of insulin. Some patients had high and others low LH pulse pattern components, and few had an inverted LH:FSH ratio. Morphological polycystic ovarian changes may be a reflection of various rather than a single pattern of gonadotrophin secretion. 
Autonomic nervous system dysregulation in human hypertension. An increased sympathetic drive combined with decreased parasympathetic inhibition is found in patients with borderline hypertension, who characteristically have rapid heart rates, high cardiac output and relatively normal vascular resistance (hyperkinetic state). In established hypertension, cardiac output is normal, vascular resistance is elevated and signs of increased sympathetic drive are absent. Apparently hemodynamics and sympathetic drive change during hypertension. The mechanism of the hemodynamic transition in the course of hypertension is well understood. Cardiac output returns from elevated to normal values as beta-adrenergic receptors down-regulate and stroke volume decreases (due to decreased cardiac compliance). The high blood pressure induces vascular hypertrophy, which in turn leads to increased vascular resistance. The mechanism of the change of sympathetic tone from elevated in borderline hypertension to apparently normal in established hypertension can best be explained within the conceptual framework of the "blood-pressure-seeking" properties of the brain. In hypertension, the central nervous system seeks to maintain systemic blood pressure at the higher level. As hypertension advances and vascular hypertrophy develops, arterioles become hyperresponsive to vasoconstriction. At this point, less sympathetic drive is needed to maintain pressure-elevating vasoconstriction, and the central sympathetic drive is down-regulated. The etiology of increased sympathetic drive in hypertension remains unresolved. Subjects with increased sympathetic drive are also usually overweight and have elevated levels of insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as decreased high-density lipoproteins. Future research must focus on the link between coronary risk factors and sympathetic overactivity in hypertension. 
Miller-Dieker syndrome with ring chromosome 17. A girl presented at 6 weeks of age with failure to thrive and arching of the back. She had various dysmorphic features, hepatosplenomegaly, and developmental delay. The electroencephalogram and cranial ultrasound were abnormal, and a computed tomogram showed lissencephaly and apparent agenesis of the corpus callosum. Because of frequent aspiration she became oxygen dependent. She later developed intractable convulsions and died at the age of 9 months. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis of paramedic emergency medical services in the treatment of prehospital cardiopulmonary arrest. STUDY OBJECTIVES: 1) Identification of marginal costs associated with prehospital resuscitation of cardiopulmonary arrest; 2) Determination of cost effectiveness for such resuscitation; and 3) Comparison of cost effectiveness of paramedic care with selected other medical interventions. DESIGN: Retrospective review of 190 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. SETTING: City limits of a midsized southwestern city. The events studied took place outside of medical facilities. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for whom the EMS system was activated by a 911 telephone request for emergency medical assistance. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cost, including training, personnel, equipment, and response time maintenance, per year of life saved was found to be $8,886.00 for paramedic care. This result was compared with published cost-effectiveness figures for heart transplantation, liver transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, and chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Paramedic care was more cost effective, as measured by cost per year of life saved, than organ transplantation and chemotherapy for acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: Out-of-hospital treatment by paramedics of cardiopulmonary arrest is more cost effective than heart, liver, bone marrow transplantation, or curative chemotherapy for acute leukemia. 
The arrhythmogenicity of theophylline. A multivariate analysis of clinical determinants. OBJECTIVE: to determine the relation of serum theophylline concentrations (STC) to the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias in a population of hospitalized patients. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of 100 patients receiving theophylline who had electrocardiograms at the time STC had been obtained. Categorization was based on STC without knowledge of clinical status: group 1 (25) had STC less than 2.5 mg/L; group 2 (25), STC greater than or equal to 2.5 less than 10 (6.2 +/- 0.4) mg/L; group 3 (25), STC greater than or equal to 10 less than or equal to 20 (15.8 +/- 0.4) mg/L; and group 4 (25), STC greater than 20 (27.8 +/- 1.1) mg/L. SETTING: A university-affiliated teaching hospital. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the patients were receiving theophylline in an oral form, with a similar distribution found in all groups. Groups were not different with respect to age, clinical diagnoses, electrocardiographic patterns, arterial pH or gases, serum calcium, or treatment with beta-agonists. Although fewer patients in group 1 were receiving steroids than those in the other groups, and serum potassium was lower in group 3 than in group 1 (4.0 +/- 0.6 vs 4.5 +/- 0.5 mEq/L, p less than 0.05), on multivariate analysis, serum potassium was not an independent predictor of arrhythmia, and treatment with steroids or digoxin was, at most, only weakly associated with the presence of arrhythmia. Heart rate was directly related to STC (r = 0.64, p less than 0.01), and STC was the strongest independent predictor of arrhythmia in this population. Although only 20 percent of patients in group 1 or 2 had arrhythmias, 48 percent of group 3 (p less than 0.05) and 56 percent of group 4 (p less than 0.05) had this finding. Moreover, the odds ratio of group 3 having an arrhythmia compared with group 1 was 3.7, 1.5 to 11.7, p less than 0.01. Multifocal atrial tachycardia was found in 8 percent of the patients in group 3 and 16 percent in group 4 but in none of the patients in groups 1 or 2. Two patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia died suddenly within 24 hours of having their STC measurement; none had concomitant ventricular ectopy. CONCLUSION: Theophylline causes tachycardia and serious arrhythmias even at STC considered to be therapeutic. Multifocal atrial tachycardia, an arrhythmia associated with use of this drug, may herald sudden cardiac death. 
Fourth branchial pouch sinus: diagnosis and treatment. The fourth branchial pouch sinus (FBPS) is a rare translaryngeal anomaly with diverse manifestations, including neonatal stridor and recurrent deep neck infection. Review of the world literature reveals 23 reports of sinuses consistent with fourth pouch origin. We present two additional cases, including the only example of a right-sided FBPS. Retrograde excision, beginning at the piriform apex, ensures complete removal of the tract and protection of the recurrent nerve. The posterior border of the thyroid ala must be resected or retracted for adequate exposure. Failure to remove the translaryngeal portion of the tract almost guarantees recurrence. 
Suprascapular nerve entrapment. A series of 27 cases. Suprascapular nerve entrapment is an acquired neuropathy secondary to compression of the nerve in the bony suprascapular notch. A series of 27 cases, the largest reported to date, is presented and examined as to the best and most appropriate method of diagnosis and treatment. The entity is described in detail as to its origin, anatomy, and pathophysiology. 
Acute effects of ethanol on cultured myocardial cells: an ultrastructural study. Myocardial cells in monolayer culture were examined ultrastructurally at various times (5 min-24 hr) after addition of ethanol (12.5-500 mM). At 5 min, all concentrations of ethanol induced mitochondrial fusion and a remarkable increase in glycogen granules, and the mitochondrial outer membrane seemed more fragile. These initial ultrastructural changes then recovered with time. Glycogen granules were decreased, then returned to normal more rapidly as the ethanol concentration was increased. Mitochondrial fusion and fragile appearance of the outer membrane were hardly seen at 1 hr in the presence of 12.5 or 50 mM ethanol, but were still evident with higher ethanol concentrations (200 and 500 mM), though less frequently than at 5 and 30 min. Furthermore, 'giant mitochondria' (with at least a five-fold increase in sectional area) appeared in the presence of 200 and 500 mM ethanol with increasing time of exposure. These results are discussed in relation to the direct effects of ethanol. 
Effect of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunization on prolonged apnea or bradycardia in siblings of sudden infant death syndrome victims. To determine whether the incidence of apnea or bradycardia increased after the first diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) immunization in 100 subsequent siblings of victims of sudden infant death syndrome, we examined data obtained from floppy disk recordings attached to apnea-bradycardia monitors for episodes of apnea lasting 15 seconds or longer and episodes of bradycardia lasting 10 seconds or longer. The data were divided into three periods: (1) 10 days before the first DTP immunization was received (pre-DTP period), (2) 10 days immediately after the DTP (DTP period), and (3) 10 days after the DTP period (post-DTP period). Seventeen infants had at least one episode of prolonged apnea or prolonged bradycardia either before or after the 30-day study period (eight before only, eight after only, and one before and after). None of the infants had episodes of apnea lasting 15 seconds or more or bradycardia lasting 10 seconds or more during the pre-DTP or DTP period. One episode of apnea, 16 seconds long, and one episode of bradycardia lasting 11 seconds occurred in the post-DTP period. These results failed to confirm the clinical impression that DTP immunizations are associated with an increased frequency and severity of prolonged apnea. They also place in question the utility of assessing an infant's response to a DTP immunization to determine continued risk of apnea and bradycardia before home monitoring is discontinued. 
Kikuchi-Fujimoto syndrome during pregnancy. Necrotizing lymphadenitis of the Kikuchi-Fujimoto type developed in our patient during her first trimester of pregnancy, but she carried the infant to full term with no apparent adverse effect. Two subsequent pregnancies were not associated with reactivation of the disorder, nor with any recognizable adverse effect on the fetuses. A pregnancy should not be terminated because of Kikuchi-Fujimoto necrotizing lymphadenitis when it develops during the first trimester of pregnancy. 
Management of valvular heart disease: an illustrative cases approach. As indicated by the 22 illustrative cases included in this monograph, a stepwise approach to the assessment of valvular heart disease provides the information necessary to make good clinical decisions. The ECG and chest x-ray add useful information to the history and physical examination. Echocardiography, Doppler, and color flow Doppler techniques have an important role in defining the presence and severity of valvular stenosis and regurgitation. Nuclear techniques provide useful information about global biventricular systolic function, regional wall motion, and myocardial perfusion. Exercise testing is most valuable in confirming objectively the patient's functional status and exercise tolerance. Newer imaging techniques, such as cine CT and MRI, are capable of displaying and measuring cardiac chamber size and myocardial thickness; however, visualization of the cardiac valves and demonstration of flow abnormalities are difficult, limiting the current usefulness of these techniques in patients with valvular heart disease. 
Color Doppler ultrasound imaging in iatrogenic arterial injuries. Pulsatile masses following arterial puncture for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures may represent false aneurysms or noncommunicating periarterial hematomas with transmitted arterial pulsation. Color Doppler ultrasound imaging was used in 27 patients with pulsatile groin masses. Of these 27 patients, 23 were diagnosed as having pseudoaneurysms and 5 as having periarterial hematomas. The pseudoaneurysms were confirmed at surgical exploration, and the periarterial hematomas were all observed longitudinally with spontaneous resolution. With a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100% in this clinical study, color Doppler ultrasound imaging appears to be the diagnostic modality of choice for detecting false aneurysms following transarterial procedures, obviating the need for additional invasive diagnostic procedures. 
Diagnostic problems in tissues previously sampled by fine-needle aspiration. Unusual tissue changes in needle tracts after fine-needle aspiration were studied in two specimens. One specimen, a 3.0 x 2.5 cm mesenteric nodule, was found six days after a nondiagnostic transabdominal fine-needle aspiration of a retroperitoneal mass. At frozen-section examination, the nodule had proliferating spindle-shaped cells interspersed with adipocytes that raised the possibility of well-differentiated liposarcoma. On permanent sections, however, there was fat necrosis and reactive spindle-shaped cells that immunohistochemically were consistent with myofibroblasts. In the second case, a needle tract was noted in breast tissue on which a biopsy was performed two days after a cytologic diagnosis of carcinoma. The 0.4-mm-wide tract contained neutrophils, foamy histiocytes, and clumps of intact, atypical epithelial cells without a desmoplastic or elastotic component. Aside from these epithelial cells, nothing in the biopsy specimen suggested invasive carcinoma. The cells were identical to those from a comedocarcinoma present in the biopsy and mastectomy specimens. These two cases provide examples of pitfalls that may arise during the examination of biopsy specimens obtained after fine-needle aspiration. 
Intestinal obstruction during shigellosis: incidence, clinical features, risk factors, and outcome. To determine the incidence and outcome of intestinal obstruction during shigellosis, the authors assessed 1211 consecutive patients with shigellosis admitted during a 15-month period to a diarrhea treatment center in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Obstruction was identified in 30 (2.5%) patients. Ten (33.3%) of these patients died, compared with 97 (8.2%) of the 1181 patients without obstructions (P less than 0.001; RR = 4.1). In a case-control study, patients with obstructions were compared with 30 control patients with shigellosis but without obstructions. Case and control patients were similar in age (median, 18 months vs. 24 months; NS). Before admission to the hospital, case patients had less often been breast-fed than control patients (33% vs. 85%; P = 0.006) and had more often received antimicrobial agents (53% vs. 13%; P = 0.001). Case patients more often had abdominal tenderness (73% vs. 13%; P less than 0.001), altered consciousness (50% vs. 17%; P = 0.006), and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 infection (73% vs. 27%, P = 0.001) and had a higher median blood leukocyte count (40 x 10(3)/microL vs. 14 x 10(3)/microL; P = 0.007) and serum potassium concentration (5.0 mmol/L vs. 4.3 mmol/L; P = 0.016), and lower median serum sodium (123 mmol/L vs. 131 mmol/L; P = 0.003) and total protein (52 g/L vs. 60 g/L; P = 0.025) concentrations than did control patients. Eight (27%) patients with obstructions developed the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, compared with none of the control patients (P = 0.003). It was concluded that obstruction is an ominous complication of shigellosis and that therapies in addition to provision of antimicrobial agents need to be evaluated. 
Reviewing oral leukoplakia: clinical concepts for the 1990s. Microscopic evidence of dysplasia is not necessary to diagnose leukoplakia. Rather leukoplakia is clinically diagnosed not so much by defining appearances as by excluding other lesions also appearing as oral white plaques. 
The dyad symmetry element is the molecular target for c-fos induction and inhibition during K 562 differentiation along mutually exclusive lineages. The c-fos proto-oncogene seems to play an important role during differentiation and activation of cells from the hematopoietic lineage. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the mechanism underlying its transcriptional activation in these cells. To delineate the sequences and factors involved in c-fos transcriptional activation during the course of myeloid cell differentiation, we have used the K 562 chronic leukemic cell line as a model. K 562 cells were transfected with chloramphenicol transacetylase (CAT) reporter constructs, including various regions of the human c-fos promoter, and induced to differentiate by two distinct agents: 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which activates a differentiation program along the megakaryoblastic pathway; and hemin, which induces erythroid differentiation. We show here that TPA treatment of K 562 cells induces fos CAT reporter constructs activation, whereas treatment with hemin does not. Furthermore, predifferentiation of the cells with hemin blocks a subsequent induction by TPA, in correlation with the inhibition by hemin of megakaryoblastic differentiation markers appearance. Both the induction by TPA and the inhibition by hemin are mediated by a dyad symmetry element (DSE) located in the upstream regulatory region, between -318 and -296. These results suggest that the protein complex binding to the DSE regulatory element is the target for c-fos activation by TPA and inhibition by hemin in K 562 cells. However, no modulation of protein affinity for the DSE sequence was detected by gel shift assay during the course of induction or inhibition, suggesting that the structural change responsible for the transcriptional modulation is too unstable or too subtle to be detected by this method. 
Proliferation of endocrine cells in the rat stomach caused by drug-induced achlorhydria. Time-related changes of serum gastrin levels, gastrin cell, and enterochromaffinlike cell densities, and proliferation kinetics of these cells have been examined in rats during treatment with the substituted benzimidazole BY 308 over a period of 73 days. Serum gastrin levels increased very rapidly from 74 +/- 6 pg/mL (controls) to 438 +/- 31 pg/mL (day 1) and 727 +/- 68 pg/mL (day 4). Thereafter, a steady increase was observed until day 70 (2097 +/- 208 pg/mL). Enterochromaffinlike cell density was unchanged until day 10, but then increased progressively without reaching a plateau (144% above control on day 73). The labeling index of these cells was enhanced shortly after drug application and remained on a constant elevated level from day 14 to day 73 (about 10-fold to 12-fold above controls from day 14 to day 70). The number of gastrin cells increased rapidly within the first week and reached a plateau after 17 days (96% increase above controls). In contrast to enterochromaffinlike cells, the labeling index did not change immediately but increased on day 7 by 37% and returned beneath control values after day 28. The results suggest that in drug-induced achlorhydria, the progressive increase of enterochromaffinlike cells is explained by an enhanced mitosis, whereas other factors in addition to proliferation are responsible for the augmentation of gastrin cells. 
Thoracoabdominal aneurysm resection after previous infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. Thoracoabdominal aneurysms in 51 patients were repaired over 5 years ending in February 1991. Fourteen (27%, 14 of 51) patients had a prior infrarenal aneurysm resection (PRA); their data are analyzed separately. The average age of patients who had undergone PRA was 67 years (range: 56 to 86 years). The mean aneurysm diameter was 8.6 cm (range: 5 to 12 cm), and the mean time interval between initial aneurysm surgery and subsequent resection of the thoracoabdominal aneurysm was 8.5 years (range: 2 to 17 years). Three patients in the PRA group were operated on emergently, two because of clinical evidence of rupture; the other patients underwent elective repair. Early mortality (30 days) in the PRA group was significantly related to age (72 years or older versus younger than 72 years: 75% versus 10%, p = 0.04), proximal extent of aneurysm (above diaphragm versus below diaphragm: 50% versus 0%, p = 0.05), ruptured aneurysm (ruptured versus nonruptured: 100% versus 16%, p = 0.06), and a cardiac history of myocardial infarction (57% versus 0%, p = 0.03), congestive heart failure (66% versus 0%, p = 0.01), or arrhythmia (80% versus 0%, p = 0.005). Similar results were seen with the entire group of patients with thoracoabdominal aneurysms except that the proximal extent of the aneurysm was not related to mortality. These results demonstrate that thoracoabdominal aneurysm resection after prior infrarenal aneurysmectomy is not associated with increased mortality or morbidity. 
The pathogenic role of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) are found in the sera of patients with systemic necrotizing vasculitis and glomerulonephritis. Their role in the pathogenesis of these diseases is not clearly understood; however, there is a growing body of data that supports a pathogenic function for these antibodies. In vitro they can activate neutrophils and monocytes to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), degranulate, and damage target cells. The antigens to which they are directed stimulate T lymphocytes from patients with these diseases. The ANCA directed against proteinase 3 (PR3) may also play a role in growth regulation of monocytes by inactivating the enzymatic function of its antigen. The proposed model of ANCA-induced disease takes into account both the in vitro data and the natural history of these diseases. 
Haemodynamic effects and outcome analysis of hypotensive extradural anaesthesia in controlled hypertensive patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. We have examined the safety of induced hypotension produced by extradural anaesthesia in patients with medically controlled hypertension. The haemodynamic response to induced hypotension was assessed in 38 non-hypertensive and 31 controlled hypertensive patients. All received extradural anaesthesia to T4 or above which decreased mean arterial pressure to 52 mm Hg and 55 mm Hg in normotensive and hypertensive patients, respectively. Cardiac output (thermodilution) was maintained by low dose i.v. infusions of adrenaline (1-5 micrograms min-1). No differences in the haemodynamic response to induced hypotension were observed in hypertensive patients. Data were collected also from 987 consecutive patients (353 hypertensive and 634 non-hypertensive) undergoing total hip replacement. Patients with hypertension were significantly older (68 vs 60 yr; P less than 0.001) and had greater ASA ratings (P less than 0.001). The smallest recorded systolic pressures were reduced more in patients with hypertension (57% vs 52%, respectively; P less than 0.001). The mean duration of maintained intraoperative hypotension (100 and 98 min) and estimated intraoperative blood loss (278 vs 281 ml) were similar in each group. After operation, two patients developed myocardial infarctions. None developed acute renal failure or stroke. There were three deaths; one of a patient who had hypertension. This suggests that induced hypotension with extradural anaesthesia is a safe technique for patients with medically controlled hypertension undergoing total hip arthroplasty. 
Rare choroidal tumour simulating a malignant melanoma. A 15-year-old boy had been treated for a central chorioretinitis of his right eye. The other eye had always been normal. Two years later he presented a relapse with deterioration of central visual acuity. All clinical tests, including fluorescein angiography, suggested an inflammatory process this time again. Thereafter, the patient did not show up for 6 years. Then he came to hospital because of strong pains in his right eye. Now, a blind and inflamed eye was found with a huge tumour from the optic nerve extending to the temporal periphery. All clinical investigations, amongst others ultrasonography, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance tomography, suggested a choroidal melanoma with extrabulbar extension. An enucleation with partial exenteration was performed. A demonstration and discussion of the clinical findings and the rare and complicated histological diagnosis of a very unusual ectopic meningioma-like lesion are given. 
Prediction of postoperative pain and duration of hospitalization using two anxiety measures. This study examined the extent to which measures of anxiety could predict pain and the length of hospitalization following surgery in 111 patients with gallstones over and above what could be predicted on the basis of biographical and medical status variables. Self-reported pain on the third day postoperative could hardly be explained by the variables measured. Preoperative anxiety did not increase the value of the prediction. Age, type of surgery, cystitis and wound infection explained a significant proportion of the variance in postoperative hospital stay. Over and above these variables. A-state on the third postoperative day and also A-state and specific anxiety measured 1 day before surgery exerted a significant increase on the values of prediction of the length of postoperative hospitalization. 
Interferon-gamma inhibits arterial stenosis after injury. BACKGROUND. Arterial injury initiates a proliferative response among the smooth muscle cells of the artery. This leads to the formation of a thickened intima that may reduce the diameter of the arterial lumen. Such intimal lesions often develop after vascular surgery and angioplastic procedures. Previous cell culture studies have shown that the lymphokine, interferon-gamma (gIFN), inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation. METHODS AND RESULTS. We therefore tested whether administration of exogenous gIFN could inhibit the development of intimal lesions. Rat carotid arteries were denuded with a balloon catheter, resulting in the formation of a standardized intimal lesion. The animals were then treated with recombinant rat gIFN at 200,000 units (approximately 400,000 units or 100 micrograms/kg body wt) administered parenterally once daily for 7 days. Autoradiographic analysis of 3H-thymidine incorporation revealed that gIFN reduced the early smooth muscle replication by approximately 75%. gIFN treatment for 1 week resulted in a 50% reduction of intimal cross-section area at 2 weeks after injury when compared to control rats injected with buffer alone. The difference in lesion development persisted in rats analyzed 10 weeks after injury, suggesting that proliferative events during the first week determine the long-term development of the intima. Inhibition of lesion development was accompanied by expression of the class II histocompatibility (Ia) gene, RT1B, suggesting that both were directly related to the administration of gIFN. CONCLUSIONS. These results show that gIFN is a potent inhibitor of the formation of arterial proliferative lesions in vivo. It is possible that gIFN could be useful in preventing arterial stenosis after surgery and angioplasty in man. 
Anaerobic threshold in patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ventilatory anaerobic threshold in patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Ventilatory volumes and gas exchanges were measured during treadmill stress testing in 36 patients (11 with previous myocardial infarction) with electrocardiographic criteria of myocardial ischemia during the test and in 23 healthy, untrained control subjects of equivalent age. The anaerobic threshold was detected in 32 of 36 patients (89%) and in 22 of 23 control subjects (96%). The anaerobic threshold was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects (13.5 +/- 1.9 versus 19.7 +/- 1.7 ml/kg per minute VO2, p less than 0.001). In the 21 patients without previous myocardial infarction, the anaerobic threshold was also significantly lower than in the control subjects (13.9 +/- 1.6 versus 19.7 +/- 1.7 ml/kg per minute VO2, p less than 0.001). Among the 21 patients without previous myocardial infarction, the 12 with a low ischemic threshold, which occurred during the first three steps of the modified Bruce protocol, had an anaerobic threshold significantly lower than the other nine patients (13.1 +/- 1.5 versus 14.9 +/- 1.0 ml/kg per minute VO2, p less than 0.01). However, even in the patients with a moderate to high ischemic threshold, the anaerobic threshold was significantly lower than in the control subjects (p less than 0.001). These data show that the anaerobic threshold can be measured in the great majority of patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. The low anaerobic threshold level indicates a relevant functional impairment in these patients. 
Safety and efficacy of repeat thrombolytic treatment after acute myocardial infarction. Thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction increases the risk of subsequent reocclusion of the infarct related artery. The efficacy and safety of repeat thrombolytic treatment was assessed in 31 patients treated with streptokinase (n = 13) or tissue plasminogen activator (n = 18) a median of five days (1-716) after the first infusion. The indication for readministration was prolonged chest pain with new ST segment elevation. Efficacy was assessed by infarct artery patency at angiography at a median of eight days after readministration in 22 patients and by non-invasive criteria in 23 patients (reperfusion was deemed to be likely if serum creatine kinase was not increased or reached a peak less than 12 hours after infarction). Angiography showed patency of 70% of the infarct arteries after readministration of streptokinase and of 75% after tissue plasminogen activator. The corresponding patency rates assessed noninvasively were 73% and 75%. Reinfarction was prevented in nine (29%) patients. Allergic reactions occurred in four of eight patients who received streptokinase twice (plasmacytosis and acute reversible renal failure developed in one patient). Two patients had major bleeding and two minor bleeding, all after tissue plasminogen activator, and one of them died of cerebral haemorrhage. Repeat thrombolytic treatment results in late patency rates similar to the rates after the initial administration. Allergic reactions were common in those treated twice with streptokinase. 
Cancer rates after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident and proximity of residence to the plant. BACKGROUND: In the light of a possible link between stress and cancer promotion or progression, and of previously reported distress in residents near the Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear power plant, we attempted to evaluate the impact of the March 1979 accident on community cancer rates. METHODS: Proximity of residence to the plant, which related to distress in previous studies, was taken as a possible indicator of accident stress; the postaccident pattern in cancer rates was examined in 69 "study tracts" within a 10-mile radius of TMI, in relation to residential proximity. RESULTS: A modest association was found between postaccident cancer rates and proximity (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.3, 1.6). After adjusting for a gradient in cancer risk prior to the accident, the odds ratio contrasting those closest to the plant with those living farther out was 1.2 (95% CI = 1.0, 1.4). A postaccident increase in cancer rates near the Three Mile Island plant was notable in 1982, persisted for another year, and then declined. Radiation emissions, as modeled mathematically, did not account for the observed increase. CONCLUSION: Interpretation in terms of accident stress is limited by the lack of an individual measure of stress and by uncertainty about whether stress has a biological effect on cancer in humans. An alternative mechanism for the cancer increase near the plant is through changes in care-seeking and diagnostic practice arising from postaccident concern. 
Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia discovered at coronary bypass operation. A 68-year-old man was discovered to have a large peritoneopericardial hernia when operated on for coronary artery bypass. Such hernias are very unusual. The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of this problem are discussed. 
Primary mandibular reconstruction: analysis of 64 cases and evaluation of interface radiation dosimetry on bridging plates. The combination of a myocutaneous flap or free cutaneous tissue transfer with a three-dimensional bendable reconstruction plate either of stainless steel or titanium has provided very satisfactory results in primary restoration of mandibular defects following surgical resections in irradiated patients or in those who require postoperative radiotherapy. Sixty-four cases have been treated and evaluated prospectively using this technique. Fifty-three of the patients had the soft-tissue defect restored with a myocutaneous flap, 8 had a free cutaneous tissue flap, 2 were reconstructed with tongue flaps, and 1 closed primarily. The stainless steel plate of the A.O. type was used in 53 cases and the titanium plate system and hollow screws in the other 11 cases. A success rate of 78.9% was found with a median follow-up of 384 days. Thirty of the 64 cases had preoperative irradiation and 15 were treated postoperatively. A plate failure rate of 23% was encountered in those treated with preoperative irradiation and in 20% with those having postoperative irradiation. Forty-nine of the 64 patients or 76.5% experienced no perioperative complications. Five or 7.8% of the complications were minor. Ten patients or 15.6% experienced a major complication with one death due to a myocardial infarct. A radiation dosimetric model was employed using both stainless steel and titanium. The results from this study showed that, when using a parallel pair of beams, an excess dose of irradiation for the lowest energy cobalt-60 is 13%, for 6 mV it is 15%, and for 18 mV it is 20%. The excess tissue dose, both for stainless steel and titanium plates, extends for about 0.2 mm for cobalt-60, 1.1 mm at 6 mV, and for 25 mm at 18 mV. Patients with plates, therefore, can be treated safely with postoperative irradiation using either cobalt-60 or 6-mV energy. 
Transcatheter occlusion of pulmonary arterial circulation and collateral supply: failures, incidents, and complications. Failures and complications were analyzed retrospectively in 45 patients treated with embolotherapy or occlusion of pulmonary arterial circulation. Pulmonary arterial branches were occluded with steel coils in 19 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations, 17 with hemoptysis of pulmonary artery (PA) origin, and one with massive parenchymal shunt. Bronchial arterial supply to the lung was embolized with small particles in eight cases of hemoptysis and systemic to pulmonary arterial antegrade shunt secondary to chronic thromboembolism. Asymptomatic incidents included catheterization failures, vascular damage, partial occlusion, partial recanalization of the thrombus, ectopic deposition of a coil, and delayed bacterial contamination of the thrombus. A few cases of transient clinical and radiologic signs of pulmonary infarction were observed after complete occlusion of the PA and bronchial artery embolization. This complication was never observed after complete occlusion of main right or left PA, inferior right or left PA, or segmental branches. The management and prevention of these complications, the role of bronchial arterial collateral pathways, and the importance of the site of PA occlusion in the development of pulmonary infarction are discussed. 
Follow-up study of unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 and C4 segments of the internal carotid artery. A follow-up study of unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 and C4 segments of the internal carotid artery was performed. During the 10-year period from 1979 to 1989, there were 22 patients with 24 aneurysms arising from the C3 or C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. All 24 aneurysms were unruptured. They represented 3% of all intracranial aneurysms and 11% of all internal carotid artery aneurysms diagnosed at the hospital during the 10-year period. Eighteen patients were women and 4 were men. Their ages ranged from 34 to 82 years (mean 63.3 years). Of the 22 patients, 12 (55%) had multiple aneurysms. A follow-up study without treatment was made in 15 of the 22 patients who had a total of 16 unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 or C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. This study excluded 7 of the 22 patients with a total of eight aneurysms because of operation or death soon after diagnosis. The average maximal dimension of the 16 aneurysms was 5 mm, with a range of 2-17 mm. Follow-up periods varied from 11 months to 10.5 years, with an average of 4.7 years. During this period, none of the 16 aneurysms ruptured, and they remained asymptomatic, except for one aneurysm that had been discovered as a result of the cavernous sinus syndrome. Some surgeons are now attempting direct operations on intracavernous carotid artery aneurysms, even if the aneurysms are unruptured and relatively small. 
Standardizing neck dissection terminology. Official report of the Academy's Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology. The emergence of the multitude of modified techniques for neck dissection procedure has resulted in a nomenclature system that is nonuniform. To eliminate potential misinterpretation, overlap, and lack of standardization, the Academy's Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology, with input from the Education Committee of the American Society of Head and Neck Surgery, has developed a classification system for these procedures. This has now been adopted by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. The classification is based on the following concepts: (1) radical neck dissection is the fundamental procedure with which all other neck dissections are compared, (2) modified radical neck dissection denotes preservation of one or more nonlymphatic structure(s), (3) selective neck dissection denotes preservation of one or more group(s) of lymph nodes, and (4) extended radical neck dissection denotes removal of one or more additional lymphatic and/or nonlymphatic structure(s). Adherence to the principles of this classification system to describe neck dissection techniques should provide an improved method of communication. Furthermore, the system provides a rational framework on which subsequent terminology can be added. 
Characterization of tumor hypoxia by 31P MR spectroscopy. Tumor hypoxia is of considerable importance to the oncologist in selecting and optimizing cancer therapy, because hypoxia can determine the effectiveness of various therapies. The relationship between tumor hypoxia and tumor bioenergetics, assessed by 31P MR spectroscopy, is examined to determine whether 31P MR spectroscopy can be clinically useful to measure or characterize tumor hypoxia. Work with experimental tumors has suggested that several different types of hypoxia may exist and that 31P MR spectroscopy cannot be used to characterize all types. Metabolic hypoxia is the level of hypoxia that results in mitochondrial impairment in cells, and it is associated with declining cellular bioenergetic status, which can be measured by enzymatic assay of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Because 31P MR spectroscopy is sensitive to levels of ATP, it is potentially sensitive to metabolic hypoxia in vivo and may provide a rapid and noninvasive technique for characterizing metabolic hypoxia in tumors. Radiobiologic hypoxia is the level of hypoxia that results in attenuated cell death due to radiation, because radiotoxicity is directly related to tissue levels of oxygen. Radiobiologic hypoxia of tumors thus has more impact on choice of therapy, yet the relationship between metabolic hypoxia and radiobiologic hypoxia remains to be elucidated. An analysis of published data suggests that 31P MR spectroscopy is directly sensitive to metabolic hypoxia in tumors, but it is only indirectly sensitive to radiobiologic hypoxia in tumors. Therefore, 31P MR spectroscopy may be unable to quantify the cell fraction of a tumor that has radiobiologic hypoxia. However, preliminary data suggest that MR spectroscopy may prove useful for determining the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions designed to manipulate radiobiologic hypoxia in tumors or for monitoring the kinetics of tumor reoxygenation after treatment. 
The Sugiura procedure for patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis. The Sugiura procedure (SP) was performed upon 27 patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (EPVT) without associated hepatic disease. There were 14 female and 13 male patients. The mean age was 28 +/- 14 years. The causes of EPVT were protein C deficiency in two; antithrombin III deficiency in one patient, a history of omphalitis in two patients, a history of pancreatitis in one patient and idiopathy in 21 patients. The SP was completed in two surgical stages in 14 patients and in one stage in nine. There was one operative death. One patient had mild postoperative encephalopathy, and two patients rebled at long term follow-up study. Actuarial survival rate was 82 per cent at five and ten years. It is concluded that the SP is a good alternative for the management of hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to EPVT. 
Reversal of intrapulmonary shunting in cirrhosis after liver transplantation demonstrated by perfusion lung scan. A young girl with biliary atresia leading to cirrhosis developed respiratory complications with hypoxemia. Intrapulmonary shunting was diagnosed with a 99mTc-MAA perfusion lung scan, which showed marked systemic activity. The shunting resolved after liver transplantation. The perfusion lung scan offers an efficient method to screen patients with cirrhosis in whom intrapulmonary shunts are suspected and to follow their progress. 
Surgical approaches for resection of heterotopic ossification in traumatic brain-injured adults. The site of heterotopic ossification (HO) at the elbow or the hip dictates the surgical approach for resection. Three approaches are used for HO resection at the elbow: (1) a posterolateral approach for posterolateral HO; (2) an anterolateral approach for anterior HO; and (3) a medical approach for medial or posteromedial HO or anterior transfer of the ulnar nerve. Two approaches are recommended for resection of HO at the hip: (1) an anterior approach for anterior or inferomedial HO and (2) a posterior approach for posterior HO. Posterior HO is often associated with a hip-flexion contracture, and an anterior soft-tissue release may be necessary as well. Physical examination indicates the prognosis for functional improvement as well as recurrence. Patients with a near normal neurologic recovery have minimal to no HO recurrence with improved limb function and increased joint motion, whereas a poor neurologic recovery and persistent spasticity are associated with recurrence of HO and no functional limb improvement. Standard roentgenograms aid in selecting the appropriate surgical approach. Radiation, indomethacin, and diphosphonates have been administered for prophylaxis. Physical therapy is necessary until range of motion stabilizes. 
Strategies for reducing cardiovascular risk in women. The major risk factors for coronary heart disease in women are much the same as in men. They include elevated cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, severe obesity, a history of stroke and/or thromboembolic disease, and a family history of premature coronary heart disease. Diabetes appears to confer a greater risk and hypertension to have a lesser effect in women than in men. The obstetrician-gynecologist's role as primary care physician is important in terms of risk reduction counseling in areas that are amenable to change: diet, exercise and cigarette smoking. A fourth area, prescribing hormonal therapy, including oral contraceptives and hormone replacement, is the one risk reduction modality that is within the physician's control. 
Shortlasting, unilateral, neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection, tearing, and subclinical forehead sweating ("Sunct" syndrome): II. Changes in heart rate and arterial blood pressure during pain paroxysms. The recently described "Sunct" syndrome is a rare picture of unilateral, shortlasting headache attacks accompanied by autonomic phenomena (conjunctival injection, tearing, etc.) on the symptomatic side. Heart rate and blood pressure were monitored in two elderly "Sunct" patients during and outside headache attacks. An ultrasound Doppler servo method was used for the non-invasive, continuous, beat-to-beat determination of instantaneous arterial blood pressure. In a third patient, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, both outside and during pain paroxysms, were assessed using the standard Korotkoff method. Heart rate was found to be significantly decreased during pain paroxysms. Systolic blood pressure was observed to be significantly increased during attacks, when compared with the inter-attack period, while a less consistent pattern was observed for diastolic blood pressure. Some of the changes in the cardiovascular system seemed to start prior to pain onset. Therefore, it seems unlikely that these changes were caused by pain activation of the sympathetic nervous system or the oculocardiac reflex. 
Associative anomia: dissociating words and their definitions. A 60-year-old woman, in whom magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission computed tomography confirmed the presence of chronic damage to the left temporal lobe, had pure anomia with sparing of other language and cognitive functions. She could independently access lexical knowledge (words) and semantic knowledge (word definitions). We postulate that her anomia was due to a failure to associate lexical and semantic knowledge. 
Benign hemorrhagic adrenocortical macrocysts in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. A new pseudotumorous lesion found in the adrenal cortex of six infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is described. These cystic masses were discovered either prenatally by using sonography or early in the neonatal period as palpable flank masses. Imaging studies, including sonography and CT, could not confidently exclude malignancy. After the masses were removed surgically, histologic examination showed them all to be benign hemorrhagic macrocysts within the capsule or permanent cortex (in contrast to neonatal adrenal hemorrhage, which usually occurs more centrally in the fetal cortex). The cysts were as large as 8 cm in diameter, and in one case a solitary cyst was predominant. Hemihypertrophy was present in all cases. Four of the six lesions were right-sided, and there was a male-female ratio of 5:1. Benign hemorrhagic adrenocortical macrocysts are a cause of abdominal mass in the fetus and neonate with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. 
Effects of U74006F on multifocal cerebral blood flow and metabolism after cardiac arrest in dogs. Lipid peroxidation reactions during reperfusion after cardiac arrest may contribute to postischemic cerebral hypoperfusion, which in turn can contribute to permanent neurological dysfunction. We designed this study to determine whether the aminosteroid U74006F, a putative inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, mitigates cerebral multifocal hypoperfusion after cardiac arrest. We used our established dog model of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest (no blood flow) of 12.5 minutes, reperfusion by cardiopulmonary bypass of less than or equal to 5 minutes, and control of extracerebral variables during 4 hours postarrest. Cerebral blood flow was monitored by the stable xenon computed tomography method. Changes in cerebral oxygen consumption were obtained from mean blood flow values of coronal slices and the cerebral arteriovenous (sagittal sinus) oxygen content difference. A treatment group (n = 5) received U74006F starting with reperfusion (1.5 mg/kg i.a. plus 1.5 mg/kg i.v.) and three additional (graded) doses over 4 hours (total dose 4.5, 7.5, or 14.5 mg/kg). The U74006F-treated group showed the same postarrest transient hyperemia and protracted hypoperfusion in terms of global (computed tomography slice), regional, and local (multifocal) cerebral blood flow values and the same global cerebral oxygen consumption pattern as a concurrent control group (n = 5). At 1-4 hours postarrest, in both groups there was mismatching of global cerebral oxygen consumption, which reached baseline values, in relation to global cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery, which remained at 50% of baseline. We conclude that treatment with U74006F after prolonged cardiac arrest causes no deleterious side effects and does not seem to alter multifocal postarrest cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption. 
Pulmonary microvascular permeability in patients with severe mitral stenosis. Patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis often have no pulmonary oedema despite considerably increased pulmonary venous pressure. Pulmonary microvascular permeability was measured non-invasively by a previously validated method of double isotope scintigraphy with indium-113m and technetium-99m. This permits calculation of an index reflecting transferrin efflux and thus, indirectly, the microvascular permeability. Fifteen patients with severe mitral stenosis (defined as valve area less than 1.0 cm2) were compared with a control group of 11 patients with mild coronary artery disease. The permeability index was significantly lower in patients with mitral stenosis than in the control group. Furthermore, the extent of reduction of the permeability index correlated with the severity of mitral stenosis as reflected by the Gorlin valve area. This finding may account for the relative resistance of these patients to pulmonary oedema despite chronic pulmonary venous hypertension. 
The effect on pulmonary function of tangential field technique in radiotherapy for carcinoma of the breast. Twenty-five patients treated by lumpectomy and radiotherapy for Stage I breast cancer were enrolled in a prospective study to measure the effects of tangential field irradiation on pulmonary function. Fractional doses of 2 Gy to a total of 50 Gy were administered with the tangential technique. An additional 10 Gy (2 Gy x 5) was given as direct booster. Dynamic and static lung volumes, distribution of ventilation and gas transfer were measured before irradiation and at varying intervals up to 1 year after the completion of therapy. There was a small, but statistically significant decrease in the forced vital capacity (mean 63 ml) and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (mean 79 ml) measured 3 months after irradiation (p less than 0.05). These changes were reversed within 1 year. The reduction in total lung capacity (mean 240 ml) after 3 months was nearly significant (p = 0.06). The remaining variables did not change to a significant degree. We conclude that a slight restrictive ventilatory impairment may occur when a combined tangential and direct booster technique is applied. The changes are, however, small and reversible, and imply no clinical importance. 
The significance of antibody to hepatitis C virus in patients with chronic hepatitis B. We assessed the prevalence and clinical significance of antibodies to hepatitis C virus among a cohort of 148 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Sixteen patients (11%) had anti-hepatitis C virus detectable by enzyme-linked immunoassay. The results from eight of these patients were positive by recombinant immunoblot assay. The results of recombinant immunoblot assay testing were not consistent; therefore the analysis of the patients' data was based on anti-hepatitis C virus enzyme-linked immunoassay results. Patients with chronic hepatitis B with anti-hepatitis C virus were more likely to be cirrhotic (44% vs. 21%) and to have decompensated liver disease (24% vs. 6%). Hepatitis B virus replication appeared to be suppressed in patients with both infections as measured by hepatitis B virus-associated DNA polymerase activity (mean = 2,055 vs. 2,555 cpm). Human immunodeficiency virus infection was more common in the anti-hepatitis C virus positive group (36% vs. 11%). Thus hepatitis C virus appears to suppress hepatitis B virus replication and to cause more severe liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. 
The tissue origin of low back pain and sciatica: a report of pain response to tissue stimulation during operations on the lumbar spine using local anesthesia. In an effort to define the origin of low back pain and sciatica, 193 patients were carefully studied using progressive local anesthesia. These patients had surgery for herniated discs, spinal stenoses, or both. Various tissues were stimulated during the performance of these lumbar spinal operations. This article discusses our observations and the results of that study. 
Acquired Brown's syndrome associated with hypogammaglobulinemia. We describe a 10-year-old girl with hypogammaglobulinemia who presented initially with painless progressive diplopia on right upward gaze and associated tenderness in the area of the superior oblique tendon (Brown's syndrome). She was given prednisone (40 mg/day) with gradual improvement of her symptoms. Prednisone was tapered and her symptoms remained unchanged for 10 months. She then experienced rapid deterioration. Prednisone was reinstituted with similar improvement and then therapy was switched to naproxen. She remains with only slight diplopia on extreme upward gaze. 
Relation of stenosis morphology and clinical presentation to the procedural results of directional coronary atherectomy BACKGROUND. Directional coronary atherectomy has recently become available to treat coronary stenoses. This study was performed to determine the relation of patient characteristics and stenosis morphology to procedural outcome with directional coronary atherectomy to gain insight into which patients might be best treated with this device. METHODS AND RESULTS. Four hundred stenoses from 378 patients consecutively treated at six major referral institutions were analyzed. Angiographic data were assessed at a central angiographic laboratory using standardized morphological criteria and computer-assisted quantitative dimensional analyses. Procedural success was achieved in 87.8% of stenoses, and major ischemic complications (death, myocardial infarction, and emergency bypass surgery) occurred in 6.3% of patients. Lesion success and complications were closely correlated with recognized modified American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force lesion morphological criteria. Observed for type A stenoses were 93% success and 3% complication rates; for type B1 stenoses, 88% success and 6% complication rates; and for type B2 stenoses, 75% success and 13% complication rates, respectively. There were too few type C stenoses treated to analyze. Furthermore, multivariate testing demonstrated stenosis angulation (multivariate p less than 0.001), proximal tortuosity (p less than 0.001), decreased preatherectomy minimum lumen dimension (p = 0.032), and calcification (p = 0.041) to correlate independently with adverse outcome and complex, probably thrombus-associated stenoses to have a favorable outcome (p = 0.055). Operator experience (p = 0.020) and a history of restenosis (p = 0.022) also favorably influenced outcome. CONCLUSIONS. The procedural outcome of directional coronary atherectomy is highly associated with coronary stenosis morphology. Furthermore, after appropriate stratification for morphology and clinical presentation, overall atherectomy procedural outcome may be similar to that achieved with coronary angioplasty. However, specific subsets of patients may have relatively better outcome with either atherectomy or balloon angioplasty. 
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated diseases: a pathologist's perspective. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) are a useful diagnostic serologic marker for the most common forms of necrotizing vasculitis, provide a means of categorizing vasculitides so that diagnostically useful shared pathologic and clinical characteristics can be recognized, and offer insight into the pathogenesis of previously idiopathic diseases. ANCA-associated vasculitides can be categorized into a number of distinctive clinicopathologic categories, eg, Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, pulmonary renal syndrome, microscopic polyarteritis nodosa, leukocytoclastic angiitis, and necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. At least the latter four syndromes can also be caused by other ANCA-negative immunopathogenic mechanisms, eg, immune complex deposition. Therefore, thorough diagnostic classification requires both an assessment of clinicopathologic category, as well as an assessment of immunopathologic category. Although different ANCA-associated vasculitic syndromes have distinctive clinical and pathologic features, all ANCA-associated vasculitides share a number of common pathologic features, ie, focal distribution, necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration. ANCA assays have very good sensitivity and specificity for ANCA-associated diseases, but the prevalence of these diseases in the patient population being analyzed must be taken into consideration when determining the predictive value of a test result. As with all serologic tests, ANCA results must be integrated with other clinical and pathologic data in order to reach the most accurate diagnostic conclusion. 
Arthropathy of the ankle in hemophilia. Seventy-five patients who had hemophilia were followed clinically and roentgenographically to assess the prevalence of hemarthrosis and the prevalence and severity of arthropathy of the ankle. The mean age of the patients at the time of follow-up was twenty-two years and seven months. The patients were divided into four age-groups: less than ten years (eleven patients), ten to nineteen years (twenty-one patients), twenty to thirty years (twenty-four patients), and more than thirty years (nineteen patients). Intra-articular bleeding occurred more frequently in the joints of the lower extremities than in the joints of the upper extremities. During the second decade of life, hemarthroses occurred more often in the ankle than in the knee. A history of recurrent bleeding into the ankle joint, chronic synovitis, and overgrowth of the medial portion of the distal tibial epiphysis was associated with an early onset of arthropathy. In older patients, compression arthrodesis of the ankle joint was helpful in eliminating pain, recurrent bleeding, and equinus deformity. 
Neurologic outcome after electroencephalographically proven neonatal seizures. Infants in whom neonatal seizures were confirmed by randomly recorded ictal electroencephalographic (EEG) tracings were retrospectively examined to determine their global neurologic outcome and the specific frequency of epilepsy, development delay, and cerebral palsy. Perinatal and postnatal clinical and EEG variables were also examined for their relevance to the neurologic outcome. Forty infants with EEG documented seizures of diverse etiologies were studied. The 27 survivors were followed up at a mean of 31 months. The outcome was unfavorable in 70%. The rate of epilepsy was 56%, of developmental delay 67%, and of cerebral palsy 63%. The etiology of seizures was an important factor influencing the outcome. Other clinical factors that showed a significant relationship with global or specific aspects of the neurologic outcome included the age at the onset of seizures, birth weight, and neurologic examination results. The EEG parameters that significantly predicted the neurologic outcome were interictal EEG background, increased seizure frequency, and decreased seizure duration. 
Recognition of human 60 kD heat shock protein by mononuclear cells from patients with juvenile chronic arthritis. A postulated mechanism for autoimmune disorders is that the immunoreactivity develops against bacterial antigens which show a high degree of sequence homology with mammalian proteins. The mycobacterial 65 kD heat shock protein (hsp) has been implicated in several forms of arthritis. Substantial amounts of the human 60 kD homologue (hsp60) were produced by insertion of the gene into Escherichia coli. To investigate the hypothesis that T-cell reactivity is directed against the endogenous hsp, T-cell proliferation of synovial-fluid and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in response to hsp60 was studied in samples from six patients with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) and nine adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There was no T-lymphocyte proliferative response to purified fractions of hsp60 in mononuclear cells from RA patients or healthy children and young adults. However, both synovial-fluid and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from JCA patients showed substantial proliferative responses. There was a significant correlation between the stimulation indices for human hsp60 and for mycobacterial hsp65 (r = 0.948, p less than 0.02). A similar correlation for hsp60 and mycobacterial hsp70 did not achieve significance. Immunohistochemistry showed that hsp65 and hsp70 homologues were expressed in the synovial membrane in these patients but not in controls. These findings suggest a sequence of events in which hsps become expressed during synovial inflammation and function as autoantigens. In JCA this may be manifested by specific T-cell reactivity which apparently is lost in the more bone-eroding and non-remitting adult disease. 
Involvement of neutrophils in postischaemic damage to the small intestine. Haemorrhagic mucosal lesions are produced during intestinal ischaemia and after reperfusion probably mediated by oxygen radicals. Oxygen radicals react with cell membrane lipids and induce cell damage by peroxidation and induce accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the tissue. The aim of the study was to elucidate the involvement of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in post-ischaemic intestinal damage. Intestinal ischaemia was induced in cats by partial occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. Samples from the small intestine were excised before and at the end of the two hour hypotensive period as well as 10 minutes and 60 minutes after reperfusion. Conjugated dienes, myeloperoxidase, and the purine metabolites were determined in the samples. The tissue was also examined histologically. Seven cats were treated before reperfusion with a monoclonal antibody (IB4) which inhibits leucocyte adherence to endothelial cells and its subsequent activation. After reperfusion myeloperoxidase activity increased and the ischaemic mucosal lesions worsened significantly. IB4 treatment prevented an increase in post-hypotensive myeloperoxidase activity and attenuated the normally observed severe mucosal lesions. We conclude that the severe post-ischaemic lesions are induced by polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Such mucosal injury may be appreciably reduced by blocking leucocyte adherence with IB4. 
Synchronous arytenoid and pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. Neuroendocrine laryngeal carcinoid tumours are uncommon. The supraglottis is the main location of these tumours. Eighty-one cases have been reported in the world literature. We present the first case of a synchronous laryngeal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour. 
Importance of left ventricular systolic function in the assessment of left ventricular diastolic function with Doppler transmitral flow velocity recording. To study the effect of left ventricular systolic function on the Doppler transmitral flow velocity pattern, Doppler echocardiographic variables were correlated with hemodynamic indexes in 11 control subjects and 58 patients with heart disease. All underwent cardiac catheterization performed with use of a Millar micromanometer. The time constant of left ventricular isovolumetric pressure decrease and left ventricular end-diastolic myocardial stiffness was calculated. The 58 patients were classified into two groups according to ejection fraction: group I (n = 30; ejection fraction greater than 55%) and group II (n = 28; ejection fraction less than 50%). Compared with the control subjects, patients in group I had impairment only of left ventricular relaxation (time constant 47 +/- 9 vs. 38 +/- 3 ms; p less than 0.01), whereas patients in group II had, in addition to impaired left ventricular relaxation (time constant 52 +/- 11 vs. 38 +/- 3 ms; p less than 0.01), increased preload, increased pulmonary capillary pressure (12 +/- 8 vs. 5 +/- 3 mm Hg; p less than 0.01) and increased myocardial stiffness (2,018 +/- 980 vs. 1,050 +/- 218 g/cm2; p less than 0.01). In group I, there was a significant partial correlation coefficient between the time constant and deceleration half-time (r = 0.54). In group II, a strong correlation existed between myocardial stiffness and peak atrial filling velocity (r = -0.71) and between myocardial stiffness and the ratio of peak atrial to peak rapid filling velocity (r = -0.71). 
A critical evaluation of new agents for the treatment of sepsis. OBJECTIVE - To evaluate new treatments directed against endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin 1 for use in sepsis and related disorders (sepsis syndrome and septic shock). DATA SOURCES - Investigations of these treatments in animal models, healthy human volunteers, and patients with sepsis and related disorders. STUDY SELECTION - Particular attention was paid to studies of patients with sepsis and related disorders, especially randomized, double-blind, controlled trials. DATA EXTRACTION - Animal studies and investigations with human volunteers were judged by how closely the experimental model replicated the clinical disorder (sepsis). Patient trials were assessed by sample size and design. Results of all studies were used to evaluate the likelihood that a given treatment would reduce mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS - Direct comparison of E5 and HA-1A antibody studies is difficult because of differences in their design, definitions of shock, and methods of subgroup analysis. However, both antibodies improve outcome in some subgroups: E5 benefits patients with gram-negative infection (bacteremic or focal) who do not have refractory shock, and HA-1A benefits those with gram-negative bacteremia (regardless of whether shock is present) but not those with focal gram-negative infection. Two agents that may be beneficial in gram-positive and gram-negative infection are monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor alpha and receptor antagonists to interleukin 1. Preliminary results with both are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS - All three types of treatment may improve outcome in sepsis. The best results will probably be obtained with combination therapy that interrupts multiple points of the inflammatory cascade underlying sepsis. 
Islet amyloid polypeptide in proliferating pancreatic B cells during development, hyperplasia, and neoplasia in humans and mice. The occurrence of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) immunoreactivity was investigated in fetal pancreas, islet cell hyperplasia, and tumors in humans and mice. Transgenic mice heritably developing endocrine tumors of the pancreas (AVP/SV40, Rip 1 Tag2/Rip2PyST1 and Glu2-Tag strains) were used as murine models of islet cells proliferative disease. In the mouse, IAPP immunoreactivity was found in B cells at embryonic day 12 (E12), paralleling the onset of insulin immunoreactivity. In hyperplastic/dysplastic islets and in B-cell tumors of transgenic mice (n = 16), IAPP immunoreactivity was localized consistently to insulin-immunoreactive cells. Ultrastructural single- and double-immunogold labeling of transgenic mice B-cell tumors (n = 3) showed insulin and IAPP to be colocalized in beta granules. In human fetuses, IAPP immunoreactivity was found in insulin-immunoreactive B cells, but at a later gestational age than the onset of insulin immunoreactivity. In pancreatic specimens of infantile/neonatal persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (11 cases) and in pancreatic endocrine tumors (21 cases, 10 of which were functioning insulinomas), IAPP immunoreactivity was found consistently in insulin-immunoreactive B cells. Congo-red-positive amyloid deposits present in tumors also were IAPP immunoreactive. Ultrastructural single and double immunogold labeling of infantile/neonatal persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia cases (n = 3) and functioning insulinomas (n = 2) showed IAPP and insulin to be colocalized in beta granules. In addition, IAPP immunoreactivity was observed in amyloidlike fibrils. These findings indicate that IAPP is a constitutive component of B cells. Possible relationships between IAPP and insulin expression and interspecies differences are suggested and discussed. 
Interethnic differences in pain perception. While several investigators have reported relationships between ethnic background and expression of pain, such relationships are in fact highly problematical. Few studies of pain and ethnicity have used quantitative measures of pain combined with multivariate methods of data analysis. Most have focussed on populations which, unlike many in the United States today, are characterized by highly distinct ethnic groups. The study reported here interviewed 536 persons recently treated for forms of cancer known to cause significant pain. Pain was assessed using standard, well validated instruments, including Graphic Rating Scales anchored in several alternative time-frames and the McGill Pain Questionnaire. The study took place in an area with a low proportion of recent immigrants and only small concentrations of distinct ethnic minorities. No statistically significant relationships were observed between ethnic identity and measures of pain sensation. However, pain described in affective terms according to the McGill Pain Questionnaire did vary among ethnicities. This observation suggests that cultures associated with specific ethnic identities still condition individual expression of pain despite the high degree of assimilation that has occurred among ethnic groups in the United States. 
Repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. A statewide experience. The results of elective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms are excellent in many institutions. To our knowledge, however, no study has compared the results in a large geographic area in which patients were treated by a variety of surgeons and hospitals. We studied the results of repairing abdominal aortic aneurysms for all Medicare recipients during a single year in Kentucky. One hundred thirty-six operations were performed by 52 surgeons in 31 hospitals. Overall operative mortality was 18%; elective and emergency operative mortality rates were 6% and 49%, respectively. Advancing age did not affect outcome, but mortality due to ruptured aneurysms was higher in smaller hospitals than in larger hospitals. The low mortality for elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms in an elderly population by numerous surgeons in divergent hospitals is a strong indication for its liberal use compared with the high mortality and morbidity of emergency surgery. 
Gastrocolic fistula with pyloric stenosis and benign gastric ulcer. We have reported a case of gastrocolic fistula with gastric outlet obstruction as a complication of benign gastric ulcer. The single-stage surgical procedure described resulted in a successful outcome. Benign gastric ulcer currently appears to be the most prevalent cause of gastrocolic fistula. 
Anticardiolipin and antineutrophil antibodies in giant cell arteritis. IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were found in a patient with Takayasu's arteritis and then in 11 of 22 patients with temporal arteritis (TA) studied prospectively. In comparison IgG aCL were found in only one of 18 elderly controls with rheumatoid arthritis and one of 47 healthy elderly controls. In TA IgG aCL were more frequent in those with acute disease (8/12), in those with an accompanying history of polymyalgia rheumatica (9/13), p less than 0.05); and levels normalized with corticosteroid treatment. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) were present in one patient with TA who had no systemic disease. 
Histological changes in free jejunal grafts used in pharyngeal reconstruction. A histological study was performed of biopsies taken from jejunal free grafts used in pharyngeal reconstruction. The main findings were a decreased crypt/villi ratio and a mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate. There was no evidence of metaplastic or dysplastic transformation. 
Atrial regulation of intravascular volume: observations on the tachycardia-polyuria syndrome. The atria, strategically located at the junction of the venous and arterial circulation, contain a network of neural and humoral structures by which they sense and regulate intravascular volume. Atrial receptors, most commonly consisting of complex unencapsulated nerve endings discharging into myelinated vagal fibers, are located in the intrapericardial portions of the caval and pulmonary veins and the adjacent atrial walls. Receptor activation by atrial distension results in increased afferent vagal fiber discharge, which in turn leads to tachycardia (Bainbridge's reflex) and decreased renal sympathetic nerve activity, renal vasomotor tone, and antidiuretic hormone activity. In addition, atrial distension also releases ANF, a peptide with potent diuretic, natriuretic, and vasorelaxant actions. The combined effect of these neurohumoral changes is the production of a large hypotonic diuresis. In the clinical setting the volume-regulating role of the atria is demonstrated by the tachycardia-polyuria syndrome. Laboratory and clinical evidence points to the activation of atrial neurohumoral mechanisms in response to atrial distension as the mediators of the polyuria that often accompanies paroxysmal tachycardias. The involvement of these mechanisms in other forms of cardiac congestion and the capability to easily measure in the blood an index of atrial distension, namely ANF, provide the opportunity to elucidate the pathophysiology and hence to open new therapeutic avenues in many cardiac disorders. 
Evolution of insulin secretory response to glucose by perifused islets from lean (FA/FA) rats chronically infused with glucose. Chronic infusion of nondiabetic rats with glucose for up to 7 days modified the insulin secretory response by subsequently perifused islets. Thus, on the 1st day of infusion with 40% glucose, the islets responded to 16.7 mM glucose with a 3.9-fold increase in insulin release during the first 10 min with no significant change during the second-phase insulin output compared with the control group. On the 2nd day, there was a 2-fold enhancement of insulin release during the initial 10 min of stimulation, the second phase being a similar to control islets. On the 5th day of infusion, the pattern of insulin release was not significantly different from the control group. After 7 day of infusion, there was a 46% decrease in first-phase and a 33% decrease in second-phase insulin response to glucose. The response to 10 mM arginine plus 5 mM glucose was not modified by chronic glucose infusion. Priming experiments indicate that islets from rats infused for 7 days were not able to recover the normal pattern of secretion in vitro. Islets from 7-day glucose-infused rats contained 75% more protein and had a significantly higher insulin content than control islet, suggesting that insulin synthesis is not involved in the loss of the response observed. Glucose metabolism by the islets was modified by glucose infusion with a significant increase in glucose utilization and no changes in glucose oxidation, suggesting that alterations in mitochondrial oxidative events are involved in the phenomenon of desensitization. 
Possible metastatic routes via portacaval shunts in renal adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis. Renal adenocarcinoma findings from autopsies on patients with and without liver metastasis (635 and 936 patients, respectively) were investigated concerning the mode of metastasis. The patients with liver metastasis showed a significantly higher frequency of metastases to the lungs, lymph nodes, contralateral kidney, adrenals, pancreas, spleen, peritoneum, and intestines; in the female patients, those with liver metastasis had a higher frequency of metastasis to the ovary and uterus than patients without liver metastasis. Some of the metastases to those organs are explainable by venous spread via portacaval shunts as well as ordinary hematogenous or lymphogenous spread, especially, those to the contralateral kidney, adrenals, spleen, intestines, or ovary. 
Wound complications after modified radical mastectomy compared with tylectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Tylectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and radiotherapy (TAD) has become an accepted treatment for early breast cancer and has been shown to result in equal 5- and 8-year survival when compared with modified radical mastectomy (MRM). In order to determine the safety of TAD with respect to wound complications and to identify potential risk factors, we reviewed the charts of 560 patients undergoing MRM (n = 387) and TAD (n = 173) at Virginia Mason Medical Center from 1983 through 1989. The incidence of infection, seroma, hematoma, and epidermolysis were compared, and obesity, age 60 years or older, smoking, antibiotics, and wound drainage were examined as possible risk factors. There were more wound complications in the MRM group versus the TAD group (49% versus 35%; p less than 0.01), specifically more seromas (29% versus 18%; p less than 0.01) and epidermolysis (18% versus 0%). In the MRM group, age 60 years or older was associated with seroma (p less than 0.01) and smoking was associated with epidermolysis (p less than 0.01). In the TAD group, obesity was associated with infection. In both groups, volume of drainage from closed suction wound drains greater than 30 mL in the 24 hours prior to removal of the last drain was associated with seroma (p less than 0.05). 
Long-term results of choledochoduodenostomy in the treatment of choledocholithiasis: assessment of 225 cases. During a 10-year period 2610 patients were operated on for biliary lithiasis; in 225 (8.6 per cent) cases the operation concluded with a choledochoduodenostomy. The commonest preoperative diagnosis (62.2 per cent) in these 225 patients was choledocholithiasis; 30 patients had previously had a cholecystectomy. After choledochoduodenostomy, 4.0 per cent of patients had an intra-abdominal complication; six patients developed an intra-abdominal abscess and three developed an external biliary fistula. Four patients (1.8 per cent) died, three from pulmonary complications and one from a biliary fistula. After a mean follow-up period of 4.6 years, 71.5 per cent of patients were asymptomatic. The remainder suffered from dyspepsia (15.1 per cent), colicky pain (8.7 per cent) or episodes of cholangitis (4.7 per cent). Endoscopy in the symptomatic patients allowed the following conclusions: (a) no patient with dyspepsia had a problem at the anastomosis; (b) 27 per cent of those with colic had anastomotic stenosis or the sump syndrome; and (c) all patients with cholangitis had anastomotic stenosis and residual calculi. 
Adequacy of preparation for barium enema among elderly outpatients. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether outpatients 75 years of age or older have a higher rate of inadequate bowel preparation for barium enema and of complications associated with the preparation and the test than patients aged 55 to 74 years. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Radiology department in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Patients 55 years or older referred for a barium enema from March to August 1988. OUTCOME MEASURES: All films were reviewed independently by a study radiologist blind to the staff radiologist's report. Patients were interviewed by telephone within several days after the test to assess the occurrence of problems during the preparation or the test. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 213 patients assessed 72 were excluded: 43 refused to participate or could not be contacted, 16 had previously undergone colonic surgery, and 13 were excluded for other reasons. The remaining 141 patients were separated into three age groups: those 55 to 64 years (46 patients), those 65 to 74 (47) and those 75 or older (48). In 104 cases (74%) the bowel had been prepared adequately; there was no significant difference between the three groups with regard to the adequacy of preparation. The incidence of problems reported by the patients did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatients aged 75 years or more are no more likely than those aged 55 to 74 to have problems with bowel preparation or the barium enema itself. Age should not be a criterion for exclusion from barium enema. To try to lower the rate of poor bowel preparation clinicians and radiologists should consider counselling patients more carefully about the importance of proper preparation. Also, the current method of preparation could be examined to determine whether simple changes would significantly improve colon cleanliness. 
Transmission of hepatitis C virus by organ transplantation BACKGROUND. Liver disease is a frequent and major complication after organ transplantation. We sought to determine whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) is transmitted by organ transplantation and whether it causes post-transplantation liver disease. METHODS. Serum samples from all cadaver organ donors to the New England Organ Bank between 1986 and 1990 were screened retrospectively for antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We reviewed the hospital records of all recipients of organs from anti-HCV-positive donors for evidence of liver disease. Serum samples from recipients obtained before transplantation and during follow-up were analyzed for anti-HCV. RESULTS. Of 716 organ donors, 13 (1.8 percent) were positive for anti-HCV. Their organs (19 kidneys, 6 hearts, and 4 livers) went to 29 recipients. Non-A, non-B hepatitis developed after transplantation in 14 of the 29 (48 percent), for a prevalence 7.4 times the 6.5 percent prevalence after transplantation from untested donors that was previously reported by two institutions in the organ bank (P less than 0.0001). The liver disease began a mean of 3.8 months after transplantation and became chronic in 12 patients; the other 2 had subfulminant hepatic failure. Liver disease was more frequent in the patients who had received antilymphocyte preparations (P = 0.04). HCV was the cause of the post-transplantation liver disease in 12 of the 13 recipients (92 percent) for whom serum samples were available. Anti-HCV was detected by ELISA in eight and enzyme immunoassay in one; in three others, HCV RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in serum samples obtained after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS. Organ transplantation can transmit hepatitis C. This raises serious questions about the continued acceptance of organs from donors positive for anti-HCV. 
Prostaglandin F2 alpha inhibits the ammoniagenic response to acute acidosis in LLC-PK1 cells. A kidney epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1, which does not synthesize prostaglandins, provides an ideal in vitro model system to investigate the effect of prostaglandins in the regulation of renal ammoniagenesis. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated significant increases in glutamine-dependent ammonia and alanine production by rocked cultures of LLC-PK1 cells subjected to either acute metabolic or respiratory acidosis. In the study presented here, experiments were conducted to investigate the role of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the response of ammonia metabolism to acute metabolic acidosis by LLC-PK1 cells. A low dose of PGF2 alpha (0.1 ng/mL) dramatically inhibited the stimulatory effect of a low pH (pH 6.8) on ammonia production. In contrast, the inhibition of cytosolically generated alanine was less dramatic and averaged only 20% of the effect on ammonia production. Furthermore, PGF2 alpha increased cellular alpha-ketoglutarate concentration, suggesting an increase in intramitochondrial pH. Thus, the cellular mechanism of PGF2 alpha action appears to involve either interference with the cytosolic pH signal or its translation to the intramitochondrial compartment. The inhibitory response of PGF2 alpha on pH-stimulated ammoniagenesis was progressively lost at higher concentrations. Both low-dose (0.1 ng/mL) and high-dose (10 ng/mL) PGF2 alpha had no significant effect on the basal rates of ammonia and alanine production at pH 7.4. PGE2, on the other hand, did not exhibit any significant response on ammonia or alanine production at either pH 6.8 or 7.4 when given in a wide range of doses. 
Treatment of children with Down syndrome and growth retardation with recombinant human growth hormone. The effect of recombinant human growth hormone on children with Down syndrome who had growth retardation and microcephaly was examined. Thirteen children with trisomy 21 without congenital heart disease who were short for age (-1.19 to -3.5 standard deviation score) and microcephalic (-1.58 to -6.60 standard deviation score) were given recombinant human growth hormone, 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously, 3 days a week for 1 year. Before treatment, peak serum growth hormone concentrations were less than 10 micrograms/L after levodopa and clonidine stimulation tests in five patients, after clonidine in three patients, and after levodopa in three patients. Three patients had nocturnal integrated growth hormone concentrations of 0.5, 1.5 and 0.65 micrograms/L, respectively. The mean growth rate before treatment was 5.4 +/- 1.6 cm/yr and increased to 12.2 +/- 3.2 cm/yr (p less than 0.001) after 12 months of recombinant human growth hormone treatment. The mean head circumference standard deviation score before treatment was -3.1 +/- 1.3 and increased to -2.3 +/- 1.2 (p less than 0.001) at 12 months. Bone age before and 1 year after treatment increased in correspondence with chronologic age. Plasma hemoglobin A1c concentration was normal during treatment with recombinant human growth hormone. The mean plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I at baseline and at 12 months were 0.54 +/- 0.19 U/ml and 1.25 +/- 0.97 U/ml, respectively (p less than 0.02). We conclude that recombinant human growth hormone therapy can result in a significant increase in annual growth rate and head circumference in children with Down syndrome, without significant side effects. 
A pilot study of stanozolol for advanced breast carcinoma. Eighteen patients with advanced metastatic carcinoma of the breast who had been previously treated with other hormone therapy were treated with stanozolol in a pilot study to assess its efficacy and toxicity. In a heavily pretreated population of patients with advanced breast cancer, three patients (16.6%) had partial responses (PR) and five patients (27.7%) had stable disease (SD). Toxicity was far less than that expected with androgen therapy. Stanozolol should be investigated in large groups of patients to establish its role more fully in the management of metastatic breast carcinoma. 
Cytochrome c oxidase deficiency with acute onset and rapid recovery. A 7-year-old girl with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency who had no neurologic deficits in infancy suddenly developed ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and respiratory arrest. She recovered almost completely 80 days after onset, suggesting that acute onset and rapid remission are observed in patients with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. It is also possible that early initiation of therapy in cytochrome c oxidase deficiency with coenzyme Q10 may hasten and enhance the therapeutic effect. 
Cutaneous botryomycosis. We report four cases of cutaneous botryomycosis. The predisposing factors included alcoholism, diabetes, and trauma. Clinically, the patients had nodules, suppurative plaques, or ulcers. In two cases, Staphylococcus aureus was cultured. In one case Neisseria species was cultured and in another a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium species were the only organism cultured. All patients responded to systemic antibiotic therapy. 
Assessment of left atrial appendage function by transesophageal echocardiography. Implications for the development of thrombus. BACKGROUND. The predilection of the left atrial appendage (LAA) for thrombus formation has long been known. METHODS AND RESULTS. We prospectively studied the two-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler patterns of LAA function in 82 patients by transesophageal echocardiography. In the 63 patients in sinus rhythm, LAA area was measured during LAA diastole at the onset of the electrocardiographic (ECG) P wave (LAAmax) and after LAA systole at the ECG R wave (LAAmin) and LAA ejection fraction was calculated as (LAAmax-LAAmin)/LAAmax; peak Doppler velocity was recorded from the LAA outlet. The 58 patients in sinus rhythm without LAA thrombus were grouped according to left atrial size on transthoracic echocardiography; 39 patients had a left atrial size of less than 40 mm (group 1) and 19 had a left atrial size of 40 mm or greater (group 2). Five patients in sinus rhythm had LAA thrombus. In the 19 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter LAAmax was measured independent of the ECG; three of these patients had LAA spontaneous contrast, four had thrombus, and one had both. Patients in sinus rhythm without LAA thrombus demonstrated a characteristic pattern of a contractile LAA apex and a noncontractile base with color flow and pulsed Doppler evidence of LAA emptying that coincided with the P wave. Patients in sinus rhythm with LAA thrombus had a mean +/- SD LAAmax (8.0 +/- 1.5 cm2) larger than that in group 1 (5.0 +/- 1.9 cm2) (p less than 0.01) but not group 2 (6.7 +/- 3.1 cm2), LAAmin (6.5 +/- 1.0 cm2) larger than that in both group 1 (2.3 +/- 1.5 cm2) and group 2 (4.2 +/- 2.7 cm2) (p less than 0.01), and LAA ejection fraction (17 +/- 11%) and LAA velocity (0.24 +/- 0.10 m/sec) less than those in both group 1 (55 +/- 21% and 0.48 +/- 0.24 m/sec, respectively) and group 2 (45 +/- 27% and 0.46 +/- 0.24 m/sec, respectively) (p less than 0.01). Patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter with LAA spontaneous contrast and/or thrombus had LAAmax (10.4 +/- 6.6 cm2) greater than that in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter without LAA contrast and/or thrombus (6.8 +/- 3.0 cm2) (p less than 0.05). The LAA appeared as a static pouch in seven of eight of the former compared with in two of 11 of the latter. When attempted, Doppler demonstrated a recognizable fibrillatory LAA outflow velocity pattern in none of three in the former versus four of seven in the latter group. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the LAA has a characteristic pattern of emptying in sinus rhythm. LAA thrombus formation in sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation is associated with both poor LAA contraction and LAA dilation. 
A unique bone-like variant of alkaline phosphatase. The authors describe an unusual variant of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) discovered in a patient with a 90-fold increase in serum ALP. The variant ALP was indistinguishable from the bone isoenzyme when subjected to chemical inhibition, heat inactivation, lectin precipitation, and routine electrophoresis. However, treatment with neuraminidase produced a marked decrease in the ALP variant's electrophoretic mobility and a reduction in its molecular weight. A bone marrow biopsy revealed metastatic infiltration of the bone marrow by adenocarcinoma of the prostate accompanied by a remarkable amount of new bone formation, suggesting a bone origin for the unusual isoenzyme. The authors believe this to be the first report of an ALP variant with these properties. 
Migraine and epilepsy with infantile onset and electroencephalographic findings of occipital spike-wave complexes. An EEG finding of temporo-occipital or temporo-parieto-occipital spike-wave complexes, suppressed by eye opening, coexisting with classical migraine, was observed in 14 children; in 13 of these patients, seizures were present. Classical migraine, visual phenomena and seizures coexisted in different clinical patterns. 
Treatment of advanced-stage Hodgkin's disease: alternating noncrossresistant MOPP/CABS is not superior to MOPP. One hundred twenty-five assessable patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin's disease were randomized to receive mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) or MOPP alternating with lomustine (CCNU), doxorubicin, bleomycin, and streptozocin (CABS). The median follow-up is 7.7 years. The complete response rate was 60 of 66 MOPP-treated patients (91%) and 54 of 59 MOPP/CABS-treated patients (92%) (difference not significant). The level of the disease-free survival curve at longest follow-up is 65% for MOPP-treated patients and 72% for MOPP/CABS-treated patients (difference not significant). The overall survival at 12 years is projected at 68% for MOPP-treated patients and 54% for MOPP/CABS-treated patients (difference not significant). Thus, there were no significant differences in efficacy between MOPP and MOPP/CABS. However, MOPP/CABS was more emetogenic than MOPP, and four MOPP/CABS-treated patients went on to develop secondary acute leukemia. No MOPP-treated patients developed leukemia. High initial erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and high platelet counts adversely affected treatment outcome. MOPP-treated patients who received greater than 81% of the projected dose intensity of vincristine over the first three cycles had significantly improved disease-free survival rates over those receiving less than 81%. MOPP/CABS-treated patients who received greater than 82% of the projected dose intensity of vincristine had significantly better overall survival than those who received less than 82%. Disease-free survival on both arms was significantly better in patients who received greater than 84% of the projected dose intensity of all agents. The effect of dose intensity was particularly apparent in patients with poor prognostic factors where those who received greater than 84% of the projected dose intensity of all agents had significantly improved disease-free and overall survival. 
In-vitro DNA synthesis of keratinocytes in normal human skin, psoriasis, seborrhoeic keratosis, Bowen's disease and basal cell carcinoma. The DNA-synthesizing cells in benign and malignant keratotic diseases including psoriasis, seborrhoeic keratosis, Bowen's disease and basal cell carcinoma were studied. Cells in S-phase were labelled after small pieces of the lesions were incubated in tissue culture medium that contained 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). The labelling of DNA was analysed using the labelling index and pattern. Although the malignant diseases tended to show a higher DNA labelling index, neither this nor the loss of polarity alone was associated with malignancy. However, a higher DNA labelling index together with a loss of polarity was characteristic for malignancy. 
Disorders of the hair and scalp in children. A wide variety of disorders involving the scalp and hair exist that may be encountered in the pediatric and adolescent population. An approach to the differential diagnosis of many of these conditions can be considered once the patient is found to have either alopecia, scaling, or tumors of the scalp. Certainly other causes of scalp or hair disease exist but the more common disorders can be appropriately considered in this manner. 
Interactions between calcium channel blockers and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin. We describe a retrospective analysis of the frequency of adverse interactions between calcium channel blockers and anticonvulsant drugs (phenytoin and carbamazepine) in a series of 43 patients. Ten patients receiving carbamazepine and three patients receiving phenytoin exhibited symptoms or signs of toxicity. Toxicity occurred with both diltiazem and verapamil, but not with nifedipine. These results emphasize the need for careful clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients receiving both classes of medication. 
Early enteral nutrition after brain injury by percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy. Twenty-seven patients in a series of 52 patients with severe brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score less than or equal to 8) underwent insertion of intestinal feeding tubes at the bedside. The technique required endoscopy with externalization of gastric and intestinal ports through the abdominal wall. Feedings were begun through the intestinal tube with Vital HN within 4 hours of its insertion with simultaneous gastric decompression via the gastric tube. Tubes were placed 2.3 (range 0-5) days after injury. Full caloric intake (3020 kcal/24 h) was achieved by 6.8 (range 2-8) days after injury to 4.2 (range 2-8) days after placement of the feeding tube. Only 1 patient failed to tolerate feedings immediately after tube insertion. Technical inability to insert the tubes occurred in 3 patients and the intestinal tube migrated into the stomach in 2 patients; diarrhea occurred in only 1 patient. With this technique, it was possible to deliver an average daily intake of 1.2 g/kg of protein in 8-day balance periods beginning at the time of tube insertion. These data included 3- to 4-day periods in which feedings were steadily increased. In 16 patients in whom nitrogen balance was measured for 8-day balance periods, average nitrogen balance was -5.7 (range -11.3 to +3.5) g/24 h. The reduction in nitrogen loss by this technique appears equal to or superior to either gastric feeding or TPN. This technique provides the ability to enterally feed a high proportion of brain-injured patients (except those in barbiturate coma) very early after injury using a bedside procedure. 
Five-day bismuth-free triple therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori and reduction of duodenal ulcer relapse. Previous studies have demonstrated that the eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is associated with a significant reduction of the rate of duodenal ulcer (DU) relapse. The aim of this study was to assess the long-term effect of a bismuth-free triple therapy on the eradication of H. pylori and reduction of DU relapse. After informed consent, 61 patients with endoscopically proven DU and H. pylori infection detected on 14C-urea breath test (BT) were included in the study. All patients received a combination of furazolidone, amoxicillin, and metronidazole, three times a day, for 5 days, in addition to eventual classical antiulcer agents prescribed by their attending physicians. BT was repeated after an interval of at least 60 days to evaluate H. pylori eradication. Endoscopy and another BT were performed again at 6.5 months after therapy to detect possible recurrences. Forty-eight patients completed the trial: 26 (54%) patients were negative for H. pylori at 6.5 months after the end of treatment, and 22 (46%) persisted H. pylori positive. Ninety-two percent of the patients in whom the bacteria were eradicated showed endoscopically healed ulcers and were asymptomatic, and two that were symptomatic presented only occasional pain not requiring therapy. Among the 22 patients who persisted H. pylori positive, six (27%) showed endoscopically active ulcers (p = 0.012) and eight (36%) patients continued to be symptomatic (p less than 0.01), and were still using antiulcer drugs (p = 0.002) 6.5 months after treatment. It is concluded that combined treatment with furazolidone, amoxicillin, and metronidazole for 5 days represents a well-tolerated, inexpensive, and effective therapeutic regime for the eradication of H. pylori and abolition of DU relapse in more than 50% of the patients during a follow-up period of 6.5 months. 
Azygos vein laceration due to blunt trauma. The azygos vein ascends along the thoracic spine through the mediastinum and drains into the superior vena cava at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra. Fracture-dislocation of the mid-thoracic spine, as a result of blunt thoracic trauma, can tear the azygos vein. Four such fatal cases (three motor vehicle accidents and one fall) were studied, only one of which was recognized prior to death. The vein can also be torn, in the absence of skeletal injuries, by horizontal acceleration/deceleration forces. The pathologist must consider azygos vein laceration as a possible cause of either hemothorax or hemomediastinum or both in a victim of a blunt chest trauma, if that individual had persistent hypotension during the few hours before death and no identifiable source of hemorrhage can be found postmortem in sites such as the heart, great vessels, lung, and chest wall. A fracture-dislocation of the thoracic spine may not necessarily be present. Azygos vein laceration seems to be an uncommon cause of hemothorax and hemomediastinum; however, this injury is probably more frequent than is implied by the few cases described in the medical literature. 
Indium-111-labeled B72.3 monoclonal antibody in the detection and staging of breast cancer: a phase I study. Sixteen patients with primary breast cancer were studied with a pancarcinoma monoclonal antibody B72.3, an IgG1 molecule directed against tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG-72) present in several tumors. Five millicuries of 111In was used to label 0.2 mg (six patients), or 2 mg (six patients), or 20 mg using the site-directed bifunctional DTPA method (at carbohydrate moiety). Digital, planar, and SPECT images were obtained at 2, 48, 72 and 96 hr when possible. HAMA levels were obtained before the Mab infusion and at 1, 3, and 6 wk postinfusion. Fourteen of 14 known primary breast lesions were detected by imaging (100% sensitivity). Two fibrocystic lesions were negative. Seven of 14 patients had lymph node metastases by histologic methods, but all were missed by radioimmunoscintigraphy. Tumor uptake of Mab ranged 0.00054%-0.0038% of the ID/g. The tumor-to-normal breast tissue ratio was 4.3 +/- 0.91 (mean +/- s.e.m.). Lymph nodes localization of 111In-B72.3 by tissue analysis was similar for tumor-bearing and normal nodes (0.0039 +/- 0.0023 versus 0.0025 +/- 0.0019). Pharmacokinetics revealed mean plasma half-life of 33.3-41.2 hr for the different doses. There was no statistical difference between any of the pharmacokinetic parameters of different doses. HAMA was positive only in 17% of the patients. The study suggests that this antibody has 100% sensitivity for primary breast cancers, but very poor detection rate of metastatic lesions in axillary lymph nodes; thus making it of questionable value in the initial staging process of this disease. 
Prolactin and cortisol levels in various paroxysmal disorders in childhood. The hormonal response of the anterior pituitary to various epileptic and nonepileptic events in children was studied. Postictal serum prolactin and cortisol levels were measured in 17 children with epilepsy, 23 with febrile seizures, and 10 with syncope or breath-holding spells. The levels were compared with those of 30 children with nonspecific fever, and 23 afebrile children served as control subjects. Significantly higher (P less than .01) prolactin levels (26.5 +/- 3.3 ng/mL, mean +/- SEM) were found in the epileptic group, compared with levels in children with febrile seizures (13.2 +/- 1.0 ng/mL), fever (11.2 +/- 0.9 ng/mL), syncope (7.3 +/- 0.9 ng/mL), and the control group (7.9 +/- 0.6 ng/mL). In contrast, serum cortisol levels were nonspecifically elevated in the epileptics and patients with febrile seizures or fever only. These findings suggest that elevated prolactin levels may be found after epileptic seizures and much less after febrile seizures, but not after breath-holding spells or syncopal events. Cortisol secretion appears to be nonselectively triggered by all stressful events, such as epileptic and febrile seizures, and fever. Elevated prolactin levels (greater than 15 ng/mL) associated with seizures may help in differentiating epileptic from febrile seizures or syncope. 
Cytogenetic abnormalities associated with renal cell carcinoma. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on 23 renal cell carcinomas (21 sporadic and 2 associated with von Hippel-Lindau's disease). Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were found in 19 of 21 of the sporadic tumors. The most frequent abnormalities were a loss or rearrangement of material in 3p (11 of 21 cases) or an extra chromosome 7 (7 of 21 cases). Correlation between specific chromosomal abnormalities and clinical presentation was absent with the exception of trisomy 7 and -Y, which occurred only in patients more than 60 years old. An increasing number of cytogenetic abnormalities were associated with a greater likelihood of renal vein and/or capsule involvement. Both patients with von Hippel-Lindau's disease had tumors with a normal karyotype. 
Uncemented total hip arthroplasty. Prospective analysis of the tri-lock femoral component. Fifty consecutive hip disease patients (56 hips) with total hip arthroplasties (THA) utilized the uncemented Tri-Lock femoral component. Forty-five patients (51 hips) were followed for an average of 46 months (range, 24-66). Forty-two patients (47 hips) were followed with clinical examination and roentgenographs, three (four hips) by telephone interview, four (four hips) were deceased, and one (one hip) was lost to follow-up evaluation. The diagnoses included osteoarthritis (30 hips), avascular necrosis (11 hips), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (two hips), and degenerative joint disease secondary to childhood hip disorder (four hips). Of 47 hips, 34 were graded excellent, seven good, three fair, and three poor using the Harris hip score. The incidence of thigh pain was 19% at one year, but only 6% at final follow-up evaluation. Limp persisted in 19% of the patients. Of the three patients with four hips contacted by telephone, two had slight pain and two had no pain. The roentgenographic results found an alarming 38% incidence of varus shift of the components, relative to their preoperative position. The presence of a varus shift did not adversely affect the clinical results. Early experience with the Tri-Lock femoral component shows results comparable to those reported in the literature. The high incidence of femoral component shift, presumably because of geometry of the stem is of concern. Longer follow-up evaluation will be necessary to determine the fate of these uncemented THA operations. 
Modulation of venous tone in heart failure. Venodilatation may be an important property in drugs used to treat heart failure. Deductions about venous tone from standard hemodynamic studies may be misleading since filling pressures may be reduced by improved left ventricular function. To study the venodilator properties of drugs, we have modified a radionuclide blood pool method and shown that venous volume is increased by 10% after glyceryl trinitrate but is unchanged after the arteriolar dilator hydralazine. In patients with congestive cardiac failure, the calcium channel blocker, felodipine, causes a marked reduction in systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular filling pressures, but venous volume remains unchanged. In a similar group of patients comparable arterial and central effects are seen after the administration of captopril, but venous volume increases by 16%, and this increased venous volume is sustained after 3 months of long-term treatment. Milrinone has been used to treat both acute and chronic heart failure. As expected of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, it exhibits inotropic properties in animals and humans and also causes arterial vasodilatation. We have studied its effects on venous tone in 10 patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association classes III to IV). Milrinone was given intravenously at a loading dose of 50 micrograms/kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 micrograms/kg/min. After treatment, cardiac index, which was measured by thermodilution, increased from 1.8 +/- 0.48 to 2.3 +/- 0.65 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.001); pulmonary artery wedge pressure fell from 23 +/- 6 to 11 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); and systemic vascular resistance index decreased from 4296 to 3168 dynes.sec.cm-5/m2 (p less than 0.001). 
Suprahyoid pharyngotomy for oropharynx cancer including the tongue base. Suprahyoid pharyngotomy has been utilized as the standard approach to tongue base cancer not involving the larynx or mandible for the last 6 years at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Boston, Mass. Review of 15 patients revealed that all had advanced disease (stage III and stage IV); 14 cases involved the tongue base, and one was on the posterior pharyngeal wall. By following the hyoepiglottic ligament, precise entry into the vallecula was routine. No injuries of vital neurovascular structures or compromised tumor margins were present; one tracheotomy was performed. Primary closure without the use of flaps was accomplished in 14 of 15 patients. No locoregional recurrences were found, with a median follow-up of 25 months. However, two patients died of another unrelated cancer, and two patients died of a myocardial infarction unrelated to their surgery. Suprahyoid pharyngotomy is a familiar approach often utilized during laryngectomy. In our experience, it provides excellent exposure of the oropharynx, can be combined with a transoral approach to avoid mandibulotomy without precluding this option, allows for simple reconstruction, and has a low complication rate. 
Mucosal humoral immune response to Helicobacter pylori in patients with duodenitis. The humoral immune response to Helicobacter pylori infection in the duodenum has been investigated by short-term in vitro culture, ELISA, and immunoblotting techniques. H. pylori IgA secretion by duodenal bulb biopsies was significantly increased (P less than 0.001) in patients with duodenitis. The IgA response to H. pylori in patients with duodenitis was restricted to the first part of the duodenum; second part duodenal biopsies secreting significantly (P less than 0.001) less IgA during culture in vitro. H. pylori IgG antibody secretion by cultured biopsies was also significantly increased (P less than 0.01) in patients with duodenitis and those with gastric H. pylori infection but without duodenitis. Immunoblotting of duodenal bulb culture supernatants showed positive recognition by the mucosal IgA response of H. pylori antigens in the region of 120, 90, 61, and 31-26 kDa in patients with duodenitis. Serologically, such patients showed little evidence of IgA H. pylori antibodies by immunoblotting. These results demonstrate that the inflammatory response in the duodenal mucosa of patients with duodenitis represents a specific highly localized humoral response to H. pylori. 
Fetal cephaloceles: diagnosis with US. The prenatal sonograms of 15 fetuses with cephaloceles (13 occipital, one ethmoidal, and one frontoparietal) were retrospectively reviewed. The prognosis for fetuses with cephaloceles was poor: Only three of 14 with follow-up were born alive (21%), and all are likely to be handicapped. Karyotypes were abnormal in four of nine fetuses tested (44%). Associated cranial abnormalities observed in various numbers of fetuses included ventriculomegaly, the "lemon" sign, a flat basioccipital, "beaked" tectum, and bone defect. A wide variety of neural and nonneural anomalies were associated with cephaloceles. At least one sonographically observed concomitant neural or nonneural axis abnormality or an abnormal karyotype was present in nine of 15 fetuses (60%). Some associated neural malformations noted pathologically were not observed prenatally. Cranial meningoceles were not accurately distinguished from encephaloceles sonographically, and they also were associated with a poor prognosis. Comparison of findings in fetuses with cephaloceles with those of 15 fetuses with cystic hygromas revealed that the two abnormalities can usually be distinguished by the relationship of the mass with the neck and by other cranial findings present in fetuses with cephaloceles but absent in association with cystic hygromas. 
Sodium restriction in hypertensive patients treated with a converting enzyme inhibitor and a thiazide. When the function of the renin system is inhibited, blood pressure becomes more dependent on changes in sodium and water balance. Diuretics alone and sodium restriction alone are additive to converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. However, it is not known if these two ways of reducing sodium balance are additive in the presence of established converting enzyme inhibition. We therefore performed a double-blind crossover study of the effects of moderate sodium restriction in 21 patients with essential hypertension who were already being treated with the combination of a converting enzyme inhibitor and a diuretic. After 1 month of captopril (50 mg twice daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily) therapy, with their usual sodium intake, average supine blood pressure was 147/96 +/- 5/3 (SEM) mm Hg 2 hours after treatment. Patients then reduced their sodium intake to around 80-100 mmol/day for the remainder of the study. After 2 weeks of sodium restriction, they entered a double-blind, randomized, crossover study of Slow Sodium (100 mmol sodium/day) compared with Slow Sodium placebo, while continuing sodium restriction and the above treatment. During the double-blind study, after 1 month of treatment with captopril (50 mg twice daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily), and Slow Sodium placebo, supine blood pressure 2 hours after treatment was 138/88 +/- 4/2 mm Hg (24-hour urinary sodium 104 +/- 11 mmol). After 1 month of captopril (50 mg twice daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once daily), and Slow Sodium tablets, supine blood pressure 2 hours after treatment was 147/91 +/- 5/2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05; 24-hour urinary sodium 195 +/- 14 mmol). 
Some genetic aspects of idiopathic and symptomatic absence seizures: waking and sleep EEGs in siblings. Epileptic activity was recorded in the waking and sleep EEG of 62.5% of 80 siblings of 38 patients with absence seizures. Epileptic discharges were noted in waking only in 8.7%, in waking as well as sleep in 28.8%, and in sleep only in 25%. Generalized, partly irregular, and slow spike-wave complexes were found, twice with lateral emphasis. Spike-wave complexes were recorded in 72% of 50 siblings of patients with idiopathic absence and in 46.7% of 30 siblings of patients with symptomatic absence. One epileptic discharge was observed every 108.6 s on the average, without striking differences between siblings of patients with idiopathic (99.7 s) and symptomatic absence (119.3 s). Without any differences between siblings of children with idiopathic and symptomatic absence, the most epileptic discharges were activated in sleep stages C and D, followed by stages A and B. The highest activation rate was observed in the 7-14-year-old group (73.5%) and to a somewhat lesser degree in the group between 15 and 20 years of age (66.7%); fewer epileptic discharges were recorded in younger (25%) and older patients (28.6%). The higher activation rates in the male sex were significant only in siblings of patients with idiopathic absence. Although only five patients (13.2%) were photosensitive, a photosensitivity was found in 24% of siblings of children with idiopathic absence and in 20% of siblings of patients with symptomatic absence. Three siblings of patients with idiopathic absence also had absence seizures; in one of them a febrile seizure occurred at an earlier age. All of them showed generalized spike wave discharges in waking as well as sleep. Occipital theta delta activity with generalization was observed more frequently in siblings of patients with idiopathic absence (82.2%) than in those of patients with symptomatic absence (63.6%). Our waking and sleep EEG recordings prove that concerning etiology-genetic factors play a striking role in idiopathic absence, but are also of considerable significance in the symptomatic types. 
Resting pulse rate of children and young adults associated with blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors. Few researchers have investigated the resting pulse rate of children and young adults as a risk factor or indicator for subsequent cardiovascular morbidity in a representative sample of the total population. Data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for persons ages 6-24 years revealed mean resting pulse rates that declined with age until ages 12-16, were higher in females than males, and in whites than blacks. At ages 12-17 and 18-24, blood pressure and body temperature showed consistent, independent, positive associations with pulse rate in whites. However, relatively little of the overall variation in pulse rate was explained by measured variables in multivariate regression analyses. Mother-child, age-specific correlation coefficients for pulse and blood pressure were generally positive. Further research is needed on the associations of resting pulse rate with sex, race, and blood pressure and with subsequent cardiovascular morbidity. 
Intestinal absorption of calcium and calcium metabolism in patients with essential hypertension and normal renal function. Several abnormalities of calcium metabolism have been described in patients with essential hypertension, and they have been linked to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Intestinal calcium absorption has been shown to be decreased in rats with spontaneous hypertension, but it has not been studied in patients with essential hypertension. In these studies we have for the first time measured intestinal absorption of calcium (using oral and intravenous administration of 47Ca), along with other parameters of calcium metabolism, in 14 patients with essential hypertension and normal renal function and in 16 normal subjects. There was no difference in serum total or ionized calcium, serum phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), and 24,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D(24,25(OH)2D) among hypertensives and normotensives. The urinary excretion of calcium, on the other hand, was greater in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects (195 +/- 33 v 107 +/- 13 mg/24 h, P less than .05). There was also no difference in intestinal absorption of calcium after 2 and 24 h among hypertensives and normotensives. When hypertensive patients were stratified according to plasma renin activity (PRA) we found that patients with low PRA had higher intestinal absorption of calcium at 2 h (23 +/- 2.9 v 18 +/- 0.6%, P less than .05) but not at 24 h. Serum total and ionized calcium, PTH, and 1,25(OH)2D were not different between patients with low and those with normal-high PRA. The major derangement of calcium metabolism in patients with essential hypertension is hypercalciuria. This abnormality is more pronounced in patients with low PRA, and it may lead to increased vitamin D-dependent intestinal absorption of calcium. 
Prolactin and cortisol levels in various paroxysmal disorders in childhood. The hormonal response of the anterior pituitary to various epileptic and nonepileptic events in children was studied. Postictal serum prolactin and cortisol levels were measured in 17 children with epilepsy, 23 with febrile seizures, and 10 with syncope or breath-holding spells. The levels were compared with those of 30 children with nonspecific fever, and 23 afebrile children served as control subjects. Significantly higher (P less than .01) prolactin levels (26.5 +/- 3.3 ng/mL, mean +/- SEM) were found in the epileptic group, compared with levels in children with febrile seizures (13.2 +/- 1.0 ng/mL), fever (11.2 +/- 0.9 ng/mL), syncope (7.3 +/- 0.9 ng/mL), and the control group (7.9 +/- 0.6 ng/mL). In contrast, serum cortisol levels were nonspecifically elevated in the epileptics and patients with febrile seizures or fever only. These findings suggest that elevated prolactin levels may be found after epileptic seizures and much less after febrile seizures, but not after breath-holding spells or syncopal events. Cortisol secretion appears to be nonselectively triggered by all stressful events, such as epileptic and febrile seizures, and fever. Elevated prolactin levels (greater than 15 ng/mL) associated with seizures may help in differentiating epileptic from febrile seizures or syncope. 
Evolution of myocardial ischemia and left ventricular function in patients with angina pectoris without myocardial infarction and total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and collaterals from other coronary arteries. Repeated episodes of myocardial ischemia might lead to progressive impairment of left ventricular (LV) function. This radionuclide study assessed myocardial ischemia and LV function several years after documented coronary occlusion without myocardial infarction. Over 5 years, 24 consecutive patients, who underwent cardiac catheterization for angina pectoris without myocardial infarction, had isolated total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery with well-developed collateral vessels. Five patients were successfully treated by coronary bypass grafting and 3 by coronary angioplasty. Among the 16 medically treated patients, 1 was lost to follow-up and 1 died (extracardiac death). The mean (+/- standard deviation) follow-up (14 patients) was 48 +/- 15 months. At follow-up, 8 patients still had clinical chest pain, 11 received antianginal therapy, 4 patients had no stress ischemia and the other 10 had greater than or equal to 1 sign of stress ischemia. All patients had a normal LV ejection fraction at rest (mean 60 +/- 3%; range 55 to 65%). Collateral circulation preserves LV function at the time of occlusion and, in some cases, prevents the development of myocardial ischemia; in patients with persisting myocardial ischemia after well-collateralized coronary occlusion, LV function is not impaired at long-term follow-up. 
Treatment of organic impotence. A review of 86 patients referred to a urological clinic with impotence showed that in 58% the causation was predominantly psychogenic. These patients were managed with psychosexual counselling. The various treatment options were discussed with those patients with organic impotence and 14 underwent the implantation of a penile prosthesis. A review of 130 patients who received penile prostheses in the period 1983 to 1987 was carried out to compare the complications and results obtained with the various types of prosthesis. The overall satisfaction rate was 81%; dissatisfaction usually arose as a result of complications of surgery. These were highest in patients with diabetes and priapism. The complications were also related to the type of prosthesis used. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antihypertensives. Approximately 60 million people in the United States have hypertension (BP greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg), 40 million have arthritis clinically suitable for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy, and millions take NSAIDs for nonarthritic conditions, creating considerable potential for concomitant administration of NSAIDs and antihypertensive agents. It is estimated that more than 20 million people are on concurrent therapy. Most NSAIDs produce mild elevations of normal blood pressure levels and can partially or completely antagonize the effects of many antihypertensive drugs. The effect on blood pressure can vary from no effect to hypertensive crisis. In pooled studies, the average increase in mean arterial pressure was 10 mm Hg, and duration was short-lived or chronic. Significant interactions occur in about 1% of patients per year. The risk is greatest in the elderly, blacks, and patients with low-renin hypertension. NSAIDs may block the antihypertensive effects of thiazide and loop diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, alpha-adrenergic blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. No interactions have been reported with centrally acting alpha agonists or the calcium channel blockers. The mechanism of the hypertensive effects of NSAIDs seem primarily related to their ability to block the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, with a resultant decrease in prostaglandin formation. The prostaglandins are important in normal modulation of renal and systemic vascular dilatation, glomerular filtration, tubular secretion of salt and water, adrenergic neurotransmission, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Blockade of salutary effects of prostaglandins by NSAIDs results in a complex series of events culminating in attenuation of the effects of many antihypertensive agents. High-risk patients treated with NSAIDs should be identified and have blood pressure, renal function, and serum potassium frequently monitored. 
Usefulness of flecainide for prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter. Danish-Norwegian Flecainide Multicenter Study Group. To evaluate the efficacy of flecainide acetate in the prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter, 43 patients (23 men) (mean age 53 years) were randomized blindly to receive either placebo or 150 mg of flecainide twice per day for consecutive periods of 3 months. Attacks were verified by a minielectrocardiogram event recorder. If intolerable symptoms developed, the protocol allowed patients to cross over between treatments before the end of the first 3-month period. Four patients crossed over prematurely, between 1 week and 1 month, and 15 between 1 month and 3 months. The remaining 24 patients completed both 3-month periods. In all 3 treatment intervals, there was a significant reduction in the number of attacks during flecainide treatment (p less than 0.002). Complete suppression was seen in 15 of 43 patients (35%) treated with flecainide for 1 week, in 18 of 39 (46%) treated for 1 month and in 12 of 24 (50%) completing all 3 months in each period. Adverse effects were reported in 32 of the 43 patients (74%) treated with flecainide, but only 2 were withdrawals. One patient died suddenly. In comparison, 3 of 43 patients (7%) reported adverse effects in the placebo group. In conclusion, flecainide significantly suppressed the number of attacks of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter. Adverse effects were frequent but were mostly tolerable. 
Mortality and morbidity in patients receiving encainide, flecainide, or placebo. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial, designed to test the hypothesis that suppression of ventricular ectopy after a myocardial infarction reduces the incidence of sudden death, patients in whom ventricular ectopy could be suppressed with encainide, flecainide, or moricizine were randomly assigned to receive either active drug or placebo. The use of encainide and flecainide was discontinued because of excess mortality. We examined the mortality and morbidity after randomization to encainide or flecainide or their respective placebo. RESULTS. Of 1498 patients, 857 were assigned to receive encainide or its placebo (432 to active drug and 425 to placebo) and 641 were assigned to receive flecainide or its placebo (323 to active drug and 318 to placebo). After a mean follow-up of 10 months, 89 patients had died: 59 of arrhythmia (43 receiving drug vs. 16 receiving placebo; P = 0.0004), 22 of nonarrhythmic cardiac causes (17 receiving drug vs. 5 receiving placebo; P = 0.01), and 8 of noncardiac causes (3 receiving drug vs. 5 receiving placebo). Almost all cardiac deaths not due to arrhythmia were attributed to acute myocardial infarction with shock (11 patients receiving drug and 3 receiving placebo) or to chronic congestive heart failure (4 receiving drug and 2 receiving placebo). There were no differences between the patients receiving active drug and those receiving placebo in the incidence of nonlethal disqualifying ventricular tachycardia, proarrhythmia, syncope, need for a permanent pacemaker, congestive heart failure, recurrent myocardial infarction, angina, or need for coronary-artery bypass grafting or angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS. There was an excess of deaths due to arrhythmia and deaths due to shock after acute recurrent myocardial infarction in patients treated with encainide or flecainide. Nonlethal events, however, were equally distributed between the active-drug and placebo groups. The mechanisms underlying the excess mortality during treatment with encainide or flecainide remain unknown. 
Hypoxemic stimulation of heart glycogen synthase and synthesis. Effects of insulin and diabetes mellitus. With radiotracer and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR) methods, we studied the time course of glycogen resynthesis after three 90-s episodes of hypoxemia in both control and diabetic rats in vivo. Glycogen synthesis was measured in the presence and absence of infused insulin and compared with the changes in glycogen synthase (GS) and phosphorylase activities. We observed in 13C-NMR spectra the expected mobilization of glycogen during hypoxia in vivo. In control rats with or without exogenous insulin, this was followed by a rapid resynthesis of glycogen during a 40-min recovery period. A marked activation of GS was observed by 10 min (glucose-6-phosphate-independent form of GS [GSl] = 0.65 mumol.min-1.g-1 or 92% of total GS), and activation persisted up to 40 min in both groups. Glycogen synthesis during the recovery period averaged 0.51 and 0.45 mumol.min-1.g-1 in the saline- and insulin-treated rats, respectively. In the diabetic rats by 10 min after hypoxemia, GSl increased only modestly in both saline-treated (0.16 mumol.min-1.g-1) and insulin-treated (0.21 mumol.min-1.g-1) rats, and activation persisted up to 40 min only with insulin treatment. Glycogen synthesis was slower in the diabetic rats given insulin (0.28 mumol.min-1.g-1) and essentially absent in the saline-treated rats (0.03 mumol.min-1.g-1) compared with controls. We conclude that recovery from hypoxemia is accompanied by a marked activation of GSl and rapid rates of glycogen synthesis in nondiabetic rats, and diabetes markedly blunts this response. Acute insulin infusion only partially overcomes this block. 
Stability of buffered lidocaine and epinephrine used for local anesthesia. Buffered lidocaine has been recently recommended for local anesthesia, as there is less pain on injection of the buffered solution. Reduced pain on injection of lidocaine and epinephrine buffered to a neutral pH was confirmed in 20 subjects (P less than .01). Concentrations of buffered lidocaine and epinephrine were performed in order to evaluate their stability. Buffered lidocaine dropped to 66.1% of initial concentrations after 4 weeks when stored at 25 degrees C. Buffered epinephrine fell to 1.34% of its initial concentration under similar conditions. Buffered lidocaine and epinephrine maintained 94.54% and 82.04%, respectively, of their initial concentrations after 4 weeks when refrigerated at 0-4 degrees C. Both lidocaine and epinephrine maintained greater than 90% concentration 2 weeks after buffering when stored at 0-4 degrees C. This permits batch buffering of lidocaine with epinephrine and storage for periods up to 2 weeks when properly refrigerated. 
Association of sustained oxyhemoglobin desaturation and onset of cluster headache attacks. Ten episodic cluster headache patients in their active cluster period, ten patients in remission and five control subjects were monitored for minute to minute changes in oxygen saturation (SaO2) and pulse rate before and after nitroglycerin (NTG) administration. A transient but significant decrease in SaO2 and increase in pulse rate of 25 minutes duration occurred following NTG in all groups. These changes may reflect physiologic hemodynamic effects of NTG as a smooth muscle relaxant. Subsequently, SaO2 levels and pulse rate recovered to baseline values in remission and control groups. In contrast, SaO2 values in the active cluster group decreased further and after an extended period culminated in cluster headache attacks in 10/10 patients. Three major changes, therefore, distinguished active cluster patients from remission and control groups. First, the magnitude of oxygen desaturation increased after the physiological effects of NTG ceased. Second, oxygen desaturation was sustained for an additional 9 to 30 minutes duration. Third, the hypoxemic state culminated in attacks in all cases. Our findings suggest that the active cluster period may be characterized by an impaired mechanism to autoregulate, and thus compensate, for hypoxemia. It is further proposed that persistence of hypoxemia and the cluster attack onset may share a common mechanism, coupling the two events. We suggest that abnormal central and/or peripheral chemoreceptor activity may be responsible for these events. 
Germ-line deletions of mtDNA in mitochondrial myopathy. mtDNA encodes subunits of the electron transport chain and is exclusively maternally inherited in mammals. It has been suggested that mtDNA might be the site of some of the mutations causing a group of human disorders called the "mitochondrial myopathies," because these may both be (1) accompanied by defects in the electron transport chain and (2) display a maternal pattern of inheritance. However, all of the deletions and duplications of mtDNA which occur in these patients have been sporadic, apart from families in whom affected members all carry different deletions suggesting a mutant autosomal dominantly inherited nuclear gene with de novo deletions in each individual. We present the first evidence for the presence of deleted mtDNAs in the germ line in these disorders. The patient carries a higher level of deleted mtDNAs than do his relatives, corresponding to severity of symptoms and consistent with a predicted dosage effect. "Selfishness" of deleted mtDNAs is probably one of the factors over and above random segregation of a small number of "founder" mtDNAs (the bottleneck hypothesis) which may be invoked to explain the usual distribution of mtDNAs in different tissues of patients with mtDNA deletions. 
Long-term mental health effects of a pediatric home care program. The increased survival of youngsters with chronic physical disorders has led to concern about their long-term psychological adjustment. Few data are available on how to reduce the psychological morbidity that occurs in the presence of chronic childhood illness. An earlier report of a randomized controlled trial of a pediatric home care program demonstrated that this program, combining comprehensive biomedical and psychosocial care, reduced the short-term psychological morbidity of those receiving home care. However, data have not previously been available on whether the short-term improvement in adjustment is associated with any long-term benefits. This report presents long-term follow-up data collected 4 1/2 to 5 years after enrollment on 68% of the original sample. After this interval there were even larger differences between the experimental and control groups than those previously observed at 6 months and 1 year. This finding provides strong evidence that a comprehensive family-oriented outreach program for youngsters with chronic physical disorders can have long-term mental health benefits. It should encourage clinicians to develop similar programs and investigators to look for long-term effects of other interventions. 
Sarcoidosis of the nervous system. A clinical approach. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder of unknown cause. The disease is characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in the affected tissue system. Clinically recognizable nervous system involvement occurs in about 10% of patients with sarcoidosis, although the incidence of subclinical neurosarcoidosis is much higher. The disease appears in the differential diagnosis of many infectious and noninfectious neurological syndromes. We have reviewed all aspects of neurosarcoidosis from the point of view of practicing internists, including the clinical manifestations, cerebrospinal fluid and radiographic changes, differential diagnosis, and treatment. 
The sequential generation of neutrophil chemoattractant proteins in acute inflammation in the rabbit in vivo. Relationship between C5a and proteins with the characteristics of IL-8/neutrophil-activating protein 1. An in vivo experimental peritonitis model was investigated in the rabbit using zymosan as the inflammatory stimulus. After an i.p. injection of zymosan, exudate was removed at intervals and tested in the back skin of assay rabbits. Assay rabbits received i.v. injections of 125I-albumin and 111In-neutrophils, and the local accumulation of each label was measured in response to intradermal injections of exudate samples mixed with a potentiating dose of PGE2. When peritoneal exudate samples were tested in the presence of a specific anti-C5a antibody, virtually all the edema-inducing and neutrophil chemoattractant activity was abolished in samples taken up to 2 h after the zymosan injection. Later samples, however, contained increasing levels of a non-C5a component. In C5a-depleted 6-h exudate two peaks of inflammatory activity were separated using cation exchange HPLC. Evidence is presented that C5a itself is unable to stimulate the production of these activities. Both peaks of activity appear related to IL-8/NAP-1 as they inhibited the binding of 125I-IL-8/NAP-1 to human neutrophils. 
Studies on corticosteroid therapy in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. We evaluated the significance of corticosteroid therapy on 47 new patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease examined in the Uveitis Survey Clinic of the Hokkaido University Hospital. All patients were treated with topical corticosteroids, with or without systemic corticosteroids. 18 patients received systemic corticosteroid as pulse therapy, 20 patients received high-dose corticosteroid starting with prednisolone 200 mg, 2 patients received conventional-dose corticosteroid and 7 patients received no systemic corticosteroid therapy. When we evaluated the results 6 months after the initiation of treatment, anterior chamber inflammation was significantly less in patients with pulse and high-dose corticosteroid therapy than in those without systemic corticosteroid therapy. Furthermore, final visual acuity was significantly better in patients with pulse and high-dose corticosteroid than in those without them. However, there was no significant difference between patients with pulse therapy and those with high-dose corticosteroid therapy. The findings are in support of systemic corticosteroid therapy (pulse and high-dose) in the treatment of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. 
End-tidal CO2 monitoring in mitral stenosis patients undergoing closed mitral commissurotomy. Arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide difference (P(a-E')CO2) was recorded in 20 mitral stenosis patients (group A) for closed mitral commissurotomy and 20 healthy individuals (group B) for elective limb surgery. Mitral stenosis patients showed a greater difference than group B patients. Repeated measurements of P(a-E')CO2 in mitral stenosis patients at various stages of closed mitral commissurotomy not only showed a mean increase from before thoracotomy but there was also no correlation between P(a-E')CO2 before thoracotomy with that after thoracotomy, after commissurotomy or after chest closure. This indicated that end-tidal CO2 monitoring was unsuitable to measure adequacy of ventilation during closed mitral commissurotomy. 
The possible influence of antibiotics on results of bacillus Calmette-Guerin intravesical therapy for superficial bladder cancer. Intravesical treatment with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is an established treatment of carcinoma in situ and an effective prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrence of transitional cell carcinoma. During instillation therapy oral antibiotics may be used to prevent or to treat urinary tract infections. Tuberculostatic agents are employed to prevent or to treat local irritative symptoms and systemic side effects caused by Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. We investigated the susceptibility of four different Bacillus Calmette-Guerin preparations to 18 antibiotics and to 11 tuberculostatic agents in vitro. All preparations were equally susceptible to most of the commonly used antibiotics and to all of the tuberculostatic agents with the exception of pyrazinamide. Our results suggest that in the absence of cystitis, instillations should not be accompanied by antibiotics because of the possible inhibition of antitumor efficacy by eradication of living Bacillus Calmette-Guerin organisms. The same inhibition may occur when tuberculostatic agents are used to prevent local and systemic complications of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillation therapy. 
An unusual angiographic picture in status migrainosus. Arteriographic findings suggestive of inflammation are described in a 26-year-old woman presenting with headache and syncope. There were no clinical findings of angitis, and a diagnosis of status migrainosus was eventually made. We present her case, as well as a review of previous cases of arterial changes in patients with headache. Most previous cases report arterial narrowing, felt to reflect spasm, whereas our patient demonstrated segmental stenoses and dilatations, perhaps implicating inflammation. The inflammatory process has been postulated as the pathogenesis of migraine pain. As most migraineurs do not undergo arteriography, the incidence of arterial change in these patients is unknown. This finding has therapeutic implications for selecting the optimal anti-migraine agent. 
Serum and tissue autoantibodies to colonic epithelium in ulcerative colitis. Sera and colonic tissue-bound immunoglobulin extracts from patients with ulcerative colitis and disease controls were examined immunohistochemically and by killer cell cytotoxicity assay for the presence of anticolonic epithelial autoantibodies. IgG yields in the tissue extracts from patients with colitis and control subjects were similar, and the extracts were uniformly autoantibody negative. Of 41 sera from patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 'classical' anticolon antibody was present in 41% and was commoner in patients with sclerosing cholangitis. Cytotoxic anticolon antibody was present in 20% overall and was strongly associated with disease activity; it did not correlate with the presence of 'classical' anticolon antibody. The heterogeneous and non-universal antiepithelial autoantibody response and the failure to detect tissue bound autoantibody in vivo argue against the hypothesis that humoral autoimmunity is of major importance in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. 
Rapid development of resistance to antifolates in vitro: possible clinical implication. Within three repeated 7-day incubation periods with either methotrexate (MTX) or trimetrexate (TMTX), human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-8) developed high levels of resistance to these drugs, as evidenced by approximately 20- and 50-fold increases, respectively, in the median effective doses. Similarly, within six short-term exposures (4 hours) to the same drugs, a high degree of resistance developed in the cells. Alternating 4-hour treatment cycles with MTX and TMTX did not delay the onset of resistance to these antimetabolites in the HCT-8 cells. The same strategy produced no better results than giving either MTX or TMTX alone to (C57BL/6 x DBA/2)F1 mice bearing murine leukemia P388 cells. Furthermore, HCT-8 cells resistant to short-term (4-hour) exposure to MTX were cross-resistant to the same drug given for 7 days continuously, and cells resistant to MTX given continuously for 7 days were cross-resistant to the same drug given for 4 hours. Analogous results were obtained with TMTX, indicating that, under these circumstances, changing the schedule of administration of the same agent does not overcome resistance to it. The clinical relevance of these data to prolonged adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as loco-regional and continuous-infusion chemotherapy, is discussed. 
Inhibition of mineralization of glutaraldehyde-pretreated bovine pericardium by AlCl3. Mechanisms and comparisons with FeCl3, LaCl3, and Ga(NO3)3 in rat subdermal model studies. In the present study, the authors investigated the mechanism by which Al3+ preincubations inhibited the pathologic calcification of glutaraldehyde-pretreated bovine pericardium (GPBP) implanted subdermally in rats. The concentration dependency of the Al3+ anticalcification effect was compared with that of other trivalent metal ions (Fe3+, Ga3+, La3+) known to interact with calcium phosphates. In vitro incubations of GPBP were carried out in AlCl3 (10(-3) mol/l [molar] to 10(-1) mol/l) to ascertain both the optimal conditions for uptake of Al3+ and the time course of Al3+ dissociation. Al3+ uptake by GPBP was concentration dependent and occurred rapidly, with tissue levels after 1 hour not differing significantly from those after 72 hours of incubation. Analyses of GPBP samples preincubated in AlCl3 (0.1 mol/l, 24 hours) showed that more than 75% of the Al3+ remained tightly bound after 60 days' in vitro release at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4. Preincubations of GPBP in AlCl3 significantly inhibited calcification after subdermal implantation in rats for 60 days (Ca++ = 5.1 +/- 0.9 microgram/mg, 11.5 +/- 4.6 micrograms/mg, 70.3 +/- 23.0 micrograms/mg, mean +/- standard error [SE], for 10(-1) mol/l, 10(-2) mol/l, 10(-3) mol/l AlCl3, respectively), compared with controls (Ca++ = 110.0 +/- 9.3 micrograms/mg). All animals were free of Al3(+)-mediated adverse effects on bone, as determined by light microscopic evaluation of femoral epiphyseal growth plates. Transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) of GPBP incubated in 10(-1) mol l AlCl3 for 24 hours demonstrated discrete Al3+ localization in the sarcolemma and cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes of devitalized pericardial connective tissue cells at intracellular sites coincident with phosphorus loci. Similar intracellular localization remained prominent in explants removed after 60 days; no calcific deposits were noted in these specimens. Preincubations in Fe3+ but not Ga3+ and La3+ solutions yielded significant inhibition of GPBP calcification, which did not differ significantly from that provided by Al3- and had a comparable concentration dependency. Light microscopic examination (Prussian blue staining) and EELS of FeCl3-preincubated explants demonstrated Fe3+ localization within devitalized GPBP connective tissue cells. The authors conclude that Al3+ and Fe3+ significantly inhibit the pathologic mineralization of glutaraldehyde-pretreated bovine pericardium by mechanisms that are likely related to the high affinity of these cations for membrane associated and other intracellular phosphorus loci. 
What value is given to quality of life assessment by health professionals considering response to palliative chemotherapy for advanced cancer? A study was designed to obtain information on the importance of quality of life assessment (QL) during palliative chemotherapy. A questionnaire was answered by 542 health professionals (392 general practitioners, 20 specialist oncologists, and 130 oncology nurses). In both simulated patient situations and multiple-choice questions, all groups rated QL higher than other standard methods of assessment. General practitioners and oncologists appeared to weight the assessment criteria more equally than nurses who gave strong emphasis to QL. In the simulated patient situation, there was a small degree of interaction between QL and other assessment criteria. However, the analysis showed that QL was regarded as an independent variable and was considered to be the most important objective of palliative chemotherapy for advanced cancer. 
Cystic cerebellar schwannoma: case report. We report a case of cerebellar schwannoma in a 64-year-old woman. The tumor was defined on computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans and confirmed on surgery. The solid part of the tumor appeared to be derived from the inferior vermis of the cerebellum, the cystic part extending toward the medulla oblongata and the foramen magnum. The problem of preoperative diagnosis based on magnetic resonance imaging findings is discussed. 
Acute effects of delayed reperfusion on myocardial infarct shape and left ventricular volume: a potential mechanism of additional benefits from thrombolytic therapy. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of late reperfusion on myocardial infarct shape and to quantitate associated changes in left ventricular volume. Reperfusion was delayed until there was no salvage of ischemic myocardium. Dogs underwent 6.5 h of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (n = 5) or 5.5 h of occlusion and 1 h of reperfusion (n = 5). Infarct shape was measured with pairs of ultrasonic crystals implanted circumferentially in the mid myocardium. Infarct stiffness was determined from end-diastolic pressure-segment length curves produced by aortic clamping. Left ventricular volume was measured with three pairs of endocardial ultrasonic crystals and the effect of infarct shape change on left ventricular volume was determined. Infarct size, expressed as a percent of the area at risk, was similar in reperfused (97 +/- 1%) and nonreperfused (98 +/- 1%) hearts. After coronary artery occlusion, infarct segments became akinetic and functional dilation, measured as end-diastolic ultrasonic crystal separation, increased to a similar extent in reperfused (24 +/- 7%) and nonreperfused (19 +/- 3%) hearts. In 13 additional dogs that underwent reperfusion and instrumentation with endocardial ultrasonic crystals for volume measurement, left ventricular volume increased 42 +/- 6% over the preocclusion level (p less than 0.001). Within minutes of reperfusion, the infarct stiffened, infarct dilation decreased to 1 +/- 4% over the baseline preocclusion level (p less than 0.05 vs. prereperfusion) and left ventricular volume decreased to 16 +/- 11% over the baseline level (p less than 0.01 vs. postocclusion). Thus, coronary artery reperfusion reverses initial infarct dilation. Changes in infarct dilation occur immediately after reperfusion and are accompanied by infarct stiffening and a decrease in left ventricular volume. Reperfusion can affect infarct shape and stiffness at a point in time when myocardial salvage is no longer possible. 
Pain in neonatal circumcision. Because newborn circumcision is a quick and safe surgical procedure, any method to relieve pain must be almost risk-free in order to be acceptable. General anesthesia and narcotic analgesia are not appropriate. Dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) with lidocaine hydrochloride is probably the most effective and safest form of anesthesia for newborn circumcision currently available, but it can cause significant local and systemic reactions. Only a limited number of cases of DPNB have been reported and we feel that this procedure should be used cautiously until there is more published evidence of its safety. Alternative methods of pain relief including oral acetaminophen and topical anesthesia should also be studied. Of special interest is recent evidence that a sucrose-flavored pacifier is an effective analgesic during newborn circumcision. 
Stereotaxic implantation of autologous adrenal medulla into caudate nucleus in four patients with parkinsonism. One-year follow-up. Four patients with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism (aged 26, 35, 45, and 49 years) received autologous adrenal medullary implants into or near the left caudate nucleus by stereotaxic implantation after flank adrenalectomy. All patients had an immediate response to implantation lasting several days, during which parkinsonian signs and symptoms decreased. This period was followed by a gradual reappearance of symptoms in all but one patient. This patient had had a dramatic increase in "on" time without dyskinesias and a decrease in the severity and duration of "off" time. He died of multifocal glioblastoma 1 year after transplantation. Autopsy revealed no surviving adrenal cells. In one case, the stereotaxic implantation missed the basal ganglia, resulting in the placement of the adrenal medullary tissue into the medial thalamus and near the third ventricle; the patient did not improve. In the other two cases, a modest but definite increase in "on" time without dyskinesia and a reduction in the severity and duration of "off" time has been observed. The role of autologous adrenal medullary transplantation in patients with parkinsonism remains to be determined. Patients with a family history of cerebral malignancy may be at increased risk for the development of transplant-induced malignancy. 
Effect of aluminized covers on body temperature in patients having abdominal surgery. An unintended fall in body temperature is commonly associated with surgery. One promising strategy to help conserve body heat is use of covers made of aluminum-coated plastic. We compared the effect of three combinations of the covers (head cover, body covers, both) and a control condition on tympanic temperature in 60 adults having major abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. The covers were applied from the time of transport to the operating room until exit from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Tympanic temperature was measured with an infrared thermometer. Between transport and PACU entry, the four groups had mean temperature decreases ranging from 1.6 degrees to 2.3 degrees F (0.9 degree to 1.3 degrees C). After controlling for background variables affecting body temperature, adjusted PACU entry temperature was higher in the two groups with aluminized body covers. Regression analysis showed that use of the body covers accounted for 7% of the temperature variance at PACU entry and predicted a 0.9 degree F (0.5 degree C) higher temperature at that time. These findings indicate that aluminized body covers help to reduce heat loss in patients having major abdominal surgery. 
Recurring catamenial pneumothorax treated with a Gn-RH analogue. We report a case of recurring catamenial pneumothorax with concurrent pelvic endometriosis. Thoracoscopy revealed a blue-like lesion on top of the dome of the right hemidiaphragm. Microscopic examination of biopsy specimens showed endometriosis. The patient was treated with a Gn-RH analogue and remains well without further evidence of pneumothorax after six months. 
Endogenous IFN-gamma is required for resistance to acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice. In order to study the role of endogenous IFN-gamma in Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice, a potent murine IFN-gamma-specific mAb was injected i.p. on days -1, 7, and 14, relative to infection. Irrespective of the parasite inocula (100 or 25,000), groups of antibody-treated mice had significantly greater cumulative mortality rates than did appropriate controls. In antibody-treated mice, mean survival times were also significantly shorter, and maximum mean parasitemia levels were significantly higher, than in controls. Moreover, the number of amastigote nests in tissues was higher than in control mice and attained a maximum at the same time as parasitemia. As evident from kinetic studies of neutralizing activity, injected mAb were rapidly consumed in infected, but not in noninfected, mice, which is suggestive of massive IFN-gamma production during the early parasitemic phase of the disease. Nevertheless, IFN-gamma remained undetectable in the sera of infected but untreated mice. Unexpectedly, however, a peak of IFN-like antiviral activity, characterizable as a mixture of IFN-gamma and IFN-beta, appeared in mAb-treated mice that survived to infection at a time when neutralizing activity of injected mAb had drastically decreased in the circulation. We hypothesize that this high level of artificially induced endogenous IFN-gamma, not neutralized by the amounts of injected mAb, was due to the more intense parasite multiplication occurring in mAb-treated mice, which in turn may have induced an increased amount of various cytokines. TNF-alpha was not found in the serum of our mice. The humoral immune response entered its exponential phase at a time point later than that when protection by endogenous IFN-gamma was evident. Treatment with IFN-gamma-specific antibody, as applied in our study, failed to affect the level of different Ig isotypes or of T. cruzi-specific antibodies. Our study clearly indicates that IFN-gamma is produced early in acute T. cruzi infection and exerts a protective effect that is probably independent from the humoral immune response. 
Long-term observation after intravesical metaphylaxis with mitomycin C in patients with superficial bladder tumors. After transurethral resection of a superficial bladder tumor 63 patients were treated by chemoprophylaxis with mitomycin C over a period of two years: 33.3 percent experienced recurrent disease under metaphylaxis and 42 patients who remained recurrence-free during instillation therapy were observed further for an average of 26.4 months. During this period 26.2 percent of the patients showed recurrences ranging between two to forty-four months after completing instillation. The majority of the patients in whom recurrent tumors developed also had recurrent tumor processes before the instillation therapy was begun. Of the 42 patients 73.8 percent stayed recurrence-free during the observation period of twelve to fifty-four months after completing instillation therapy. In conclusion, during an average observation period of 50.4 months, 52.4 percent of the patients in this study showed recurrences. 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease as a cause of chest pain. Patients with recurrent chest pain free of significant coronary artery disease account for 10% to 30% of patients undergoing coronary angiography. Recent studies suggest that gastroesophageal reflux disease may be very common in these patients. The cause of this chest pain seems to be related primarily to an acid-sensitive mucosa regardless of the presence of esophagitis. Unfortunately, a careful history will not distinguish chest pain arising from a cardiac versus an esophageal source. Therefore, all patients must undergo a thorough cardiac evaluation before assuming that acid reflux is the cause of their complaints. Initial gastroenterology evaluation will usually include upper GI endoscopy or barium studies, possibly with acid perfusion (Bernstein) testing, or both. However, the more sensitive and specific test for acid-related disease is prolonged esophageal pH monitoring. This study quantifies the amount of acid reflux but, more importantly, identifies the relationship between chest pain and acid reflux episodes. Patients should be studied in the outpatient setting with emphasis placed on performing activities that replicate their chest pain. Although we presume that acid-induced chest pain responds as well as heartburn to vigorous antireflux regimens, there are few studies to address this issue. Nevertheless, I have had great success in treating these patients with either high-dose H2 blockers or omeprazole therapy. 
Cancer mortality, aging, and patterns of comorbidity in the United States: 1968 to 1986. Cancer is often reported as contributing to the risk of noncancer causes of death. The age variation of these reports was studied using U.S. data on all causes of death listed on death certificates for 1968 to 1986. The occurrence of cancer as a nonunderlying cause of death increased with age and was higher for treatable and slowly growing tumor types. These patterns persisted even if the cancer manifested changes in occurrence. Nonunderlying occurrences were highest in the 85 to 94 age group and were correlated with cancer survival. This suggests increased importance of cancer as a cause of death and a comorbid condition among oldest-old persons. The high rate of occurrence as an associated cause of death suggests that if life expectancy increases due to declines in circulatory and other chronic disease mortality, cancer could become the preeminent cause of death in the United States. 
Anterior transpetrosal-transtentorial approach for sphenopetroclival meningiomas: surgical method and results in 10 patients. This report presents a new surgical method and the results in 10 patients with petroclival meningiomas extending into the parasellar region (sphenopetroclival meningiomas). Minimal but effective extradural resection of the anterior petrous bone via a middle fossa craniotomy offered a direct view of the clival area with preservation of the temporal bridging veins and cochlear organs. The dural incision was extended anteriorly to Meckel's cave, and in cases with invasion of the cavernous sinus, Parkinson's triangle was enlarged by mobilization of the trigeminal nerve. This approach offered an excellent view from the mid-clivus to the cavernous sinus. Extra-as well as intradural tumor masses and dural attachments could be cleared under direct view of the pontine surface. The risk of injury to the lower cranial nerve and of retraction damage to the temporal lobe and brain stem were kept minimal by this approach. Total tumor resection was achieved in 7 patients, with no resultant mortality. Eight patients had a satisfactory postsurgical course, extraocular paresis being their main complaint. The extent of tumor resection depended on the degree of tumor adhesion to the carotid artery, and operative morbidity on the degree of tumor invasion of the brain stem. Of the 3 patients in whom subtotal tumor removal was achieved, only one experienced regrowth of the tumor and underwent a second operation during the follow-up period (6 months-6 years). 
Reexamination of the blood lymphocyte transformation test in the diagnosis of chronic beryllium disease. The T cell response to beryllium, measured in bronchoalveolar lavage by the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT), is a critical diagnostic test for discriminating between chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and other granulomatous diseases. We examined the sensitivity, reproducibility, and methods of a less invasive, peripheral blood LTT in 17 patients with CBD and in 18 beryllium-exposed control subjects. Ninety-four percent of CBD cases (16/17) had abnormal blood LTT results, and all 18 beryllium-exposed control subjects had normal blood LTT results. Split samples for 10 beryllium disease cases and eight control subjects demonstrated that the blood LTT was reproducible between two separate laboratories. The LTT was equally sensitive with 10% and 20% serum in the culture medium. We conclude that an abnormal blood LTT can be used to diagnose CBD in patients with compatible lung pathology. 
Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty: evaluation of postoperative complications, sequelae, and results. A study of 71 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was performed to evaluate the effectiveness, complications, and late sequelae of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Postoperative immediate complications were of minor importance. In 96% of the patients, the snoring was improved; it was completely resolved in 48%. The postoperative apnea index remained pathologic in all patients who underwent postoperative polysomnography, although mild improvement was noted. Seventy-four percent of our patients felt a subjective postoperative improvement which was not always confirmed by the polysomnographic examination. A record of improvement was obtained in 64% of the operated patients. Our results establish the beneficial effect of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, which is the recommended surgical procedure for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. 
Altered interleukin-2 secretion in patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) production was studied in T lymphocytes and isolated CD4+ T lymphocytes from 12 patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome and 10 healthy volunteers. The dose and time kinetics of IL-2 production by concanavalin A-stimulated T cells and CD4+ T cells of fibromyalgia patients differed from findings in controls by 1) a need for a higher concentration of mitogen in order to achieve optimal IL-2 secretion, and 2) a delay in the peak time of optimal IL-2 secretion. Unlike normal IL-2 secretion, which was higher after removal of CD8+ T cells, the pattern and degree of IL-2 secretion by cells from fibromyalgia patients were not changed following removal of CD8+ T cells. Addition of calcium ionophore in assays using suboptimal concanavalin A concentrations did not correct the reduction in IL-2 secretion by fibromyalgia patient T cells, but addition of phorbol myristate acetate induced normal secretion of IL-2. These findings suggest that there is a defect in the IL-2 pathway, which is related to protein kinase C activation and does not involve impairment of Ca2+ elevation, in patients with fibromyalgia. 
Cerebral vasoconstriction during head-upright tilt-induced vasovagal syncope. A paradoxic and unexpected response. BACKGROUND. To determine the effect of vasovagally mediated syncope on the cerebral circulation, transcranial Doppler sonography was used to assess changes in cerebral blood flow velocity during head-upright tilt-induced syncope. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thirty patients (17 men and 13 women; mean age, 43 +/- 22 years) with recurrent unexplained syncope were evaluated by use of an upright tilt-table test for 30 minutes, with or without an infusion of intravenous isoproterenol (1-4 micrograms/min), in an attempt to provoke bradycardia, hypotension, or both. Transcranial Doppler sonography was used to assess middle cerebral artery systolic velocity (Vs), diastolic velocity (Vd), ratio of systolic to diastolic velocities, pulsatility index (PI = Vs-Vd/Vmean), and resistance index (RI = Vs-Vd/Vs) before, during, and after tilt. Syncope occurred in six patients (20%) during the baseline tilt and 14 (46%) during isoproterenol infusion (total positives, 66%). In the tilt-positive patients, concomitant with the development of hypotension and bradycardia, transcranial Doppler sonography showed a 75 +/- 17% decrease in diastolic velocity, unchanged systolic velocity, a 46 +/- 17% decrease in mean velocity, a 295 +/- 227% increase in pulsatility index, and a 73 +/- 34% increase in resistance index. CONCLUSIONS. These findings reflect increased cerebrovascular resistance secondary to arteriolar vasoconstriction distal to the insonation point of the middle cerebral artery. This is paradoxic because the expected response of the cerebral circulation to hypotension is vasodilation. We conclude that abnormal baroreceptor responses triggered during vasovagal syncope result in a derangement of cerebral autoregulation with paradoxic vasoconstriction in the face of increasing hypotension. 
Hypertension, lipoprotein(a), and apolipoprotein A-I as risk factors for stroke in the Chinese. We analyzed the serum concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins and the prevalence of other risk factors in a case-control study of 304 consecutive Chinese patients with acute stroke (classified as cerebral infarction, lacunar infarction, or intracerebral hemorrhage) and 304 age- and sex-matched controls. For all strokes we identified the following risk factors: a history of ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension; the presence of atrial fibrillation or left ventricular hypertrophy; a glycosylated hemoglobin A1 concentration of greater than 9.1%; a fasting plasma glucose concentration 3 months after stroke of greater than 6.0 mmol/l; a serum triglyceride concentration 3 months after stroke of greater than 2.1 mmol/l; and a serum lipoprotein(a) concentration of greater than 29.2 mg/dl. We found the following protective factors: a serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration of greater than 1.59 mmol/l and a serum apolipoprotein A-I concentration of greater than or equal to 106 mg/dl. The patterns of risk factors differed among the three stroke subtypes. When significant risk factors were entered into a multiple logistic regression model, we found a history of hypertension, a high serum lipoprotein(a) concentration, and a low apolipoprotein A-I concentration to be independent risk factors for all strokes. The attributable risk for hypertension was estimated to be 24% in patients aged greater than or equal to 60 years. In this population, in which cerebrovascular diseases are the third commonest cause of mortality, identification of risk factors will allow further studies in risk factor modification for the prevention of stroke. 
Abnormalities of gastrointestinal motility in children with nonulcer dyspepsia and in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease. In 11 children (mean age 44.2 months) with symptoms suggesting upper intestinal dysfunction (nonulcer dyspepsia), in nine children (mean age 27.3 months) with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease, and in seven controls (mean age 20.4 months) we investigated fasting [for 3 hr or until two migrating motor complexes (MMC) were observed] and fed (90 min) antroduodenal motility by means of perfused catheter system; furthermore, we measured both gastric emptying of a radiolabeled milk formula and fasting duodenogastric reflux during manometry by assessing bile salt concentration in gastric aspirates. No structural abnormalities of gastrointestinal tract and organic disorders were detected in the patients. In a high proportion of both groups of patients we found manometric abnormalities of interdigestive and fed motor patterns that were not seen in the controls: absence of antral phase III of MMC; significant decrease of antral and/or duodenal motor activity during fasting and/or fed periods; abnormal propagation or configuration of MMC phase III that was significantly shorter than in controls; bursts of sustained fasting and/or fed phasic duodenal activity, frequently uncoordinated with adjacent gut segments. When compared to controls, the mean intragastric concentration of bile salts during all MMC phases and the mean 1-hr percent gastric activity of the radiolabeled milk were significantly higher in the two groups of patients. We conclude that in a high proportion of children with nonulcer dyspepsia and of children with GER disease, gastrointestinal manometry may reveal significant irregularities of antral and duodenal motility, which are associated with increased duodenogastric reflux and delayed gastric emptying. 
One-stage hypospadias repair: experience of 367 cases. Over a 6 1/2-year period we performed 374 primary hypospadias repairs, all but 7 as single-stage procedures. We usually employed the MAGPI, tubed preputial island flap and Mathieu reconstructions. Complications were comparatively few, with an overall incidence of 5% fistulae, 3% anastomotic strictures and 7% meatal retraction or stenosis. The cosmetic results were superior to those of staged procedures in that it was almost always possible to obtain a glanular meatus which was both terminal and realistic. 
Early repair of iatrogenic injury to the ureter or bladder after gynecological surgery. Contrary to the traditional doctrine of delayed intervention in post-hysterectomy injuries of the ureter or bladder, the policy at our department has been to operate as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made. Of 68 patients (25 with vesicovaginal fistulas and 43 with ureteral injuries) early intervention was possible in 40 (59%). Primary healing was obtained in all patients. These results suggest that there is no disadvantage in early repair. 
Perivalvular pseudoaneurysm complicating bacterial endocarditis: MR detection in five cases. Bacterial endocarditis usually affects the valve leaflets, but erosion into the valve anulus and adjacent myocardium may form a myocardial abscess. Perivalvular abscesses can drain into the ventricles or aorta, forming a life-threatening pseudoaneurysm. We reviewed our experience with cardiac MR imaging of this disorder. Fourteen patients with complicated bacterial endocarditis underwent ECG-gated spin-echo cardiac MR imaging in addition to conventional duplex two-dimensional echocardiography (2-D echo). Angiography was performed in seven patients, six of whom underwent surgery for valve replacement. MR imaging detected the pseudoaneurysms in all five of the surgically proved cases, while 2-D echo detected only three. Clinical follow-up suggested there were no false-negative examinations, but no autopsy data were available for confirmation. Postoperative MR imaging studies were conducted in three patients, revealing two recurrent pseudoaneurysms and one thrombosed aneurysm. Cardiac MR imaging provides useful pre- and postoperative information in patients with perivalvular pseudoaneurysms due to endocarditis. 
Immunohistochemical detection of transforming growth factor-beta 1 in fibrotic liver diseases. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 was localized by means of immunohistochemical reaction in liver biopsy specimens taken from patients having different chronic liver diseases with extending fibrosis. Two polyclonal antibodies that were produced in rabbits were directed against the amino terminal of transforming growth factor-beta 1. Staining by anti-CC(1-30) was primarily extracellular and located in the portal and periportal fibrotic areas of all seven cases with chronic active hepatitis. No staining was noted in the four chronic persistent cases studied. A strong reaction was seen with the antibody in nine of the ten cirrhotic samples, whereas it was negative in one inactive cirrhosis case and in all five cases with normal liver histological findings. No positive staining could be detected by the anti-LC(1-30) in any of the liver tissues. Detection of transforming growth factor-beta 1 in active liver diseases at the site of fibrosis suggests that transforming growth factor-beta 1 might have a role in the process and progression of fibrosis during the development of the disease. 
Elevated serum gastrin levels in patients with gastric cancer. Elevated plasma gastrin levels have been found in patients with colorectal cancer. We measured fasting serum gastrin levels in control subjects (n = 12), patients with gastric cancer (n = 43), and patients with carcinoma of the esophagus (n = 55). Serum gastrin levels were significantly higher in patients with gastric cancer compared to normal controls (P less than 0.005) and those with esophageal cancer (P less than 0.05). This information may add to our understanding of the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. 
The nutcracker syndrome: new aspects of pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to study vascular anatomy in 3 patients with the nutcracker syndrome and in 10 healthy volunteers. From these studies an abnormal branching of the superior mesenteric artery from the aorta was identified as being the cause of the nutcracker syndrome. Consequently, surgical transposition of the left renal vein to achieve an unobstructed renal venous backflow was performed successfully in 2 patients, while 1 underwent nephrectomy. In 1 patient adjuvant ureteral instrumentation became necessary to aid occlusion of persisting shunts between peripelvic venous varicosities and the urinary tract. Awareness of the pathophysiology of the nutcracker syndrome ensures an early diagnosis, which should be confirmed by a combination of diagnostic procedures, including MRI. 
Localized necrotizing arteritis. A report of two cases involving the gallbladder and pancreas. We report two cases of localized necrotizing arteritis, one involving the gallbladder and one involving the pancreas. Both cases were found incidentally in surgically resected specimens. Vascular changes in both cases were similar to those seen in classic polyarteritis nodosa, involving medium-sized muscular arteries characterized by fibrinoid necrosis and panarterial and periarterial inflammations varying from active to resolving stages. Both patients had no constitutional symptoms or underlying serologic abnormalities suggestive of systemic angitis. To our knowledge, pancreas-limited arteritis has not previously been described. Whether these lesions represent an early manifestation of a systemic arteritides syndrome, a variant of polyarteritis nodosa, or a distinct entity should be prudently judged through a long-term follow-up. 
Effect of oral propranolol administration on azygos, renal and hepatic uptake and output of catecholamines in cirrhosis. Circulating catecholamines are increased in cirrhosis with portal hypertension, and increase further after propranolol. In 23 cirrhotic patients, plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine were determined in an artery, the azygos vein, the right renal vein and a hepatic vein before and after an oral 80-mg dose of propranolol. Baseline azygos and renal venous norepinephrine levels were significantly higher than arterial norepinephrine levels (+20%, p less than 0.005; and +28%, p less than 0.001, respectively). Hepatic venous norepinephrine and all venous epinephrine values were below the arterial values (all p less than 0.05). After propranolol intake, arterial norepinephrine and epinephrine increased (+16%, p less than 0.01; and +93%, p less than 0.001, respectively). Significant increases in norepinephrine and epinephrine were found in azygos and renal veins (all p less than 0.01), whereas hepatic venous norepinephrine and epinephrine remained unchanged. Azygos and hepatic blood flow decreased after propranolol intake (-27%, p less than 0.05; and -16%, p less than 0.01, respectively). Azygos spillover of norepinephrine (an estimate of locally released norepinephrine delivered to the circulation) and clearance of epinephrine remained unaltered. Hepatointestinal clearance showed no significant change for norepinephrine, but showed a borderline-significant decrease for epinephrine (-23%, p = 0.08). Our results show a net production of norepinephrine in the prehepatic splanchnic area drained through superior portalsystemic collaterals and in the kidneys. The increase in circulating catecholamines after propranolol intake is probably due to a combination of further enhancement of sympathetic activity and a decrease in catecholamine degradation. 
The spectrum of vertical gaze palsy following unilateral brainstem stroke. A single unilateral lesion, near the midline, may interrupt the pathways involved in vertical gaze just before and after they decussate, inducing an anatomically unilateral, but functionally bilateral, lesion. We report 11 patients with supranuclear vertical gaze palsies (two with conjugate upgaze palsy, four with combined up- and downgaze palsies, two with monocular elevation palsy, and three with vertical "one-and-a-half" syndrome) due to unilateral midbrain strokes. 
Use of polymerase chain reactions to monitor minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. T-cell receptor (TCR) delta gene rearrangements are observed in more than 80% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Moreover, a preferential usage of specific genetic elements has been shown in different ALL subtypes: V delta 1 DJ delta 1 rearrangements predominate in T-ALL, while most B-precursor ALLs show a recombination of V delta 2 to D delta 3. Recently we have proposed a strategy for the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) based on the isolation of clonospecific probes following the in vitro amplification of V delta 1 DJ delta 1 junctions by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and now have adapted this method to the preparation of specific V delta 2 D delta 3 fragments. In the present study, clonospecific probes were generated from 11 T-ALL and 16 cALL patients (21 children, 6 adults). The sensitivity of these 27 probes in detecting residual leukemia cells varied between 10(-4) to 10(-6) as determined by semiquantitative evaluation of dilution experiments. PCR analysis of 55 bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples obtained from the 27 patients during complete clinical remission showed the following results: (1) Evidence for MRD was obtained in the BM of all patients (eight of eight) investigated 2 to 6 months after remission induction and also in 6 of 11 cases on maintenance therapy 7 to 19 months after diagnosis. (2) In contrast, all patients but one (10 of 11) analyzed 6 to 41 months after the termination of treatment lacked apparent evidence for leukemia DNA; the exception was a girl exhibiting 10(-4) to 10(-5) residual cells in her PB 5.5 years after diagnosis. (3) Longitudinal analysis in nine patients disclosed marked individual differences in the intervals between achievement of clinical remission and complete eradication of the leukemia cell clone. (4) Differences in the duration of MRD were not associated with distinct clinical-hematologic features. (5) Detection of residual disease by PCR proceeded clinical relapse in two cases. 
Update on esophageal radiology. This article reviews the current status of double-contrast radiography in diagnosing pharyngeal tumors and opportunistic esophagitis and the radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility disorders in patients with chest pain. Double-contrast pharyngography is a valuable technique for detecting pharyngeal tumors. These lesions may be manifested by an intraluminal mass, mucosal irregularity, or asymmetric distensibility. Furthermore, barium studies may demonstrate lesions involving the valleculae, tongue base, lower hypopharynx, and pharyngoesophageal segment that are difficult to visualize at endoscopy. Double-contrast radiography is also a valuable technique for detecting opportunistic esophagitis and for differentiating the underlying causes. Mucosal plaques should suggest Candida esophagitis, whereas discrete ulcers should suggest herpes esophagitis, and one or more large, relatively flat ulcers should suggest cytomegalovirus esophagitis. Finally, in evaluating patients with chest pain, in only a small percentage are esophageal motility disorders found to be a possible cause of their pain. Instead, the majority are found to have cardiac disease, structural esophageal lesions, or gastroesophageal reflux, so that barium studies are more useful in documenting normal motility or structural abnormalities in these patients. 
Effects of diltiazem on long-term outcome after acute myocardial infarction in patients with and without a history of systemic hypertension. The Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial Research Group. The effect of diltiazem on long-term outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction with and without a history of systemic hypertension was investigated in 2,466 patients using the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial data-base. The baseline variables were comparable in the diltiazem and placebo-treated patients within the groups with and without hypertension. The initial 60-mg dose of diltiazem was associated with a significant (p less than 0.001) but modest (3%) reduction in blood pressure and heart rate in both groups with and without hypertension. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed a meaningful overall reduction in first recurrent cardiac events (cardiac death or nonfatal reinfarction, whichever occurred first) and cardiac death in patients with hypertension treated with diltiazem compared with results in those treated with placebo. Similar effects were not observed in patients without a history of hypertension. When first recurrent cardiac events were used as the end point, the diltiazem:placebo hazard ratio (95% confidence limits) was 0.77 (0.58, 1.01) for the total hypertension group, and 0.67 (0.47, 0.96) and 1.32 (0.83, 2.10) for patients with hypertension with and without pulmonary congestion during the acute infarction, respectively. Similar results were observed using cardiac death as the end point. Beta blockers had a negligible effect on the hypertension-diltiazem relation. These findings suggest that diltiazem may exert a long-term beneficial effect in most patients with hypertension who do not have pulmonary congestion during an acute infarction, and a detrimental effect in the minority who have pulmonary congestion. 
Chronic neurologic manifestations of Lyme disease BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Lyme disease, caused by the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is associated with a wide variety of neurologic manifestations. To define further the chronic neurologic abnormalities of Lyme disease, we studied 27 patients (age range, 25 to 72 years) with previous signs of Lyme disease, current evidence of immunity to B. burgdorferi, and chronic neurologic symptoms with no other identifiable cause. Eight of the patients had been followed prospectively for 8 to 12 years after the onset of infection. RESULTS. Of the 27 patients, 24 (89 percent) had a mild encephalopathy that began 1 month to 14 years after the onset of the disease and was characterized by memory loss, mood changes, or sleep disturbance. Of the 24 patients, 14 had memory impairment on neuropsychological tests, and 18 had increased cerebrospinal fluid protein levels, evidence of intrathecal production of antibody to B. burgdorferi, or both. Nineteen of the 27 patients (70 percent) had polyneuropathy with radicular pain or distal paresthesias; all but two of these patients also had encephalopathy. In 16 patients electrophysiologic testing showed an axonal polyneuropathy. One patient had leukoencephalitis with asymmetric spastic diplegia, periventricular white-matter lesions, and intrathecal production of antibody to B. burgdorferi. Among the 27 patients, associated symptoms included fatigue (74 percent), headache (48 percent), arthritis (37 percent), and hearing loss (15 percent). At the time of examination, chronic neurologic abnormalities had been present from 3 months to 14 years, usually with little progression. Six months after a two-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g daily), 17 patients (63 percent) had improvement, 6 (22 percent) had improvement but then relapsed, and 4 (15 percent) had no change in their condition. CONCLUSIONS. Months to years after the initial infection with B. burgdorferi, patients with Lyme disease may have chronic encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, or less commonly, leukoencephalitis. These chronic neurologic abnormalities usually improve with antibiotic therapy. 
Automatic and effortful memory processes in elderly persons with organic brain pathology. This study investigated the automatic and effortful memory encoding model of Hasher and Zacks (1979) and the potential it may hold for aiding in the differentiation between aging-related memory decline and dementia. College students, normal elders, and dementia patients were compared on a 96-item picturebook task utilizing measures of free recall, recognition accuracy, memory for location, and memory for frequency. There were no differences between students and elders on any of the dependent measures. However, differences were found between elders and patients on each measure, and a discriminant function correctly classified the two groups with 93.3% accuracy. Subsequent discriminant analysis found patients could be correctly classified into diagnostic subgroups, i.e., dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), multi-infarct dementia (MID), and Korsakoff's disease (KD) with 80.8% accuracy. The model holds promise as a guide for clinicians who are asked to make differential diagnoses of memory-impaired individuals. 
Postpartum hypercalcemia in a patient with medullary sponge kidneys. Previous associations of primary hyperparathyroidism-induced hypercalcemia and medullary sponge kidney (MSK) have been reported. In this report, we describe a lactating woman MSK noted to be hypercalcemic throughout lactation, without evidence of hyperparathyroidism. After the baby was weaned, the serum calcium returned to normal. A bone biopsy performed while the patient was hypercalcemic was consistent with hyperparathyroidism, suggesting the presence of a parathyroid-like protein produced during lactation. 
Survival determinants in extensive-stage non-small-cell lung cancer: the Southwest Oncology Group experience. We analyzed the 2,531-patient Southwest Oncology Group extensive-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (ENSCLC) data base from 1974 to 1988 to (1) assess the interactions of host- or tumor-related prognostic factors and therapy using Cox modeling and recursive partitioning and amalgamation (RPA) to determine whether each independently predicts outcome, and (2) use RPA to define prognostic subsets with different survival potentials. Good performance status (PS), female sex, and age greater than or equal to 70 years were significant independent predictors in a Cox model applied to the entire population. In a second Cox model for patients with good PS enrolled on recent studies, hemoglobin level greater than or equal to 11.0 g/dL, normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), normal calcium, and a single metastatic site were significant favorable factors. The use of cisplatin was an additional independent predictor of improved outcome in both Cox models after adjustments for year of accrual and all prognostic variables. The favorable effect of cisplatin was observed in each of six RPA-derived subgroups from the entire population. A second RPA of 904 patients from recent trials (nearly all received cisplatin-based therapy) resulted in three distinct prognostic subsets based on PS, age, hemoglobin, and LDH; greater than or equal to 1-year survivals were 27%, 16%, and 6% (P less than .0001). The best survival occurred for patients with a good PS who had a hemoglobin level greater than or equal to 11 g/dL and who were older than 47 years. This analysis suggests that although several factors were independent variables in the Cox models, three important prognostic subgroups were easily defined through RPA. Together with other analyses, our results suggest the need to modify the stage IV category in NSCLC. 
Current medical management of cirrhotic ascites. The presence of ascites may indicate a number of hepatic and extra-hepatic disorders. This situation requires comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause. The evaluation and management of ascites in patients with known cirrhosis is very important since this manifestation of portal hypertension has a detrimental effect on the prognosis for such patients. 
Visceral and peripheral tissue perfusion after cardiac surgery. Visceral and peripheral tissue perfusion and oxygenation were studied in ten patients in the early phase after coronary artery bypass grafting. Visceral perfusion was assessed indirectly, by determining gastric intramucosal pH. As parameters of peripheral tissue perfusion and oxygenation, subcutaneous tissue PO2 (PscO2), transcutaneous PO2 (PtcO2). PtcO2 index (PtcO2/PaO2), laser-Doppler skin red-cell flux (RCF) and fingertip temperature (Tft) were recorded in the upper extremity. Central haemodynamics, rectal temperature and blood gases were also measured. The inspired oxygen concentration was maintained at 30 v/v%. Gastric intramucosal pH declined progressively during the first 3 hours in the intensive care unit, reached its minimum at 5 hours and thereafter slowly increased. The peripheral vascular bed was shut down on admission to the ICU, as indicated by low values of PscO2, PtcO2, PtCO2 index, RCF and Tft. These parameters began to rise after the next 2-4 hours and peaked by the end of the 8-hour study period, indicating complete opening of the peripheral vascular bed. 
Neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction in critical illness. Sepsis syndrome frequently results in endothelial injury in many organ systems. To evaluate neutrophil-pulmonary endothelial cell interaction in the sepsis syndrome, we studied 39 critically ill patients prospectively and 20 normal volunteers. Thirteen patients with sepsis (mean age, 71.4 years), 14 patients in an intensive care unit control group (mean age 65.4 years), and 12 patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction (mean age, 66.8 years) were evaluated. Blood samples were drawn from septic patients within 24 hours and from ICU and MI patients within 72 hours of admission. All sepsis patients were culture positive, 6 of 13 from the blood. Both renal failure and ARDS developed in 54 percent of septic patients. 51Cr-labelled neutrophils were prepared and added to bovine pulmonary endothelial cell monolayers with and without added phorbol myristate acetate. Endothelial cells with adherent PMA and nonadherent PMN's, were harvested and radioactivity in each fraction measured with a gamma scintillation counter. Baseline and maximally stimulated (PMA, 3.0 ng/ml) neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells were similar in all patients groups. However, in septic patients, PMA-stimulated PMN adherence was reduced at lower doses, most significantly in those who developed ARDS within 24 to 48 hours of admission (p less than 0.05). Seventy-one percent of patients who developed ARDS had reduced stimulated adherence (PMA 1.0 ng/ml) compared to 22 percent of critically ill patients who did not. We conclude that diminished adherence of neutrophils to endothelium in response to low-level PMA stimulation is significantly more common in patients with sepsis who develop ARDS. Our findings suggest that PMN-endothelial cell interaction is altered by the time sepsis is clinically recognized but before the development of ARDS. We speculate that the observed reduction in adherence of the PMN to endothelial cells may be a consequence of down-regulation by mediators generated in the inflammatory response to sepsis and/or the need for active participation of septic endothelium in this interaction. 
Systemic lupus erythematosus and lymphoma: association with antiphospholipid syndrome. A woman with a history of polyarthralgias appeared to develop systemic lupus erythematosus and lymphoma simultaneously. The diagnosis of the concurrent lymphoma was made on biopsy of a left axillary lymph node. Generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and pruritus had given rise to suspicion of an underlying lymphoma. The lymphoma responded well to chemotherapy. Her condition was further complicated by an arterial occlusion involving the right 2nd toe which was eventually amputated, transient ischemic attacks (amaurosis fugax), livedo reticularis and thrombocytopenia which were accompanied by elevations of IgM anticardiolipin antibodies and a biological false test for syphilis. The lupus anticoagulant test was not performed as she was given anticoagulation therapy. 
Determinants of successful transthoracic defibrillation and outcome in ventricular fibrillation. OBJECTIVE--To examine factors determining defibrillation success and outcome in patients with ventricular fibrillation. DESIGN--Observational prospective study of age, sex, transthoracic impedance, site of cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation duration and amplitude, primary or secondary ventricular fibrillation, aetiology, number of shocks to correct ventricular fibrillation, and drug treatment. SETTING--A teaching hospital and a mobile coronary care unit with a physician. PATIENTS--70 consecutive patients (50 male, 20 female) mean age 66.5 years. INTERVENTIONS--Before the first countershock was administered transthoracic impedance using a 30 kHz low amplitude AC current passed through 8 cm/12 cm self-adhesive defibrillator electrode pads applied in the anteroapical position was measured. The first two shocks were 200 J delivered energy (low energy) and further shocks of 360 J (high energy) were given if required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Countershock success and outcome from ventricular fibrillation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS--First shock success was significantly greater in inhospital arrests (37/53) than in out-of-hospital arrests (5/17) and in those receiving antiarrhythmic treatment (13/15, 86.7%) v (27/51, 52.9%). Transthoracic impedance was similar in those who were successfully defibrillated with one or two 200 J shocks (98.7 (26) omega) and those who required one or more 360 J shocks (91.4 (23) omega). Success rates with two 200 J shocks were similar in those patients with "high" transthoracic impedance (that is, greater than 115 omega) and those with transthoracic impedance (less than or equal to 115 omega) (8/12 (67%) v 44/58 (76%]. Fine ventricular fibrillation was significantly more common in the patients with a transthoracic impedance of greater than 95 omega (41% (13/32] than in those with a transthoracic impedance less than or equal to 95 omega (13% (5/38]. Death during arrest was significantly more common in patients who needed high energy shocks (14/18 (78%] than in those who needed low energy shocks (16/52 (31%]. Multiple regression analysis identified ventricular fibrillation with an amplitude of greater than or equal to 0.5 mV, age less than or equal to 70 years, and arrests that needed less than or equal to two shocks for defibrillation, in rank order as independent predictors of survival to discharge. 
Prediction of prognosis in primary breast cancer by detection of a high molecular weight mucin-like antigen using monoclonal antibodies DF3, F36/22, and CU18: a Cancer and Leukemia Group B study Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (DF3, F36/22, CU18) were used to monitor expression of distinct epitopes present within a family of mucin-like, breast carcinoma-associated molecules. Primary tumor specimens from more than 190 stage II breast cancer patients were evaluated for expression of the high molecular weight antigens. With a median follow-up of 6 years, patients whose tumors exhibited high immunoperoxidase staining scores (greater than 50% positive cells) with MAb DF3 had a superior disease-free survival ([DFS] 56% +/- 6% v 37% +/- 5% at 6 years; P = .0088) and overall survival ([OS] 72% +/- 5% v 59% +/- 5% at 6 years; P = .025). Staining scores with the other two antibodies did not correlate with improved prognosis. For MAbs DF3 and CU18, patients whose tumors exhibited predominantly apical cellular reactivity patterns had improved DFS, although differences reached conventional levels of statistical significance only with MAb CU18. In multivariate analyses, the prognostic value of MAb DF3 staining was independent of other identified prognostic factors. Furthermore, the concordance between primary and axillary lymph node metastases staining with each MAb was 73%, 80%, and 85% for MAbs DF3, F36/22, and CU18, respectively. These results suggest that staining with MAb DF3 identifies a group of node-positive women with a relatively favorable prognosis. Expression of the DF3 mucin-like glycoprotein is related to better differentiation, and staining with MAb DF3 provides an accurate and objective estimate of clinical outcome independent of histopathologic evaluation. 
Cerebral edema causing death in children with maple syrup urine disease. Four children with the classic form of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) died of cerebral edema during an intercurrent infection that caused severe dehydration and acidosis. The diagnosis of MSUD had been established during the neonatal period in all four patients, on day 1 of life in three of them. All were in satisfactory control before the intercurrent illness. Two patients underwent peritoneal dialysis. Signs of brain-stem compression occurred after treatment, when biochemical abnormalities were improving. Computed tomography of the head, which was done in two patients, revealed cerebral edema; one of these patients also had subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autopsy in one case revealed cerebral edema with herniation. Our experience documents that cerebral edema may occur in the older child with MSUD as well as in the neonate. The pathogenesis of cerebral edema in MSUD remains unclear. Early treatment of dehydration and acidosis may prevent the catastrophic consequences that we have observed. 
Amino acid substitutions in the coat protein result in loss of insect transmissibility of a plant virus. Amino acids near the N terminus of the coat protein of tobacco vein mottling virus were deleted or altered by site-directed mutagenesis to determine the effect on aphid transmissibility of the virus. Deletion of a three amino acid sequence Asp-Ala-Gly, which is conserved in aphid-transmissible potyvirus isolates, abolished transmission. The mutation Ala----Thr in this triplet drastically reduced transmission, whereas the mutation Asp----Asn had no effect, and the mutation Asp----Lys consistently reverted to the wild-type residue. The mutation Lys----Glu, in the residue adjacent to the glycine of the triplet, drastically reduced transmission, whereas the mutation Gln----Pro, seven residues downstream from the glycine had no effect. Comparison of the sequences of other potyviruses suggests that the presence of a glycine residue at the third position of the Asp-Ala-Gly triplet is critical for aphid transmissibility and that certain changes in the residues adjacent to this position abolish or greatly reduce aphid transmissibility. 
Radiologic findings of clonorchiasis. Clonorchiasis is a trematodiasis caused by chronic infestation of liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis. The adult flukes reside in the medium-sized and small intrahepatic bile ducts and, occasionally, in the extrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder, and pancreatic duct. The result is mechanical obstruction, inflammatory reaction, adenomatous hyperplasia, and periductal fibrosis. Signs and symptoms are usually mild and nonspecific, but heavy infestation results in obstructive jaundice. The disease has a close relationship with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma. In this article, the radiologic findings, including cholangiography, sonography, and CT of clonorchiasis are reviewed in light of the pathophysiology of the disease. The relationship to recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and to cholangiocarcinoma is discussed. 
Diverticula of the female urethra: diagnosis by endovaginal and transperineal sonography. Diverticula of the female urethra can be difficult to diagnose. Invasive contrast studies (voiding cystourethrography or double-balloon urethrography) or urethroscopy are frequently required for definitive diagnosis. Although transabdominal sonography has been able to visualize large diverticula, this technique has not proved useful in routine screening. In this study, we examined the use of higher frequency (5 MHz) near-focus endovaginal or transperineal sonography for the diagnosis of urethral diverticula. Five patients with radiographically proved (three with double-balloon urethrography and two with voiding cystourethrography) urethral diverticula were examined with endovaginal (two cases) or transperineal (four cases) sonography. In all five cases, sonography showed the diverticula previously demonstrated on the contrast study. The spatial relationship of the diverticula to the urethra, an important consideration at surgery, was shown more clearly by sonography than by contrast radiography. These findings suggest that sonography may be useful as a noninvasive screening technique for urethral diverticula. 
Hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory responses in parents and siblings of children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. Children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) have abnormal ventilatory responses to metabolic stimuli. As there is a genetically determined component of chemoreceptor sensitivity, parents and siblings of children with CCHS may also have blunted ventilatory responses to hypercapnea and hypoxia. To test this, we studied hypercapnic ventilatory responses and hypoxic ventilatory responses in six mothers, four fathers, and five siblings (6 to 49 yr of age) of seven children with CCHS and compared them with 15 age- and sex-matched control subjects (5 to 47 yr of age). Pulmonary function tests were not different between relatives of children with CCHS and control subjects. To measure hypercapnic ventilatory responses, subjects rebreathed 5% CO2/95% O2 until PACO2 reached 60 to 70 mm Hg. To measure hypoxic ventilatory responses (L/min/% SaO2), subjects rebreathed 14% O2/7% CO2/balance N2 at mixed venous PCO2 until SaO2 fell to 75%. All tests were completed in less than 4 min. Instantaneous minute ventilation, mean inspiratory flow (tidal volume/inspiratory time), and respiratory timing (inspiratory timing/total respiratory cycle timing) were calculated on a breath-by-breath basis. Hypercapnic ventilatory responses were 1.97 +/- 0.32 L/min/mm Hg PACO2 in children with CCHS relatives and 2.23 +/- 0.23 L/min/mm Hg PACO2 in control subjects. Hypoxic ventilatory responses were -1.99 +/- 0.37 L/min/% SaO2 in the relatives and -1.54 +/- 0.25 L/min/% SaO2 in the control subjects. 
Clinical pathology of endocrine tumors of the pancreas. Analysis of autopsy cases. A clinicopathological analysis of endocrine tumors of the pancreas, using 800 autopsy cases (422 men, 378 women, mean age 78.7) was accomplished. The results were: (1) Endocrine tumors and similar lesions were found in 3% or 24 cases (25 lesions). Twenty lesions (20 cases) were found to be tumors and five lesions (five cases) were determined to be hyperplasia of Langerhans islets. (2) Incidence of tumor was 10% (6/60) in individuals having histological studies of all sections of the pancreas, and 1.6% (12/738) in individuals having histological studies of three random sections of the pancreas. (3) None of the cases with tumors and hyperplastic lesions showed symptoms of hormone production. (4) Immunohistochemical analysis revealed hormone production in all 20 tumor cases and multiple hormone production was found in 14 of these (70%). (5) Ductular or tubular structures were found in or adjacent to the tumors in 12 cases (60%) and hyperplasia in one case (20%). Langerhans islets, 500 microns or larger in size, were found in three lesions of the tumor (15%). Langerhans islets with the mean diameter of normal islets + 2 SD or larger also were found around five tumors (25%) and three hyperplasias (60%). The above findings suggest that endocrine tumors of the pancreas are prevalent and that they do not produce symptoms of excessive hormone production even though they do continue to produce hormones. Some of the endocrine tumors or hyperplasias develop from totipotent stem cells of the duct epithelia, and factors promoting the growth of Langerhans islets might exist. 
ECMO in premature infants. Review of factors associated with mortality. During the first few years of clinical research on neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), 16 premature infants of less than 35 weeks gestational age were treated by the authors (RHB), and only four (25%) survived. Intracranial hemorrhage was common, prompting the authors to recommend that ECMO not be used in premature infants with respiratory failure. Since diagnostic methods, indications, and techniques of extracorporeal support have improved considerably, the records of these previous cases were reviewed in detail to determine if there was reason to believe that results might be better in the modern era. Of the 16 patients, four had pre-ECMO conditions that would now be considered contraindications and five of the remaining patients had major technical complications that are now rare. Anticoagulation and fluid management of these patients also would be handled much differently. Based on this review and on current experience with extracorporeal support in near-term infants, it is reasonable to expect that survival of moribund premature infants might be 50% or greater with extracorporeal support. New phase I trials using improved indications and technology are suggested. 
Activation of phospholipase D by E-series prostaglandins in human erythroleukemia cells. Phospholipase D (PLD) can be activated by a variety of receptor agonists in different cell types. However, an effect of prostaglandins (PGs) on the activity of this enzyme has not been demonstrated previously. In this study, we found that PGE1 could stimulate PLD in human erythroleukemia cells, as measured by phosphatidylethanol formation, with an ED50 of 3.5 x 10(-7) M. PGE2 was also active, but other PGs including prostacyclin, PGD2 and PGF2, had no effect. PGE1 also elicited cyclic AMP production over the same concentration range that activated PLD. However, it is unlikely that cyclic AMP per se is responsible for PGE-induced PLD activation, because PLD could be substantially activated by PGE2 at concentrations (0.1-1 microM) which did not stimulate cyclic AMP production. Furthermore, no increase of phosphatidylethanol formation could be observed when cells were treated with other adenylyl cyclase-activating agents such as prostacyclin, forskolin and vasoactive intestinal peptide. In Ca+(+)-free medium, PLD activation by PGE1 and PGE2 was greatly reduced, indicating that their effect was through a Ca+(+)-dependent pathway. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin abolished PGE1- and PGE2-stimulated PLD activity, implying the involvement of a G protein in the PGE-mediated signal transduction pathway. Our results not only indicate that E-series PGs may initiate some of their cellular effects through a novel pathway, activation of PLD, but also suggest that PGE-stimulated PLD activity in human erythroleukemia cells is Ca+(+)-dependent and is regulated via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. 
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced renal failure: causes, consequences, and diagnostic uses. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced renal failure is now a well-recognized phenomenon that appears to occur almost exclusively in patients with a preexisting reduction in renal perfusion pressure, especially those with renovascular disease. In the latter group of patients, renal failure probably results from some combination of reduced poststenotic renal perfusion pressure and a unique disturbance in the autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate. Although traditionally regarded as functional and reversible, recent animal studies suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced reductions of glomerular filtration rate may lead to progressive renal atrophy, an observation that raises concerns about the long-term safety of these agents in patients with renovascular disease. On the other hand, the deleterious consequences of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in renovascular disease have been exploited as aids in the diagnosis of this disorder. Whether the adjunctive use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors will prove to be useful in screening large populations of hypertensive patients for renovascular hypertension remains to be determined. However, such adjunctive tests appear to be useful in judging the functional significance of angiographically documented renal artery stenosis. 
Pacemaker-lead puncture of the tricuspid valve. Successful diagnosis and treatment. During insertion, a transvenous pacing lead pierced the tricuspid valve in a 66-year-old man, causing progressive tricuspid insufficiency and congestive heart failure. The defect remained undiagnosed for ten years and was then repaired. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which this problem has been successfully treated rather than being diagnosed at autopsy. 
Acute and sustained release of the atrial natriuretic factor prohormone N-terminus with acute myocardial infarction. This investigation was designed to determine if acute ischemic cardiac injury causes the release of the 98 amino acid (aa) N-terminus of the 126 aa atrial natriuretic factor prohormone (pro ANF). Seventeen patients with acute myocardial infarction, but without clinical evidence of congestive heart failure, had their circulating concentrations of the whole N-terminus (ie, pro ANF 1-98), the midportion of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone (consisting of aa 31-67; pro ANF 31-67) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) monitored daily for 14 days. All seventeen patients had elevated plasma pro ANF 1-98 and pro ANF 31-67 concentrations at the time of presentation. Maximal increase on day three post-infarction correlated with the size of infarction estimated by the maximal CPK (r = 0.675; p less than 0.05) but did not correlate with the amount of left ventricular dysfunction. Another three patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The measured pro ANF 1-98 and pro ANF 31-67 levels in these patients were within our normal range and significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than seen in patients with acute myocardial infarction not given thrombolytic therapy. Six patients with unstable angina, likewise, had normal circulating pro ANFs 1-98 and 31-67 concentrations during prolonged episodes of chest pain. These data suggest that myocardial necrosis but not ischemia triggers the release of the entire 126 aa prohormone. 
Peritonitis due to Prototheca wickerhamii in a patient undergoing chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. A 72-year-old man who was undergoing chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis developed peritonitis due to Prototheca wickerhamii. Results of in vitro sensitivity testing revealed that the organism was sensitive to amphotericin B (MIC, 0.4 micrograms/mL) but resistant to fluconazole (MIC, greater than 80 micrograms/mL). The patient was successfully treated medically with a combination of intravenous amphotericin B and oral doxycycline. 
Microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm. Patterns of vascular compression in unsuccessfully operated patients. To determine the causative factors of unsuccessful microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm, the follow-up results in 53 patients were assessed retrospectively. The mean follow-up period was 36 months. There were 32 patients who had compression of the seventh cranial nerve ventrocaudally by an anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) or a posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Of these 32 patients, 30 (94%) had excellent postoperative results. Of 14 patients with more severe compression by the vertebral artery, nine (64%) had excellent results, three (21%) had good results, and two (14%) had poor results; in this group, three patients with excellent results experienced transient spasm recurrence. There were seven patients in whom the meatal branch of the AICA coursed between the seventh and eighth cranial nerves and compressed the dorsal aspect of the seventh nerve; this was usually associated with another artery compressing the ventral aspect of the nerve ("sandwich-type" compression). Of these seven patients, five (71%) had poor results including operative failure in one and recurrence of spasm in four. The authors conclude that the clinical outcome was closely related to the patterns of vascular compression. 
Anti-anginal therapy and quality of life. A comparison of the effects of transdermal nitroglycerin and long-acting oral nitrates. A total of 112 male patients with severe effort-induced angina pectoris (New York Heart Association functional classes II and III) participated in a randomized open trial consisting of a 6 month phase with 3 month treatment cross-overs. The aim of the study was to compare the effect of transdermal nitroglycerin (TN) patches and long-acting oral nitrates (LAON) on quality of life (QL). During the cross-over period 30 patients (20 on TN and 10 on LAON) withdrew from the study, over half of them within the first month. Although the results should be interpreted with some caution, they showed that improvement in QL was present for both treatments but greater during the transdermal therapy (unadjusted p = 0.07, adjusted p = 0.03). Anginal attacks were associated with improved QL scores, and fewer attacks occurred on TN (p = 0.06). Improvement in QL was most pronounced in patients whose recorded duration of angina was less than 8 years. 
Method and theory of monophasic action potential recording. MAP recordings have been at the cradle of cardiac electrophysiology but only recently, through safer and simpler technology, have gained wider access to clinical electrophysiology. In contrast to conventional electrode catheter recordings, MAP recording devices provide precise information not only of the local activation time but of the entire local repolarization time course as well. Although the MAP does not reflect the absolute amplitude or upstroke velocity of transmembrane action potentials, it delivers highly accurate information on the action potential duration and configuration, including early afterdepolarizations as well as relative changes in transmembrane diastolic and systolic potential changes. Based on available data, the MAP probably reflects the transmembrane voltage of cells within a few millimeters of the exploring electrode. MAPs can be recorded by catheter technique from the endocardial surface and by special probes from the epicardium in the operating room. The contact electrode technique is preferable over suction electrodes because it is safer and simpler to use in patients and because it produces more stable, longer-lasting signals. A modified contact MAP catheter incorporates pacing electrodes and permits simultaneous assessment of action potential duration and refractoriness. This not only facilitates the use of MAP catheters in routine electrophysiological studies but also is important for assessing the voltage-independent effects of antiarrhythmic drugs on refractoriness. MAP recordings offer the opportunity to study, in the in situ heart, a variety of pertinent electrophysiological phenomena including, for example, effects of cycle length changes and antiarrhythmic drugs on action potential duration or the role of afterdepolarizations in the genesis of triggered arrhythmias. Due to vigorous heart beating, movement artifacts may occur and need to be distinguished from true abnormalities in the action potential time course. With these limitations in mind, MAP recordings are a valuable addition to clinical electrophysiological studies. 
Screening for sleep apnea using pulse oximetry and a clinical score. Confirmation of the diagnosis of OSA currently requires overnight polysomnography. This study evaluates the usefulness of pulse oximetry together with a clinical score in identifying OSA. Forty patients were assigned a clinical score based on the presence or absence of loud snoring, observations of interrupted breathing during sleep, hypersomnolence, obesity and essential hypertension. Each underwent a night of domiciliary pulse oximetry followed by nocturnal polysomnography. Significant OSA was confirmed in 26. All 15 patients with positive pulse oximetry tracings had significant OSA (apnea index greater than or equal to 10). Five of eight with negative tracings were also shown to have significant OSA along with six of the seven patients with inadequate or indeterminate tracings. Clinical scores were significantly different for those with and without OSA. This study confirms the usefulness of nocturnal pulse oximetry in establishing the diagnosis of OSA and highlights the value of a clinical score in improving its sensitivity as a screening tool. 
Hemodynamic and metabolic responses to graded microvascular occlusion. The hemodynamic and metabolic consequences of microvascular occlusion, often present in the runoff bed of distal arterial reconstructions, have been difficult to quantitate clinically. To investigate these pathophysiologic relationships, a porcine hindlimb model was developed in which arteriolar patency, which we term outflow capacity, may be quantitatively defined and reduced by serial distal microembolization with 70 microns flow-directed glass bubbles. In 10 anesthetized adult pigs, hindlimb perfusion was limited to femoral artery flow (FAF) by collateral ligation. Serial measurements of outflow resistance (OR), femoral artery flow, and resting muscle pH (mpH), a metabolic index of tissue perfusion, were made as relative outflow capacity (ROC) underwent graded reduction from 1.0 (baseline) to 0 (complete occlusion). Femoral artery flow decreased linearly (FAF = 87 ROC - 3), and outflow resistance increased in hyperbolic fashion (OR = 1.66/ROC) in response to graded peripheral microembolization, whereas resting muscle pH followed a more complex relationship (In mpH = 0.055 ROC + 1.95). An integrated analysis of these results suggests that a 50% to 60% reduction in arteriolar patency represents a critical point beyond which outflow resistance rises rapidly and hindlimb flow decreases to levels that are inadequate to support the metabolic demands of resting tissues. 
The fibromyalgia impact questionnaire: development and validation. An instrument has been developed to assess the current health status of women with the fibromyalgia syndrome. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is a brief 10-item, self-administered instrument that measures physical functioning, work status, depression, anxiety, sleep, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and well being. We describe its development and validation. This initial assessment indicates that the FIQ has sufficient evidence of reliability and validity to warrant further testing in both research and clinical situations. 
Effect of salbutamol on gastroesophageal reflux in healthy volunteers and patients with asthma. The aim of this work was to establish whether beta-adrenergic agonists promote or increase gastroesophageal reflux in patients with asthma. Ten healthy individuals and eight patients with asthma were studied on 2 different days. One day they received a placebo, and the other day they received 4 mg of salbutamol by mouth. Complete measurements of esophageal manometry were performed before and every 30 minutes for 210 minutes after the administration of the drugs. Esophageal pH was measured continuously for the duration of the experiment. The results demonstrate that (1) salbutamol had no effect on the lower esophageal sphincter pressure gradient, the peak esophageal contraction pressure, or the number and duration of reflux episodes in patients with asthma and normal individuals, and (2) patients with asthma have a resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure higher than healthy subjects. We conclude that the administration of salbutamol does not affect esophageal function. 
Neurotoxicity of intraventricularly administered alpha-interferon for leptomeningeal disease. Nine patients with leptomeningeal disease are reported who were treated with intraventricular alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN). In seven of these patients, a progressive vegetative state developed during treatment. The patients became unresponsive to verbal commands but opened their eyes with auditory or tactile stimulation. It took an average of 3 weeks for these patients to become verbally responsive after treatment was discontinued. Electroencephalographic findings showed evidence of irritative involvement of the deep midline nuclei in 80% of patients. Periventricular white matter changes developed during treatment in three of six patients who underwent computed tomographic scans. All patients with this severe neurotoxicity received whole-brain irradiation before treatment. Possible mechanisms for the development of this neurotoxic syndrome are discussed. The neurotoxicity of alpha-IFN and brain irradiation may be additive, suggesting a cautious approach when using this combination for treatment. 
The survival of total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteonecrosis of the medial condyle. The results of total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle were examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The study included 32 osteonecrotic knees with an average final follow-up examination of 3.9 years. For comparison, 63 osteoarthrotic knees with an average final follow-up examination of 4.6 years were also analyzed. The survival rates were calculated using four distinct categories of failure: (1) revision, (2) revision or radiolucency, (3) revision, radiolucency, or pain, and (4) pain. On the basis of pain relief alone, the five-year postoperative success rate was 82% for osteonecrosis (eight knees) and 90% for osteoarthrosis (27 knees), with no significant statistical difference between the two groups. 
Emergency department presentation of renal dialysis patients: indications for EMS transport directly to dialysis centers. To determine the pattern of emergency department (ED) utilization by renal dialysis (RD) patients, a prospective study was conducted of dialysis patients presenting to the ED of a regional dialysis center. The most common presenting complaints were shortness of breath (SOB), chest pain, abdominal pain, and vomiting; the most common diagnoses were congestive heart failure, chest wall pain, and electrolyte abnormalities. Interventional dialysis (ID), defined as emergent dialysis required to treat the patient's presenting complaint, was required for 30 patients, with the most common presenting complaints of these patients being shortness of breath, weakness, and chest pain. Only SOB was statistically significant in predicting the need for ID (P less than 0.001), with a positive predictive value of 0.63 and a negative predictive value of 0.85. Prehospital implications of these data suggest that RD patients with a chief complaint of SOB should be transported directly to a facility capable of dialysis on an emergent basis. 
Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging for assessment and follow-up of patients with valve disease. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging now offers a powerful means of assessing a variety of clinically important parameters in patients with valvular heart disease. NMR approaches will probably be most useful in patients with chronic valvular regurgitation, in which there continues to be uncertainty regarding the optimum timing for surgical intervention. In these patients it is possible to simultaneously assess both the valvular regurgitation and the resulting changes in myocardial structure and function. In patients with aortic stenosis, NMR can be applied to the assessment of left ventricular mass, both before and after valvuloplasty or valve replacement. In mitral stenosis, NMR may be applied to the assessment of right ventricular volumes and function. NMR may be used for the detection of prosthetic valve regurgitation when Doppler studies are equivocal. Finally, NMR imaging may be applied in patients with congenital or aortic root disease to evaluate valvular function in addition to diagnostic assessment of such patients. The future development of isotropic three-dimensional acquisition approaches, ultrafast imaging strategies, automated surface detection techniques, and more rapid function and flow analysis could considerably enhance the use of the current NMR approaches. The application of spectroscopic techniques could provide a means of monitoring myocardial metabolic abnormalities in ventricles exposed to chronic overload. Meanwhile, in patients with valvular regurgitation and stenosis, it would seem timely to initiate long-term serial NMR studies to further define natural history and the effects of various medical regimens and to ultimately help determine optimum medical and interventional regimens. 
Calcium antagonists: an overview. Calcium antagonists reduce the influx of calcium ions through the calcium channels. This causes a reduction in myocardial contractility or a fall in vascular resistance because of a lowering of vascular smooth muscle tone. Therefore, the net effect is a fall in blood pressure. The three major classes of calcium antagonists, the dihydropyridines, papaverine derivatives, and benzothiazepines, differ in molecular structure and their binding characteristics to the calcium channels. Furthermore, newer antagonists, particularly the dihydropyridines such as nicardipine, have a high affinity for vascular tissue and are highly selective for vascular smooth muscle. These compounds also have a favorable effect on hypertension mainly because of lowering of vascular resistance. In addition, they do not cause potentially negative metabolic effects on glucose or lipid levels and are generally well tolerated. Based on these findings, the Joint National Committee in the United States and the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension Committee on the Management of Mild Hypertension recommended the use of calcium antagonists as first-line treatment in hypertension. 
Prognostic value of proliferative activity in lymph node metastases of patients with breast cancer. Whether the proliferative activity of distant metastases could be predicted by the proliferation in axillary lymph node metastases was investigated in 304 lymph nodes metastases of 52 patients with breast cancer who had not received adjuvant treatment. The standard deviation of the mean mitotic index (MI)--the average number of mitoses per field in 10 high power fields--was of the best prognostic valve in univariate survival analysis. None of the classic (volume % epithelium and stroma) or morphometric features (nuclear area, nuclear axis ratio. shape factors) provided significant results. In Cox regression analysis a multivariate combination of the mean MI, the SD of the mean MI, and the maximum MI emerged, which provided a satisfying means of differentiating patients with a good (68% survival) and a poor (28% survival) prognosis. Proliferation variables derived from axillary lymph node metastases of patients with breast cancer can predict the clinical course of distant metastases. 
Nonoperative management of splenic injuries. The traditional management of splenic trauma has undergone major revision in recent years. Given the physiological importance of the spleen, certain controversy has arisen regarding the most appropriate method of managing this type of trauma. Nonoperative therapy in children has proven to be successful not only in the case of kidney lesions but also for splenic lesions. Nonoperative management carried out in the authors' hospital on a group of 56 patients (49 adults and seven children over the age of 7 years) has proved successful in 37 cases. The success of this technique requires a well-formulated protocol, diagnostic methods (ultrasound and computed tomography), rigorous patient control in the emergency room during the initial phase (first 48 hours), the availability of a medical team if surgical intervention becomes necessary (persistent or recurrent hemorrhage), and complementary measures which facilitate the cicatrization of the splenic injury (bed rest, antibiotic therapy). 
Eight-year outcome in infants with birth weight of 500 to 999 grams: continuing regional study of 1979 and 1980 births. Victorian Infant Collaborative Study Group. The outcome at a mean age of 8.3 years was determined for 88 of 89 surviving children with birth weights of 500 to 999 gm who were born in Victoria in 1979 and 1980; the condition of the untraced child, severely disabled at 5 years of age, was assumed to be unchanged at 8 years. Principal impairments in the children at 8 years of age were cerebral palsy 8 (9%); bilateral blindness 6 (6.7%) and poor vision in another 4 (4.5%); bilateral deafness requiring amplification 5 (5.6%); and epilepsy 2 (2.2%). The Full Scale score of the Weschler Intelligence Scales for Children--Revised was available for 77 children: 5 scores (6.5%) were less than 71 (low IQ), and 9 (11.7%) were between 71 and 85 (borderline IQ). Severe disability in 16 children (18%) was due to severe cerebral palsy, bilateral blindness, or low IQ. Mild or moderate disability was present in another 18 children (20.2%) with borderline IQ, mild or moderate cerebral palsy, poor vision, deafness, or epilepsy. Significantly more outborn children (10/18, 55.6%) than inborn children (24/71, 33.8%) were disabled. Ten children required special schooling; reading accuracy or comprehension was at least 18 months behind chronologic age in 17 (23%) of 75 children in normal school who were tested. The 2-year assessment correctly estimated the category of disability at 8 years of age in 55 (62%), overestimated it in 24 (27%), and underestimated it in 10 (11%). For the 82 children also seen at 5 years age, the category of disability at 8 years of age was correctly identified in 69 children (84%), overestimated in 4 (5%), and underestimated in 9 (11%). Change in psychologic test scores was the principal reason for reclassifying children. We conclude that the 2-yar assessment was valuable in the early identification of most of the severely disabled children, but developmental delay at 2 years of age did not always portend intellectual impairment at 8 years of age. 
Mixed acid fermentation of glucose as a mechanism of emphysematous urinary tract infection. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a severe necrotizing infection that usually occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus or obstructive uropathy. Although glucose fermentation has been considered as the main cause of gas production the actual mechanism remains controversial. Compositions of gas samples from 2 patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis recently encountered were analyzed, and showed 15% hydrogen, 4.8% carbon dioxide, 60% nitrogen, 6.7% oxygen and some unknown gases in case 1, and 3.4% hydrogen, 22% carbon dioxide, 66% nitrogen and 9.8% oxygen in case 2. These results tend to implicate mixed acid fermentation of glucose as the pathway by which emphysematous urinary tract infections develop. 
Does hyperkinetic circulation constitute a pre-hypertensive stage? A 5-year follow-up of haemodynamics in young men with mild blood pressure elevation. In a previous haemodynamic examination, 44 young men (18-22 years) with blood pressure elevation above the 98th percentile, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) greater than or equal to 95 +/- 6 mm Hg, showed an increased cardiac index (dye-dilution) and an enhanced resistance at maximal vasodilation of the hand (venous occlusion plethysmography during hyperaemia). This latter finding suggested arteriolar wall hypertrophy. However, the subgroup with the highest cardiac index (greater than or equal to 3.86 1 min-1 x m2) (n = 18) displayed normal vascular resistance at maximal dilation in comparison with the normotensive control group (n = 29). Consequently, functional signs of arteriolar hypertrophy were restricted to individuals with normal or low cardiac index. At the re-investigation 5 years later, a significant reduction in blood pressure was observed in the normotensive control group (MAP: from 88 +/- 7 to 85 +/- 7 mm Hg, P less than 0.05). There was no change in individuals with initially elevated blood pressure. Furthermore, cardiac index fell significantly with time in this latter group. Thus, the blood pressure elevation in the hypertensive group, previously mainly dependent on high blood flow was, 5 years later, more related to an increased total peripheral resistance, (delta total peripheral resistance = 8%). However, no definite evidence indicating development of hypertrophy of the resistance vessels of the hand was observed during the follow-up period. Since the hyperkinetic subgroup did not display a concomitant fall in blood pressure with cardiac output, our results do not support the theory that the hyperkinetic form of borderline hypertension is a temporary phenomenon, explained by the inclusion of anxious individuals afraid of the experimental situation. Hyperkinetic hypertension may be the initial phase of sustained hypertension in a subgroup of the future hypertensive population. 
Nonmelanoma skin cancer mortality. A population-based study. To estimate the magnitude of nonmelanoma skin cancer mortality and describe its parameters, we reviewed the medical records of all deaths certified as due to this cause among Rhode Island residents from 1979 through 1987. After excluding acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, we confirmed that nonmelanoma skin cancer was the cause of death for 51 individuals, a quarter of the number of melanoma deaths reported. The age-adjusted nonmelanoma skin cancer mortality rate was 0.44/10(5) per year. Fifty-nine percent were due to squamous cell carcinoma, and 20% were due to basal cell carcinoma. Most appeared actinically induced. Among deaths from squamous cell carcinoma, the mean age was 73 years. At least 80% of the squamous cell carcinomas metastasized, and 47% arose on the ear. None appeared due to refusal of treatment. Among deaths from basal cell carcinoma, the mean age was 85 years, and refusal of surgical intervention was documented in 40%. Study of nonmelanoma skin cancer mortality provides for estimation of the magnitude of this problem, complements other studies of prognosis, and helps guide prevention, early detection, and treatment. 
Acoustic-distortion products: separation of sensory from neural dysfunction in sensorineural hearing loss in human beings and rabbits. Because distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) provide a noninvasive measure of outer hair-cell (OHC) activity, they should provide a unique and sensitive indicator of the effects of agents that damage hearing. Using DPOAE methods, the present study was designed to assess the relative contributions of the cochlea's outer hair cells to some common sensorineural diseases, including Meniere's disease, acoustic neuroma, and noise-induced, hereditary, and sudden idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss. Parallel evaluations of DPOAEs were performed under essentially identical conditions in rabbit models of several of the human disorders, including noise-induced hearing loss, endolymphatic hydrops, and cochlear neurectomy. Animal studies were performed to assess the proficiency of DPOAEs to track a developing sensorineural deficit as well as to compare patterns of DPOAE dysfunction between clinical and experimental forms of peripheral hearing loss. Detailed measures of DPOAEs were collected in the stimulus-frequency and intensity domains as "audiograms" and response/growth or input/output functions, respectively. The outcome of analyses of both human beings and animals supported the notion that DPOAE testing is sensitive to sensory-cell disease. Thus, in combination with conventional audiometry, DPOAE measures permit a distinction between the relative contribution sensory and neural components of the cochlea make to hearing deficits. 
Acute gall bladder perforation--a dilemma in early diagnosis. Gall bladder perforation is a rare complication of cholecystitis. A definitive diagnosis is uncommon before surgery and the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition are high. We report six patients with gall bladder perforation to show the difficulty of making an early diagnosis. The history and the clinical findings of these patients are reviewed to highlight diagnostic pitfalls. 
Early abdominal complications following heart and heart-lung transplantation. In the first 11 years of the heart and heart-lung transplantation programme at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, 356 patients underwent heart transplantation, and 73 patients received both heart and lungs. Out of 429 patients 41 (9.5 per cent) developed abdominal complications within the first 30 days, and 20 of the 41 required surgery. The complications included pancreatitis (10), peptic ulceration (8), and pseudo-obstruction (8), in addition to colonic perforation and small bowel obstruction. When laparotomy was performed it was well tolerated. This paper supports the view that successful management of abdominal complications following transplantation requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Where doubt exists in the presence of an acute abdomen, laparotomy is the appropriate way to establish a definitive diagnosis. 
Comparison of the combined effects of atropine and neostigmine with atropine and edrophonium on the lower oesophageal sphincter. In two groups (n = 11) of healthy patients, we have measured gastric, lower oesophageal and barrier pressures before and after antagonism of neuromuscular block during anaesthesia with nitrous oxide and isoflurane. In one group, atropine 1.2 mg and neostigmine 2.5 mg were given and in the second group atropine 0.6 mg with edrophonium 1 mg/kg. One minute after administration of the reversal agents, there was a significantly greater reduction in barrier pressures in the neostigmine and atropine group than in the edrophonium and atropine group, but subsequently, there was no significant difference between the two groups. We conclude that there is no clinical difference between the two reversal mixtures in terms of the risk of regurgitation in the immediate period after reversal. 
Auditory nerve compound action potentials and brain stem auditory evoked potentials in patients with various degrees of hearing loss. Click-evoked compound action potentials recorded in normal-hearing patients through a monopolar electrode placed on the intracranial portion of the eighth nerve were compared with the responses recorded in patients with high-frequency hearing loss or with high- and low-frequency hearing losses. That multiple peaks appear in the compound action potential in patients with hearing loss implies that click sounds elicit successive and separated volleys of neural excitation in the ascending auditory pathway, whereas click sounds in patients with normal hearing mainly give rise to a single volley of neural activity. This difference in the pattern of auditory nerve activity might explain why there are often multiple peaks in the brain stem auditory evoked potentials in patients with hearing loss and that the peaks are often less well-defined than peaks in patients with normal hearing. 
Determination of severity of valvular aortic stenosis by Doppler echocardiography and relation of findings to clinical outcome and agreement with hemodynamic measurements determined at cardiac catheterization. To determine the relation of Doppler findings to clinical outcome and the agreement between Doppler and cardiac catheterization in the assessment of aortic stenosis (AS) severity, 510 consecutive patients with suspected AS studied in our laboratory were analyzed. Adequate echocardiographic and Doppler examinations were obtained in 498 patients or 98% of the population. Clinical data were available for analysis in 497 patients. In 160 patients, Doppler demonstrated an aortic valve area less than or equal to 0.75 cm2 or a peak jet velocity greater than or equal to 4.5 m/s consistent with critical AS. In the subgroup with cardiac catheterization (n = 105), Doppler was 97% accurate. Aortic valve replacement or balloon valvuloplasty was performed in 109 patients, 106 of whom were symptomatic. Noncritical AS was detected by Doppler in 327 patients, with 95% accuracy in the subgroup with cardiac catheterization (n = 133). Aortic valve replacement was performed in 15 patients with symptoms of AS and with valve areas assessed by Doppler to be between 0.76 and 0.80 cm2 or with peak jet velocities greater than 3.5 m/s. In 20 patients, aortic valve replacement was performed because of moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, and in 11 elderly (greater than 70 years old) patients with valve areas between 0.80 and 1.0 cm2, valve replacement was performed at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery in an attempt to prevent the need for a repeat surgical procedure in the future. These observations allow the following conclusions. In the symptomatic patient with critical or near critical AS by Doppler, cardiac catheterization does not provide additional information beyond that provided by Doppler. 
Lord's procedure--the best operation for hydrocele? A prospective study was carried out to compare Lord's hydrocele operation with traditional surgical procedures. The groups of patients investigated were comparable in terms of age, period of observation, number of previous aspirations and size of hydrocele. The incidence of isolated hydrocele of the spermatic cord, as well as epididymal cysts, was lower in the patients who underwent Lord's procedure (7.2 versus 15.8%), as was the percentage of patients reporting post-operative pain for more than 3 days (4.3 versus 15.8%, p less than 0.05). 
Comparison of commercially available cytokeratin antibodies in normal and neoplastic adult epithelial and non-epithelial tissues. Five commercially available cytokeratin antibodies (lu-5, AE1/AE3, CAM 5.2, MFN116 and anti-cytokeratin 18) were used to stain a wide range of normal and neoplastic epithelial and non-epithelial tissues to assess their potential value in diagnostic histopathology. All five showed good specificity, with some cross-reactivity in smooth muscle cells. The wider reactivity of AE1/AE3, lu-5, and MFN 116, which includes cytokeratins 8,18 (Moll's catalogue) expressed in simple epithelia and their tumours, as well as cytokeratins expressed in complex stratified squamous epithelia, permits identification of a wider range of epithelial derived tumours. This wider spectrum of reactivity may allow these antibodies to be used in a diagnostic panel for the identification of poorly differentiated tumours. 
Improving palliation in pancreatic cancer: intraoperative celiac plexus block for pain relief. Most patients with pancreatic carcinoma are not curable. Surgical palliation of obstructive jaundice and gastric outlet obstruction leaves many patients with severe pain from pancreatic carcinoma. Anesthesiologists have drawn increasing attention to the successful use of postoperative percutaneous celiac plexus block for the treatment of pancreatic pain. Ironically, little attention has been paid to celiac plexus block during laparotomy. We reviewed the cases of 12 patients with pancreatic carcinoma and severe abdominal pain who were treated surgically. All patients had operative celiac plexus block with absolute alcohol at the time of exploratory laparotomy for biliary bypass, gastroenterostomy, or tumor biopsy. Complete postoperative pain relief was obtained in 10 of the 12 patients; two had only partial relief. No operative complications were related to celiac plexus block; one patient died postoperatively of pneumonia. Average postoperative hospital stay was 13 days and average postoperative survival was 3 1/2 months. Most patients had excellent pain relief for at least 2 months or until death. Because most patients treated surgically for pancreatic carcinoma are receiving only palliation with biliary bypass or gastroenterostomy, surgeons should pay increased attention to pain relief. Operative celiac plexus block is easy, safe, and highly effective in relieving the agonizing pain of pancreatic carcinoma. 
Anal tonometry: a quick method of anal manometry. Evaluation of anal sphincter tonic activity is important in the proctologic clinic. However, manometric techniques are expensive, complex, and only available in some centers. Because there is often an in-office need for having objective measurements of anal tonic activity, in our clinic we introduced a simple method for measurement of anal pressures. This method is based on the flow of air in an open circuit by using a rubber probe with a side opening at one end. Pressure is assessed by an ordinary manometric gauge for arterial pressure. With this simple instrument, the following parameters are measured: 1) anal resting pressure, 2) squeeze pressure, 3) functional length of the anal canal, and 4) descent of the perineum on staining. After testing the technique in 100 healthy persons, it was applied to 130 patients with several proctologic disorders. Differences in pressures were found between controls and patients with anal fissure (high resting pressures), and patients with anal incontinence (low resting and/or squeeze pressures). A correlation was also found between the descending perineum measured by this method and by defecography. This simple instrument is useful in the office as the first approach to the function of the anal sphincters and the pelvic floor. Nowadays, so-called anal tonometry is part of the proctologic examination in our department, because it is simple, reliable, and takes only a few minutes. 
Interrelationship of blood transfusion, non-A, non-B hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma: analysis by detection of antibody to hepatitis C virus. To clarify the relationship between hepatitis C virus infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma as sequelae of non-A, non-B posttransfusion hepatitis, 231 patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (96 with chronic hepatitis, 81 with cirrhosis and 54 with hepatocellular carcinoma) were analyzed for antibody to hepatitis C virus and were compared with 125 patients with chronic hepatitis B (50 with chronic hepatitis, 46 with cirrhosis and 29 with hepatocellular carcinoma). Antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 89.6%, 86.4% and 94.4% of patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis-related chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively, compared with 6%, 17.4% and 34.5% with similar diseases related to hepatitis B. A history of transfusion was documented in 52%, 33% and 42% of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive cases of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The mean intervals between the date of transfusion and the date of diagnosis of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were 10, 21.2 and 29 yr, respectively. In 21 patients with transfusion-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, anti-hepatitis C virus was present in each serial sample available for testing, including samples obtained up to 14 yr before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. These data suggest the slow, sequential progression from acute hepatitis C virus-related non-A, non-B hepatitis through chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma and support a causal association between hepatitis C virus and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Left ventricular diastolic filling alterations in normotensive young adults with a family history of systemic hypertension. To characterize the cardiovascular consequences of a history of hypertension in first-degree relatives in normotensive young adults, 72 normotensive (diastolic blood pressure [BP] less than 90 mm Hg) healthy volunteers (age 18 to 30 years) were studied with 2 dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiography, pulsed Doppler echocardiography, and 2-hour automated BP monitoring. Of the 72 subjects, 19 (12 men and 7 women) had a family history of hypertension and were compared with 19 subjects without a family history of hypertension who were matched for systolic BP and gender. There were no detectable differences in 2-hour average BP, left ventricular (LV) mass or wall thickness, or echocardiographic systolic functional indexes between subjects with and without a family history of hypertension. Doppler-derived diastolic functional indexes demonstrated more prominent late diastolic filling in subjects with a family history of hypertension. Late diastolic transmitral flow time and flow velocity integral were greater (132 +/- 24 vs 117 +/- 17 ms, p less than 0.05; and 2.5 +/- 0.7 vs 1.9 +/- 0.5 cm, p less than 0.01, respectively). To measure possible gender-related effects of a family history of hypertension, the men and women were analyzed separately. The 12 men with a family history of hypertension had greater peak late (40 +/- 0.9 vs 31 +/- 0.8 cm/s, p less than 0.02) and ratio of late-to-early (0.64 +/- 0.19 vs 0.46 +/- 0.10, p less than 0.01) transmitral flow velocities and greater late transmitral flow velocity integrals (2.6 +/- 0.8 vs 1.9 +/- 0.5 cm, p less than 0.05) than the matched male control subjects. 
Enterogastric reflux after various types of antiulcer gastric surgery: quantitation by 99mTc-HIDA scintigraphy. In 28 controls and 142 patients subjected to a variety of antiulcer procedures, the enterogastric reflux (EGR) was quantitated by 99mTc-HIDA scintigraphy and expressed as the EGR index on 229 different occasions. The EGR index was calculated according to two different formulas: one based on the maximal radioactivity over the gastric area as a percentage value of the total abdominal activity (EGR-Im) and the other based on the relative maximal radioactivity over the gastric area as a percentage value of the relative hepatobiliary activity (EGR-It). There was a significant positive correlation of values between the two methods (P less than 0.0001). In patients with an EGR-Im greater than 20% or EGR-It greater than 57% and postgastric surgery symptoms some of the symptoms were attributed to EGR, an antireflux procedure is expected to relieve those symptoms. Sixteen of these patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastrectomy and their preoperative symptoms were relieved. 
Tocainide and mortality after myocardial infarction: a prospective study in conscious dogs. The production of an anterior myocardial infarction as part of an experimental animal model for sudden death was burdened by a persistently elevated mortality rate (30%) despite the use of traditional antiarrhythmic drugs. Mortality was reduced when tocainide (600 mg three times daily) was empirically administered for 4 days before and 4 days after myocardial infarction. Retrospective analysis showed that mortality at 4 days after infarction was significantly lower in the tocainide-treated dogs than in the preceding large group of dogs that had not been so treated (5 [9%] of 55, versus 64 [32%] of 199, p less than 0.01). This difference was still evident 30 days after myocardial infarction (13 [24%] of 55 versus 83 [42%] of 199; p less than 0.05). This observation led to the present prospective study in 106 dogs with a similar protocol but with a randomized sequence. At 4 days after myocardial infarction, the mortality rate was 55% lower in the tocainide group than in the control group (7 [12.5%] of 56 versus 14 [28%] of 50; p less than 0.05). During the 10 days after treatment withdrawal 9 (18%) of 49 dogs in the tocainide group died compared with only 2 (5%) of 36 in the control group. This rebound in mortality produced similar survival figures in the two groups at 14 and at 30 days after infarction when mortality was 30% (17 of 56) in the tocainide group and 34% (17 of 50) in the control group. The tocainide plasma levels were 7.4 +/- 4 micrograms/ml the day before infarction and 7.2 +/- 3 micrograms/ml 3 days after infarction. 
Hereditary sacral agenesis with presacral mass and anorectal stenosis: the Currarino triad. A family with autosomal dominant inheritance of sacral agenesis is described. Ten members were affected; four had associated presacral teratomas and anterior sacral meningoceles, giving rise to serious complications in three, including bacterial meningitis, local recurrence of teratoma and perianal sepsis. Three of those with presacral masses presented initially with anorectal anomalies. Other associated abnormalities included tethering of the cord, hydrocephalus, duplex ureter, hydronephrosis, vesicoureteric reflux, neurogenic bladder, bicornuate uterus, rectovaginal fistula and hereditary spherocytosis. Early diagnosis and surgical excision of a presacral mass is advised to prevent future morbidity and mortality. 
Nutritional management of acute and chronic pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis often results in a catabolic state characterized by profound hemodynamic, metabolic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and renal aberrations. Parenteral nutrition and metabolic support are essential if morbidity and mortality are to be minimized. In chronic pancreatitis, nutritional management ranges from fundamental dietary manipulation with or without administration of appropriate digestive enzymes to enteral supplementation with modular chemically defined diets to total parenteral nutrition, depending on the stage, severity, and manifestations of the disease. In prescribing nutrient substrates in both acute and chronic pancreatitis, consideration must be given to their effects on pancreatic enzyme secretion if optimal results are to be achieved. 
Antitumor effect of synthetic derivatives of lipid A in an experimental model of colon cancer in the rat. Colon carcinoma is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death in industrialized countries. The patients generally die of the metastases. In a colon cancer rat model, the authors have shown that lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli induced the regression of carcinomatosis and cured 20%-30% of the rats. Some synthetic derivatives of lipid A, which are less toxic than lipopolysaccharides, were injected 14 days after the tumor cells. They induced the complete regression of peritoneal carcinomatosis consisting of numerous nodules measuring 1-5 mm in 20%-30% of rats. Only compounds with three or more hydroxymyristic acid residues were effective. In vivo effects were correlated with the capacity to induce the production of interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor but not with the capacity to induce macrophage-mediated cytolysis. It is therefore possible to synthesize weakly toxic derivatives of lipopolysaccharides retaining their antitumoral property in vivo. 
Effectiveness of imazodan for treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. The Imazodan Research Group. A 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of imazodan, a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was conducted in 147 patients with congestive heart failure to determine clinical efficacy and safety. Patients were randomized to placebo or 2, 5 or 10 mg of imazodan administered twice daily. Patients were maintained on their standard therapy including diuretics, digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The mean ejection fraction was 23 +/- 10%. Exercise time increased from baseline in all 4 groups. There was no significant difference observed between the placebo group and any of the treated groups with regard to exercise time, ejection fraction, frequency of ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia. When analyzed by intent to treat, the placebo mortality was 7% (3 of 44) and the imazodan mortality was 8% (8 of 103) (p = not significant). This study failed to demonstrate that imazodan provided any benefit in exercise performance when compared with placebo. 
Periarticular heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty. Risk factors and consequences. The formation of periarticular heterotopic bone after total hip arthroplasty is a frequent complication. The reported occurrences concerning this complication vary considerably in different reports, ranging from 15% to 90% with significant amounts in 1%-27% of the cases. Heterotopic ossification (HO) starts with the surgical operation, and the extent is well delineated on roentgenograms after six to 12 weeks. The amount of bone varies from small islands in the soft tissue to widespread bridging ossification. The cause of HO seems to be mainly related to systemic factors and is chiefly dependent on gender, diagnosis, and concurrent antiinflammatory medication. Patients at risk seem to be those with HO after a previous surgical operation, patients suffering from certain types of ankylosing spondylitis, otherwise healthy men with osteoarthrosis, patients with hypertrophic osteoarthrosis, and patients operated upon for fresh fractures or other posttraumatic conditions. The surgical technique and the local tissue trauma probably moderate both the occurrence and amount of HO. HO does not seem to cause pain or to decrease hip muscle strength but does limit hip mobility in cases with significant amount of ossification. 
The European Stroke Prevention Study: results according to sex. The European Stroke Prevention Study was a multicenter trial comparing the effect of a combination of 75 mg dipyridamole and 330 mg acetylsalicylic acid tid with placebo in the prevention of stroke or death after one or more attacks of recent transient ischemic attacks or stroke of atherothrombotic origin. From the 2,500 patients in the intention-to-treat analysis, the proportion of women was 42%, and from the 1,861 patients in the explanatory analysis it was 44%. The endpoint incidence was significantly higher in men than in women. The endpoint reduction was statistically significant only in the intention-to-treat analysis with total endpoints. However, there was a marked percentage reduction of endpoints in both men and women in explanatory analysis. The risk reduction of strokes was 49% for men and 41% for women, and the reduction of total endpoints was 39% in men and 30% in women. Thus, antiplatelet therapy is effective in the prevention of stroke or death in both sexes. 
Pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal artery as a complication of an osteochondroma. A review of the literature and a case report. False aneurysm of the femoral artery was associated with a solitary osteochondroma of the femur in a 22-year-old man. An extensive review of the literature and the problems related to diagnosis revealed that the aneurysm was apparently unique. Contrary to previous reports, computed tomography and angiography did not establish the diagnosis. The physical findings were more informative. 
External cardiopulmonary resuscitation preserves brain viability after prolonged cardiac arrest in dogs. Standard external cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) steps A-B-C produce a low blood flow that may or may not preserve brain viability during prolonged cardiac arrest. A dog model was used with ventricular fibrillation (VF) of 20 minutes, reperfusion with brief cardiopulmonary bypass, controlled ventilation to 20 hours, and intensive care to 96 hours. A retrospective comparison was made of the results of one series, now called "group I" (n = 10)--which received CPR basic life support interposed from VF 10 to 15 minutes, and CPR advanced life support with epinephrine (without defibrillation) from VF 15 to 20 minutes--to the results of another series, now "control group II" (n = 10)--which received VF no flow (no CPR) for 20 minutes. All 20 dogs within protocol were resuscitated. All 10 of group I and 7 of 10 of group II survived to 96 hours. Pupillary light reflex returned after the start of cardiopulmonary bypass at 7.7 +/- 3.7 minutes in CPR group I, versus 16.3 +/- 7.4 minutes in control group II (P = .032). At 96 hours postarrest, final overall performance categories (1, normal; 5, brain death) were better in group I. Six of 10 dogs achieved normality (overall performance category 1) in group I, as compared with none of 10 in group II (P = .004). Final neurologic deficit score (0%, best; 100% worst) was lower (better) in group I (15% +/- 20%) than in group II (51% +/- 6%; P less than .001). 
Long-term follow-up after prosthetic replacement of the superior vena cava combined with resection of mediastinal-pulmonary malignant tumors. The contraindication to curative excision of mediastinal and pulmonary cancers because of invasion of the superior vena cava is now challenged by the existence of vascular prostheses that are suitable for venous replacement. Between 1979 and 1990 22 patients underwent resection of lung cancer (n = 6) or malignant mediastinal tumors (n = 16) involving the superior vena cava. Resection was done with concomitant venous reconstruction, and polytetrafluorethylene grafts were used. All bronchogenic carcinomas necessitated right pneumonectomy, whereas the excision of mediastinal tumors had to include pulmonary resections in nine patients (five lobectomies and four sublobar resections) and the right phrenic nerve in 12 patients. Venous reconstruction was performed by interposition of a large polytetrafluoroethylene graft between the proximal and cardiac ends of the superior vena cava (n = 8), or between one (n = 10) or both brachiocephalic veins (n = 4) and the right atrium. One patient died postoperatively (4.5%), and another had mediastinitis that was successfully treated by omentopexy. Chemotherapy was administered preoperatively to five patients and postoperatively to seven patients; radiotherapy was administered to two and 10 patients, respectively. The overall actuarial survival rate is 48% at 5 years, with 11 patients presently alive. The survival rate of patients with mediastinal tumors is 60% at 5 years. Among the patients with lung cancer, two with N1 disease are alive at 16 and 51 months, and one died at 38 months; the two patients with N2 disease died at 6 and 8 months. Only one graft occlusion occurred in the postoperative period; another occurred 14 months after operation and was precipitated by insertion of a central venous catheter. The patency of all remaining grafts was demonstrated after an average time of 23 (1 to 98) months. On the basis of these results, polytetrafluoroethylene graft replacement of the superior vena cava should be part of the planning and execution of radical excision with curative intent of mediastinal and right pulmonary malignant tumors that are not present with other contraindications, such as pleural or distant metastasis and severe systemic disease. 
Expression and secretion of leukocyte chemotactic cytokines by normal human melanocytes and melanoma cells. The capacity of human melanocytes and melanoma cells to produce IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic and activating factor (MCAF) was investigated. Melanocytes expressed mRNA for IL-8 and MCAF, when stimulated with either IL-1 alpha or TNF alpha, but not when stimulated with IL-6, IFN gamma, or LPS alone. IL-8 and MCAF could be induced in a dose-dependent fashion with doses as low as 0.1 ng/ml TNF alpha and 0.5 ng/ml IL-1 alpha. IL-8 and MCAF mRNA were rapidly expressed and peaked between 2 and 4 h for IL-8 and between 4 and 8 h for MCAF. This correlated well with the accumulation of IL-8 antigen as measured by a radioimmunoassay. Supernatants from melanocyte cultures stimulated with either IL-1 alpha or TNF alpha and separated on a heparin-Sepharose column became positive for neutrophil and monocyte chemotactic activity in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. When IFN gamma was added to melanocyte cultures stimulated with suboptimal doses of TNF alpha there was a synergistic increase in secreted IL-8 protein and monocyte chemotactic activity. These data provide further evidence for the possible role of melanocytes in the initiation of an inflammatory reaction. Three different malignant melanoma cell lines stimulated with either TNF alpha or IL-1 alpha expressed IL-8 mRNA, but not mRNA for MCAF. The IL-8 mRNA signal corresponded well with the amount of secreted IL-8 protein. These data suggest that IL-8 and MCAF may play a role in growth regulation and spreading of melanomas. 
[35S]methionine interaction with rat liver tRNA and effect of chemical carcinogens. The interaction of [35S]methionine with hepatic tRNA in normal, carcinogen-treated, and partially hepatectomized rats was studied. tRNA was preferentially labeled following [35S]methionine (1.6 mCi, 25 mg/kg body wt) administration by intraperitoneal injection. The extent of [35S]methionine-tRNA interaction was impaired by partial hepatectomy and by conditions having a carcinogenic potential. 
Inhibition of promoter activity by methylation: possible involvement of protein mediators. To study the relationship between DNA methylation and promoter activity we have methylated in vitro the promoters of the mouse metallothionein I gene and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. We have transiently transfected these promoters fused to the human growth hormone in their methylated or unmethylated state into mouse L or F9 cells. Promoters methylated by methylase (M.) Hpa II and M.Hha I caused inhibition of reporter gene expression in L cells but not in F9 cells, while methylation of all CpGs by M.Sss I caused inhibition in both cell lines. Repression of promoter activity by M.Hpa II and M.Hha I methylation, but not by M.Sss I methylation, could be alleviated by cotransfection with an excess of untranscribable DNA methylated with M.Sss I. The methylated sites in nuclei isolated from the transfected L cells, but not F9 cells, were found to be protected from Msp I digestion. Taken together these results suggest that a factor present in L cells and missing in F9 cells mediates the methylation-directed inhibition of promoter activity. The ability of methylated DNA to overcome the inhibition seems to reflect competition for the mediator factor. Interestingly, treatment with Zn2+ ions brought about activation of the methylated promoter of the metallothionein gene. Similarly, butyrate could override the repression of the thymidine kinase methylated promoter. These activations were not accompanied by demethylation of the promoter or displacement of the mediator factor. 
Omega-3 fatty acids in health and disease and in growth and development. Several sources of information suggest that man evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids of approximately 1 whereas today this ratio is approximately 10:1 to 20-25:1, indicating that Western diets are deficient in omega 3 fatty acids compared with the diet on which humans evolved and their genetic patterns were established. Omega-3 fatty acids increase bleeding time; decrease platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and fibrinogen; and increase erythrocyte deformability, thus decreasing the tendency to thrombus formation. In no clinical trial, including coronary artery graft surgery, has there been any evidence of increased blood loss due to ingestion of omega 3 fatty acids. Many studies show that the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on serum lipids depend on the type of patient and whether the amount of saturated fatty acids in the diet is held constant. In patients with hyperlipidemia, omega 3 fatty acids decrease low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol if the saturated fatty acid content is decreased, otherwise there is a slight increase, but at high doses (32 g) they lower LDL cholesterol; furthermore, they consistently lower serum triglycerides in normal subjects and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia whereas the effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) varies from no effect to slight increases. The discrepancies between animal and human studies most likely are due to differences between animal and human metabolism. In clinical trials eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the form of fish oils along with antirheumatic drugs improve joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; have a beneficial effect in patients with ulcerative colitis; and in combination with drugs, improve the skin lesions, lower the hyperlipidemia from etretinates, and decrease the toxicity of cyclosporin in patients with psoriasis. In various animal models omega 3 fatty acids decrease the number and size of tumors and increase the time elapsed before appearance of tumors. Studies with nonhuman primates and human newborns indicate that DHA is essential for the normal functional development of the retina and brain, particularly in premature infants. Because omega 3 fatty acids are essential in growth and development throughout the life cycle, they should be included in the diets of all humans. Omega-3 and omega 6 fatty acids are not interconvertible in the human body and are important components of practically all cell membranes. Whereas cellular proteins are genetically determined, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of cell membranes is to a great extent dependent on the dietary intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Ataxic hemiparesis associated with ipsilateral cerebellar syndrome caused by a paracentral gyrus lesion. The authors report a case of ataxic hemiparesis and an ipsilateral cerebellar syndrome in relation to a glioblastoma of the paracentral gyrus region. The physiopathology of this clinical presentation caused by compression of the corticopontine tract is discussed. 
6-mercaptopurine therapy in selected cases of corticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease. Nineteen patients (12 children and 7 adults) with severe Crohn's disease, all of whom were dependent on corticosteroids, were treated with 6-mercaptopurine. All patients received a daily dose of 6-mercaptopurine of 50 mg; in two pediatric patients with a poor response after 2 months, the dosage was increased to 75 mg/day. A complete or partial response to 6-mercaptopurine therapy was noted in 47% of patients, and therapy failed in 53%. The age of the patients, prior resection, or initial symptoms did not influence the response. The clinical response was better in male than in female patients and in patients with involvement of both the small intestine and the colon than in those with only enteritis. 6-Mercaptopurine is a possible alternative to long-term corticosteroid therapy or surgical treatment in selected patients with severe Crohn's disease. 
Incentive spirometry versus routine chest physiotherapy for prevention of pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery We entered 876 patients into a clinical trial aimed at preventing pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery. Patients either received conventional chest physiotherapy or were encouraged to perform maximal inspiratory manoeuvres for 5 min during each hour while awake, using an incentive spirometer. The incidence of pulmonary complications did not differ significantly between the groups: incentive spirometry 68 of 431 (15.8%, 95% CI 14.0-17.6%), and chest physiotherapy 68 of 445 (15.3%, CI 13.6-17.0%). Nor was there a difference between the groups in the incidence of positive clinical signs, pyrexia, abnormal chest radiographs, pathogens in sputum, respiratory failure (PO2 less than 60 mm Hg), or length of stay in hospital. We conclude that prophylactic incentive spirometry and chest physiotherapy are of equivalent clinical efficacy in the general management of patients undergoing abdominal surgery. 
Gastric emptying in patients with severe reflux esophagitis. The pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is not fully understood. There have been reports that delayed gastric emptying is a contributing factor in some patients. To determine whether delayed gastric emptying plays a role in the genesis of GER, we correlated gastric-emptying measures obtained by scintigraphic techniques with the degree of acid reflux assessed by esophageal pH monitoring. Ten patients, all of whom had evidence of esophageal mucosal disease and severe acid reflux, were studied. Four of the 10 patients with reflux had prolongation in the lag phase of gastric solid emptying, and one of the four showed prolonged gastric-emptying t1/2. There was no significant difference, however, in the mean gastric-emptying t1/2 between a control group and the patient group. Furthermore, there was no correlation between gastric-emptying measures and degree of acid reflux. We conclude that in this group of 10 patients with severe GER, delayed gastric emptying does not play an important role in the development of gastroesophageal reflux. 
Recurrence of oropharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. Two-hundred-and-twenty-one patients with squamous carcinoma of the oropharynx treated by irradiation are presented. The primary recurrence rate at five years in the previously untreated patients was 27%, but was dictated by neither host factors (age, sex and general condition) nor tumour factors (site, T-stage and histological grade). Pre-operative histological diagnosis had a very high sensitivity but a low specificity, indicating that false positives are common but false negatives unusual. Twenty per cent of patients with a recurrent primary tumour were untreatable. The five year survival after a primary recurrence was 31 per cent. Sixty-eight per cent of patients undergoing major surgery recovered without a major complication, and the hospital mortality rate was three per cent, due entirely to major medical catastrophes. The major complication rate in those undergoing flap repair after major resection was seven per cent. The metastatic rate in lymph nodes was 44 per cent at five years, and again this did not depend on any host or tumour factors. The survival at five years after node recurrence was a mere 19 per cent, and the length of survival was related to the primary site of the original tumour and the presence of extranodal disease. Two-thirds of patients had advanced disease (N2 and N3) when node recurrence was diagnosed and about 15 per cent were unsuitable for surgery. 
Cerebral infarction verified by cranial computed tomography and prognosis for survival following transient ischemic attack. Of 564 consecutive patients with transient ischemic attack, 350 (62%) had cranial computed tomography performed. Except for date of admission and smoking history, there were few differences between the patients evaluated with computed tomography and the 214 who were not. Cerebral infarcts were found in 59 (17%) of the 350 tomographic evaluations. Previous clinically diagnosed stroke, older age, and male sex were all significantly associated with the occurrence of tomographically verified infarcts (p less than 0.05). After controlling for stroke history and other important covariates, patients with tomographically verified infarcts had significantly shorter survival times than did patients without evidence of infarction on computed tomography (p = 0.035). Thus, cranial computed tomography findings appear to have important prognostic value for estimating survival following transient ischemic attack. 
Surgical evaluation of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Experience with 110 children. Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a disorder of unknown origin that is probably related to an autoimmune phenomenon. This report concerns 110 children (mean age, 6.2 years; range, 6 months to 14 years) with Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Seventy-two (65%) had abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting, bloody stool, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Sixty patients with abdominal pain were evaluated and treated conservatively. However, 12 patients underwent laparotomy. Six underwent unnecessary appendectomy for wrongly diagnosed appendicitis. Bowel resection was performed in one patient for an obstructive ileal lesion. Six additional patients had intussusception; surgery was required in three, while barium enema reduction was successfully accomplished in three others. Massive gastric hemorrhage required ligation, vagotomy, and pyloroplasty in two instances. One child with severe scrotal pain, hemorrhage, and swelling underwent unnecessary scrotal exploration. Four additional patients with similar symptoms avoided operation after a testicular scintiscan demonstrated good blood flow. A high index of suspicion and early diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura based on clinical, roentgenographic, and laboratory findings may avoid unnecessary operations in most cases. However, life-threatening complications (hemorrhage, obstruction, and intussusception) may occur and require operative intervention. All of the patients survived. 
Complications of diverticular disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a prospective study. Previous retrospective studies have suggested an association between consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the complications of diverticular disease. Ninety-two patients were entered into a prospective study of the complications of diverticular disease over a 3 year period; 31 were taking NSAIDs, compared with only four age- and sex-matched controls from a representative general practice (P less than 0.001). A second control group comprised 306 patients with cancer of the colon in whom NSAID consumption was again significantly lower than in patients with diverticular disease (22 of 306 versus 31 of 92, P less than 0.001). Of the 31 patients taking NSAIDs, 19 presented with a perforation or peritonitis. By contrast, only eight of the 61 patients not taking NSAIDs had such complications (P less than 0.001). Eleven patients presented with bleeding of whom five were taking NSAIDs and six were not. Patients admitted with complications of diverticular disease have a high incidence of NSAID intake, and it appears that NSAID consumption is associated with a more severe form of the disease. 
A1-adenosine receptor inhibition of adenylate cyclase in failing and nonfailing human ventricular myocardium. BACKGROUND. Receptors that couple via the stimulatory G protein, Gs, to adenylate cyclase and to a positive inotropic response have been extensively investigated in falling human heart. In contrast, much less is known about receptors, such as the A1-adenosine receptor, that couple to adenylate cyclase via the inhibitory G protein, Gi, to give a negative inotropic response. Activation of such Gi-coupled receptors might worsen heart failure. Furthermore, alpha Gi is increased in failing human ventricular myocardium, which may enhance inhibitory receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase. METHODS AND RESULTS. A1-Adenosine receptor inhibition of adenylate cyclase was examined in crude particulate preparations derived from 12 nonfailing and 12 failing human left ventricles. Experimental conditions were designed for maximal inhibitory responses. Dose-response curves were performed with the selective A1-adenosine receptor agonist R-phenylisopropyl-adenosine (R-PIA). No differences in nonfailing versus failing heart were observed for basal adenylate cyclase activity (49.0 +/- 4.1 versus 45.7 +/- 2.6 pmol cyclic AMP/min/mg), maximal R-PIA-mediated inhibition (31.1 +/- 2.6 versus 30.2 +/- 1.6 pmol cyclic AMP/min/mg), ED50 (R-PIA x 10(-7) 1.28 +/- 0.10 versus 1.36 +/- 0.08), or slope (1.06 +/- 0.06 versus 1.03 +/- 0.10), respectively. Furthermore, fluoride, forskolin, and manganese adenylate cyclase activation were not different in failing heart, which is consistent with no change in the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase. The inhibitory G protein alpha Gi, as quantitated by pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, was increased in failing heart (105.7 +/- 5.8 versus 132.7 +/- 3.4 optical density units, p less than 0.003). Basal adenylate cyclase activity was reduced in failing heart (7.8 +/- 0.8 versus 4.5 +/- 0.4 pmol cyclic AMP/min/mg, p less than 0.005) with assay conditions designed to assess G protein effects. CONCLUSIONS. The A1-adenosine receptor pathway exerts a major inhibitory effect on human myocardial adenylate cyclase activity. Although alpha Gi was increased in failing heart, A1-adenosine receptor inhibition of adenylate cyclase was not altered in preparations of failing versus nonfailing human ventricular myocardium. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and peptic ulcer disease. An overview. Evidence is accumulating that use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is linked to ulceration of the stomach and duodenum and can cause significant, life-threatening ulcer complications. The mechanism of action seems to be both topical damage to the mucosal barrier and the systemic effect of a reduction in levels of mucosal prostaglandins. Patients especially at risk are the elderly, those with concomitant debilitating disease, those with a history of ulcers, and those taking corticosteroids. Histamine2 blockers are reported to significantly reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer, and misoprostol (Cytotec) has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Prophylaxis with these agents should be considered for high-risk patients who need NSAID therapy to maintain a reasonable life-style. 
Cervical dystonia: clinical findings and associated movement disorders. We studied 300 patients, 61% women, with mean age 49.7 years and mean duration of dystonia 7.8 years, to determine the demographic and clinical characteristics of cervical dystonia (CD) and its relationships to other movement disorders. Torticollis was present in 82%, laterocollis in 42%, retrocollis in 29%, and anterocollis in 25%; however, the majority (66%) had a combination of these abnormal postures. Scoliosis was present in 39%, local pain reported by 68%, and 32% had evidence of secondary cervical radiculopathy. In addition to CD, 16% of patients had oral dystonia, 12% mandibular dystonia, 10% hand/arm dystonia, and 10% had blepharospasm. Tremor was noted in 71% of patients; head-neck tremor was present in 60%, and tremor in other body regions was present in 32%. A family history of a movement disorder was present in 44% of the CD patients. Tardive dystonia was the cause in 6%; 11% had posttraumatic dystonia. Anticholinergic drugs provided moderate improvement in 33% of patients, but local intramuscular botulinum toxin injections relieved CD, local pain, or both in over 90% of all treated patients. 
Diagnosis and management of Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis characterized by mucosal inflammation, rash, cervical adenopathy, indurative edema of the hands and feet, and late membranous desquamation of the fingertips. Early cardiac effects include myocarditis (occasionally with congestive heart failure), pericardial inflammation, and, rarely, valve involvement. Coronary artery aneurysms are a long-term concern because coronary thrombosis with myocardial infarction can be a late manifestation. The origin of Kawasaki disease is unknown, but an infectious agent is most likely. Management consists of aspirin for control of fever and inflammatory manifestations and intravenous gamma globulin for the prevention of coronary aneurysm formation. Careful late follow-up is required, especially for patients with persistent coronary abnormalities. Giant aneurysms (greater than 8 mm) are more likely to progress to coronary obstructive disease, and coronary bypass grafts have been required for some patients. Late coronary artery manifestations in patients with mild early coronary dilatation have not been described. However, since long-term epidemiologic studies have not yet been performed, it is prudent to consider childhood Kawasaki disease to be a potential risk factor for coronary disease, especially in atherosclerosis-prone Western societies. 
Occurrence of stroke associated with use/abuse of drugs. Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke frequently occur in temporal association with use or abuse of illicit and over-the-counter (OTC) sympathomimetic drugs. However, little information is available on the proportion of strokes associated with use/abuse of drugs in specific hospital populations. Between September 1, 1988, and August 1, 1989, 167 of 178 stroke patients entered into the Maryland Stroke Data Bank were asked for a history of drug use or abuse. Information was incomplete in 51 of 167 (31%) patients due to neurologic deficit or lack of inquiry. Eleven of the remaining 116 cases (9.5%) were historically associated with drug use. Age range was 25 to 56 years (mean, 41 years). Stroke associated with drug use occurred in four of 62 (6%) cerebral infarcts, two of 28 (7%) intracerebral hemorrhages, and five of 26 (19%) subarachnoid hemorrhages (p = ns). Drugs included cocaine in five (45%), OTC sympathomimetics in three (27%), phencyclidine in two (18%), and heroin in one (9%). 
Identification of a gene located at chromosome 5q21 that is mutated in colorectal cancers Recent studies have suggested the existence of a tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome region 5q21. DNA probes from this region were used to study a panel of sporadic colorectal carcinomas. One of these probes, cosmid 5.71, detected a somatically rearranged restriction fragment in the DNA from a single tumor. Further analysis of the 5.71 cosmid revealed two regions that were highly conserved in rodent DNA. These sequences were used to identify a gene, MCC (mutated in colorectal cancer), which encodes an 829-amino acid protein with a short region of similarity to the G protein-coupled m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The rearrangement in the tumor disrupted the coding region of the MCC gene. Moreover, two colorectal tumors were found with somatically acquired point mutations in MCC that resulted in amino acid substitutions. MCC is thus a candidate for the putative colorectal tumor suppressor gene located at 5q21. Further studies will be required to determine whether the gene is mutated in other sporadic tumors or in the germ line of patients with an inherited predisposition to colonic tumorigenesis. 
Microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm. Patterns of vascular compression in unsuccessfully operated patients. To determine the causative factors of unsuccessful microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm, the follow-up results in 53 patients were assessed retrospectively. The mean follow-up period was 36 months. There were 32 patients who had compression of the seventh cranial nerve ventrocaudally by an anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) or a posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Of these 32 patients, 30 (94%) had excellent postoperative results. Of 14 patients with more severe compression by the vertebral artery, nine (64%) had excellent results, three (21%) had good results, and two (14%) had poor results; in this group, three patients with excellent results experienced transient spasm recurrence. There were seven patients in whom the meatal branch of the AICA coursed between the seventh and eighth cranial nerves and compressed the dorsal aspect of the seventh nerve; this was usually associated with another artery compressing the ventral aspect of the nerve ("sandwich-type" compression). Of these seven patients, five (71%) had poor results including operative failure in one and recurrence of spasm in four. The authors conclude that the clinical outcome was closely related to the patterns of vascular compression. 
A study of elastic tissue and actinic radiation in "aging," temporal arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and atherosclerosis. The actinic storm in the modern world. Solar radiation provokes a lifelong series of destructive changes in the supporting elastic tissues of "exposed" skin. Called actinic elastosis/lysis (or actinic "aging"), the sequence begins in early life as simple elastic hyperplasia, converts in middle life to progressive actinic elastotic degeneration, and, in late life, typically ends with a stage of resorption (elastolysis) and atrophy ("aged" skin). Superficial "exposed" arteries such as the temporal artery participate in the same sequence of degenerative elastotic changes, which, as in the skin, may provoke granulomatous responses in a few of the many subjects affected. In the case of the temporal artery, a contingent outcome may be giant cell (temporal) arteritis and its recognized systemic vascular expression, polymyalgia rheumatica. Actinic commotion at the surface of the body is often massive in degree and extent and may be expected to exert a deleterious autoimmune impact on the essential elastic tissues of the arterial system. For this reason, solar radiation should be recognized as a risk factor for other elastic-related vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and aneurysms. Man-made radiations may be exacerbating the effects of predominant solar radiation. Of the many radiant bands that make up the actinic (electromagnetic) spectrum, little is known for certain about the identity of those that cause these prevalent disorders of elastic tissue. Until this void is filled, more care should be taken with solar and the other "safe" radiations. 
Memory and pain: tests of mood congruity and state dependent learning in experimentally induced and clinical pain. The associative network theory of memory [2] is outlined along with the concepts of mood congruity and state dependent learning. Two experiments are reported which investigate the occurrence of these effects where memory for pain is concerned. In experiment 1 the performance of 25 chronic pain patients was compared with that of 25 non-patient controls on a test involving both immediate and delayed recall of a mixed list of stimulus words of 3 types: pain-related, negative or neutral. No significant group differences were found in overall rates of immediate recall. As predicted, however, pain patients recalled more pain-related words than non-patient controls (P less than 0.001). On delayed recall the same significant group x word-type interaction was obtained (P less than 0.02), but in addition the non-patient controls recalled significantly more words overall (P less than 0.02). These results provide some evidence for the occurrence of a mood congruity effect. Experiment 2 investigated state dependent learning and mood congruity effects in experimentally induced pain. Twenty volunteer subjects were allocated to 1 of 4 conditions in which a wordlist (as in experiment 1) was presented following either a painful stimulus (cold pressor test) or a non-painful one (warm water) and was then recalled immediately following further exposure to stimulus conditions which were congruent with the original stimulus (warm/warm and cold/cold conditions) or non-congruent (warm/cold and cold/warm conditions). A 3-way split plot ANOVA yielded no significant main effects for group or word-type, but a significant interaction emerged between state at encoding and at recall (P less than 0.04). 
Colchicine and antineoplastic therapy for the prevention of restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions. The complexity of the events that culminate in intimal proliferation after arterial injury and similarities between this response and benign neoplasia suggest that conventional medical therapies will continue to be unsuccessful in preventing recurrent stenosis after percutaneous coronary revascularization. By preventing cell division after smooth muscle cell activation, antimitogenic therapy may inhibit the final common pathway in this complex chain of events and offset the apparent loss of local growth control. Colchicine, which causes metaphase arrest of cell division, has been shown in experimental studies to decrease the extent of atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the severity of arterial restenosis after balloon angioplasty. However, preliminary results from a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial suggest that low dose colchicine (0.6 mg twice a day orally) does not prevent restenosis. The use of more potent antineoplastic agents is limited by the potential for life-threatening side effects. It is possible that these adverse effects can be averted by using novel drug delivery systems to administer antimitogenic therapy locally at the site of arterial injury or by using low dose synergistic combinations of antiproliferative agents. This review examines the potential role of antimitogenic therapy in the prevention of restenosis after coronary interventions and considers the possibility of an overlap of the therapeutic realms of interventional cardiology and medical oncology. 
Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study. Final results BACKGROUND. Atrial fibrillation in the absence of rheumatic valvular disease is associated with a fivefold to sevenfold increased risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS. The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study, a multicenter, randomized trial, compared 325 mg/day aspirin (double-blind) or warfarin with placebo for prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (primary events), and included 1,330 inpatients and outpatients with constant or intermittent atrial fibrillation. During a mean follow-up of 1.3 years, the rate of primary events in patients assigned to placebo was 6.3% per year and was reduced by 42% in those assigned to aspirin (3.6% per year; p = 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 9-63%). In the subgroup of warfarin-eligible patients (most less than 76 years old), warfarin dose-adjusted to prolong prothrombin time to 1.3-fold to 1.8-fold that of control reduced the risk of primary events by 67% (warfarin versus placebo, 2.3% versus 7.4% per year; p = 0.01; 95% confidence interval, 27-85%). Primary events or death were reduced 58% (p = 0.01) by warfarin and 32% (p = 0.02) by aspirin. The risk of significant bleeding was 1.5%, 1.4%, and 1.6% per year in patients assigned to warfarin, aspirin, and placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Aspirin and warfarin are both effective in reducing ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Because warfarin-eligible patients composed a subset of all aspirin-eligible patients, the magnitude of reduction in events by warfarin versus aspirin cannot be compared. Too few events occurred in warfarin-eligible patients to directly assess the relative benefit of aspirin compared with warfarin, and the trial is continuing to address this issue. Patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation who can safely take either aspirin or warfarin should receive prophylactic antithrombotic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke. 
Evidence for a new tumor-suppressor gene involved in gastrointestinal malignancies. Inactivation or loss of tumor-suppressor genes is believed to lead to the development or progression of malignancies. To determine whether a tumor-suppressor gene is located on chromosome 8, DNA was extracted from tumor and normal tissue of colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic specimens, and allele loss was investigated by Southern hybridization techniques with the chromosome 8 probe D8S7. Twenty-five percent of pancreatic carcinomas, 50% of gastric carcinomas, and 50% of colorectal carcinomas were found to have lost an allele on chromosome 8. These findings suggest the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene on chromosome 8, which is involved in colorectal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, and pancreatic carcinoma. Definition of the frequency with which this tumor-suppressor gene is involved in gastrointestinal malignancies will await the study of many patients who are classified as informative and the use of multiple probes for chromosome 8. 
Urethrovaginal fistula repair with Martius labial fat pad graft. Most urethrovaginal fistulas are iatrogenic and, like other urinary fistulas, significantly reduce the quality of the affected individual's life. The Martius labial fat pad graft facilitates the urologic care of these women. 
Free and supported stance in Parkinson's disease. The effect of posture and 'postural set' on leg muscle responses to perturbation, and its relation to the severity of the disease. Upright stance and its reflex control were studied in parkinsonian patients and in age-matched normal subjects. They stood unperturbed on a force-measuring surface (static conditions), or were displaced by movement of a supporting platform (dynamic conditions). During quiet stance the following variables were analysed, with eyes open or closed: position of the centre of foot pressure (CFP), average sway area, length of sway path, amplitude and distribution of tonic leg muscle EMG activity. Perturbations of stance were induced by toe-up or toe-down rotations, and by backward or forward translations of the platform. Amplitude of short, medium and long-latency EMG responses to displacement were measured in the tibialis anterior (TA) and in the three heads of the triceps surae (TS) muscle. The perturbations were produced during both free and supported stance (holding onto a stable structure), under which condition normal subjects suppress medium and long-latency responses. Under static conditions, the only significant finding in parkinsonians was represented by a shift in the position of the CFP. This was correlated with the severity of the disease (Webster scale), the less affected patients being shifted backwards and the more affected patients forwards, with respect to normals. Under dynamic conditions, the reflex responses to perturbations of free stance were similar in both groups. Only the medium-latency burst of gastrocnemius lateralis and the long-latency burst TA evoked by TS stretch were larger in parkinsonians. The amplitude of these responses, as well as of all the others, was not related to the Webster score. Within the patients' group, a relationship between position of CFP and area of EMG burst was found for both medium and long-latency TA responses evoked by forward translation and toe-up rotation, respectively. Under supported conditions, the capability to suppress all medium and long-latency muscle responses to any perturbation was lost or impaired in the parkinsonians. The degree of impairment was unrelated to the position of the CFP, but was significantly related to the severity of the disease. The suppression to 40% (supported/nonsupported), of TA response to toe-down rotation is proposed as the point of separation between normals and parkinsonians. The forward projection of the CFP, occurring in the severe stages of the disease, and the increase in amplitude of some responses to perturbations of free stance might be a compensatory adaptation to the anomalous upright posture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
The differential effects of biofeedback in the treatment of menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of biofeedback training in the treatment of menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine. Accordingly, 39 female patients suffering from both migraine associated, and migraine not associated, with menstrual periods were drawn from a pool of research volunteers enrolled in a biofeedback treatment program for migraine headaches. All patients were required to complete 5 weeks of daily self-monitoring of headache and menstruation activity immediately before and after treatment, and again at 6-month follow-up. Within-subjects comparisons of the effects of biofeedback on menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine, and between-subjects comparisons of the effects of biofeedback on patients suffering predominantly from either menstrual or nonmenstrual migraine showed that biofeedback is just as effective in reducing menstrual migraine as it is in reducing nonmenstrual migraine. Questions as to whether or not these conclusions can apply to patients who experience migraine headaches only during, or shortly before or after, menstruation, are raised. 
Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid presenting as multifocal bronchial carcinoid tumour. A 21 year old man presented with diarrhoea and flushing after meals and later developed miliary shadowing on his chest radiograph. Multifocal bronchial carcinoid tumour was diagnosed initially, but at necropsy metastatic medullary carcinoma of the thyroid was found. Multifocal bronchial carcinoid tumour should not be accepted as a primary diagnosis without first excluding medullary carcinoma of the thyroid because of the need to screen relatives of affected patients. 
Descending thoracic aorta-splenic artery graft for occlusive disease of the celiac axis. A new procedure is presented for the restoration of normal blood flow to the celiac axis in cases of orifice lesions of the celiac artery. The operation consists of inserting a graft between the descending thoracic aorta end-to-side and the divided splenic artery end-to-end. 
Pseudohypacusis. This article provides the basis for the techniques and interpretation of audiologic tests useful in evaluation of the patient with pseudohypacusis. Differences between the childhood and adult forms of the problem are discussed. The indications for currently popular conventional and special tests are presented. These include both behavioral and electrophysiologic measures for assessing auditory function. 
The impact of ulcerogenic drugs on surgery for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. To investigate the impact of ulcerogenic drugs on surgery for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, we reviewed 150 surgical cases. Ulcerogenic drug use (steroids and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including aspirin) increased from 15% between 1972 and 1977 to 37% between 1983 and 1988. While there was no correlation between ulcerogenic drug use and hemorrhage, obstruction, or intractable pain, 16 (52%) of the 31 perforations and 26 (38%) of the 69 emergency operations were associated with use of ulcerogenic drugs. The overall mortality rate was 11%. Death was correlated with age greater than 65 years and emergency operation, but not with ulcerogenic drug use or other variables. Of 12 patients with histories of peptic ulcer disease who were treated with ulcerogenic drugs without concomitant antiulcer prophylaxis, 11 (92%) required emergency operation to treat perforation or massive hemorrhage. Standard antiulcer medications or misoprostol should be prescribed to elderly patients and to those with histories of ulcers who require ulcerogenic drug therapy. 
Cardiac disturbances during the administration of taxol. The clinical development of taxol, a new antimicrotubule agent with a unique mechanism of cytotoxic action, has proceeded slowly due to serious hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) and shortages in its supply. Nevertheless, large-scale phase II trials have been initiated as taxol has recently demonstrated impressive activity in advanced and cisplatin-refractory ovarian carcinoma. Furthermore, the incidence of HSRs has been reduced substantially with premedications and modifications in the administration schedule. However, various manifestations of potential cardiotoxicity have been observed in several patients who participated in four phase I and II studies of taxol. Asymptomatic bradycardia has occurred in a high proportion of patients, including 29% of ovarian cancer patients who were treated with maximally tolerated doses of taxol in a phase II study. More profound cardiac disturbances, including a range of atrioventricular conduction blocks, left bundle branch block, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and manifestations of cardiac ischemia, have been observed in seven of 140 patients (5%) who received taxol. Descriptions of these events are presented in this report to alert investigators to the potential for these adverse effects. Although these disturbances did not result in serious sequelae in most patients, investigators should continue to maintain a high degree of caution until precise risk factors, frequency, and clinical significance of these adverse cardiac effects are determined. 
Application of intermediate biomarkers to studies of cancer prevention in the gastrointestinal tract: introduction and perspective. In this article, abnormalities in the proliferation and differentiation of gastrointestinal cells are described in diseases that increase predisposition to gastrointestinal cancer. Recent findings related to the effects of calcium on gastrointestinal cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumor occurrence in rodent models and in human subjects are summarized. 
Usefulness of esmolol in unstable angina pectoris. European Esmolol Study Group. Esmolol is a new cardioselective beta blocker with unique pharmacokinetic properties resulting in a half-life of only 9 minutes. The present multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined the hemodynamic and antiischemic effects of this compound given as an adjunctive to conventional medical therapy in 113 patients with unstable angina. Fifty-nine patients received esmolol and 54 received matching placebo infusions. Esmolol was titrated in a step-wise manner at dosages of 2 to 24 mg/min until a 25% reduction in the double product was achieved; thereafter, esmolol was continuously infused for up to 72 hours. Esmolol caused a significant and persistent decline in heart rate and blood pressure throughout the entire study period. Clinical events, such as development of acute myocardial infarction or the need for urgent revascularization, occurred in 3 esmolol compared with 9 placebo patients (p = 0.06). There was also a trend toward reduction of silent ischemia as judged by Holter monitoring (mean [+/- standard deviation] duration/patient/24 hours, 21 +/- 81 minutes in the esmolol and 35 +/- 128 minutes in the placebo groups). Esmolol-related adverse effects were mostly cardiovascular in origin and could be managed promptly by downward dose titration or cessation of drug infusion. Thus, esmolol appears to be a safe and effective drug for patients with unstable angina because it permits a large degree of flexibility in adapting the desired level of beta blockade to the patient's changing clinical presentation. 
Allopurinol pretreatment improves evoked response recovery following global cerebral ischemia in dogs. The reperfusion of previously ischemic tissue may lead to the formation of highly reactive free radicals that promote tissue injury. Xanthine oxidase has been implicated as one source of these free radicals. We examined the role of xanthine oxidase in brain injury using a cerebrospinal fluid compression model of global cerebral ischemia with 15 minutes of ischemia and 4 hours of reperfusion. Seven dogs were pretreated with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol (50 mg/kg for 5 days). Neurophysiological recovery was monitored with cortical somatosensory evoked potentials. As an attempt to correlate brain recovery with the mechanism of protection, free brain malondialdehyde was measured at the end of reperfusion by high-performance liquid chromatography. Brain water content was measured by wet-dry weights. Compared with seven untreated control dogs, allopurinol pretreatment significantly improved recovery of somatosensory evoked potentials after 4 hours of reperfusion. However, the amount of free malondialdehyde in the allopurinol-treated dogs was 32% greater than that in the controls. Brain water content was similar in the two groups. These results suggest that xanthine oxidase contributes to brain injury after ischemia and reperfusion. However, tissue damage caused by xanthine oxidase may be mediated through mechanisms other than free radical production. 
The mechanisms and prevention of intravascular fluid loss after occlusion of the supraceliac aorta in dogs. Mechanisms of intravascular fluid depletion after temporary occlusion of the supraceliac aorta were investigated in a canine model. During ischemia and reperfusion, hemodynamic parameters, superior mesenteric artery flow, intestinal mucosal perfusion, and mucosal permeability were monitored. After 12 hours of reperfusion, the volumes of intravenous electrolyte fluid required to maintain hemodynamic stability and fluid lost into the gastrointestinal tract and peritoneal cavity were measured. The distribution of total body water was analyzed by use of radionuclide dilution techniques. Group A animals underwent laparotomy only, group B had the supraceliac aorta occluded for 45 minutes, group C had superoxide dismutase administered after 45 minutes of aortic occlusion, and group D animals were exposed to mild hypothermia during a similar ischemia and reperfusion period. No significant difference was found in mean superior mesenteric artery flow or mucosal perfusion during ischemia among groups B, C, and D. During reperfusion superior mesenteric artery flow returned to values similar to control in all groups. Aortic occlusion increased mucosal permeability most significantly in group B (p less than 0.01). Mean intravenous fluid requirements (ml/mg) were the following: group A, 80 +/- 5; group B, 201 +/- 9 (p less than 0.01); group C, 116 +/- 7 (p less than 0.05); group D, 245 +/- 24 (p less than 0.05). Mean gastrointestinal fluid loss was highest in the hypothermic group and smallest if superoxide dismutase was given. Mean intracellular fluid volume was increased in groups B and D compared with group A (p less than 0.01). 
Reperitonealization of the lesser curve in proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulcer. Ninety-six consecutive patients were operated upon with proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulcer at our department during the two year period 1976 to 1978. These patients were prospectively randomized into two groups, one of which (45 patients) had reperitonealization of the lesser curve. These two groups are compared herein. Reperitonealization of the lesser curve was without benefit on long term clinical results, ulcer recurrence rate and gastric acid secretion. None of the patients had perforation of the lesser curve. 
Reversible thyroid dysfunction during treatment with GM-CSF. To investigate whether autoimmunity against thyroid antigens is induced or exacerbated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies were studied in 14 patients with advanced breast cancer and 11 with soft-tissue sarcoma who received several cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide plus GM-CSF 250 micrograms/m2 intravenously daily for 10 days in every 21 day cycle. All patients had normal thyroid function before treatment. In 2 patients with pre-existing thyroid antibodies, thyroid dysfunction developed but disappeared after cessation of GM-CSF. No other autoimmune abnormalities appeared. Stimulation of antigen-presenting cells by GM-CSF may bring about this phenomenon. 
Neutrophil chemotaxis in gastric mucosa. A signal-to-response comparison. This prospective study compares levels of neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) in gastric juice to the neutrophil count in gastric biopsies. Sixty-three male patients enrolled in the study and had antral biopsies following collection of gastric juice during esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Biopsies were examined for the magnitude of gastritis, tissue PMN count, and presence of Helicobacter pylori. Secretions were assayed for neutrophil chemotactic activity. Results show an increase in NCA and in tissue PMN counts with increasing severity of gastritis. H. pylori-positive patients had higher levels of NCA and PMN than H. pylori-negative patients. Wide variability in NCA levels preclude a direct correlation between NCA and PMN counts. 
The Sugiura procedure for patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis. The Sugiura procedure (SP) was performed upon 27 patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (EPVT) without associated hepatic disease. There were 14 female and 13 male patients. The mean age was 28 +/- 14 years. The causes of EPVT were protein C deficiency in two; antithrombin III deficiency in one patient, a history of omphalitis in two patients, a history of pancreatitis in one patient and idiopathy in 21 patients. The SP was completed in two surgical stages in 14 patients and in one stage in nine. There was one operative death. One patient had mild postoperative encephalopathy, and two patients rebled at long term follow-up study. Actuarial survival rate was 82 per cent at five and ten years. It is concluded that the SP is a good alternative for the management of hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to EPVT. 
Early and late geometric changes after carotid endarterectomy patch reconstruction. This study examines the degree and location of vessel wall geometric changes after carotid endarterectomy-vein patch reconstruction. The external diameters of the proximal common carotid, common carotid bulb, and internal carotid arteries were measured during operation with a caliper after 349 carotid endarterectomies. There were 309 saphenous vein reconstructions, 31 synthetic patch reconstructions, and 9 primary closures. One or more B-mode ultrasound studies with cross-sectional views for common and internal carotid cursor measurements were performed from 3 months to 5 years after operation. The intraoperative-to-postoperative common carotid diameters were unchanged for the three types of reconstructions. The internal carotid diameters increased 20% to 30% for both the vein and synthetic patched arteries. This dilation was present at 3 and 6 months and progressed slightly over 5 years. Wall thickening greater than or equal to 1 mm was present in 62% of the carotid endarterectomies, with concentric stenosis in 3% and eccentric stenosis in 59%. Eccentric stenosis was present at 3 to 6 months, located on the endarterectomized posterior-medial wall of the common and internal carotid arteries, was always less than 50%, and changed very little over 5 years. No aneurysms or internal carotid occlusions were identified. Carotid endarterectomy-vein patch reconstruction results in early, mild, nonaneurysmal dilation of the internal carotid patched segment, frequent mild eccentric restenosis, and rare hemodynamically significant concentric restenosis. 
Parkinson's disease rigidity: magnetic motor evoked potentials in a small hand muscle. We studied the EMG potentials evoked in the bilateral first dorsal interosseus muscle by electromagnetic stimulation of the corticomotoneuronal descending system in 10 Parkinson's disease patients and in 10 age- and sex-matched normal controls. We selected patients who did not have tremor but had predominant rigidity with asymmetric body involvement. On the rigid side of the PD patients, the threshold to cortical stimulation was lower than on the contralateral side or than normal values. On average, patients had normal central conduction times, but their motor evoked potentials (MEPs) on the rigid side were larger than those of controls when the cortical stimulus was at rest or during slight tonic contraction of the target muscle. In the latter condition, a silent period shorter than that of controls followed MEPs, whereas the peripheral silent period following ulnar nerve stimulation at the wrist was prolonged. Alpha motor neuron excitability, tested by the F-wave method, was enhanced on the rigid side at rest. In rigidity, spinal motor nuclei may be more responsive than normal to descending inputs from motor cortex, or the entire corticomotoneuron system may prove hyperexcitable under given conditions. 
A case of extragenital choriocarcinoma in the jejunum. A case of extragenital choriocarcinoma which produces human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in the small intestine of a 48-yr-old Japanese women is reported. Only seven such cases have been reported. The patient complained of postprandial upper abdominal pain and vomiting of 5 months' duration. Nine years before, right upper lobectomy was performed because of lung undifferentiated carcinoma. Double-contrast examination of the small intestine showed irregular ulceration in the lower jejunum. Celiac angiography demonstrated a hypervascular tumor stain in the branch of the jejunal artery. The serum HCG level was elevated. Gynecological examination revealed nothing abnormal. A small intestinal neoplasm was diagnosed, and a partial resection of the jejunum was performed. Endoscopy on the operating table showed a large, irregularly shaped sessile ulcer. Histologically the tumor was diagnosed as choriocarcinoma, composed of syncytiotrophoblastic cells and cytotrophoblastic cells. Immunohistochemical staining for HCG was positive. No metastasis was present. Although extragenital choriocarcinoma in the small intestine is rare, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of small intestinal neoplasm. 
Non-neoplastic pineal cysts. We identified 53 patients with non-neoplastic cysts of the pineal gland. In contrast to patients with pineal neoplasms, pineal cysts are usually asymptomatic. They infrequently obstruct the aqueduct to cause hydrocephalus or compress the tectum to produce the neuro-ophthalmologic signs of dorsal midbrain dysfunction. Obstructive hydrocephalus was present in only five patients (9.4%); three of them showed clinical signs of Parinaud's syndrome. CT and MRI typically reveal a cystic mass that averages 1.6 cm in anteroposterior (A-P) diameter with calcification at the periphery and faint rim-like contrast enhancement. Sagittal MRI is the most useful diagnostic test because it shows the anatomic relationship of the cyst to the aqueduct. The mass may compress the tectum and distort the proximal aqueduct; occasionally a large cyst may occlude the aqueduct. All patients with obstructive hydrocephalus had cysts greater than 2.0 cm in A-P diameter. Nine patients had suboccipital craniotomy. In all of them, the cysts contained clear fluid and were easily removed. We advocate conservative management with clinical observation of these benign lesions that may be developmental variants of normal pineal gland. 
Superior vena cava occlusion in a patient with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. A 55-year-old woman with a lupus like disease, associated with the lupus anticoagulant, was admitted because of facial edema. Her facial swelling was previously attributed to the steroids she had been taking and they were tapered without improvement. Laboratory tests revealed high titers of anticardiolipin antibodies. Computerized tomography of her chest and Doppler ultrasound examination of her neck veins demonstrated a thrombus in the superior vena cava. She was treated with heparin and was maintained with longterm warfarin therapy with uneventful followup. Superior vena cava obstruction should be added to the long list of thromboembolic complications of the antiphospholipid syndrome. 
Barrett's mucosa in conjunction with squamous carcinoma of the esophagus. Fifty esophagectomies (32 specimens with squamous cell carcinoma and 18 with adenocarcinoma) were reviewed for the presence of Barrett's mucosa. The whole resected specimens were cut, and a total of 1677 blocks (measuring up to 4.0 x 0.5 cm) were obtained. In resections with squamous cell carcinoma, a mean of 33.6 sections (range, 16 to 55 sections) were excised, and in those with adenocarcinomas, a mean of 33.4 sections (range, ten to 60 sections) were cut. Barrett's mucosa (without or with dysplasia) was present in all 18 specimens with an adenocarcinoma (100%) and in 13 of the 32 specimens (40.6%) with squamous cell carcinoma. In ten of the 13 specimens with squamous cell carcinoma, adjacent areas with high-grade squamous cell dysplasia were found. The squamous cell carcinoma and/or the adjacent squamous cell dysplasia were found separated from the Barrett's mucosa by normal squamous epithelium, supporting the view that these two lesions are not related to one another. Early clinical and experimental data showed that squamous cell dysplasia antedated the development of squamous cell carcinoma in that organ. One possible suggestive of these findings is that the detection of a Barrett's esophagus (without or with dysplasia) should prompt the endoscopist also to examine carefully the rest of the esophagus to exclude mucosal alterations possibly connected with squamous cell carcinogenesis in that organ. 
Intractable ulcerating enterocolitis of infancy. Five children (three boys, two girls) presenting in the first year of life with intractable diarrhoea had a number of features in common. All had ulcerating stomatitis, four had partial villous atrophy on small intestinal biopsy, all had colitis characterised by large ulcers with overhanging edges, and four had severe perianal disease; no stool pathogens were detected. Treatment with steroids, sulphasalazine, and azathioprine was unsuccessful. All five required subtotal colectomy. Four were children of consanguinous marriages, two were siblings of Pakistani origin, two were cousins of Arab origin, and the fifth was Portuguese. Although the diagnoses of Behcet's disease and Crohn's disease were considered, it appears that these children represent a distinct inherited condition affecting the whole gastrointestinal tract, particularly the colon. 
Efficacy of gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for differentiation between superficial and muscle-invasive tumor of the bladder: a comparative study with computerized tomography and transurethral ultrasonography. Gadolinium-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was evaluated in an effort to clarify whether MRI could replace or be proved to be superior to computerized tomography (CT) and/or transurethral ultrasonography. A total of 57 bladder cancer patients was evaluated. MRI was performed with a superconducting magnet operating at 1.5 Tesla. The images acquired were multisections, having a fast spin-echo pulse sequence of less than a 14-second breath holding. Serial scans were performed before and immediately after Gd-DTPA venous injection. The findings on different imaging techniques were compared with the histological stagings. A proper diagnosis was made in 42 of 57 cases (73.7%) by Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI, in 27 of 57 (47.4%) by CT and in 31 of 57 (54.4%) by transurethral ultrasonography when comparing the histological findings. The sensitivity and specificity for differentiating superficial and muscle-invasive tumor of each imaging method were, respectively, 96.2 and 83.3% in Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI, 96.0 and 58.3% in CT, and 88.0 and 66.7% in transurethral ultrasonography. These data suggest that the staging of bladder cancer by Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI appears to be superior and more accurate than the staging obtained by CT and transurethral ultrasonography. 
A prospective study to evaluate the dose of vitamin D required to correct low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase in patients at risk of developing antiepileptic drug-induced osteomalacia. The dose of vitamin D3 required to maintain normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in epileptic patients was evaluated in a prospective study. Patients were divided into two groups, comprising 14 institutionalized and 18 non-institutionalized subjects; they were taking carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbitone, alone or in combination. The study was divided into a dose titration stage and a further period of assessment on a fixed dose after attainment of normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Seventeen of the 18 non-institutionalized patients achieved normal levels over a period of 12 months; the remaining patient became normal after 15 months. The dose required to achieve normal levels ranged from 400 to 4000 IU/day; three patients required less than 2400 IU vitamin D3, 12 required 2400 IU and three required greater than 2400 IU. All institutionalized patients achieved normal levels over a period of 12 months; six patients required less than 2400 IU, six required 2400 IU and two required greater than 2400 IU vitamin D3. Raised alkaline phosphatase levels occurred in 11 patients, and reverted to normal in six patients during the initial return of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to normal. During the second 12 months, when patients were taking a fixed dose of vitamin D3, alkaline phosphatase increased in five patients who had achieved normal levels. During this phase normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not maintained in five patients. There was a significant seasonal variation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels institutionalized patients, being highest in June and lowest in December. Our findings show that while there was a wide range in the dose required to achieve normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels--between 400 and 4000 IU/day--78 per cent of patients responded to a dose of 2400 IU/day. 
Effects on quality of life with comprehensive rehabilitation after acute myocardial infarction. This investigation was designed to determine the impact of a brief period of cardiac rehabilitation, initiated within 6 weeks of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), on both disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life, exercise tolerance and return to work after AMI. With a stratified, parallel group design, 201 low-risk patients with evidence of depression or anxiety, or both, after AMI, were randomized to either an 8-week program of exercise conditioning and behavioral counseling or to conventional care. Although the differences were small, significantly greater improvement was seen in rehabilitation group patients at 8 weeks in the emotions dimension of a new disease-specific, health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire, in their state of anxiety and in exercise tolerance. All measures of health-related quality of life in both groups improved significantly over the 12-month follow-up period. However, the 95% confidence intervals around differences between groups at the 12-month follow-up effectively excluded sustained, clinically important benefits of rehabilitation in disease-specific (limitations, -2.70, 1.40; emotions, -4.86, 1.10, where negative values favor conventional care and positive values favor rehabilitation) and generic health-related quality of life (time trade-off, -0.062, 0.052; quality of well-being, -0.042, 0.035) or in exercise tolerance (-38.5, 52.1 kpm/min); also, return to work was similar in the 2 groups (relative risk, 0.93; confidence interval, 0.71, 1.64). 
Prediction of uneventful cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm from direct-current electrical cardioversion of chronic atrial fibrillation and flutter. The present study was undertaken to reassess prospectively the immediate and long-term results of direct-current electrical cardioversion in chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and to determine factors predicting clinical outcome of the arrhythmia after direct-current cardioversion. Two-hundred forty-six patients underwent direct-current electrical cardioversion and were followed during a mean of 260 days. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors predicting short- and long-term arrhythmia outcome. Cardioversion was achieved in 70% of patients with atrial fibrillation and in 96% of patients with atrial flutter. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that arrhythmia duration (p less than 0.001), type of arrhythmia (fibrillation vs flutter, p less than 0.02) and age (p less than 0.05) independently influenced conversion rate. On an actuarial basis, 42 and 36% of patients remained in sinus rhythm during 1 and 2 years, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the type of arrhythmia (p = 0.0008), low precardioversion functional class (p = 0.002) and the presence of nonrheumatic mitral valve disease (p = 0.03) independently increased the length of the arrhythmia-free episode. Rheumatic heart disease shortened this period (p = 0.03). In conclusion, patients having a high probability of conversion together with a prolonged post-shock arrhythmia-free episode can be identified. This may improve the cost-benefit ratio of cardioversion. 
Recurrent abdominal pain due to chronic appendiceal disease. Recurrent appendicitis and chronic appendicitis are the subjects of much controversy, but long-standing inflammation of the appendix and surrounding tissues has been reported in rare instances. We have described two patients, both with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, who subsequently were shown to have chronic appendiceal disease. Appendiceal disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with recurrent abdominal pain. 
Epilepsy: disappearing lesions appearing in the United Kingdom OBJECTIVE--Investigation of spontaneously resolving lesions associated with epilepsy. DESIGN--Observational study during one year. SETTING--One neurology department. PATIENTS--4 cases in patients (one of Indian parents, one African, one white English, and one Afro-Caribbean) resident in the United Kingdom, who presented with transient epilepsy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Findings on computed tomography and on screening for infections. RESULTS--In all four cases a small mass lesion in one cerebral hemisphere was observed on computed tomography, which resolved after 9, 4, 3 and 1.5 months respectively without surgery. CONCLUSIONS--The number of cases seen in one year suggests that the lesions may be more common in the United Kingdom than previously recognised and that research into their cause is warranted. 
Effect of beta-blockers on exercise physiology: implications for exercise training. We conducted a series of studies aimed at investigating the effect of beta-blockers on exercise physiology. On the basis of these and other existing studies, it is possible to draw the following conclusions and to make the following tentative recommendations for patients engaged in exercise training who receive beta-blocker therapy: i) CAD patients treated with beta-blockers are capable of deriving the expected enhancement of cardiorespiratory fitness during training, irrespective of the type of drug used; ii) beta1-selective blockers are preferable to nonselective agents for hypertensive patients engaged in exercise training; iii) because beta1-selective blockers impair exercise tolerance in some hypertensive patients, physicians should look out for this adverse reaction and, if present, consider alternative antihypertensive therapy; iv) intrinsic sympathomimetic activity confers no advantage during exercise training; v) exercise intensity prescription for patients receiving beta-blockers should be in accordance with traditional guidelines and based on results of individualized exercise testing performed on medication; vi) exercise training is desirable during beta-blocker therapy in that it appears to offset adverse alterations in lipoprotein metabolism; and vii) nonselective beta-blockers may increase predisposition to exertional hyperthermia, and patients must therefore be encouraged to adhere strictly to accepted guidelines for heat injury prevention. 
Classification and natural history of clinically identifiable subtypes of cerebral infarction. We describe the incidence and natural history of four clinically identifiable subgroups of cerebral infarction in a community-based study of 675 patients with first-ever stroke. Of 543 patients with a cerebral infarct, 92 (17%) had large anterior circulation infarcts with both cortical and subcortical involvement (total anterior circulation infarcts, TACI); 185 (34%) had more restricted and predominantly cortical infarcts (partial anterior circulation infarcts, PACI); 129 (24%) had infarcts clearly associated with the vertebrobasilar arterial territory (posterior circulation infarcts, POCI); and 137 (25%) had infarcts confined to the territory of the deep perforating arteries (lacunar infarcts, LACI). There were striking differences in natural history between the groups. The TACI group had a negligible chance of good functional outcome and mortality was high. More than twice as many deaths were due to the complications of immobility than to direct neurological sequelae of the infarct. Patients in the PACI group were much more likely to have an early recurrent stroke than were patients in other groups. Those in the POCI group were at greater risk of a recurrent stroke later in the first year after the index event but had the best chance of a good functional outcome. Despite the small anatomical size of the infarcts in the LACI group, many patients remained substantially handicapped. The findings have important implications for the planning of stroke treatment trials and suggest that various therapies could be directed specifically at the subgroups. 
Choleriform syndrome and production of labile enterotoxin (CT/LT1)-like antigen by species of Salmonella infantis and Salmonella haardt isolated from the same patient. Isolates of Salmonella infantis from the stool and blood and an isolate of Salmonella haardt from the stool of a patient with choleriform diarrhea produced labile enterotoxin (CT/LT1)-like antigen. Genetic and molecular experiments indicated that the production of CT/LT1-like antigen was chromosomally encoded. 
Transethmoid decompression of the optic nerve in head injuries: an update. Sixty-three patients with loss of vision following head injury were subjected to decompression of the optic nerve by the transethmoid route. This paper discusses the criteria for selection of patients for surgery, the results of the operation and the prognostic factors determining the results. 
CA 125 regression: a model for epithelial ovarian cancer response. The rate of decline of CA 125 in effectively treated epithelial ovarian cancer is described by the exponential regression curve CA 125 = EXP [i - s (days after surgery)]. In this equation i, the y-axis intercept, measures initial tumor burden whereas s, the slope of the regression curve, is determined by the extent of cytoreductive surgery and the subsequent response to chemotherapy. Departure from the regression curve uniformly results in progressive disease. In patients whose cancers had been completely removed, we calculated the mean half-life of CA 125 to be 10.4 days (range 4 to 21). In this case s = 0.0835 and characterizes the ideal regression rate. The model predicts that high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy (s = 0.0671) is more effective than low-dose cisplatin (s = 0.0380) (p less than 0.03) in eliminating residual cancer. Because s can be calculated within 2 to 3 months of treatment and then compared with s for the ideal regression curve and with the values of s reported for standard chemotherapy, evaluation of any new treatment protocol can be facilitated with this method. 
A randomized controlled trial of adjuvant immunotherapy (murine monoclonal antibody 494/32) in resectable pancreatic cancer. In a prospective randomized multicentric trial, 61 patients from six hospitals with resectable pancreatic cancer were recruited between 1987 and 1989. All patients underwent a Whipple resection. Two weeks after surgery, the patients were randomized to be given either intravenous (IV) treatment with 370 mg (100 mg loading dose, 9 x 30 mg continuing within 10 days) of monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 494/32 (Behringwerke AG, Marsburg, Germany) or no additional anti-cancer treatment. This murine immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody has been shown to strongly bind to human pancreatic cancer cells and to induce an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Both study groups were well matched with respect to age, sex, tumor staging, and grading. Six patients suffered from minor toxicity (vomiting and abdominal pain) after immunotherapy. Ten months after the end of the recruitment period, 65% and 53% of the patients in the treatment and control groups, respectively, had died. Of the living patients, 60% and 53% are alive with recurrent or progressive cancer disease. Median survival time was 428 days (range, 248 to 510 days) and 386 days (range, 296 to 509 days) in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The authors concluded that repeated IV treatment with the antibody 494/32 is not helpful in resectable pancreatic cancer. This study provides the first controlled data on passive immunotherapy in solid cancer. 
Immunohistochemical study of thyroid peroxidase in normal, hyperplastic, and neoplastic human thyroid tissues. An immunohistochemical study using two monoclonal antibodies (MoAb 30 and MoAb 47) against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) was performed on surgical specimens of human thyroid carcinoma (n = 65), adenoma (n = 70) and Graves' disease (n = 10). Normal adjacent thyroid tissue was used as positive control. Monoclonal antibody 30 reacted significantly with all adenoma and most carcinoma, whereas MoAb 47 reacted with 66 adenoma but only two carcinoma. Of the four adenomas that did not react with MoAb 47, three were of the fetal type. Both carcinoma reacting with MoAb 47 were of the well-differentiated follicular type. These findings further confirm the hypothesis that thyroid carcinoma is associated with changes in the quantity and antigenic properties of TPO. Although the alterations in antigenic behavior revealed by MoAb 47 are not 100% specific, they may allow more accurate diagnosis of malignancy in thyroid tumors. 
Time course of intracellular edema and epileptiform activity following prenatal cerebral ischemia in sheep. The role of edema in the pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic injury in the immature brain is controversial. We studied 15 chronically instrumented fetal sheep following transient cerebral ischemia, to estimate changes in extracellular space using an impedance technique, to quantify the electroencephalogram with real-time spectral analysis, and to assess histologic outcome 3 days after the insult. These measurements were made in the parasagittal cortex. There was a rapid loss of extracellular space from 5 +/- 2 minutes after the onset of ischemia. Following 10 minutes of ischemia (n = 7) the intracellular edema peaked but then quickly resolved (6 +/- 4 minutes), and mild selective neuronal loss was seen. In contrast, the swelling was biphasic after 30-40 minutes of ischemia (n = 8). The early edema resolved slowly (28 +/- 12 minutes) but incompletely, and secondary swelling began at 7 +/- 2 hours and peaked at 28 +/- 6 hours. The early swelling was the more severe. Postinsult epileptiform activity began at 8 +/- 2 hours and peaked at 10 +/- 3 hours; later there was laminar necrosis of the underlying cortex. The secondary decrease of extracellular space indicates that a progressive loss of membrane function started with the onset of postischemic epileptiform activity. The increased metabolic load of the epileptiform activity may have worsened this delayed deterioration. 
Thermal ablation of the gallbladder. Gallbladder ablation by means of injection of hot contrast medium was attempted in 13 dogs. Room temperature contrast medium was injected into the gallbladders of two additional dogs (controls). After midline laparotomy was performed to expose the gallbladder, temperature probes were placed in the liver adjacent to the gallbladder, and on the surface and in the lumen of the gallbladder. A 7-F catheter with multiple side holes was placed into the gallbladder. The cystic duct was clamped during the procedure. After injection of boiling contrast medium, the mean temperature in the gallbladder lumen was 80 degrees C; in the adjacent liver, 43.5 degrees C; and on the gallbladder surface, 45.8 degrees C. After the procedure, the cystic duct was unclamped, temperature probes and catheter were removed, and the laparotomy was closed in standard fashion. In the hot contrast medium group, one dog each was sacrificed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and at 6 months. Six animals were sacrificed at 1 year. The gallbladder was completely ablated in 11 of 13 animals in the hot contrast medium group. One dog was sacrificed at 8 days because of bile leakage, and another was sacrificed at 17 days because of gallbladder rupture. The two control animals were sacrificed at 12 and 13 weeks, and their gallbladders were normal at that time. 
Hypnotically induced auditory hallucinations and the mouth-opening maneuver: a failure to duplicate findings. OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to replicate the part of a study by Bick and Kinsbourne in which hypnotically induced auditory hallucinations in normal volunteer subjects were abolished by requiring the subjects to open their mouths. METHODS: Sixty-four normal volunteer subjects were hypnotized, and an attempt was made to induce auditory hallucinations. The subjects in whom hallucinations were successfully induced were then asked to perform the mouth-opening maneuver and the control maneuvers of putting their fingers in their ears or squeezing their eyes shut in an effort to end the hallucinations. RESULTS: Sixteen subjects reported having hallucinations. None of them reported that a hallucination was abolished by opening the mouth or closing the eye; four reported ending hallucinations by putting their fingers in their ears. CONCLUSIONS: Opening the mouth does not affect auditory hallucinations induced by hypnosis in normal persons. The most likely reason for the discrepancy between the results of this experiment and those of the Bick and Kinsbourne study is that the design of the latter study was faulty because it permitted demand characteristics to influence the results. 
Evaluation, treatment, and follow-up results of post polio patients with dysphagia. Twenty consecutive patients were evaluated for reports of dysphagia from post-polio clinics. Only half the patients reported a history of swallowing problems at the time of their acute poliomyelitis. Each patient received a videofluorographic evaluation of the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, and then was provided with recommendations to improve swallowing skills. A follow-up questionnaire was sent to all patients. The respondents had an average interval of 12 months since the initial evaluation. Of the 18 patients responding to the questionnaire, 14 (77%) reported regular use of the swallowing suggestions. Comparison of pre-evaluation results to followup of the 18 respondents yielded a statistically significant decline in the frequency of choking (p = 0.0156) and food sticking in the throat (p = 0.0195). We conclude that a dysphagia program can result in significant improvement of the swallowing symptoms reported with the post-polio population. 
Altered noradrenergic projection to hypothalamus via baroreflex in spontaneously hypertensive rats. To determine whether noradrenergic projections to the posterior hypothalamus via baroreflex are altered in the hypertensive state, the extracellular norepinephrine (NE) content of the posterior hypothalamus was measured in both spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) after sinoaortic denervation (SAD) or sham operation. In WKY, blood pressure (BP) and extracellular NE content 24 h after SAD were significantly higher than those of sham-operated rats. Contrarily, SAD did not increase both BP and NE in the posterior hypothalamus of SHR. These results suggest that the noradrenergic pathway via the baroreflex is impaired in SHR. This mechanism may play an important role in the development and maintenance of hypertension in SHR. 
Characteristics of left ventricular filling in coronary artery disease and myocardial ischaemia after dipyridamole provocation. Doppler echocardiographic measurement of transmitral filling velocities seems to be a sensitive marker for resting left ventricular diastolic abnormalities in patients with coronary artery disease. The behaviour of these filling velocities during induced myocardial ischaemia, however, has not been fully studied. Left ventricular filling was assessed by pulsed Doppler ultrasound in 21 patients with angina pectoris and coronary artery disease and in five controls (patients with chest pain but without myocardial ischaemia). High dose dipyridamole infusion (0.9 mg/kg over 10 minutes) was used to provoke myocardial ischaemia, which was assessed by symptoms and electrocardiographic ST segment change. Doppler indices of diastolic filling were measured and the results expressed as percentage change from baseline values. Dipyridamole increased the heart rate and reduced systolic blood pressure equally in both groups. In the controls dipyridamole increased the peak filling velocities of both the early and atrial filling waves. In the 12 patients with coronary artery disease who did not develop evidence of myocardial ischaemia, the effect on left ventricular filling velocity resembled that in the controls though the time to peak change was delayed. Six of the nine patients with dipyridamole induced myocardial ischaemia had a significantly reduced maximum changes in early (+30% v +18%) and atrial (-0.2% v +33%) filling velocities compared with the controls. The remaining three patients had a decrease in early filling velocity (-20%) with an associated increase in atrial peak filling velocity (+21%). Dipyridamole increased diastolic filling velocities in the controls. In patients with coronary artery disease there was a variable change in diastolic filling indices which may be attributed either to the degree of myocardial ischaemia or to the different haemodynamic changes occurring during myocardial ischaemia. 
Fine needle aspiration biopsy of superficial masses in children. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is an underused diagnostic procedure in children, particularly in the evaluation of superficial masses. A total of 54 FNABs of superficial masses were performed in children aged 1 month to 15 years. Adequate material for diagnosis was obtained in 50 attempts. The cytologic diagnosis increased clinical understanding and provided a guide for treatment in 46 of the 50 cases. The cytologic diagnosis was confirmed in 15 of 19 patients who underwent an operation. Surgical intervention was obviated in 31 patients. There was one false-positive diagnosis of cancer. We describe the role of FNAB in children and its technique, accuracy, and diagnostic problems. 
A meta-analysis of prophylactic antibiotics in head and neck surgery. Although it is generally agreed that prophylactic antibiotics are necessary for the prevention of postoperative wound infection, the choice of antibiotic regimen is controversial. In an attempt to determine the most effective antibiotic regimen, a meta-analysis of published clinical trials of prophylactic antibiotics for head and neck surgery was undertaken. The meta-analysis revealed a relative difference in infection rates of 43.7 percent in favor of the use of antibiotics versus placebo, of 8.3 percent in favor of multiple antibiotics versus a single antibiotic, of 13.7 percent in favor of multiple antibiotics versus cefazolin, and of 4.1 percent in favor of multiple-day prophylaxis versus single-day prophylaxis. This meta-analysis suggests that a 1-day course of clindamycin may be the most effective prophylactic antibiotic regimen for head and neck surgery. 
Nonpalpable invasive breast cancer. The use of mammography has resulted in 1464 breast biopsies for nonpalpable abnormalities at the University of Virginia in the 10 years 1980 to 1989. Two hundred sixty-four cancerous lesions (18%) were found. One hundred seventy-eight of these (67%) were in situ lesions. Invasive cancer (86 of 264 lesions or 33%) forms the basis for this report. Mammographic findings leading to biopsy were a mass in 61 of 86 cases (71%), microcalcifications in 23 of 86 (27%), or both in 2 of 86 cases. Histologic subtypes were infiltrating ductal (63 of 86), infiltrating lobular (14 of 86), and other infiltrating (9 of 86). Mastectomy was performed in 71 of 86 lesions (82%), lumpectomy/radiation in 14 of 86 (16%), and lumpectomy alone in 1 of 86 lesions. Division of the tumors into size with nodal status revealed 19 of 86 lesions (22%) less than 0.5 cm with 0 of 14 positive nodes. Thirty-nine of eighty-six lesions (46%) measured 0.6 to 1.0 cm with 10 (26%) positive nodes. Twenty-eight of eighty-six lesions (32%) measured more than 1.0 cm with 8 of 28 (28%) positive nodes. Nodal status is unknown for eight patients. Overall 18 of 78 lesions (23%) had positive nodes. Median follow-up is 44 months. Disease-free survival rate is 92% (79 of 86 patients) and overall survival rate is 94% (81 of 86 patients). Six of seven recurrences occurred in node-positive patients. For those with negative or unknown nodes, the disease-free survival rate is 98% (67 of 68 patients). These findings emphasize the benefit of early detection of breast cancer through the use of mammography. 
Volume tests for chronic venous insufficiency: an appraisal. Chronic venous disease is increasingly treated surgically with a variety of experimental procedures. Noninvasive volume tests are commonly used before surgery to select patients and after surgery to assess results. Rapid volume changes are considered to indicate regurgitation. Rigorous statistical validation of tests and the confounding nature of unmeasured arterial inflow are seldom considered. Volume changes were measured in 29 control limbs and 35 limbs with venous disease, with mercury-in-silicone rubber strain gauges, for both exercise and elevation. Normalization for arterial flow permitted calculation of the regurgitation rate. Normal (95% confidence) limits for measured and calculated parameters were determined. Specificity was shown by the percent of normal parameter values for control limbs and sensitivity by the percent of abnormal values for extremities with venous disease. Arterial flow significantly altered volume curves. Normalization increased specificity and sensitivity significantly. Calf exercise tests, even normalized, were too insensitive to be reliable. Elevation tests were significantly more sensitive for determining regurgitation. However, exercise tests were useful and supplied important information about the calf muscle pump. We conclude that, as currently used, many limb volume test procedures are unsuitable but could be improved significantly by normalization to reduce the confounding effect of regional arterial flow and use of an elevation test to measure regurgitation. 
Angiographically assessed coronary arterial patency and reocclusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with anistreplase: results of the anistreplase reocclusion multicenter study (ARMS). In this open multicenter study, 156 patients with acute myocardial infarction received 30 U of anistreplase intravenously over 5 minutes within 4 hours of the onset of chest pain. The patency of the infarct-related vessel was determined by coronary angiography 90 minutes after anistreplase treatment, and also 24 hours after treatment, in patients with a patent infarct-related vessel at 90 minutes, to assess the reocclusion rate. The investigators categorized the infarct-related vessel as patent or occluded, and 2 independent cardiologists graded the infarct-related vessel according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) perfusion criteria. At the 90-minute assessment, 106 of 145 evaluable patients (73%) had patent infarct-related vessels, and 39 of 145 (27%) had occluded infarct-related vessels. Of the 139 independently assessed patients, 98 (71%) had TIMI grades 2 or 3 and 41 (29%) had TIMI grades 0 or 1. At the 24-hour assessment, 98 of 102 patients (96%) had a patent infarct-related vessel, and reocclusion had occurred in 4 of 102 patients (4%). Of the 94 independently assessed patients 90 (96%) had TIMI grades 2 or 3, and 4 (4%) had TIMI grades 0 or 1. The reliability of noninvasive parameters as indicators of achieved patency of the infarct-related vessel was estimated by means of correlation with patency assessed by coronary angiography. A significant correlation of 0.62 was found. The patency rate of 71 to 73% after use of anistreplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction corresponds with findings in earlier studies. The low reocclusion rate of 4% after use of anistreplase probably reflects the prolonged action of anistreplase. 
Prospective hospital based study on persistent diarrhoea. A total of 383 children aged less than 5 years suffering from acute watery diarrhoea or dysentery were studied in hospital to determine the rate of persistent diarrhoea. Altogether 335 (87.5%) recovered within 13 days. Only in 48 (12.5%) did the diarrhoea continue for 14 days or more, and they were considered as having persistent diarrhoea. Children aged between 7 and 18 months had a significantly increased incidence of persistent diarrhoea. Children suffering from grade II-IV malnutrition constituted the majority (70.8%) of those with persistent diarrhoea. Higher rates of isolation of Shigella flexneri, Shigella dysenteriae 1, and Salmonella typhimurium were observed among patients with persistent diarrhoea than in those with diarrhoea of shorter duration. No positive correlations were observed between the clinical severity of disease at hospital admission and measles. Breast fed babies were not prone to persistent diarrhoea. 
Magnetic resonance assessment of the postoperative spine. Degenerative disc disease. The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in patients after surgery for degenerative disc disease in the lumbar and cervical spine are discussed. In the lumbar spine, changes seen in the immediate postoperative period, use of Gd-DTPA in distinguishing scar and disc and postoperative complications are reviewed. In the cervical spine, operative approaches and types, the appearance of bony stenosis, and disc herniations are demonstrated. 
MR imaging of small hepatocellular carcinoma: effect of intratumoral copper content on signal intensity. Small (less than 5 cm) hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in 45 of 112 patients (40.2%) had a high-signal-intensity pattern (relative to that of liver) on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. To identify the cause of this pattern, specimens of histologically defined HCC with high- (n = 21), iso- (n = 6), and low- (n = 22) intensity patterns were histologically evaluated for paramagnetic ionic forms of metals. The incidence of steatosis, clear cell formation, and copper accumulation was statistically (P less than .01) higher in tumors with the high-intensity pattern than in those with other patterns. Of 17 HCCs that stained positive for copper, 16 (94%) had a high-intensity pattern; the pattern of one tumor (6%) was isointense. All 21 tumors with the high-intensity pattern had at least one of the findings of steatosis, clear cell formation, or copper accumulation. These features were evident in only four of 28 tumors (14%) with an iso- or low-intensity pattern. Thus, copper accumulation might be a cause of the high-intensity pattern on T1-weighted images of small HCCs. 
Experience with surgical resection of heterotopic bone in spinal cord injury patients. Extensive heterotopic ossification may occur after a spinal cord injury. Surgical removal of the heterotopic bone is considered only in patients who develop limitations of function or related skin pressure areas. In a prospective study of 21 patients, a total of 43 surgical procedures were performed to resect heterotopic bone. Long-term follow-up study was available for 18 patients who had 38 surgical procedures. This was a descriptive study since preoperative, surgical, and postoperative care varied slightly over time and were dependent on newer advances in surgical techniques and therapeutic agents. Primary complications included excessive bleeding, infection, fractures, and recurrence of the heterotopic ossification. Procedures are outlined that may reduce the incidence of postoperative infection. Fractures are related to the degree of regional osteoporosis. Recurrence is still a common problem, and any or all therapeutic agents that may reduce the extent of postoperative recurrence should be considered before surgical excision is planned. 
Decrease in resting metabolic rate during abstinence from bulimic behavior. Among eight normal-weight bulimic women studied during 1 week of binge eating and vomiting and 7 weeks of abstinence without weight loss, resting metabolic rate and T3 and T4 levels fell significantly during abstinence. These data suggest that a physiological consequence of binge eating and vomiting is an increase in metabolic rate, in part due to increased thyroid hormone activity. 
Reconstruction of the sternum and anterior chest wall using autologous tissues. We have described the successful reconstruction of a completely resected anterior chest wall using autologous tissues. This case demonstrates feasibility despite known potential contamination and serious postoperative physiologic dysfunction. 
Immediate mandibular replacement using reconstruction plates. Mandibular reconstruction at the time of tumor resection remains a surgical dilemma. Primary reconstruction allows for immediate reconstitution of mandibular form and function. Various methods have been attempted, but none enjoys uniform success. With advances in the field of microvascular surgery have come numerous options in replacing these defects. These procedures, however, require special surgical teams and are associated with an increase in operative time as well as morbidity at the donor site. An alternative method involves the use of mandibular reconstruction plates to bridge the defect between segments. This review focuses on 19 patients whose jaws were reconstructed in this fashion. Although not free of complications, mandibular plate reconstruction offers the advantages of (1) lack of donor site morbidity, (2) expediency, (3) excellent mandibular contour, and (4) the ability to reconstruct the condyle when necessary. The technique, results, and complications associated with this procedure are discussed. 
Aneurysm of the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery unrelated to the cerebellopontine angle: case report. This is a case report of an unusual aneurysm of the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery. A 44-year-old woman had a severe frontal headache and vomiting of sudden onset. On the day after admission, the patient began to demonstrate nuchal rigidity and difficulty with upward gaze bilaterally. There were no complaints at this time suggestive of a syndrome of the cerebellopontine angle. A computed tomographic scan revealed an intraventricular hemorrhage of the 3rd and 4th ventricles; however, multiple attempts at four-vessel angiography were required before an aneurysm could be demonstrated. On the 28th hospital day, a suboccipital craniectomy using the retromastoid approach in the lateral position was performed. A saccular aneurysm with a surrounding hematoma in the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery was found and clipped. The operative findings revealed that the aneurysm was unrelated to the cerebellopontine angle. After surgery, the patient had an uneventful recovery and complete resolution of symptoms. 
Astigmatism after small incision cataract surgery. A prospective, randomized, multicenter comparison of 4- and 6.5-mm incisions Four surgeons evaluated induced astigmatism and postoperative wound stability in a randomized prospective study of 130 patients undergoing cataract extraction. After phacoemulsification through a scleral pocket, patients received either a 6.5-mm diameter silicone optic posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) folded for insertion through a 4-mm small incision or a 6.0-mm diameter polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) optic PC IOL placed through an approximately 6.5-mm conventional incision. Vector analysis calculations of prism diopters (D) of mean postoperative-induced keratometric astigmatism for the small incision versus conventional incision groups were, at day 1, 1.54 D versus 3.07 D (P less than 0.0001); at weeks 1 to 2, 1.00 D versus 2.43 D (P less than 0.0001); at 1 month, 0.98 D versus 1.44 D (P = 0.004); and at 3 months, 0.82 D versus 1.03 D (P = 0.089). Subgroup analysis of the suturing technique for the 6.5-mm incision showed that the technique of wound closure, as well as the wound size, influenced the induced astigmatism. For all four surgeons using three methods of suturing the 6.5-mm wound, however, the variability in the amount of induced cylinder was least with the 4.0-mm wound closed with a horizontal mattress suture. Complications in the two groups were comparable. 
Difficult diagnoses in toxicology. Poisons not detected by the comprehensive drug screen. The comprehensive drug screen has serious limitations when used as the sole study for diagnosing intoxication. A careful history and physical examination in the poisoned patient can provide important clues that point to possible toxins. Ancillary studies help differentiate the most likely poison and guide treatment. Fortunately, most poison victims do well with supportive care alone. However, the clinician should be aware of agents that can cause significant harm to patients if not detected and treated quickly. Iron and carbon monoxide are good examples of lethal agents that need a high index of clinical suspicion for early recognition and require specific therapy to ensure a good outcome. Patients who overdose with clonidine, calcium-channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, or albuterol must be managed expectantly and according to their clinical presentation because rapid laboratory verification is not available for these poisons. In all situations, the clinician must integrate information from history, physical examination, and laboratory to render the best care. 
Solitary pulmonary nodules: comparison of classification with standard, thin-section, and reference phantom CT. Standard, thin-section, and reference phantom computed tomography (CT) were performed to evaluate 75 consecutive patients with solitary pulmonary nodules. Follow-up was available for 62 nodules in 59 patients; 53 of the nodules were benign and nine were malignant. Twenty-one of the 62 nodules were assessed as benign with thin-section CT, while 33 of the 62 nodules were assessed as benign with reference phantom CT. Two of the nodules classified as benign with both thin-section and reference phantom CT proved to be malignant (a peripheral, ossified carcinoid and a 3.5-cm-diameter calcified carcinoma). The sensitivity of reference phantom CT (58%) for classification of benign nodules was higher than the sensitivity of thin-section CT (36%). The sensitivity of standard CT was lowest (12%). The presence of fat at thin-section CT was a reliable criterion for benignancy in six hamartomas. While both thin-section and reference phantom CT were useful in the identification of benign pulmonary nodules, reference phantom CT increased sensitivity by 22% compared with thin-section CT. 
Medulloblastoma: long-term follow-up of patients treated with electron irradiation of the spinal field. Thirty-two patients with posterior fossa medulloblastoma underwent treatment with electron irradiation to the spinal field. The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 57% and 50%, respectively. Late complications observed in the 15 patients followed up for more than 5 years were short stature (six patients), decreased sitting-standing height ratio (four patients), scoliosis (two patients), poor school performance (seven patients), xerostomia (one patient), esophageal stricture (one patient), pituitary dysfunction (four patients), primary hypothyroidism (one patient), bilateral eighth-nerve deafness (one patient), and carcinoma of the thyroid (one patient). Complications following treatment with electrons to a spinal field are compared with reported complications following treatment with photons to the spinal field. Although short-term reactions were minimal, the authors found no difference in late complications. More sophisticated treatment planning may show such a long-term benefit in the future. 
Psychological events are both risk factors in, and consequences of, chronic pain. This study questioned 2 assumptions often inherent in psychogenic explanations of pain: (1) that a relationship exists between pain and life events predating pain onset, and (2) that pain patients are a psychologically homogeneous group. Chronic pain sufferers in multiple settings and control subjects participated in this study in which the relationships between pain and 20 psychological variables were examined. Pain was defined and assessed in 3 different ways: (1) membership in a pain group, (2) number of specialists consulted for pain, and (3) pain intensity. Of the 20 psychological variables examined, only less emotional repression and greater "ergomania" (excessive work) were consistently associated with pain on all 3 pain criteria. In addition, pain patients were more likely to have had a relative with pain. Comparisons of pain patients in different settings showed that pain clinic patients reported having been more active throughout their lives, but were currently more depressed and experienced less life satisfaction than patients who were not in a specialized pain centre. These results are interpreted in the light of current multicausal views of pain and conclusions are drawn about the role of psychological variables both as risk factors in, and as consequences of pain. 
Cholestasis without cirrhosis alters regulatory liver gene expression and inhibits hepatic regeneration. Partial hepatectomy (PH) initiates cellular signals for regeneration. Sequential expression of nuclear and cytosolic protooncogenes accompanies the restoration of normal liver function and architecture. Although cirrhosis is known to inhibit liver regeneration, the effects of noncirrhotic cholestasis on hepatocellular proliferation, differentiation, and regulatory gene expression are unknown. To examine this, 25 male Fisher rats underwent common bile duct ligation and division. A 47% +/- 5% PH was performed 10 days after common bile duct ligation and division when histologic analysis revealed cholestasis without cirrhosis. Despite early elevations of total hepatic DNA and RNA values, cholestatic livers demonstrated a significant threefold suppression of expected hepatocyte mitotic indexes 48 and 72 hours after PH, compared with livers after PH alone. Weight restoration in cholestatic livers was 11% +/- 5.2% compared with 40% +/- 4.3% in control livers (+/- SEM; p less than 0.001) 5 days after PH. Analysis of regenerating liver messenger RNA with complementary DNA probes revealed an abnormal, sustained elevation of K-ras expression in cholestatic livers through all time points. Cholestasis blunted but did not obliterate normal sequential elevations in H-ras found in control livers. The expression of c-myc was inhibited threefold with cholestasis 72 hours after PH. These results are the first indication that cholestasis alone inhibits hepatocyte proliferation and the expression of c-myc that normally precedes the first wave of mitosis. This implies that cholestasis without cirrhosis may alter programmed liver gene expression, inhibiting normal hepatic regeneration. 
Cavernous malformations of the brain stem. Once they become symptomatic, cavernous malformations of the brain stem appear to cause progressive morbidity from repetitive hemorrhage, and can even be fatal. Twenty-four patients with long-tract and/or cranial nerve findings from their cavernous malformations of the brain stem were seen for initial evaluation or surgical consultation and thereafter received either surgical or continued conservative treatment. The decision to operate was based on the proximity of the cavernous malformation to the pial surface of the brain stem, the patient's neurological status, and the number of symptomatic episodes. Sixteen patients were treated by definitive surgery directed at excision of their malformation. In four patients, associated venous malformations influenced the surgical approach and their recognition avoided the risk of inappropriate excision of the venous malformation. Although some of the 16 patients had transient, immediate, postoperative worsening of their neurological deficits, the outcome of all except one was the same or improved. Only one patient developed recurrent symptoms: a new deficit 2 1/2 years after surgery required reoperation after regrowth of the cavernous malformation. She has been neurologically stable since the second surgery. One patient died 6 months postoperatively from a shunt infection and sepsis. The eight conservatively treated patients are followed with annual magnetic resonance imaging studies. One has a dramatic associated venous malformation. Seven patients have either minor intermittent or no symptoms, and the eighth died from a hemorrhage 1 year after his initial presentation. Based on these results, surgical extirpation of symptomatic cavernous malformations of the brain stem appears to be the treatment of choice when a patient is symptomatic, the lesion is located superficially, and an operative approach can spare eloquent tissue. When cavernous malformations of the brain stem are completely excised, cure appears permanent. 
Postoperative treatment of nonmetastatic visible residual neuroblastoma: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. The Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) evaluated in a prospective study the hypothesis that patients who had localized, visible residual neuroblastoma without regional lymph node involvement after surgery (POG stage B) have a favorable prognosis when treated with moderate intensive chemotherapy. Eligible patients were initially treated with five courses of Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Evansville, IN) and Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) followed by surgery (CY/AD +/- surgery). Those patients not achieving a complete remission (CR) crossed over to five courses of cisplatin and teniposide (PL/VM) +/- surgery. Radiation therapy (XRT) was given to selected patients who still were not in CR after the crossover therapy. Of the 61 eligible patients, 38 (62%) patients achieved CR after CY/AD proven by clinical (31) or surgical (seven) evaluation. One (2%) patient in clinical partial remission (PR-C) entered CR without further therapy. Nineteen (31%) patients achieved CR with the following salvage therapies: surgery (five), PL/VM +/- surgery (five) followed by XRT (three) or autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) (one) and further courses of CY/AD +/- PL/VM instead of courses of PL/VM (five). The overall CR rate was 95% (58 of 61). Four patients had recurrence of the disease. The probability of being disease-free at 3 years after initial or salvage therapy was estimated at 84% (SE, 5%). The overall prognosis of children older than 1 year and younger than 1 year was similar (P = .26). If, however, the three remission deaths (all younger than 1 year) were censored, there was only one other failure in 32 children younger than one versus seven of 29 children older than 1 year (P = .018). These results confirm the excellent prognosis for patients with POG stage B neuroblastoma and indicate that most patients are curable with CY/AD +/- surgery, and those not achieving CR with this therapy are curable with alternate therapy. 
Effects of perindopril on left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary blood flow, and mechanical properties of cardiac muscle in renovascular hypertensive rats. We studied the effects of perindopril on left ventricular hypertrophy, systemic and coronary hemodynamics, and mechanical cardiac performance in renovascular hypertensive rats (Goldblatt, two-kidneys, one-clip). Systemic and coronary hemodynamics, before and after carbochrome infusion, were assessed by radioactive microspheres injection via an atrial catheter in conscious rats. Mechanical performance was measured on isolated papillary muscle from the same animal. Twelve treated hypertensive rats were compared with 10 nontreated hypertensive rats and nine sham-operated normotensive rats of the same age. Perindopril treatment induced a complete control of blood pressure (mean blood pressure from 156 +/- 22 mm Hg in the untreated group to 100 +/- 24 mm Hg in the treated group (P less than .01), compared to 106 +/- 18 mm Hg in the sham group). This was associated with a nearly complete regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass/body weight 2.26 +/- 0.38 mg/g in the treated group v 3.1 +/- 0.6 in the untreated group [P less than .01], compared to 2 +/- 0.25 mg/g in the sham group [p = NS]). Minimal left ventricular coronary resistances after carbochrome were slightly higher in the hypertensive group compared both to sham and treated group. A reversal of impaired myocardial mechanical parameters towards control values was observed, except for some parameters of relaxation. We conclude that perindopril allows in this model a complete control of blood pressure, and a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy with normalization of coronary hemodynamics and contractile function. 
Serum and tissue alpha-L-fucosidase activity in the pre-clinical and clinical stages of hepatocellular carcinoma. 1. To assess the value of serum alpha-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) as a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, the activity was measured in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and in control subjects. 2. Mean serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity was significantly greater in 35 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (225 +/- 69 nkat/l) than in 35 patients with cirrhosis and 20 normal subjects (134 +/- 30 and 93 +/- 28 nkat/l, respectively). The overlap between hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, however, was such as to severely limit any value of the enzyme as a diagnostic test. 3. In four cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, an increased enzyme activity was detectable in samples taken up to 66 months before the tumours were diagnosed clinically. 4. The serum activity of alpha-L-fucosidase fell to within the reference range after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma in three patients and in one of these a subsequent rise was associated with tumour recurrence which was diagnosed at 8 months after the rise in activity. Ineffective cytotoxic chemotherapy was also associated with a progressive rise in serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity. 5. alpha-L-fucosidase activity in tumour tissue was significantly lower than that seen in non-tumour tissue from cirrhotic patients. These reductions may represent increased transport from the tissue and may partly account for the increased serum activity found in some patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Clinical cardiac positron emission tomography: state of the art. Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) has evolved rapidly from a relatively esoteric research tool into clinical applications providing unique, quantitative information on myocardial perfusion, metabolism, and cell membrane function and having a potentially significant impact on cardiovascular medicine. Although there are many different positron radionuclides for imaging diverse myocardial behavior, three radionuclides have reached accepted clinical utility. Cardiac PET using nitrogen-13-ammonia, rubidium-82, and fluoro-18-deoxyglucose has proved accurate and definitive in multiple university and private-practice sites for diagnosing and assessing severity and location of coronary artery disease in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients, for identifying injured but viable myocardium potentially salvageable by revascularization, and for ruling out clinically significant coronary artery stenosis with a high specificity in patients who might otherwise undergo coronary arteriography to document the absence of significant disease. 
Extracorporeal shock wave treatment of common bile duct stones: experience with two different lithotriptors at a single institution. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a new treatment modality for retained common bile duct stones. Sixty-two patients (mean age 75 years, range 27-95 years) with retained common bile duct stones were treated with two different lithotriptors. One of the lithotriptors operated on the electrohydraulic principle (Dornier HM-3) (n = 13), the other on the electromagnetic principle (Siemens Lithostar) (n = 49). All HM-3 patients were treated under general anaesthesia, whereas with the Lithostar one patients was treated under general anaesthesia, 43 received analgesia and sedation and five had no analgesia at all. Patients treated with the Lithostar had more sessions (mean 1.9 versus 1.3, P less than 0.05) and needed more stock waves (mean 8611 versus 2534, P less than 0.001) than patients treated with the HM-3. Fragmentation was achieved in all patients treated with the HM-3 and in 42 (86 per cent) patients treated with the Lithostar. In this latter group ten patients underwent common bile duct exploration without complications. Eleven patients had transient haematuria after treatment with the HM-3 and two patients (one in each group) had a subcapsular haematoma of the right kidney, all without clinical sequelae. At follow-up (median: HM-3 43 months, Lithostar 18 months), none of the patients had biliary complaints. We conclude that ESWL of retained common bile duct stones in safe and effective with both lithotriptors and should be considered before surgery in the elderly or high-risk patient. 
Open biopsy without wound closure for skeletal neoplasms. During the past several years, the indications for limb salvage in musculoskeletal neoplasms have been expanded. As a result, interest in the topic of diagnostic biopsy has been renewed. Post biopsy hematoma formation and the iatrogenic spread of cancer cells has led to universally accepted guidelines for biopsy technique. These include meticulous hemostasis and wound closure. A technique of open biopsy without wound closure in which the biopsy site in a long bone with contained neoplasm remains open and hematoma allowed to drain into the dressings is outlined. A discussion of the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of this technique is presented. 
Restored hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction by peripheral chemoreceptor agonists in dogs. Hypoxic stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). On the other hand, almitrine, a peripheral chemoreceptor agonist, has been reported in some studies to enhance HPV. To further explore this apparent contradiction, we investigated the effects of two different low intravenous doses of almitrine on pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) versus cardiac index (Q) plots in 32 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs ventilated alternatively in hyperoxia (FIO2, 0.4) and in hypoxia (FIO2 0.1). HPV, defined as a hypoxia-induced increase in Ppa over the entire range of Q studied, from 2 to 5 L/min/m2, was elicited in 16 dogs. In the first eight of these "responders," almitrine 2 micrograms/kg/min had no vascular effect, and in the other eight, almitrine 4 micrograms/kg/min inhibited HPV. In 16 other dogs, hypoxia did not affect Ppa over the entire range of Q. In these "nonresponders," almitrine 2 micrograms/kg/min (n = 8) as well as 4 micrograms/kg/min (n = 8) restored HPV. To answer the question whether the ability to restore HPV would be specific to almitrine, we administered intravenously the structurally unrelated chemoreceptor agonist doxapram at the dose of 20 micrograms/kg/min to an additional group of eight "nonresponders," and this treatment also restored HPV. Intravenous infusion of the malic acid solution solvent of almitrine had no effect on Ppa/Q plots in a final group of eight "nonresponders". We conclude that low dose almitrine and doxapram restore HPV in dogs with a naturally absent hypoxic pulmonary pressor response, probably by a direct effect at the pulmonary vessels. 
Syncope and orthostatic hypotension. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the postural blood pressure response over time, the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in patients with syncope, and the relationship of orthostatic hypotension to recurrence of symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 223 patients with syncope in a standardized manner. Orthostatic responses were measured in a standardized fashion at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 minutes or until symptoms occurred. Follow-up was obtained at 3-month intervals. Causes of syncope were assigned by predetermined criteria. RESULTS: Orthostatic hypotension (20 mm Hg or greater systolic blood pressure decline) was found in 69 patients (31%). The median time to reach minimal standing systolic blood pressure was 1 minute for all subjects. In patients with orthostatic hypotension (20 mm Hg or greater), mean time to reach minimum blood pressure was 2.4 minutes. The vast majority of patients with significant orthostatic hypotension had this finding within 2 minutes of standing. Orthostatic hypotension was common in patients for whom other probable causes of syncope were assigned. The recurrence of syncope was not related to the degree of orthostatic hypotension; however, the recurrence of dizziness and syncope as end-points was lower in patients with 20 mm Hg or greater systolic blood pressure reductions as compared with patients with lesser degrees of orthostatic blood pressure declines. CONCLUSION: Orthostatic hypotension is common in patients with syncope and is detected in the vast majority of patients by 2 minutes. Although symptom recurrence on follow-up was lower in patients with more severe orthostatic hypotension, the clinical significance of this finding needs to be further defined by future studies. 
Clinical experience with the Palmaz-Schatz coronary stent. Complications that occurred in 247 patients who underwent successful elective stenting to native coronary arteries with the Palmaz-Schatz balloon expandable stent included subacute thrombosis in 7 patients (2.8%), myocardial infarction in 3 (1.2%), death 3 (1.2%), urgent bypass surgery in 4 (1.6%) and major bleeding events in 24 (9.7%). Angiographic restenosis occurred in 21 (20%) of 103 patients who received a single stent. Subgroup analysis, however, revealed that restenosis of a single stent occurred in 3 (7%) of 45 patients without prior angioplasty compared with 25 (27%) of 91 patients with prior angioplasty. Patients with "suboptimal" angioplasty results (dis-section) who received a single stent seemed to have a higher thrombosis rate perioperatively (4 [4%] of 98), but no higher incidence of restenosis (7 [15%] of 46) than that of the total group of patients who received a single stent. Coronary stenting may be a valuable adjunct to coronary angioplasty in carefully selected patients. Complication rates are similar to those of routine angioplasty; however, angiographic restenosis may be reduced in certain subsets of patients. 
No correlation between response and survival in patients with multiple myeloma treated with vincristine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone. A vincristine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (VMCP) multi-drug regimen was used in 85 previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma (MM) (symptomatic Durie Stages II and III) until they became refractory. The prognostic significance of various pretreatment characteristics was evaluated in terms of therapeutic response (according to Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] and Chronic Leukemia-Myeloma Task Force [TF] criteria) and survival. Therapeutic responses, obtained in 31.2% (SWOG) and 68.7% (TF) of patients, had a significant inverse correlation with myeloma cell mass, serum calcium, and bone status. Median survival time of Stage II and Stage III patients was 39 and 34 months, respectively. Serum B2 microglobulin greater than or equal to 6 micrograms/ml was the only variable correlating unfavorably with survival duration after multi-variate analysis (increased risk = 2.79), although therapeutic response as a time-dependent variable had no effect on survival. These data suggest no correlation between response and survival, partially because of inadequate response assessment criteria and partially because no existing treatment is curative (although current therapeutic approaches may prevent death from complications). 
Temperature-dependent modulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression in cultured human astroglial cells by dexamethasone and indomethacin. In bacterial meningitis, LPS induces production in cerebrospinal fluid of the cytokines IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), which are the principle mediators of meningeal inflammation. IL-1 beta and TNF alpha induce fever, and elevated temperature may affect cytokine expression. Dexamethasone treatment improves outcome in bacterial meningitis possibly by inhibiting IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. In this report, the effects of elevated temperature and dexamethasone on LPS-stimulated IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA gene expression and protein synthesis were studied in human astrocytoma cell lines and primary cultures of human fetal astrocytes. Cells cultured at 40 degrees C exhibited smaller peaks of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha transcription and protein synthesis compared with cells cultured at 37 degrees C. The addition of dexamethasone before, during, or after exposure of the cells to LPS resulted in temperature-dependent inhibition of IL-1 beta transcription and protein synthesis. The most extensive inhibition occurred in pretreated cells cultured at 37 degrees C. Cotreatment with LPS and dexamethasone also inhibited TNF alpha mRNA transcription at both temperatures. The effects of another antiinflammatory agent, indomethacin, on LPS induction of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA were temperature and cell line dependent. These findings provide a possible explanation for the efficacy of dexamethasone treatment of bacterial meningitis and support the proposal that fever may be beneficial to the host in this disease. 
Prolonged lumbar spinal drainage after the resection of tumors of the skull base: a cautionary note. A combined transcranial and facial approach was used for an en bloc resection of a malignant angiosarcoma of the ethmoid sinuses. The patient awoke neurologically intact and was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit. A lumbar subarachnoid drain was placed for the continuous removal of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Approximately 36 hours after surgery, she deteriorated neurologically and demonstrated bilateral extensor posturing to painful stimuli. A computed tomographic scan demonstrated obliteration of the basal cisterns indicative of transtentorial herniation and a small amount of extradural air. Eight hours after the lumbar drain was turned off, the patient had recovered completely. We propose that the patient manifested transtentorial herniation caused by a pressure gradient between the supratentorial and lumbar cistern compartments brought on by the continuous removal of CSF from the lumbar subarachnoid space. We suggest that ventricular drainage should be considered for these cases rather than lumbar drainage. This offers the same advantage of removing the CSF and maintaining low-to-normal intracranial pressure without the risk of transtentorial herniation. 
Ridogrel in the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The safety of the combination of heparin and ridogrel therapy and its antiplatelet efficacy was examined in the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). In 32 patients without known aspirin intake for 10 days before PTCA, therapy with ridogrel (300-mg intravenous bolus) was begun just before PTCA and continued orally at a dose of 300 mg twice daily until discharge. Heparin was administered as a 10,000 IU bolus dose before PTCA and followed by an intravenous infusion at a rate of 1,000 IU/hour for 24 hours. Bleeding problems at the arterial entry site occurred in 13 patients, which required a blood transfusion in only 2 patients. One patient underwent emergency bypass surgery without specific problems of hemostasis. Ridogrel virtually eliminated thromboxane B2 from the serum (29,990 +/- 6,555 pg/0.1 ml before vs 63 +/- 7 pg/0.1 ml at 2 hours after ridogrel), with a concomitant increase in serum 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (511 +/- 34 pg/0.1 ml before vs 1,190 +/- 146 pg/0.1 ml at 24 hours after ridogrel). There were no acute reocclusions in the ridogrel-treated patients, whereas acute reocclusions occurred in 5.6% of the patients taking the standard aspirin + heparin regimen during the same period. Furthermore, at 6-month clinical follow-up patients treated with ridogrel compared favorably with those receiving standard treatment. 
A longitudinal investigation of the factor structure of subjective well-being: the case of the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale. The purpose of this research was twofold: (a) to replicate the hierarchical factor structure of well-being with rural data; and (b) to investigate the longitudinal invariance of this factor structure. Subjective well-being was hypothesized to have a hierarchical factor structure with a second order factor, well-being, explaining variance in first order dimensions labeled agitation, lonely dissatisfaction, and attitude toward one's aging. The latent constructs were measured by items composing the PGC Scale (Lawton, 1975). Maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis techniques were used to test the fit of the model. Subjective well-being was investigated using a panel of older rural adults surviving a ten-year, two-wave investigation. Results of the study provided support for the hierarchical factor structure of well-being in cross-sectional analyses. This factor structure was varied across time, however. 
Implications of self-reported cognitive and motor dysfunction in HIV-positive patients. OBJECTIVE: The authors examined HIV-positive subjects to determine the relationship of patient complaints of cognitive and motor dysfunction to psychiatric status and performance on established cognitive and motor function tests. METHOD: HIV-positive volunteers (N = 77) were evaluated at entry into a longitudinal neurological study. Forty were asymptomatic, 29 had AIDS-related complex, and eight had AIDS. The subjects were not selected for the presence or absence of cognitive or motor complaints. Complaints of cognitive and motor dysfunction were assessed with items from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Macro Neurologic Exam. Current depression and anxiety were assessed with the Profile of Mood States. Psychiatric status was assessed with the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule, a structured interview that provides DSM-III psychiatric diagnoses. Actual cognitive and motor performance was measured with standard neuropsychological tests known to be sensitive to the effects of HIV. RESULTS: Cognitive complaints were found in 38 (49%) of the subjects. These complaints were associated with psychiatric symptoms but not with cognitive performance. Motor complaints, found in 12 (16%) of the subjects, were associated with poorer motor performance but not with psychiatric symptoms. The overall frequency of psychiatric diagnosis was high. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reports of cognitive and motor dysfunction were common in this unselected group and are of concern to health care providers. Potentially treatable psychiatric conditions were also common, particularly in subjects with cognitive complaints, and appropriate treatment referrals are indicated. Patients who report motor dysfunction should be neurologically evaluated for treatable causes. 
Standards for selected anthropometric measurements in Prader-Willi syndrome. We report standards (95th, 50th, and 5th centiles) in Prader-Willi syndrome for weight, height, sitting height, head circumference, head length, head breadth, hand length, middle finger length, palm length, hand breadth, foot length, foot breadth, triceps skinfold, and subscapular skinfold. For comparison with Prader-Willi syndrome standardized curves, normal control data from the literature were plotted similarly and standard curves were produced. We encourage the use of these standards with the examination of patients who have Prader-Willi syndrome and in the comparison of the patient who has Prader-Willi syndrome with other similarly affected individuals. The standards may also be useful for assisting in the diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome, particularly in younger individuals. 
Differential response of malignant human B-cells to anti-IgM immunoglobulin (anti-mu) and B-cell growth factor: unique direct cytotoxicity of anti-mu on prolymphocytic leukemia cells. We examined in vitro tritiated thymidine uptake by B cells from seven prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), seven chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and four plasma cell leukemia (PCL) patients in response to culture with anti-human IgM antibody (anti-mu) and B-cell growth factor (BCGF). In contrast to the stimulatory effect observed in normal B-cell cultures, the divalent F(ab')2 anti-mu antibody uniquely inhibited the autonomous proliferation and induced marked cytotoxicity in six of seven PLL cell cultures independent of complement or Fc-receptor-mediated mechanisms. There was neither stimulation or inhibition of the slgM+ CLL or the slgM- PCL cells. The inhibitory effect on the PLL cells was observed at an anti-mu concentration below the stimulatory threshold for normal B cells. Significant impairment of trypan blue exclusion was delayed until 48 hours, with morphological cellular changes suggestive of a programmed cell death mechanism or apoptosis. The cytotoxicity was independent of the slgM-staining intensity or the autonomous and BCGF-augmented DNA synthetic activity of the PLL cells and was similar in patients with de novo PLL or with prolymphocytic transformation of CLL. Cells from a PLL patient were separated by elutriation into two fractions, a BCGF-unresponsive large "transformed" cell fraction with marked autonomous DNA synthesis and a smaller lymphoid cell subset with low 3H-thymidine uptake that could be augmented by BCGF. Both fractions were equally susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of anti-mu. These data suggest that certain slgM-bearing malignant B cells are susceptible to anti-mu-triggered cytotoxicity. They may represent the malignant counterpart of a "tolerogenic" normal B-cell subset, and the unique direct cytotoxicity of anti-mu may provide a therapeutic strategy specifically for PLL. 
Endoscopic contact Nd:YAG laser resectional vaporization (ECLRV) and esophageal dilatation (ED) in advanced malignant obstruction of the esophagus. Malignant esophageal obstruction in patients with advanced and metastatic carcinoma is unsuitable for surgery. Palliative treatment must provide adequate swallowing with minimum complications in these often seriously ill patients. Twenty consecutive patients underwent endoscopic Nd:YAG contact laser resection and vaporization (ECLRV) and esophageal dilatation (ED) for advanced esophageal carcinoma since August, 1985. Average duration of the disease when first referred was 7.2 months. Tumor cell type was either squamous cell carcinoma (n = 11) or adenocarcinoma (n = 9). Tumor location was distal (n = 14), middle (n = 5), or upper (n = 2). Mean tumor length was 7.5 cm. Mean preoperative luminal diameter was 1 mm, with total obstruction in ten (50%) patients. The operative procedure in all patients was under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube intubation. Rigid and flexible endoscopes were both used as indicated. Mean postoperative luminal diameter was 15 mm. All but four were able to swallow fluids on the first postoperative day, followed by semisolids the next day without discomfort. Minor perforation was noted in three cases and managed in two conservatively. One more patient had difficulty in swallowing due to extra-esophageal compression, in spite of a technically successful laser therapy. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was carried out in eight cases. Eleven patients were retreated successfully for recurrent obstruction and two were treated more than twice, at a mean of six-week intervals. Endoscopic contact laser resectional vaporization with esophageal dilatation was relatively safe and provided an improved quality of life in this preliminary study group, providing a mean survival of 18.5 weeks (range 2-50 weeks). 
Primary intrasellar coccidioidomycosis simulating a pituitary adenoma. The case of a 68-year-old woman who had relatively acute, unilateral ophthalmoplegia is reported. Radiological studies indicated a mass lesion involving the pituitary gland and left cavernous sinus. Pathological tissue obtained by the transsphenoidal approach revealed the presence of a Coccidioides granuloma. This pathological entity should be considered when evaluating patients with a pituitary mass and ophthalmoplegia. 
Mediastinal involvement by alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma: evaluation with computerized tomography. We have reported a case of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma with mediastinal involvement occurring in a 15-year-old boy. Computerized tomography revealed an anterior mediastinal mass with internal mammary nodal involvement, which had metastasized from a tumor of the abdominal wall musculature. When making the differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass with concurrent distant soft tissue and muscle involvement in an adolescent, rhabdomyosarcoma should be considered. 
Clomipramine for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder affects about 2 percent of the U.S. population and can be quite disabling. Clomipramine is the only drug approved for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Its efficacy is unique among tricyclic antidepressants and may be related to its relatively high potency in affecting serotonergic neurotransmission. The drug has many anticholinergic effects, but it is relatively well tolerated by the patients for whom it is effective. A 0.4 percent incidence of seizures, a potentially serious side effect, has been observed. Other antidepressants that are relatively selective for serotonergic (as opposed to noradrenergic) transmission may be as effective as clomipramine in the treatment of this disorder; controlled studies are under way. Clomipramine at low doses is also effective in the treatment of panic disorder and has been used successfully in the treatment of premature ejaculation. 
Concurrent double balloon valvotomy for combined rheumatic mitral and tricuspid stenosis. We expanded the application of percutaneous balloon valvotomy (PBV) to 4 adults (age 14 to 30 years, average 22.2 years) with combined rheumatic mitral and tricuspid stenosis. Double balloon dilatation reduced the transmitral gradient from 17.36 +/- 3.54 to 5.52 +/- 0.89 (P less than 0.025) and transtricuspid gradient from 12.65 +/- 2.67 to 3.67 +/- 0.95 (P less than 0.025). Mitral and tricuspid valve area increased from 0.73 +/- 0.20 to 2.57 +/- 0.67 (P less than 0.005) and from 0.77 +/- 0.24 to 2.67 +/- 0.24 cm2 (P less than 0.005), respectively. The procedures were well tolerated, with no significant increase in valvular regurgitation or left to right shunt across the atrial septum. The excellent symptomatic and haemodynamic benefits are sustained at 3-24 months follow-up. It is concluded that combined dilatation of stenotic valves by double balloon technique can emerge as an alternative to surgery in selected patients with polyvalvar rheumatic heart disease. 
Detecting arrhythmia by exercise electrocardiography in pediatric patients: assessment of sensitivity and influence on clinical management. We studied 49 patients with suspected arrhythmias (group 1) and 92 patients with previously documented arrhythmias (group 2) who underwent exercise electrocardiography (EECG) at our institution between 1979 and 1987. Among group 1 patients, all of whom had sinus rhythm before exercise, 10 (20%) had abnormal findings on EECG, and treatment was modified in 4 of these 10 (8% of group 1). Further testing (24-hour ambulatory or transtelephonic electrocardiographic monitoring or electrophysiologic study) of the 39 patients with normal EECG findings revealed 8 additional patients with arrhythmias. In group 1, the sensitivity of EECG was 56%, and its negative predictive value was 79%. Group 2 consisted of 38 patients with atrial arrhythmias, 31 with ventricular arrhythmias, and 23 with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities before EECG. Of these 92 patients, 68 (74%) had abnormal EECG findings. All but 1 of the 24 patients with normal findings underwent further testing, and rhythm abnormalities were induced in 16. Patients with atrial arrhythmias were more likely to have normal EECG results (42%) than were those with ventricular arrhythmias (23%) or an atrioventricular conduction abnormality (4%). Of the 35 patients who had been referred for suppression of an arrhythmia, 25 (71%) had abnormal rhythm suppressed during exercise. Clinical management was modified in 27% of group 2 patients on the basis of EECG findings. 
Parathyroid adenoma manifested as pancreatitis and polyuria. Although the data used to explain a relationship between hyperparathyroidism and pancreatitis remain incomplete, there does appear to be a relationship between the two. We believe our patient's clinical course strongly supports this. 
Postexercise hypotension is not sustained in normal and hypertensive humans. Blood pressure falls after a single session of exercise. The duration for which this fall in blood pressure persists is not known. Sustained hypotension after a single session of exercise may have important implications in the treatment of patients with mild hypertension. We studied 24 subjects (12 normotensive subjects and 12 patients with mild or borderline hypertension). Blood pressure was measured in the laboratory for 30 minutes before and for an hour after graded bicycle exercise to maximal voluntary capacity. Subjects then left the hospital and measured their blood pressures at home (three measurements every 2 hours) following a strict measurement protocol for the rest of the day (usually between 8 and 12 hours). These home blood pressure measurements were compared with home blood pressure measurements recorded at the same times on a nonexercise control day. At 30 minutes after the graded maximal exercise test, the hypertensive patients experienced a fall in blood pressure from 142 +/- 3.5/93 +/- 6.5 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 124 +/- 4.5/79 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). For the normotensive subjects, blood pressure after exercise fell from 117 +/- 3.1/70 +/- 2.1 mm Hg to 109 +/- 3.1/62 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Despite these striking blood pressure reductions for the second half hour after exercise, blood pressure measurements recorded at home were not significantly different on the exercise and control days in either group. We conclude that although a single bout of exercise lowers blood pressure for a short (1-hour) period, this hypotension is not sustained. 
Residual functional deficit after partial fibulectomy for bone graft. The residual functional deficit caused by partial fibulectomy for bone graft was documented with subjective assessment and clinical and instrumented examination in ten patients. The donor leg often remained mildly symptomatic. Residual weakness occurred when the middle one third of the fibula was excised. However, mild discomfort, residual weakness, and laxity were not considered significant enough to discourage transplantation of large segments of the fibula. Postoperative therapy should emphasize muscular strength to minimize the functional deficit. 
Case-control study of screening for prostatic cancer by digital rectal examinations. Although commonly thought to be an effective method of screening for prostatic cancer, digital rectal examinations have yet to be shown by controlled study to help prevent advanced forms of this disease. 139 men with metastatic (stage D) prostatic cancer (cases) were compared with an equal number of matched men free of this condition (controls), with respect to rectal examinations recorded in the medical records up to, on average, 23 years before the cases' initial diagnosis of prostatic cancer. Cases and controls were members of a large health maintenance organisation in northern California. In the 10 years before initial diagnosis (excluding the last three months) the average number of examinations for routine screening (2.45 vs 2.52) or to evaluate intestinal or rectal symptoms (0.44 in both) were similar in cases and controls, respectively. After adjustment for racial differences, the relative risk of metastatic prostatic cancer for men with one or more screening rectal examinations compared with men with none was 0.9 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.5-1.7. Screening by routine digital rectal examination appears to have little if any effect in preventing metastatic prostatic cancer. If there is a small benefit, it will be difficult to demonstrate by conventional epidemiological study. 
Measuring physical activity with a single question. Using 1,004 subjects enrolled in a worksite health promotion program, this report evaluated the validity of a single question about participation in regular exercise. Measured at baseline, this one question had a significant age-adjusted association with body mass index (p less than 0.0001 in women and p = 0.001 in men), HDL cholesterol (p less than 0.0001 in women), and oxygen capacity (p = 0.0007 in women and p = 0.002 in men). Thus, one self-reported question can provide useful information about who is and who is not participating in regular exercise. The potential validity of a single exercise question is particularly relevant in complex epidemiologic studies where lengthy questionnaires highlight the importance of brief instruments. 
Endoscopic removal of gastric lipoma: diagnostic value of endoscopic ultrasonography. A 47-yr-old male with gastric lipoma is presented. X-ray and endoscopic examinations revealed a submucosal tumor on the posterior wall of the gastric antrum. Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated the hyperechoic mass in the submucosa without continuity to the muscularis propria, by which the lesion was diagnosed as lipoma. The lesion was successfully removed by endoscopic polypectomy without complications. The cross-sections of the removed specimens were quite consistent with the ultrasonographic findings. Endoscopic ultrasonography is valuable in assessing the exact extent of the tumor and in determining whether or not endoscopic polypectomy is called for. 
Characterization of Bay U 3405, a novel thromboxane A2/endoperoxide receptor antagonist. The thromboxane A2-receptor antagonistic properties of Bay U 3405 [(3R)-3-(4-fluorophenylsulfonamido)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-carbaz o-lepropanoic acid] have been evaluated in various pharmacologic models. Bay U 3405 specifically inhibits platelet aggregation induced by U 46619, collagen, platelet-activating factor, and the second wave of ADP (IC50 0.5, 0.07, 0.3, 0.19 microM) in human plasma. The plasma phase of ADP-induced aggregation is not affected. U 46619-induced platelet aggregation is competitively antagonized (pA2 = 6.3). In humans, ex vivo platelet aggregation is inhibited after oral application of 2 or 50 mg Bay U 3405. Bay U 3405 also specifically and competitively antagonizes U 46619-induced contractions of rabbit aortic rings (pA2 = 7.4). In vivo, Bay U 3405 protects rabbits dose dependently from arachidonic acid or collagen-induced thromboembolism (ED50 1-3 mg/kg p.o). Chronic administration of Bay U 3405 to stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats reduces stroke-related mortality and diminishes the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhages. From these results, we conclude that Bay U 3405 is an orally active, selective, and competitive thromboxane A2-receptor antagonist that may be beneficial in the treatment of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. 
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of pancreatic duct stones. Chronic calcifying pancreatitis presents a major clinical problem, often requiring extensive surgery. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) offers a new therapeutic option. We applied ESWL after endoscopic sphincterotomy of the pancreatic orifice in eight patients with impacted pancreatic duct stones. An electromagnetic lithotriptor (Siemens Lithostar, Erlangen, FRG) was used. Patients were treated in prone position under fluoroscopic control. A mean of 6,813 shock waves (range 1,500-10,000) was delivered in one or two sessions. Disintegration of stones was achieved in 6/8 patients, initial relief of pain in 7/8 patients, and total clearance of the pancreatic duct in 3/8 patients. One patient had an exacerbation of her pancreatitis one day after ESWL, which resolved rapidly with medical treatment. No other complications were observed. Four of five patients with fragmented stones had no abdominal complaints at follow-up (mean 17 months, range 3-27). Three patients in whom ESWL was not completely successful (two without and one with partial fragmentation) underwent an operation according to Puestow. Two of them still have abdominal complaints after surgery. From these data, we conclude that ESWL of pancreatic duct stones is a promising new alternative for surgery, when endoscopic stone extraction fails. 
Post-traumatic cholesteatoma. Post-traumatic cholesteatoma often presents many years after the original injury. This case occurred 24 years after a head injury which represents the longest recorded interval. A further interesting feature was that the patient presented with an infected skull prosthesis that was inserted at the time of the original injury. 
Primary prevention of sudden cardiovascular death in hypertensive patients. Mortality results from the MAPHY Study. In a randomized primary prevention trial including 3,234 men with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension, the effect of the beta-blocker metoprolol or a thiazide diuretic as an initial antihypertensive therapy was compared regarding the risk of sudden cardiovascular death during a follow-up ranging from 2.3 to 10.8 years (median of 4.2 years). Only men aged 40 to 64 years were included in the study. The randomization of patients into the metoprolol (n = 1,609) or diuretic group (n = 1,625) was performed after stratification for age, smoking habits, serum cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure. At baseline the two treatment groups were well matched. Metoprolol was given in a mean dose of 174 mg daily and the mean dose of thiazide diuretic was either 46 mg hydrochlorothiazide daily or 4.4 mg bendroflumethiazide daily. Identical blood pressure control was achieved using the fixed therapeutic schedule. Total and cardiovascular mortality were significantly lower for metoprolol than for diuretics, owing to fewer deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke. Of the cardiovascular deaths, 78% were classified as sudden cardiovascular deaths (occurred within 24 h after the onset of symptoms). There were significantly fewer sudden cardiovascular deaths in the metoprolol group compared to the diuretic group (32 v 45, P = .017). The present results suggest that initial antihypertensive therapy with metoprolol is associated with a lesser incidence of sudden cardiovascular deaths than initial diuretic treatment in uncomplicated hypertension. 
An evaluation of clinical variables in determining the need for pelvic examination in the emergency department. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of multiple clinical variables to predict an increased or decreased probability of pelvic pathology, therefore determining when a pelvic examination is needed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: An urban emergency department. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: 246 female patients presenting with abdominal pain and undergoing pelvic examination. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 99 patients without pelvic pathology (40%) and group 2 consisted of 147 patients with pelvic pathology (60%). Pelvic pathology was defined as presence of infective discharge (with confirmation on wet mount/potassium hydroxide smear), presence of adnexal mass and/or tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, uterine enlargement and/or tenderness, blood in the vaginal vault, and culture report positive for Neisseria gonorrhea. The following variables achieved statistical significance (P less than .05) using a logistic regression model: history of vaginal discharge (odds ratio, 2.30 [95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 4.32]); history of dysmenorrhea/menorrhagia (4.35 [1.52 to 12.40]); right upper quadrant pain on physical examination (0.33 [0.13 to 0.85]); and left lower quadrant pain on physical examination or history (1.73 [0.94 to 3.19]). CONCLUSION: History of vaginal discharge, history of dysmenorrhea/menorrhagia, and left lower quadrant pain on physical examination act as risk variables predicting presence of pelvic disease. Right upper quadrant pain on physical examination acts as a protective variable to predict absence of pelvic disease. This information may aid the emergency physician in determining the need for a pelvic examination in women with abdominal pain. 
Screening of diabetic children for coeliac disease with antigliadin antibodies and HLA typing. IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies were measured in 498 patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and no history of intestinal malabsorption. Thirty patients had abnormal concentrations of antigliadin antibodies; 22 of these had an intestinal biopsy carried out and 16 of the 22 had subtotal villous atrophy suggestive of coeliac disease (prevalence 3.2%). There were no significant differences between patients with coeliac disease and diabetes and diabetic patients with normal IgA antigliadin antibodies in any of the nutritional variables measured, duration of diabetes, and mean insulin requirement. The mean age of onset of diabetes and attainment of expected height for age were both significantly lower in the patients with both diseases. Typing HLA classes I and II was done in 242 patients. The incidence of HLA-B8, DR3, and DQW2, which are commonly associated with both the diseases, is increased when both are present. 
Acute diverticulitis. A complicated problem in the immunocompromised patient. We reviewed the records of 209 patients with acute diverticulitis treated from 1984 through 1989 to determine if immunocompromised patients have a worse prognosis than nonimmunocompromised patients. Forty immunocompromised patients and 169 nonimmunocompromised patients with acute diverticulitis were identified. Free perforation into the peritoneal cavity occurred in 43% (17/40) of immunocompromised patients and 14% (24/169) of nonimmunocompromised patients. Operations were performed in 58% (23/40) of immunocompromised patients and 33% (55/169) of nonimmunocompromised patients. Postoperative morbidity was 65% (15/23) in immunocompromised patients and 24% (13/55) in nonimmunocompromised patients; postoperative mortality was 39% (9/23) and 2% (1/55), respectively. We conclude that acute diverticulitis in the immunocompromised patient is a complicated problem; there is a greater risk of free perforation and need for surgery than in the nonimmunocompromised patient. Furthermore, the prognosis for immunocompromised patients who undergo surgery is worse than that for nonimmunocompromised patients. 
Does the addition of methylene blue to the sclerosant improve the accuracy of injections during variceal sclerotherapy? We evaluated the possibility that the addition of methylene blue to the sclerosant would improve the accuracy of intravariceal injections during endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy. Four patients had eight sessions of endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy with a sclerosant containing a combination of 3% sodium tetradecyl and 60% renograffin. For four sessions, 1 ml of methylene blue was added to 9 ml of sclerosant. The endoscopist judged each injection to be intravariceal or paravariceal. This was confirmed by fluoroscopy. There were 57 injections (28 with methylene blue, 29 without) in the eight sclerotherapy sessions. Intravariceal injections were confirmed fluoroscopically in 64.9% of injections (60.7% with methylene blue 69% without). The endoscopist correctly assessed intravariceal versus paravariceal injections 66.7% of the time (71.4% with methylene blue, 62% without). None of the differences approached statistical significance. The addition of methylene blue to the sclerosant does not improve the accuracy of intravariceal injections or the endoscopist's ability to recognize paravariceal injections during sclerotherapy of esophageal varices. 
Propranolol therapy alters estimation of potential cardiovascular risk derived from submaximal postinfarction exercise testing. We studied the effect of propranolol administration on risk assessment based on submaximal exercise testing performed early after myocardial infarction. A total of 70 patients with recent infarction underwent modified Bruce treadmill testing with simultaneous measurement of expired gases in the absence of antianginal agents including beta-antagonists. Among these, 31 patients who had at least one of the following abnormalities--ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm (22 patients), chest pain (four patients), or treadmill time less than 360 seconds (12 patients)--were studied in a randomized double-blind fashion and received either placebo or 240 mg of propranolol/day. A total of 28 patients completed the randomized phase and were able to undergo repeat exercise testing an average of 3.4 +/- 1.8 days later. Randomized groups were equivalent at baseline except for a higher peak oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production (p less than 0.05) in the propranolol compared with the placebo group; these differences were taken into account in statistical analyses of the study data. Resting heart rate (59 +/- 1.2 versus 82 +/- 4.2 beats/min) and peak heart rate x systolic blood pressure (14,208 +/- 496 versus 20,075 +/- 1,062) were both significantly less (p less than 0.01) after propranolol than after placebo. Eight of nine patients treated with placebo maintained ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm from the initial to the randomized exercise test, compared with only 4 of 13 receiving propranolol (p less than 0.01). In those with continued ST depression, time to positivity was significantly longer in those receiving propranolol compared with those taking placebo (538 +/- 73 versus 318 +/- 44 seconds, p less than 0.05). In contrast, the peak ratio between carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption was higher in those receiving propranolol compared with those receiving placebo (0.93 +/- 0.04 versus 0.81 +/- 0.03, p less than 0.05). We conclude that propranolol therapy reduces evidence of ischemia and changes traditional estimates of potential cardiac risk derived from submaximal postinfarction exercise testing. 
Modifications of thermoregulation in patients with suprasellar pituitary adenomas. Thermoregulation was investigated pre and postoperatively in 5 and only preoperatively in 7 patients with suprasellar pituitary adenomas by exposing them to external cold and heat in a climatic chamber. Five healthy subjects served as controls. Body core and skin temperatures, oxygen consumption, electromyographic activity, skin blood flow and local sweating rates were continuously measured. Threshold temperatures for activation of heat production and heat loss were calculated from these data. Hormone analysis was performed before and after stimulation with releasing factors. In the patients, core temperatures as well as threshold temperatures for heat production and heat loss were elevated by about 0.5 degrees C as compared with controls. This elevation of core and threshold temperatures was achieved, despite a reduced resting metabolic rate, by a reduction of skin blood flow indicated by a low mean skin temperature. After successful operation the thermoregulatory alterations normalized. Serum levels of growth hormone were reduced preoperatively and stimulation by GHRF did not cause an appropriate increase. Prolactin was elevated in 6 patients with prolactinomas, but there was no correlation with changes in thermoregulatory threshold temperatures. Stimulation of the other hypophyseal hormones by the combined anterior pituitary function test revealed a normal hormonal response. Apart from prolactin there were no significant hormonal changes postoperatively. It is concluded that disturbances of temperature regulation are present in patients with suprasellar adenomas, but that they are not detectable by routine clinical methods. These alterations probably depend on a disturbance of hypothalamic function and are reversible by surgery. 
Spinal cord trauma in man: studies of phosphorylated neurofilament and ubiquitin expression. Changes in neuronal proteins are a major feature of the neurodegenerative disorders, but the biological significance of these changes is not understood. We describe alterations in neuronal proteins as a result of surgical tractotomy on the human spinal cord at 3, 5, 7, 14 and 72 days after operation. Antibodies to phosphorylated neurofilaments labelled neuronal cell bodies in the nucleus dorsalis and anterior horns. Axonal swellings showed positive staining for ubiquitin, but ubiquitinated neuronal inclusions were not evident. The presence of phosphorylated neurofilaments in the neuronal cell bodies and of ubiquitination of axonal swellings may be indicators of interrupted axonal transport. The changes found in intracellular proteins in neurons after trauma do not resemble those found in motor neuron disease, suggesting that the intraneuronal ubiquitinated inclusions may have a unique significance in the cytopathology of that disorder. 
ATP-regulated K+ channels protect the myocardium against ischemia/reperfusion damage. The role of ATP-regulated K+ channels in protecting the myocardium against ischemia/reperfusion damage was explored using glibenclamide and pinacidil to block and activate the channels, respectively. Electrical and mechanical activity of arterially perfused guinea pig right ventricular walls was recorded simultaneously via an intracellular microelectrode and a force transducer. The preparations were subjected to either 1) 20 minutes of no-flow ischemia with or without glibenclamide (1 and 10 microM) followed by reperfusion, or 2) 30 minutes of no-flow ischemia with or without pinacidil (1 and 10 microM) followed by reperfusion. No-flow ischemia for 20 minutes produced changes in electrical and mechanical activity that were completely reversed on reperfusion; resting membrane potential declined by 13 +/- 1.2 mV, action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) decreased by 62%, and developed tension fell by greater than 95%, but resting tension did not change significantly. Glibenclamide (10 microM) had no effect on activity during normal perfusion, but during ischemia, resting membrane potential fell slightly further (17 +/- 1.8 mV) and APD90 declined by only 24%. Developed tension declined more slowly and to a lesser extent, but resting tension rose significantly between 10 and 20 minutes of ischemia. Reperfusion of glibenclamide-treated tissues elicited arrhythmias (extrasystoles and tachycardia), and the preparations failed to recover mechanical function. Glibenclamide at 1 microM produced qualitatively similar effects, albeit less severe. After 30 minutes of no-flow ischemia in untreated tissues, resting tension increased by approximately 130% during the no-flow period. Reperfusion caused arrhythmias (extrasystoles, tachyarrhythmias, and fibrillation) and failed to restore resting or developed tension to preischemic levels. Pinacidil at 1 microM did not affect electrical or contractile function, but at 10 microM it had a negative inotropic effect, decreasing APD90 and developed tension by 5% and 18%, respectively. Both concentrations of the drug caused a faster and greater decline in APD90 during the no-flow period. Resting tension did not change during 30 minutes of no-flow ischemia in the presence of pinacidil, and reperfusion led to 85% and complete recovery of electrical and mechanical activity at 1 and 10 microM, respectively. The data indicate that glibenclamide enhances whereas pinacidil reduces myocardial damage caused by ischemia/reperfusion. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of ATP-regulated K+ channels during ischemia is an important adaptive mechanism for protecting the myocardium when blood flow to the tissue is compromised. 
Islet amyloid polypeptide in proliferating pancreatic B cells during development, hyperplasia, and neoplasia in humans and mice. The occurrence of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) immunoreactivity was investigated in fetal pancreas, islet cell hyperplasia, and tumors in humans and mice. Transgenic mice heritably developing endocrine tumors of the pancreas (AVP/SV40, Rip 1 Tag2/Rip2PyST1 and Glu2-Tag strains) were used as murine models of islet cells proliferative disease. In the mouse, IAPP immunoreactivity was found in B cells at embryonic day 12 (E12), paralleling the onset of insulin immunoreactivity. In hyperplastic/dysplastic islets and in B-cell tumors of transgenic mice (n = 16), IAPP immunoreactivity was localized consistently to insulin-immunoreactive cells. Ultrastructural single- and double-immunogold labeling of transgenic mice B-cell tumors (n = 3) showed insulin and IAPP to be colocalized in beta granules. In human fetuses, IAPP immunoreactivity was found in insulin-immunoreactive B cells, but at a later gestational age than the onset of insulin immunoreactivity. In pancreatic specimens of infantile/neonatal persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (11 cases) and in pancreatic endocrine tumors (21 cases, 10 of which were functioning insulinomas), IAPP immunoreactivity was found consistently in insulin-immunoreactive B cells. Congo-red-positive amyloid deposits present in tumors also were IAPP immunoreactive. Ultrastructural single and double immunogold labeling of infantile/neonatal persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia cases (n = 3) and functioning insulinomas (n = 2) showed IAPP and insulin to be colocalized in beta granules. In addition, IAPP immunoreactivity was observed in amyloidlike fibrils. These findings indicate that IAPP is a constitutive component of B cells. Possible relationships between IAPP and insulin expression and interspecies differences are suggested and discussed. 
Effects of atriopeptidase inhibitor UK 79300 on left ventricular hydraulic load in patients with congestive heart failure. We investigated effects of the first orally active atriopeptidase inhibitor UK 79300 (Pfizer Clinical Research, UK) on left ventricular hydraulic load in patients with congestive heart failure NYHA II and III. In our study, 6 patients received 200 mg and 4 patients received 400 mg of UK 79300, and 4 patients received placebo (controls). Before and 90 min after oral administration of UK 79300 or placebo aortic input impedance was assessed to characterize left ventricular hydraulic load. Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) significantly increased by 126% after 200 mg and by 141% after 400 mg of UK 79300, but remained unchanged in control patients. Mean arterial pressure and flow, resistive term, characteristic impedance and oscillatory aortic input pressure power showed minor changes without statistical significance on an intergroup comparison. We conclude that acute atriopeptidase inhibition by UK 79300 effectively increases endogenous ANP levels up to 2.5-fold. However, these changes were not accompanied by significant effects on left ventricular hydraulic load. 
Weekly low-dose methotrexate therapy for cutaneous sarcoidosis. Three patients with severe, treatment-resistant cutaneous sarcoidosis were treated with low-dose oral methotrexate on a weekly basis. Facial granulomas and ulcerations responded best. A response was apparent after several weeks of treatment, but 6 to 9 months were required to reach maximal effect. 
Transurethral resection of prostatic abscess under sonographic guidance. Transrectal ultrasound may establish the diagnosis of prostatic abscess in an ambiguous clinical setting. Transurethral resection (deroofing) is the treatment preferred by many clinicians, yet intraoperative complete abscess obliteration may be difficult to confirm endoscopically. We report on a patient with a complex prostatic abscess endoscopically resected under transrectal ultrasound guidance. Adequacy of treatment was proved pathologically. 
Nucleotide deletion resulting in frameshift as a possible cause of complete thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency in six Japanese families. Complete T4-binding globulin deficiency (TBG-CD) is inherited in an X-linked fashion. A nucleotide substitution has been shown to cause this hereditary condition in caucasians of French Canadian origin. Heterogeneity in molecular mechanisms for TBG-CD has also been reported. Genomic DNA from a Japanese male exhibiting TBG-CD was subjected to polymerase chain reaction, and the generated DNA fragments were sequenced. A single nucleotide deletion was found in the first base of the codon for amino acid 352 of the common-type TBG molecule. This mutation causes a frameshift in translation and premature termination. Compared with common-type TBG, the mutated polypeptide results in 1) 22 different amino acids on its carboxy-terminus, 2) a 22-amino acid truncation, and 3) the absence of a potential N-linked glycosylation site. These alterations may lead to profound changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of the molecule. To ascertain the presence of this nucleotide deletion in the genomic DNA of affected subjects, a mutated primer was designed which together with the nucleotide deletion produced a new endonuclease restriction site in the polymerase chain reaction fragment. Results revealed the presence of the mutation in genomic DNA of the subject, and his mother was shown to have both mutant and normal alleles. The same mutation was also detected in five other unrelated families carrying TBG-CD. This mutation may be frequent in Japanese subjects with TBG-CD. 
Spectrum of intestinal failure in a specialised unit. 300 consecutive admissions over 7 years to a purpose-built intestinal failure unit are reviewed. The commonest underlying condition was Crohn's disease (42%), and the commonest complication precipitating admission was intestinal fistula (42%). Total parenteral nutrition was used in 85% and surgery in 50%. A multidisciplinary approach to management gave a high success rate--90% of patients were discharged from hospital, although nearly 25% needed home parental nutrition. These results suggest that chronic intestinal failure should be managed in specialised units in the same manner as other types of organ failure. 
Efficacy of ketanserin in the therapy of Raynaud's phenomenon: thermometric data. After a two-week washout (WO) period with placebo 1 capsule/bid, 12 patients suffering from stable Raynaud's phenomenon were treated with ketanserin (K) 40 mg/bid for fifteen days. Blood pressure, heart rate, and laboratory parameters were evaluated at the end of each period. Patients used diary cards to record the number, duration, and intensity of attacks. Computerized thermometry of the fingers was evaluated at basal temperature after acclimatization, 23 degrees C for thirty minutes; after cold test, 10 degrees C for five minutes; and after thermal recovery, 23 degrees C for eighteen minutes. Results were analyzed statistically by use of Student's t-test for paired data (p less than 0.05). No marked changes were observed in the symptoms of the attacks, but K proved effective in significantly reducing the number and duration of daily attacks and in promoting their spontaneous regression. Thermometry revealed a parallel increase in temperatures, particularly basal and recovery values. The data suggest increased flow and decreased vasospasm following 5-HT2 receptor blockade. 
Chronic periaortitis presenting as common bile duct obstruction. The case of a 67 year old woman is reported who presented with cholestatic jaundice and was found to have, in addition, an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Only at necropsy did histopathology show chronic periaortitis as the aetiology of a pancreatic head mass which, during life, mimicked a pancreatic neoplasm obstructing the bile and pancreatic ducts. 
Synchronous hippocampal bursting reveals network excitability defects in an epilepsy gene mutation. A mutation at the tottering locus (tg, recessive, on chromosome 8) stimulates noradrenergic locus coeruleus axon terminal outgrowth and predisposes the brain to generalized spike-wave epilepsy in the young mouse. In an isolated synaptic circuit studied in vitro, the hyperinnervated mutant hippocampal pyramidal neurons respond normally when individually activated; however, latent neuronal signaling defects emerge during synchronous network bursting, revealing two conditional excitability phenotypes: a voltage-dependent prolongation of a complex synaptic response, the paroxysmal depolarizing shift, and a beta-adrenoreceptor-linked attenuation of the afterhyperpolarization. In this target brain region, the tg locus transforms neuronal excitability without altering measured intrinsic membrane properties, indicating that gene control of inherited epileptic traits may be mediated in part by activity-dependent modulation of network behavior favoring synchronous neuronal firing. 
The coronary artery response to implantation of a balloon-expandable flexible stent in the aspirin- and non-aspirin-treated swine model. Intracoronary stents may potentially alleviate some of the problems associated with coronary angioplasty. Since the anatomy and physiology of swine coronary arteries closely resemble those of humans, the response to implantation of the Glanturco-Roubin, balloon-expandable, flexible stent was studied in this model. Additionally, the effect of aspirin, 1 mg/kg/day orally, on this response was evaluated. Eighteen Hanford minature swine underwent stenting of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Two died within 24 hours of stent implantation. The 16 survivors were put to death at 4 (n = 4), 11 (n = 4), 28 (n = 4), 56 (n = 3), and 180 (n = 1) days. Angiographically, reduction of stent lumen diameter of 0.1 to 1.3 mm was observed and was maximum at 11 days, with gradual improvement at subsequent time periods. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and light microscopy showed early disruption of subjacent endothelium, and adherence of platelets to exposed subendothelium and stent wires. Microthrombi were readily apparent. At 11 days, intimal thickening, made up predominantly of smooth muscle cells with abundant extracellular matrix, was observed and covered the stent wires. At 28 days, regression of intimal thickening was apparent and a confluent endothelium with flow-directed orientation was seen. At 56 and 180 days, the luminal surface was smooth; intimal thickening averaged 525 microns over the stent wires and 55 microns away from the wires. Findings in aspirin-treated animals were similar to results in those that did not receive aspirin. Thus in this swine model, stent implantation results in a time-dependent and self-limited vascular response. 
Eccrine acrospiroma (clear cell hidradenoma) of the eyelid. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features. A 46-year-old man underwent excision of a left lower eyelid mass that had enlarged over a 2-month period. Pathologic examination showed the mass to be an eccrine acrospiroma, a benign adnexal tumor that rarely arises in the eyelid. Light microscopic and ultrastructural examination showed two types of cells to comprise the tumor: eosinophilic cells with intracytoplasmic tonofilaments, and clear cells with intracytoplasmic glycogen granules. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for cytokeratins AE 1,3, epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, and muscle specific actin in tumor cells. 
Diuretic agents versus beta-blockers. Comparison of effects on mortality, stroke, and coronary events. Three recently concluded large randomized clinical trials have compared the preventive effects of diuretic agents and beta-blockers in the treatment of approximately 22,000 subjects with hypertension. In the Medical Research Council trial, bendrofluazide (10 mg daily) was compared with a dose of propranolol (as much as 240 mg daily), a nonselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Two selective beta-blockers, atenolol (100 mg daily) and metoprolol (200 mg daily), were compared with bendrofluazide (5-10 mg daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (50-100 mg daily) in the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension trial. In the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, 160 mg of slow-release oxprenolol, a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was compared with a diuretic-based regimen not containing beta-blockers. In each trial, similar reductions in mean diastolic blood pressure were achieved with diuretic and beta-blocker treatment that lasted for several years. All-cause mortality and fatal and nonfatal stroke and coronary event rates were also similar in the treatment groups. Thus, it appears that beta-blockers are as effective as diuretic agents in improving survival and in preventing major morbid events. Regarding cigarette smoking and stroke incidence, observations based on post hoc subgroup analyses of the Medical Research Council trial were not supported by subgroup findings in the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension and the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension trials, and these observations should not form the basis for any treatment recommendations. 
The paradox of 'chronic unstable angina' secondary to an organizing intracoronary thrombus [published erratum appears in South Med J 1991 Sep;84(9):1074, 1160] We have described a case in which coronary vasospasm and the resultant endothelial shear stresses most likely caused plaque rupture and transient coronary occlusion at the site of a minor atherosclerotic narrowing. Remodeling then led to a long, complex stenotic lesion that included ruptured and dissected endothelium and organized thrombus. This led to severe anginal symptoms over a 3-month period, or the paradox of "chronic unstable angina." Angioplasty was difficult but eventually successful after pulsed high-pressure balloon inflations and intracoronary thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase. This case demonstrates that the clinical course of a patient with minor or insignificant coronary disease may be a dynamic process that cannot be entirely predicted even by recent invasive cardiac studies. 
Altered excitatory and inhibitory amino acid receptor binding in hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. We examined binding to excitatory amino acid and inhibitory amino acid receptors in frozen hippocampal sections prepared from surgical specimens resected from 8 individuals with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. The excitatory receptors studied included N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), strychnine-insensitive glycine, phencyclidine, and quisqualate. The inhibitory receptors studied were gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) and benzodiazepine. Excitatory and inhibitory amino acid receptor binding were differentially altered in the patients with temporal lobe epilepsy in comparison to 8 age-comparable autopsy control subjects, and changes in receptor binding were regionally selective in four areas. Binding to phencyclidine receptors associated with the NMDA channel was reduced by 35 to 70% in all regions in the hippocampi of the patients. In contrast, binding to the NMDA recognition site and its associated glycine modulatory site was elevated by 20 to 110% in the cornu ammonis (CA) 1 area and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of the patients. Binding to these sites was unaffected in area CA4. Binding to the quisqualate-type excitatory amino acid receptor was unchanged in all regions except the stratum lacunosum moleculare CA1, where it was increased by 63%. GABAA and benzodiazepine receptor binding was reduced by 20 to 60% in CA1 and CA4, but unchanged in dentate gyrus. The data indicate that excitatory and inhibitory amino acid receptors are altered in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. 
Isolation, physicochemical characterization and preclinical efficacy evaluation of soluble scleroglucan. Herein we describe the isolation, physicochemical characterization and preclinical evaluation of a water-soluble biologic response modifier extracted from Sclerotium glucanicum. Alkaline extraction of insoluble S. glucanicum exopolymers produced a soluble scleroglucan composed of a triple-helical beta-1,3-linked glucopyranose backbone with single beta-1,6-linked glucopyranosyl branches every third subunit. Scleroglucan has a weight average molecular mass of 1.56 x 10(6) Da, a weight average root mean square distance from the center of gravity of the molecule to its farthest elements of 51.8 nm, a polydispersity (weight-average molecular mass/number average molecular mass) of 1.83 and intrinsic viscosity of 3.081 dl/g. Scleroglucan (250 mg/kg, intravenously) stimulated in vivo murine macrophage phagocytic activity (66%, P less than .001) and increased in vitro macrophage tumor cytotoxicity against syngeneic tumor targets by 124% (P less than .05). Scleroglucan enhanced (P less than .001) murine bone marrow proliferation in a biphasic manner by up to 328%. Scleroglucan therapy increased survival of mice challenged with syngeneic lymphoma, melanoma or adenocarcinoma. AKR/J mice bearing syngeneic lymphoma (1 x 10(3) cells, intraperitoneally) demonstrated increased (P less than .001) long-term survival (100% vs. 0%, greater than 64 days). C57Bl/6J mice bearing syngeneic melanoma B16 (5 x 10(5) cells, subcutaneously) demonstrated increased long-term survival (64% vs. 0%, P less than .05). C57Bl/6J mice bearing syngeneic adenocarcinoma BW10232 (1 x 10(5) cells, subcutaneously) demonstrated increased (P less than .05) median survival time. In addition, scleroglucan prophylaxis increased resistance of mice to challenge with Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and mouse hepatitis virus A-59. Scleroglucan did not induce toxicity or hepatomegaly. We conclude that: 1) a branched, water-soluble beta-1,3-linked scleroglucan biologic response modifier can be extracted from S. glucanicum; 2) scleroglucan will stimulate immunity, modify experimental neoplastic disease and increase resistance to microbial challenge; and 3) scleroglucan shows promise as an immunopotentiating drug. 
Hypertrophic smooth muscle in the partially obstructed opossum esophagus. Excitability and electrophysiological properties. Partial obstruction of the opossum esophagus leads to thickening of the circular muscle, hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells, and diminution of the extracellular space. The pharmacological and electrophysiological properties of this hypertrophied muscle were studied. Carbachol produced phasic and tonic contractions of the circular muscle. The EC50 for tonic contractions was greater for hypertrophied than for normal muscle (21.1 +/- 3.9 mumol/L vs. 4.8 +/- 2.2 mumol/L; P less than 0.05). The resting membrane potential difference of hypertrophied muscle (-50.8 +/- 0.2 mV) was similar to that of normal muscle (-50.0 +/- 0.2 mV). Electrical stimulation of intrinsic nerves in the normal muscle produced a hyperpolarization followed by a depolarization of smooth muscle membrane potential. Hypertrophied muscle responded either with an attenuated hyperpolarization or no hyperpolarization, both of which were followed by a depolarization. The space constant in the long axes of the hypertrophied circular muscle cells was greater than normal (4.4 +/- 0.2 mm vs. 3.4 +/- 0.1 mm; P less than 0.001). The threshold potential for initiation of action potentials was more negative for hypertrophied (-43.2 +/- 0.4 mV) than for normal circular muscle (-41.6 +/- 0.2 mV; P less than 0.005). These data indicate that alterations in neuromuscular function accompany the hypertrophy of esophageal smooth muscle. 
Socioeconomic status and visual impairment among urban Americans. Baltimore Eye Survey Research Group. The Baltimore Eye Survey is a population-based study of ocular disorders conducted in East Baltimore, Md, designed to determine the prevalence and severity of vision loss and ocular disease and their relationships to socioeconomic and other risk factors. This survey comprised 5300 subjects (2911 whites and 2389 blacks). Visual impairment was associated with age, race, general health status, educational level, income, and employment status. An identified association of race with blindness and visual impairment was reduced, but not eliminated, after adjustment for these socioeconomic factors, indicating that socioeconomic status itself is an important determinant of visual impairment. 
Choledocholithiasis in cirrhotic patients: is endoscopic sphincterotomy the safest choice? Of the 18 endoscopic sphincterotomies performed on 18 cirrhotic patients for choledocholithiasis, a mortality rate of 16.6% was registered. However, this figure can be limited to 6.6% if we take only successful sphincterotomies (15/18, 83.3%) into account. After closely reviewing relevant literature, it would appear that operative mortality in comparable cases is much higher. We therefore recommend that endoscopic sphincterotomy, despite higher mortality rates when compared to the general population, should be the initial choice of management of choledocholithiasis in cirrhotic patients. 
The coexistence of tics and dystonia. We studied nine patients with motor and phonic tics and other features of Tourette's syndrome, who developed persistent dystonia in addition to their tics. All, except one, were males (mean age, 35.8 years; range, 8 to 59 years), and had onset of tics prior to age 18 years (mean age, 9 years; range, 1.5 to 17 years). None of the patients were treated with neuroleptic drugs prior to the onset of dystonia. Torticollis and blepharospasm were the most common forms of dystonia. Seven patients had a history of tics in first degree relatives. While these patients were seen in a specialized movement disorder clinic and may, therefore, represent a population with atypical and more severe symptoms, the high prevalence rate of dystonia (5.0% of all patients with Tourette's syndrome seen in the clinic) suggests that some patients with tics may have an increased risk for dystonia. 
Morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass in octogenarians. One hundred fifty seven consecutive octogenarians (mean age +/- standard deviation, 82.4 +/- 1.9 years) underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with hypothermia (mean temperature, 21.8 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees C), hyperkalemic cardioplegia, and cardiopulmonary bypass in a 9-year period. Sixty-six percent were male. Preoperatively, 115 patients (73%) were in New York Heart Association functional class IV, with the remainder being in either class III (23%) or class II (4%). Twenty percent of the patients had major complications including postoperative hemorrhage (15), sepsis (9), cerebrovascular accident (6), third-degree heart block (5), renal failure requiring dialysis (1), and pulmonary embolism (1). The 30-day or in-hospital mortality rate was 7.0%. Mean total hospital stay was 26.1 +/- 17.9 days. One-year and 5-year actuarial survival rates were 85% and 62%, respectively. Higher mortality was seen to be associated with New York Heart Association class IV, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.40, and lesser values for cardiac output and cardiac index. At the 6-month postoperative follow-up, 73% of the survivors reported that their general health had improved as compared with before operation. This experience demonstrates that for select octogenarians with unmanageable angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass grafting is an effective therapeutic option. 
Congestive heart failure. New frontiers. Congestive heart failure is a common syndrome with high mortality in its advanced stages. Current therapy includes the use of vasodilator drugs, which have been shown to prolong life. Despite current therapy, mortality remains high in patients with severe heart failure. Potent new inotropic vasodilators have improved ventricular performance but have not prolonged life in patients with end-stage heart failure. Serious arrhythmias are implicated in the sudden deaths of 30% to 40% of patients with severe heart failure, but the benefits of antiarrhythmic therapy have not been established. Upcoming trials will address this question. Ventricular remodeling and progressive dilatation after myocardial infarction commonly lead to congestive heart failure; early unloading of the ventricle with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor may attenuate these events. These findings support the concept that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be useful in managing heart failure of all degrees of severity, including left ventricular dysfunction and end-stage heart failure. Part of the damage that may occur with acute myocardial infarction, particularly in this era of thrombolysis therapy, is reperfusion injury, which may be mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals. Better knowledge of the mechanisms and treatment of myocardial infarction, the leading cause of congestive heart failure, may help prevent or attenuate the development of this syndrome. 
Appendectomy during pregnancy: a Swedish registry study of 778 cases. Data from three Swedish health care registries--the Medical Birth Registry, the Registry of Congenital Malformations, and the Hospital Discharge Registry--were linked for the 9-year period 1973-1981 to identify women who had appendectomy during pregnancy and their offspring, and to determine several pregnancy outcomes (gestational duration, birth weight, perinatal mortality, and congenital anomalies). Among the 720,000 deliveries during this period, 778 were complicated by appendectomy (one in 936), and the diagnosis of appendicitis was confirmed in 64% of the cases (one in 1440). Significant findings included: 1) an increase in the risk of delivery the week after appendectomy when the operation was performed after 23 weeks' gestation, with no further increase if the pregnancy continued beyond 1 week; 2) a decrease in mean birth weight of 78 +/- 24 g with more infants than expected weighing less than 3000 g; 3) an increase in the number of live-born infants dying within 7 days of birth; 4) no increase in the number of stillborn infants; and 5) no increase in the number of congenitally malformed infants. 
Babesiosis. Diagnostic pitfalls. A case of babesiosis complicated by quinine-induced hemolysis is described. A splenectomized woman contracted babesiosis after visiting an endemic area. The patient presented with high fevers and minimal hemolysis. While she was on treatment, the hemolysis increased. The increased hemolysis was initially attributed to babesiosis, but after additional evaluation quinine therapy was found to be the cause. In the setting of this brisk hemolysis, there was an increase in red blood cell inclusions. At first, the inclusions were thought to be Babesia, but iron stain demonstrated that many of the inclusions were hemolysis-induced Pappenheimer bodies. The role of the clinical laboratory in sorting out this confusing picture is presented. 
The effect of interleukin-1 on adhesion formation in the rat. The potential role of interleukin-1 in postoperative adhesion formation was examined. Cecal abrasion gave a consistently higher adhesion score when compared with sham laparotomy, on the basis of adhesion number, density, and vascularity, and so was chosen for use in further studies. The extent of serosal bleeding during cecal abrasion did not affect adhesion scores. Intraperitoneal injection of 10 micrograms murine recombinant interleukin-1 alpha in cecally abraded animals on the day of surgery and on the following 4 days resulted in a significant increase in adhesion scores when compared with those of cecally abraded animals injected with vehicle alone. Adhesions enhanced with murine recombinant interleukin-1 alpha, which were thicker and more vascular, were equivalently enhanced at doses from 10 to 10,000 ng, implying maximal response over that range. Rats not operated on and receiving recombinant interleukin-1 alpha 2 weeks after injury had increased adhesion formation. These results demonstrate that interleukin-1 alpha may be an important short-term mediator of postsurgical adhesion formation. 
Patterns of failure in Hancock pericardial bioprostheses. A series of Hancock pericardial valve bioprostheses was reviewed for cases of primary valve failure. Thirteen mitral and 10 aortic valve explants were recovered from 21 adult patients. Mitral valves had been in place for a mean of 56.4 months, and aortic valves for 53.8 months. All valves failed with cusp tears from stents (with a mean of 1.7 for mitral valves and 2.6 for aortic valves) in a predictable pattern, suggesting that wear and stress at cusp stitch sites are important in their pathogenesis. The topography of these tears is illustrated as are the less common associates of primary failure, such as calcification, fibrosis, and thrombosis. Similarities and differences of this valve's failure compared with that of the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial valve are discussed. 
Carotid endarterectomy in elderly patients Between 1971 and 1989, 749 carotid endarterectomies were performed at our institution for symptomatic carotid occlusive disease in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these procedures, 693 were done in patients 71 through 80 years of age, and 56 were done in patients between the ages of 81 and 90 years. The neurologic morbidity and perioperative mortality in the former group were 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively, whereas in the latter group the corresponding values were 5.4% and 0%, respectively. For the entire group, the neurologic morbidity was 3.1% and the mortality was 1.3%. Of the 23 new postoperative neurologic deficits, 19 (83%) occurred in high-risk patients with severe preoperative neurologic or medical risks, and 14 (61%) of these deficits were minor. In selected elderly patients with symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusive disease, endarterectomy seems to be a safe procedure that is associated with acceptably low perioperative morbidity and mortality. 
Cost analysis of microsurgical reconstruction in the head and neck. In a cost-conscious environment, pressure exists to justify the use of expensive techniques such as reconstructive microsurgery in head and neck patients. Therefore, the costs and effectiveness of 39 consecutive free tissue transfers in patients with head and neck defects due to neoplasia (77%), trauma (13%), or congenital causes (10%) were assessed by reviewing clinical and billing records. The technical success rate was 95% with a 29% rate of complications. Most patients returned to preoperative levels of social activities, and none admitted dissatisfaction with their results. Average cost was $27,000 per case with 16 days of hospitalization. Average cost for aerodigestive tract tumors was $37,400 with 21 days of hospitalization. Costs were directly related to the etiology of the defect and incidence of complications. Applying cost-effectiveness principles we believe that these costs are justified by the high level of patient satisfaction and enhanced quality of life. 
Mitral valve replacement six years after cardiac transplantation. A 33-year-old man found to have increasing mitral regurgitation and decreasing exercise tolerance 6 years after cardiac transplantation received a mitral bioprosthesis. For 8 months he has been without complications from the valve replacement and is clinically and hemodynamically considerably improved. 
Cerebral Doppler studies in the fetus and newborn infant. The goal of developing reliable commercial Doppler systems for measuring vessel diameter and velocity changes during the cardiac cycle appears to be near. Reaching this goal would enable us to obtain volume-flow information continuously. In animal experiments, continuous measurements of Doppler velocity, pressure, and flow add important insights into hemodynamic measurements. Incorporating Doppler methods in microcirculatory research could also provide a link between the microcirculatory and the macrocirculatory hemodynamic research. Although Doppler methods have been validated, Doppler findings in clinical research (using commercial systems) must be considered at best to reflect qualitative circulatory alterations indicating directions of change. Because of inherent technologic limitations and considerable intersubject and intrasubject variability, direct extrapolation of the numeric findings from one study to the other can lead to misleading conclusions. The Doppler results are also influenced by measurement conditions and equipment settings. However, Doppler-derived information can be used as an adjunct to clinical management in many of the diseases discussed above. As with any physiologic variable, serial measurements probably are of greater value than single measurements. With continued improvement in technology, Doppler methods hold promise of becoming an important adjunct in cerebral hemodynamic monitoring in perinatal-neonatal intensive care units. 
US-guided transvaginal drainage of pelvic abscesses and fluid collections. Ultrasound (US)-guided transvaginal needle or catheter drainage was performed in 14 women for a variety of pelvic abscesses and fluid collections; tubo-ovarian abscesses and postoperative collections were most common. Diagnosis was achieved in all 14 patients (100%), including one patient with suspected ovarian carcinoma who underwent only diagnostic needle aspiration and no therapeutic drainage. Abscesses or fluid collections were evacuated in 13 of 13 patients (100%) with either needle (n = 7) or catheter (n = 6) drainage (with appropriate antibiotics). Twelve of the 14 patients (86%) were spared an operation; surgery was undertaken in two patients for a persistent tubo-ovarian phlegmon. No major complications were associated with drainage. Catheters were removed an average of 6.7 days after insertion. The success, safety, and advantages of US-guided transvaginal drainage in our early experience suggest its use as an alternative to standard percutaneous catheter procedures to diagnose and drain certain pelvic abscesses and fluid collections. 
Ventricular arrhythmias during treatment with alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) in suspected acute myocardial infarction. Continuous electrocardiography during the first 24 hours of a stay in a coronary care unit was used to record ventricular arrhythmias during treatment with alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) or placebo. Recordings were made on 378 of the 436 patients admitted to a double blind trial of alteplase or placebo in one participating centre of the Anglo-Scandinavian study of early thrombosis (ASSET), patients being selected according to the availability of recorders. Of these, 309 (158 given alteplase and 151 placebo) had greater than 5 hours of analysable data. Most of the arrhythmias were recorded in patients with an in hospital diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Ventricular couplets and ventricular tachycardia were significantly more common in the patients treated with alteplase. Further, in patients with myocardial infarction who had ventricular extrasystoles, couplets, or ventricular tachycardia type a, the number of hours in which each arrhythmia was recorded was significantly higher in the alteplase group. The various ventricular arrhythmias in the alteplase group tended to cluster in the first 4-12 hours of the recordings. During the first 24 hours admission there were four episodes of ventricular fibrillation in the alteplase group and five in the placebo group of taped patients. By one month there had been 18 deaths in these 309 patients (alteplase four, placebo 14). These bore no relation to any recorded arrhythmia. Clinical records for the patients with no or minimal tape data yielded six further episodes of ventricular fibrillation during the first 24 hours (three in the alteplase group and three in the placebo group). 
Quantitation of vascular outflow by measurement of impedance. One of the most important determinants of graft patency is the degree and character of vascular outflow. This study was designed to evaluate input impedance as a functional assessment of the outflow bed of vascular grafts. Four distinct outflow environments were created for external jugular vein conduits in 42 New Zealand white rabbits. Vein grafts (n = 14) were fashioned as end-to-side common carotid interposition bypass grafts. Arteriovenous fistulas (n = 15) were created by side-to-side anastomosis of the distal common carotid artery and linguofacial vein. Arteriovenous fistulas with outflow obstruction (n = 7) were fistulas with a metal clip partially obstructing the distal outflow channel (1 mm lumen). Vein graft/arteriovenous fistula combinations (n = 6) consisted of a vein graft and arteriovenous fistula in series. Pressure and flow in the external jugular vein were measured, and input impedance spectra were calculated by Fourier methods. By use of a PC-based acquisition and processing system, impedance results for 20 cardiac cycles could be obtained in approximately 10 minutes. The results revealed that vein grafts typically demonstrated high resistance to steady state flow (Rin = 235 +/- 50 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5) and steadily decreasing impedance to pulsatile flow resulting in a characteristic impedance (Z0; average of fourth to tenth harmonics) of 35.5 +/- 8.0 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5. Phase angle values were usually negative, especially at low harmonics (first harmonic phase angle = -1.11 +/- 0.10 radians) indicating that flow led pressure. In contrast, arteriovenous fistula Rin was minimal (6.3 +/- 1.4 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5; p less than 0.05 compared to vein graft, and the impedance was flat across the frequency spectrum (Z0 = 8.5 +/- 1.5 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5; p less than 0.05) with pressure and flow nearly in phase (first harmonic phase angle = -0.05 +/- 0.10 radians). Creation of outflow obstruction in arteriovenous fistulas resulted in significantly elevated Rin (136 +/- 41 x 10(3) dyne/sec . cm-5; p less than 0.05 compared to arteriovenous fistula and Z0 (23 +/- 9 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Gliofibroma. Case report. The case history of an infant with a large gliofibroma is presented. Gliofibromas are rare mixed glialmesenchymal tumors that have been poorly characterized. The computerized tomography appearance and a detailed light and electron microscopic description are presented, along with immunoperoxidase studies of this tumor. This case is compared with gliofibromas described elsewhere in the literature. 
Paget's disease of the nipple. A total of 48 women with Paget's disease of the nipple (nipple eczema containing Paget cells but without a palpable lump) presented to one surgeon over a 13-year period. Temporary healing of the nipple eczema occurred in six patients. In all, 21 of 34 patients with in situ (DCIS) or invasive ductal carcinoma had mammographic abnormalities. Treatment was by simple mastectomy (37 cases), cone excision of the nipple-areola complex (ten cases) and tamoxifen (one case). DCIS was found in 45 operative specimens (96 per cent); eight had associated invasion. The DCIS was predominantly large cell solid/comedo in type and was multifocal in seven cases (19 per cent). At a median (range) follow-up of 56 (18-96) months, four of the ten patients treated by cone excision have developed a local recurrence, two of these patients have also developed metastases. Two of the 37 patients who underwent mastectomy developed loco-regional recurrences; both had invasive foci at their first operation and remain disease free at 8 years. We no longer feel that cone excision is appropriate treatment. 
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to superior mesenteric artery to duodenum fistula: rare complication of metastatic lung carcinoma. Although metastases from primary carcinoma of the lung to the small intestine appear to be more common than previously suspected, they rarely produce symptoms. Such metastases may present as bowel perforations. Overt gastrointestinal bleeding has been described only as a prelude to perforation. We describe the case of a 55-yr-old man with carcinoma of the lung that had metastasized to the brain and to the third part of the duodenum. The duodenal metastasis presented with massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The metastasis was seen to be actively bleeding at endoscopy, and a direct fistula from a branch of the superior mesenteric artery to the third part of the duodenum was shown angiographically. Arterial invasion and destruction by tumor was confirmed at postmortem examination. This complication of metastatic carcinoma of the lung has not been previously described in the English literature. 
Regulation of jun-B expression by a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent mechanism in human myeloid cells. The present studies have examined the regulation of the jun-B early response gene by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathways. The 2.0-kb jun-B transcript was at low but detectable levels in uninduced human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. In contrast, treatment with 1 mmol/L8-bromo-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase, was associated with increases in jun-B transcripts that were maximal by 1 hour and then decreased to near pretreatment levels by 6 hours. Similar findings were obtained with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-cAMP) and N6,2'-0-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (dBt-cAMP). jun-B transcripts were also increased with other agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and forskolin. Moreover, inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase by the isoquinolinesulfonamide H-8 blocked 8-Br-cAMP-induced increases in jun-B expression. The results of nuclear run-on assays demonstrate that treatment of HL-60 cells with PGE2, forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, and dBt-cAMP is associated with increases in the rate of jun-B transcription. The present findings also demonstrate that the related jun-D gene is similarly regulated by a cAMP-dependent pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is involved in the induction of jun gene expression in myeloid leukemia cells. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Proposed guidelines for monitoring toxicity. The most common toxicities of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are gastropathy, renal dysfunction, and liver function abnormalities. We outline an approach to monitoring patients on long-term NSAID therapy, focusing on the early detection of complications. Gastropathy caused by NSAID use is more common in elderly patients or those with a history of dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, or alcohol abuse. Fecal occult blood testing and hemograms are less accurate in detecting gastropathy than direct visualization but are convenient and relatively inexpensive. We recommend the periodic use of these tests to detect NSAID-induced acute or chronic blood loss. Renal toxicity is seen in patients with preexisting renal disease or functional volume depletion and in the elderly. Complications include renal insufficiency, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and protein-uria. Renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of NSAID therapy, especially in high-risk patients, with periodic testing thereafter. Hepatic toxicity is less common but warrants occasional determinations of alanine aminotransferase levels. Elderly patients and those with renal insufficiency or alcohol abuse have a higher risk of complications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be used cautiously in those patients at high risk for complications. Strategies can be used to limit toxicity. Patients taking these drugs long term should be monitored periodically for signs of blood loss, renal dysfunction, and hepatic dysfunction. 
Renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena caval involvement. Renal cell carcinoma extends into the lumen of the inferior vena cava in approximately 4% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Surgical removal of the intracaval tumor thrombus with radical nephrectomy is the preferred treatment for this malignancy. From January 1977 to June 1990, 31 such patients were examined for combined problems of renal carcinoma and intracaval tumor extension. Twenty-six of these patients underwent radical nephrectomy and vena caval thrombectomy. Ten patients had tumor thrombus confined to the infrahepatic vena cava, 11 had retrohepatic caval involvement, and 5 had extension to the level of the diaphragm or into the right atrium. Surgical approach was dictated by the level of caval involvement. Control of the suprahepatic vena cava plus temporary occlusion of hepatic arterial and portal venous inflow were necessary in some cases; cardiopulmonary bypass was required for transatrial removal of more extensive tumors. Five of the 26 patients had evidence before operation of distant metastatic disease; none of these survived beyond 12 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of the 21 patients without known preoperative metastatic disease was 57%. Complete surgical excision of all gross tumor appears to be critical for long-term survival in these patients. 
Endocrine response determines the clinical outcome of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone ovulation induction in different ovulatory disorders. To accrue systematic information in different ovulatory disorders on the precise relationship among endocrine response, clinical outcome, and the occurrence of complications, we treated 114 patients with pulsatile GnRH (2.5-5.0 micrograms, iv, every 60 min) for 187 cycles and compared them to 20 normal menstrual cycles. Thirty of these patients had primary hypogonadotropic amenorrhea (PHA; 40 cycles), 33 had other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH; 55 cycles), and 51 had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; 92 cycles). Daily blood samples were drawn for hormone determinations. In PCOS, 50 cycles were preceded by GnRH analog suppression. PHA treatment cycles were characterized by the reestablishment of a normal endocrine pattern, almost no dose-related endocrine differences, elevated ovulatory (93%) and conception rates (23%), and no multiple pregnancies. In the HH subjects the ovulatory (91%) and pregnancy rates (31%) were high; however, while the lower GnRH dose elicited a normal endocrine pattern, the 5-micrograms dose induced excessive folliculogenesis and high estradiol levels and was associated with most of the multiple pregnancies of this study (three of four). GnRH analog suppression was successfully used to avoid recurrence of ovarian over-stimulation in two HH subjects. Finally, GnRH analog suppression in PCOS permitted normalization of the follicular phase endocrine pattern, achievement of good ovulatory (76%) and pregnancy (28%) rates, and avoidance of multiple pregnancies; however, luteal phase steroid secretion was abnormal, and the abortion rate remained elevated (43%). Obesity was associated with a reduced ovulatory rate in PCOS, but not in hypogonadotropic, subjects. Thus, we can conclude that in pulsatile GnRH ovulation induction: 1) a profound hypogonadotropic condition, whether spontaneous as in PHA or induced with GnRH analogs as in other ovulatory disorders, is associated with optimal menstrual cycle restoration, high ovulatory and conception rates, and virtually absent risks of multiple pregnancy; 2) residual hypothalamic activity in HH may be responsible for supraphysiological pituitary-ovarian stimulation and result in multiple pregnancy unless a low GnRH dose (2.5 micrograms/bolus) or GnRH analog pretreatment is employed; 3) obesity does not affect treatment outcome in hypogonadotropic patients; and 4) the high spontaneous abortion rate in PCOS may be related to corpus luteum dysfunction. 
Decreasing survival benefit from cardiac transplantation for outpatients as the waiting list lengthens. Many patients are accepted for cardiac transplantation during a period of clinical instability associated with a high risk of death, even though most can be discharged home to await transplantation. As the waiting lists lengthen, priority is awarded solely on the basis of the waiting time of outpatients, who now usually undergo transplantation after they have already survived a major period of jeopardy. To determine the impact of the current waiting times and priority system on the previously expected benefit offered by transplantation, 1-year actuarial survival without transplantation was recalculated after each month without transplantation for 214 potential candidates with an ejection fraction of 0.17 +/- 0.05 discharged on tailored medical therapy after evaluation. These data were compared with the 1-year survival data of 88 outpatients who underwent transplantation. Actuarial survival after 1 year was 67% on tailored therapy compared with 88% after transplantation (p = 0.009). Death without transplantation was sudden in 43 of 51 patients, resulting from hemodynamic decompensation in 8. For outpatients already surviving 6 months without transplantation, actuarial survival over the next 12 months was 83% without transplantation. Thus, the expected improvement in survival after transplantation would be only 5% over the subsequent year for patients waiting 6 months, which is the waiting time for many outpatients. Such patients should be reevaluated to determine whether transplantation remains indicated during the next year. 
Immunohistochemical detection of transforming growth factor-beta 1 in fibrotic liver diseases. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 was localized by means of immunohistochemical reaction in liver biopsy specimens taken from patients having different chronic liver diseases with extending fibrosis. Two polyclonal antibodies that were produced in rabbits were directed against the amino terminal of transforming growth factor-beta 1. Staining by anti-CC(1-30) was primarily extracellular and located in the portal and periportal fibrotic areas of all seven cases with chronic active hepatitis. No staining was noted in the four chronic persistent cases studied. A strong reaction was seen with the antibody in nine of the ten cirrhotic samples, whereas it was negative in one inactive cirrhosis case and in all five cases with normal liver histological findings. No positive staining could be detected by the anti-LC(1-30) in any of the liver tissues. Detection of transforming growth factor-beta 1 in active liver diseases at the site of fibrosis suggests that transforming growth factor-beta 1 might have a role in the process and progression of fibrosis during the development of the disease. 
DNA ploidy and cell kinetic measurements as predictors of recurrence and survival in stages B2 and C colorectal adenocarcinoma. DNA content and cell proliferation were measured by flow cytometry on paraffin-embedded Stage B2 or C colorectal adenocarcinomas from 694 patients enrolled in adjuvant trials conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Patients with diploid tumors had a higher survival rate than those with nondiploid tumors (P less than 0.001). The proliferation index (the sum of the percent of cells in S-phase plus those in G2M phase) was also a strong prognostic factor (P less than 0.001). The ploidy and proliferation data were combined, and the patients in the favorable group (diploid and low proliferative index) had a 5-year survival of 74% compared with 54% for the unfavorable group (high proliferative index or nondiploid, P less than 0.001). This grouping was prognostic for survival in B2 (P less than 0.001), C (P = 0.013), colon (P less than 0.001), and rectal (P = 0.026) patient subsets. This study indicates that cell kinetic parameters are important and independent prognostic factors for Stages B2 and C colorectal cancer. 
Bilateral perilymph fistula in an adult. Sudden hearing loss is a symptom caused by a variety of diseases, among them also a perilymph fistula. The occurrence of bilateral perilymph fistula is rare, and was reported only associated with head trauma. A case of a bilateral perilymph fistula, without head trauma in an adult construction worker is reported. To the best of our knowledge this is the first bilateral case caused by physical effort to be reported in the literature. 
Comparison of lumbar plexus block versus conventional opioid analgesia after total knee replacement. A randomised controlled study was undertaken to assess the analgesic efficacy of continuous lumbar plexus block for the first 48 hours after total knee replacement surgery. Boluses of 0.5% bupivacaine with adrenaline 1 in 200,000 (0.3 ml/kg) were administered through a cannula inserted into the neurovascular sheath of the femoral nerve. Thirteen patients who received this block required significantly less morphine than a control group of 16 patients. Pain scores were similar and there were no complications related to this technique. 
Lovastatin-associated rhabdomyolysis. Lovastatin is a new drug that has become popular for the treatment of patients with hyperlipidemias. Rhabdomyolysis is a well-documented and potentially dangerous side effect of lovastatin therapy. Critical care nurses should be aware of the symptoms and treatment of rhabdomyolysis. Patients receiving lovastatin should be instructed to report muscle pain or weakness and dark urine immediately. It should be determined whether patients are at risk for development of rhabdomyolysis from other causes so that lovastatin can be withheld. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent serious complications in patients with lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis. 
Do primary dysfunctions in neural control of arterial pressure contribute to hypertension? This article is a summary of the physiological and clinical evidence that links the cause of essential hypertension to the brain. We stress the potential importance of a biochemical disturbance in the central role of angiotensin II in the regulation of arterial pressure. While the evidence is compelling, we acknowledge the need for further complete studies on this timely subject. 
Drug abuse and headache. Substance abuse has been reported frequently in chronic headache patients. The problem exists in most Western countries. Abuse of various compounds frequently leads to a state of dependency. Prescription as well as over-the-counter agents are often abused. Aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine are the most frequently abused compounds. Butalbital, ergot alkaloids, NSAIDS, and narcotic and oral or intranasal sympathomimetics are often abused. Patients with chronic daily headache complain of symptoms that may suggest a mixed-type headache. Features of migraine and muscle contraction headache often coexist in these individuals. It has been suggested that the most frequent cause for the transformation of a periodic headache into a daily headache is substance abuse. Substance abuse and drug dependency have multiple causes, and the etiology will reside with the compounds that are used to excess. The problem may arise as a result of poor instructions from the physician, improper diagnosis with gradual escalation in amounts of drug consumed, or a reinforcement mechanism and a brain stimulation-reward effect. The brain reward system has been studied with narcotics and psychomotor stimulants. It may be activated to a lesser degree with ergotamine, barbiturates, and other abused substances. The long-term effects of substance abuse are contingent on the compounds that are used. They may result in organ damage, medical complications, vascular injury, and a refractory state with chronic headache that eludes successful management of the headache disorder. Patients exhibit a less-than-satisfactory quality of life and are often depressed. Treatment includes outpatient care in cooperative, less dependent patients. Often patients will require inpatient management in order to discontinue use of the abused agents. Pharmacologic agents, behavior modification, psychotherapy, dietary intervention, and acupuncture may be necessary to treat the patient. Each patient must be treated by an interested physician, and the patient will require one or more of the preceding measures for a successful outcome. Often abused compounds must be discontinued in order to obtain a satisfactory response in an individual with chronic headache. 
Nutritional therapy for infants with diarrhea. The appropriate choice of treatment for infants with diarrhea has long provoked debate. Growth of infants with diarrhea is adversely affected by associated diseases including anorexia, malabsorption, catabolic response to infection, and iatrogenic starvation. To prevent the negative effects of diarrhea on the nutrition of infants, continued feeding during the active and early convalescent phases has been recommended. Although this concept is not new, until recently it has been little used in the treatment of diarrhea. In this article we examine the current knowledge about, and trends in, feeding infants with diarrhea. We will discuss treatments for the well-nourished infant with acute diarrhea, the infant with prolonged diarrhea, and the malnourished infant. Information regarding the use of local staples will also be provided. 
Restenosis after coronary angioplasty: a multivariate statistical model to relate lesion and procedure variables to restenosis. The M-HEART Investigators. The Multi-Hospital Eastern Atlantic Restenosis Trial group obtained follow-up angiography in 510 patients with 598 successfully dilated coronary lesions who were enrolled in a controlled trial of the effects of a single dose of 1 g of methylprednisolone on restenosis after coronary angioplasty. The overall restenosis rate was 39.6%. The strongest univariate relations to the restenosis rate were found for lesion location (saphenous vein graft, 68%; left anterior descending artery, 45%; left circumflex artery and right coronary artery, 32%; p = 0.002); lesion length (less than or equal to 4.6 mm, 33%; greater than 4.6 mm, 45%; p = 0.001); percent stenosis before angioplasty (less than or equal to 73%, 25%; greater than 73%, 43%; p = 0.005), percent stenosis after angioplasty (less than or equal to 21%, 33%; greater than 21%, 46%; p = 0.017) and arterial diameter (less than 2.9 mm, 44%; greater than or equal to 2.9 mm, 34%; p = 0.036). Two multivariate models to predict restenosis probability were developed with use of stepwise logistic regression. The preprocedural model, which included only variables whose values were known before angioplasty, entered lesion length, vein graft location, left anterior descending artery location, percent stenosis before angioplasty, eccentric lesion and arterial diameter. The postprocedural model, which also included variables whose values were known after angioplasty was performed, was similar to the preangioplasty model except that it also entered postangioplasty percent stenosis and "optimal" balloon sizing but did not enter eccentric lesion. These data indicate that the probability of restenosis after angioplasty is determined predominantly by the characteristics of the lesion being dilated. They are consistent with the known intimal proliferative mechanism of restenosis, offer a means of identifying lesions at unusually high or low risk of restenosis, and of predicting the likelihood that a particular lesion will restenose after angioplasty and provide a rationale for stratification by restenosis probability in the design of future studies of restenosis. 
Genetic dissection of susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in inbred mice. Mice of some inbred strains, such as 21-day-old DBA/2J mice, have generalized convulsions when exposed to intense auditory stimulation. Analysis of susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in BXD recombinant inbred strains has demonstrated the influence of at least three loci. One locus, Asp-1, is located on chromosome 12 between Ah and D12Nyu1; another locus, Asp-2, is on chromosome 4, tightly linked to b. Here we report evidence that Asp-2 is located within an 8-centimorgan segment distal to b and that Asp-3 is linked to Mtv-1 on chromosome 7. We also present evidence that these three loci account for most of the heritable variation in susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in crosses of DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice and that susceptibility to audiogenic seizures is influenced by genomic imprinting. Thus, genomic imprinting may complicate linkage and mapping studies and should be considered in analyses of complex modes of inheritance. 
Genetically determined steady-state interaction between encainide and quinidine in patients with arrhythmias. A genetically determined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between quinidine and single doses of encainide in healthy volunteers has previously been described. In subjects with the extensive metabolizer phenotype, quinidine blunted encainide-induced QRS prolongation (a marker of sodium channel block) because it impaired encainide biotransformation to the potent active metabolites O-desmethyl encainide (ODE) and 3-methoxy-O-desmethyl encainide. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that quinidine would inhibit sodium channel block (and by inference arrhythmia suppression) during encainide therapy in patients with the extensive metabolizer phenotype. Surprisingly, however, in eight extensive metabolizer patients, the extent of QRS prolongation during chronic encainide therapy was unaltered by quinidine (139 +/- 21 vs. 139 +/- 22 msec) whereas arrhythmia suppression was enhanced (64 +/- 22 to 77 +/- 19%; P = .05). Plasma concentration data demonstrated that although encainide metabolism to ODE was partially impaired by quinidine, subsequent 3-methoxy-O-desmethyl encainide formation from ODE was virtually completely inhibited; thus steady-state plasma ODE remained unchanged whereas plasma encainide increased 10-fold (21 +/- 30 to 240 +/- 118 ng/ml; P less than .05). In contrast, no changes in disposition or in pharmacodynamics were observed in two poor metabolizers. It is concluded that the effect of this drug interaction in patients is determined by differential sensitivities to inhibition by quinidine of encainide O-demethylation and subsequent ODE 3-methoxylation. Evaluation of potential drug interactions should include assessment of possible genetic factors as well as of steady-state effects. 
Borrelia burgdorferi-associated cutaneous B cell lymphoma: clinical and immunohistologic characterization of four cases. Four patients with low-grade malignant B cell lymphoma of the skin in association with chronic Borrelia burgdorferi infection are presented. Plaque-shaped or nodular erythematous lesions with ill-defined borders were seen. Clinical progression was slow; the skin tumors occurred for up to 7 to 15 years. Extracutaneous involvement was found in only one case. Immunohistologic investigations showed an expression of B cell markers with restriction to only one light chain type and absence of T cell antigens. The growth fraction was 5% to 30%, as shown with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. The immunoarchitecture of the tumors in three patients was unusual compared with established criteria for cutaneous B cell lymphoma and revealed similarities to mucosa-associated B cell lymphoma. Some immunohistologic heterogeneity may indicate the development of monoclonal proliferation that originated from different phases of B lymphocytic differentiation. In three cases no clinical signs of B. burgdorferi infection were found; in one patient acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans was present. The occurrence of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and malignant lymphomas was frequently reported in the European literature before B. burgdorferi was recognized. These findings suggest a relation between B. burgdorferi infection and cutaneous B cell lymphoma. In geographic regions where infected ticks are present, borreliosis should be considered in patients with cutaneous B cell lymphoma. 
Clinical and angiographic observations on resuscitated victims of exercise-related sudden ischemic death. The clinical and angiographic findings of 17 resuscitated victims of exercise-related sudden ischemic death are reported in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism(s) of these deaths. Ten survivors developed cardiac arrest during or after sporting activities (group A) and 7 others during or after an exercise stress test (group B). There were 15 men and 2 women. The mean age of group A was 46 years and of group B 55 years. Coronary risk factors, as well as previous angina and myocardial infarction, were more frequent in group B. Only 3 of the 17 survivors had anginal symptoms before sudden death. Sudden death in group A was associated with acute myocardial infarction in 8 and unstable angina in 2 and was associated in group B with acute myocardial infarction in 2, unstable angina in 3 and silent ischemia in 2. Coronary angiography was acutely performed in 15 patients. In most patients the ischemia-related coronary artery was totally or subtotally occluded. Clinical and angiographic findings indicate that exercise-related sudden ischemic death was due to an acute coronary event--in most cases unexpected and unpredictable. It is suggested that exercise-induced intracoronary changes were probably responsible for the development of acute coronary (sub)occlusion and sudden death. 
Effect of tissue plasminogen activator on intimal platelet accumulation in cerebral arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage in cats. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator may be effective in preventing cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage by resolving subarachnoid clots. We previously demonstrated that blood placed on the adventitial surface of cerebral arteries enhances intimal platelet accumulation, positively correlating with endothelial damage and other pathologic changes in vessel walls. In this study, we investigated the ability of a single bolus injection of tissue plasminogen activator to prevent platelet accumulation in cerebral vessels after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was produced in cats by the transorbital intracisternal injection of 2.5 ml autologous arterial blood around the proximal part of the right middle cerebral artery. In 10 animals, 25 micrograms tissue plasminogen activator was injected at intervals of 10 (five cats) and 60 minutes (five cats) after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intracisternal physiological saline (0.5 ml) was injected in six cats 10 minutes after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Platelets labeled with indium-111 were injected intravenously just before subarachnoid hemorrhage, and their radioactivity was measured in cerebral arteries at death. The results indicated that, after subarachnoid hemorrhage, early injection of tissue plasminogen activator inhibited intimal platelet accumulation, but later injection did not, although the extent of subarachnoid clot was reduced at both plasminogen injection times. 
Murine monoclonal antibodies reactive with a variety of androgen independent Dunning rat prostate adenocarcinoma sublines also reactive with human prostate adenocarcinoma. Murine hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibody (MCA) to Dunning rat prostate adenocarcinoma R-3327HIS (androgen independent type) has been produced by fusing P3x63 Ag8-653 myeloma cells with splenocytes of BALB/c mice which were immunized with R-3327HIS tumor cell membranes. One monoclonal antibody designated MCA-R1 (IgG2a subtype) produced an intense immunostaining of various androgen independent Dunning rat prostate tumor sublines (HIS, HIM, HIF, AT-1, AT-2, AT-3, MAT-Lu and MAY-Ly-Lu), but did not stain other tumors of rat origin or normal rat tissues. Marginal immunostaining was detected in the androgen responsive R-3327H and R-3327G tumor subline. Although MCA-R1 antibody did not react with the regressed prostate tumor of R-3327H or R-3327G, it strongly reacted with the relapsed prostate tumor from either R-3327H or R-3327G tumor derived from rats were treated with diethyl stilbestrol (DES) or castration. MCA-R1 antibody also produced a strong cross-reaction with human prostate adenocarcinoma. Like the Dunning rat tumor, human adenocarcinoma exhibited distinct immunostaining patterns with respect to intracellular localization among well differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated tumor. Benign prostatic hyperplasia or other normal tissues did not stain. Immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and radioautographic analysis revealed that the Dunning rat prostate tumor antigen recognized (m.wt. 50 and 120 Kd) by MCA-R1 antibody are localized on both cell surface and in the cytoplasm. This MCA may represent a potential reagent for the study of tumor biology and immunotherapy of prostate tumor. 
Clinical features of Behcet's disease. Report of four cases. Behcet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. The unifying histologic reaction pattern is a leukocytoclastic vasculitis that affects predominantly the skin, oral mucosa, and eyes. Many other sites of involvement have been reported but are inconsistently found in individual patients. Early recognition and treatment of Behcet's disease may help prevent devastating permanent sequelae such as blindness. Because oral involvement is often the first manifestation of this disorder, dental practitioners are in a unique position to help these patients. We report four cases of Behcet's disease in North American patients. Diagnostic criteria and treatment options are reviewed. 
Neglected topics in the treatment of chronic pain patients--relapse, noncompliance, and adherence enhancement. Although published treatment outcome studies for chronic pain have provided favorable support for the efficacy of many pain clinics and the use of specific modalities such as biofeedback and relaxation, there are several factors that mitigate against euphoria. Two related factors that influence interpretation of these reported outcomes are discussed, namely, noncompliance with therapeutic recommendations during treatment and subsequent to treatment termination, and relapse. Conceptual and methodological problems for establishing the prevalence of noncompliance and relapse are reviewed. Several factors that contribute to noncompliance (individual differences, nature of disease or injury, characteristics of the prescribed treatment regimen, health-care provider-patient relationship, and contextual) are discussed. The literature reveals that noncompliance with treatment regimens is quite prevalent across diverse treatment modalities and pain syndromes. The incidence of relapse following initially successful treatment of persistent pain also appears to be high, ranging from 30% to 60%. Studies on arthritis and heterogeneous pain clinic populations suggest that noncompliance and relapse are related; however, this association is less well established for headache patients. Strategies for assessing compliance (i.e., self-report, behavioral, biochemical, and clinical outcome) and the perspectives' of patients and health-care providers on the application of self-care recommendations are discussed. Strategic planning and adherence enhancement tactics to facilitate maintenance of post-treatment gains are described. 
Outbreaks of diarrheal illness associated with cyanobacteria (blue-green algae)-like bodies--Chicago and Nepal, 1989 and 1990. Recent reports have described the detection of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae)-like bodies (CLB) in the stools of persons with a prolonged syndrome of diarrhea, anorexia, and fatigue (1-3). In each of these reports, affected persons either were immunocompromised or had recently traveled to tropical countries. During 1989 and 1990, the first three reported outbreaks of this CLB-associated syndrome occurred in immunocompetent populations, affecting at least 150 persons. This report summarizes investigations of these outbreaks, which occurred in Chicago in 1990 and in Kathmandu, Nepal, in 1989 and 1990. 
Promoting heart health for Southeast Asians: a database for planning interventions. This paper is a report of baseline data that the authors collected on the prevalence of hypertension in a sample of 397 Southeast Asian immigrants residing in central Ohio and the implications of those data for the design of ethnically approved and scientifically valid interventions. The context for collection of these data over a 9-month period in 1989 is described. Baseline demographic characteristics including distributions by ethnicity, sex, age, and length of stay in the United States, as well as family heart health history, hypertension level, and heart health awareness of these subjects are presented. For example, 85 percent of the immigrants did not know what could be done to prevent heart disease. Implications for the design of ethnically approved and scientifically valid prevention strategies are discussed. Based on these data, the authors realized that multiple health education strategies tailored to what they were learning about Southeast Asians would be needed. Through Southeast Asian leaders, they were led to using wall calendars, with words specific to each Southeast Asian language, that had a monthly heart health slogan as one avenue to reach Southeast Asians. Another strategy was to develop videotapes featuring cultural content but including heart health "commercials." The authors concluded that, although scientific validity of risk reduction interventions are important, customizing these strategies to ethnically specific modes of interaction are equally important. 
Long-term assessment of right ventricular diastolic filling in patients with pulmonic valve stenosis successfully treated in childhood. Patients with severe pulmonic stenosis (PS) have right ventricular (RV) diastolic filling abnormalities detectable by tricuspid valve pulsed Doppler examination. To determine if these abnormalities persist long term after successful therapy of PS, 19 patients were examined 8 +/- 3 years after PS therapy. At the time of follow-up Doppler examination, the PS gradient was 15 +/- 8 mm Hg. From the tricuspid valve inflow Doppler study, the following measurements were obtained at peak inspiration: peak velocities at rapid filling (peak E) and during atrial contraction (peak A), ratio of peak E to peak A velocities, RV peak filling rate normalized for stroke volume, deceleration time, the fraction of filling in the first 0.33 of diastole as well as under the E and A waves, and the ratio of E to A area. Data from PS follow-up patients were compared with our previously reported data from 12 age-related control subjects and 14 untreated patients with PS. Patients with PS who were followed up had higher peak E velocity (0.75 +/- 0.14 vs 0.59 +/- 0.21 m/s), lower peak A velocity (0.47 +/- 0.09 vs 0.64 +/- 0.28 m/s), higher E/A velocity ratio (1.65 +/- 0.33 vs 1.11 +/- 0.52), higher 0.33 area fraction (0.52 +/- 0.08 vs 0.34 +/- 0.14), lower A area fraction (0.29 +/- 0.06 vs 0.45 +/- 0.21) and higher E/A area ratio (2.48 +/- 0.82 vs 1.73 +/- 1.05) than PS patients without treatment (p less than 0.03). All Doppler indexes of the patients with PS who were followed up were the same as those of the control subjects except for the peak E velocity that was slightly higher (0.75 +/- 0.14 vs 0.63 +/- 0.11 m/s), the peak A velocity that was slightly higher (0.47 +/- 0.09 vs 0.38 +/- 0.09 m/s) and the E/A area ratio that was slightly lower (2.48 +/- 0.82 vs 3.50 +/- 1.25) (p less than 0.03). Thus, at long-term follow-up, all RV diastolic filling indexes in successfully treated patients with PS improved compared with the untreated patients and approached values found in normal subjects. 
Endothelial cells express the interleukin-1 receptor type I. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) profoundly affects a number of functions of vascular cells. Two distinct IL-1 receptors (IL-1R) are expressed on different cell types: the 80 Kd IL-1RI on T cells and fibroblasts, and the 68 Kd IL-1RII on B cells and myelomonocytic cells. The presence and functionality of IL-1R on vascular cells has been investigated by using polyomatransformed mouse endothelial cell (EC) lines (sEnd.1 and tEnd.1). These cells expressed specific and saturable binding sites for IL-1 (1,273 sites per cell with kd 9.5 x 10(-11) mol/L for sEnd.1, and 771 sites per cell with kd 8.5 x 10(-11) mol/L for tEnd.1, with radioiodinated IL-1 alpha as ligand). Binding of IL-1 was also evident at single cell level by autoradiography. By cross-linking studies, the molecular weight of the IL-1 binding protein on EC was approximately 80 Kd. This was confirmed by the presence in EC of mRNA for the 80 Kd IL-1RI. The IL-1RI on EC was apparently functional, since EC responded to IL-1 with IL-6 mRNA expression and IL-6 bioactivity production. These results were extended to human EC and vascular smooth muscle cells, which were also found to express mRNA for IL-1RI. 
Physiological assessment of sensitivity of noninvasive testing for coronary artery disease. The sensitivity of three noninvasive tests for coronary artery disease was assessed by means of quantitative indexes of disease severity in three different groups of patients. The overall population consisted of 110 subjects with limited coronary artery disease and no myocardial infarction. Planar dipyridamole-201Tl scintigraphy was evaluated in 31 patients, computer-assisted exercise treadmill in 28, and high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography testing in 51. Sensitivity was assessed by rigorous gold standards to define disease severity, such as measurement of minimum cross-sectional area and percent area of stenosis, by quantitative computerized coronary angiography (Brown/Dodge method). On the basis of the results of previous studies, the presence of physiologically significant coronary artery disease was indicated by a stenotic minimum cross-sectional area (MCSA) of less than 2.0 mm2 or a greater than 75% area of stenosis. With MCSA as the gold standard, dipyridamole-201Tl scintigraphy, computerized exercise treadmill, and dipyridamole echocardiography testing showed sensitivities of 52%, 54%, and 61%, respectively, in the three different patient cohorts enrolled. With percent area of stenosis as the gold standard, the sensitivity figures obtained for dipyridamole-201Tl, computerized exercise treadmill, and dipyridamole echocardiography testing were 64%, 54%, and 69%, respectively. For each of the three tests, sensitivity increased with increasing lesion severity. Sensitivity was also better in patients with left anterior descending coronary (LAD) disease when compared with patients with left circumflex or right coronary artery disease. Results of these studies, which were obtained with more strict patient selection criteria and by more rigorous gold standards than previous studies, demonstrate that in patients with limited coronary artery disease none of the tests evaluated is definitely superior in sensitivity. 
Common complaints with cardiac implications in children. Chest pain, palpitations, and dizziness are not infrequent complaints in the office of a primary care physician. Historical events and physical findings can lead to a more accurate determination of cardiac causes of these symptoms. Electrocardiogram and chest radiographs are two additional tests most often helpful in determining cardiac causes of symptoms. 
Relationship between K-ras oncogene activation and smoking in adenocarcinoma of the human lung. To investigate a possible relationship between the exposure to tobacco smoke and the presence of ras point mutations, we examined lung adenocarcinoma samples from 27 smokers and from 27 nonsmokers. Activating point mutations in K-ras (also known as KRAS2) and N-ras (also known as NRAS) were determined by using the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotide hybridization to detect the mutated sequences. Mutations were more often found in adenocarcinomas obtained from smokers (eight of 27) than in adenocarcinomas obtained from nonsmokers (two of 27) (P = .044, Fisher's exact test). All mutations were present in K-ras codon 12. None of the other parameters examined differed significantly between the ras-positive and ras-negative groups. We conclude that exposure to carcinogenic agents in tobacco smoke is an important factor in the induction of point mutations in K-ras in human lung adenocarcinomas, but that K-ras mutations may also infrequently occur in tumors of non-smokers. 
Left main coronary artery and femoral artery vasospasm associated with cocaine use. A woman had diffuse vascular spasm related to cocaine use. She presented with evidence of an acute anterior myocardial infarction but had no rise in creatinine phosphokinase levels. Cardiac catheterization showed 90 percent proximal left main coronary artery narrowing. The catheterization was complicated by right femoral artery spasm. A repeat catheterization after treatment with nitroglycerin and diltiazem showed 30 percent proximal left main coronary artery narrowing. This catheterization was complicated by left femoral artery spasm. An exercise treadmill test was negative for ischemia. 
Decreased serum interleukin-2 level in patients with chronic headache. Some cellular immune functions are impaired in cluster headache patients. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a polypeptide secreted by antigen or mitogen-actuated T lymphocytes that functions as a growth factor for T cells. To investigate cellular immune functions in patients with chronic headache, we measured the IL-2 concentration of sera in patients with migraine and in patients with tension-type headache. Thirteen subjects suffering from migraine without aura (5 males and 8 females, mean age: 32.8 years) and 46 subjects (20 males and 26 females, mean age: 39.7 years) with tension-type headache (TH) were selected for this study. Forty-three normal healthy volunteers composed the control group (15 males and 28 females, average age 41.6 years). The IL-2 levels of sera were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques. The IL-2 levels of sera were 3.18 +/- 1.8 U/ml (mean +/- SD) in the healthy controls, 2.29 +/- 2.6 U/ml in the patients with migraine and 1.59 +/- 1.0 U/ml in the patients with TH. The serum level of IL-2 in the patients with migraine was significantly lower than in the controls. The serum level of IL-2 in the patients with TH was significantly lower than in the controls. The central nervous system (CNS) has been considered to be involved in the development of the immune phenomena. In the patients with TH or migraine, reduction in platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels and sympathetic hypofunction have been observed. These phenomena might reflect decrease in 5-HT levels in CNS in the patients with TH or migraine. The decreased serum IL-2 level, observed in this study, might reflect a reduction in 5-HT or catecholamine levels in CNS in the patients with migraine or TH. 
Tolerance and safety of pharmacologic coronary vasodilation with adenosine in association with thallium-201 scintigraphy in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Adenosine thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy is a promising test for coronary artery disease detection, but its safety has not been reported in large patient cohorts. Accordingly, the tolerance and safety profile of adenosine infusion were analyzed in 607 patients (351 men, 256 women, mean age 63 +/- 11 years) undergoing this test either because of suspected coronary artery disease (Group I, n = 482) or for risk stratification early (5.2 +/- 2.8 days) after myocardial infarction (Group II, n = 125). Adenosine increased the heart rate from 74.5 +/- 14.0 to 91.8 +/- 15.9 beats/min (p less than 0.001) and decreased systolic blood pressure from 137.8 +/- 26.8 to 120.7 +/- 26.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Side effects were frequent and similar in both groups. Flushing occurred in 35%, chest pain in 34%, headache in 21% and dyspnea in 19% of patients. Only 35.6% of Group I patients with chest pain during adenosine infusion had concomitant transient perfusion abnormalities, compared with 60.7% of Group II patients (p less than 0.05). First- and second-degree AV block occurred in 9.6% and 3.6% of patients, respectively, and ischemic ST changes in 12.5% of cases. Concomitance of chest pain and ischemic ST depression was uncommon (6%) but, when present, predicted perfusion abnormalities in 73% of patients. Most side effects ceased rapidly after stopping the adenosine infusion. The side effects were severe in only 1.6% of patients and in only six patients (1%) was it necessary to discontinue the infusion. No serious adverse reactions such as acute myocardial infarction or death occurred. 
The antinociceptive effects of spinally administered neuropeptide Y in the rat: systematic studies on structure-activity relationship. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36-amino-acid, C-terminal amidated peptide that is found in bulbospinal pathways and can inhibit the release of the primary afferent C-fiber neurotransmitter, substance P. Based on these observations, the present studies examined the possible antinociceptive effects of this peptide and several NPY fragments after intrathecal administration in rats prepared with chronic intrathecal catheters. In the 52 degrees C hot plate test, NPY produced a dose-dependent elevation in the nociceptive threshold with a median effective dose of 1.1 nmol. The ordering of fragments' activity was: NPY greater than NPY16-36 greater than or equal to NPY19-36 greater than or equal to NPY14-36 greater than or equal to NPY18-36 much greater than NPY1-36-OH = NPY18-36-OH = 0. In the paw pressure test, NPY was not active, even at the highest doses examined (median effective dose greater than 20 nmol), whereas the C-terminal fragments retained their potency and produced significant increases in the pressure required to evoke escape (NPY18-36: median effective dose = 18.7 nmol). The rank ordering of activity in the paw pressure test was: NPY19-36 greater than or equal to NPY14-36 greater than or equal to NPY18-36 greater than or equal to NPY16-36 much greater than NPY = NPY18-36-OH = 0. Peptide YY, human pancreatic polypeptide and avian pancreatic polypeptide behave similarly to NPY. 
Disappearance of thalamic pain after parietal subcortical stroke. A hypertensive man had a long standing history of contumacious hyperpathia in the right upper extremity, resistant to medical therapy, secondary to a lacunar infarct in the left thalamus. A second cerebrovascular accident caused a small lesion in the left corona radiata, interrupting the thalamoparietal interconnections, and terminated the pain instantly. Interruption of the subcortical parietal white matter may more effectively control pain than cortical lesions. A few surgeons have successfully treated rebellious chronic pain with stereotaxic operations in the corona radiata, resulting in lesions very similar to our patient's. This overlooked and nearly forgotten technique may still have value in treating selected cases. 
DNA flow cytometric analysis of primary operable breast cancer. Relation of ploidy and S-phase fraction to outcome of patients in NSABP B-04. Between 1971 and 1974, 1665 women with primary operable breast cancer were randomized into a National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trial (B-04) conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of several different regimens of surgical and radiation therapy. No systemic therapy was given. Cells from archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissue taken from 398 patients were analyzed for ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) using flow cytometry. Characteristics and outcome of patients with satisfactory DNA histograms were comparable to those from whom no satisfactory cytometric studies were available. In patients with diploid tumors (43%), the mean SPF was 3.4% +/- 2.3%; in the aneuploid population (57%), the SPF was 7.9% +/- 6.3%. Only 29.9% +/- 17.3% of cells in aneuploid tumors were aneuploid. Diploid tumors were more likely than aneuploid tumors to be of good nuclear grade (P less than 0.001) and smaller size (P equals 0.03). More tumors with high SPF were of poor nuclear grade than were tumors with low SPF (P equals 0.002). No significant difference in 10-year disease-free survival (P equals 0.3) or survival (P equals 0.1) was found between women with diploid or aneuploid tumors. Patients with low SPF tumors had a 13% better disease-free survival (P equals 0.0006) than those with a high SPF and a 14% better survival (P equals 0.007) at 10 years than patients with high SPF tumors. After adjustment for clinical tumor size, the difference in both disease-free survival and survival between patients with high and low SPF tumors was only 10% (P equals 0.04 and 0.08, respectively). Although SPF was found to be of independent prognostic significance for disease-free survival and marginal significance for survival, it did not detect patients with such a good prognosis as to preclude their receiving chemotherapy. The overall survival of patients with low SPF was only 53% at 10 years. These findings and those of others indicate that additional studies are necessary before tumor ploidy and SPF can be used to select patients who should or should not receive systemic therapy. 
Sympathetic responses of patients with congestive heart failure to cold pressor stimulus. Studies in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) demonstrate blunting of sympathoexcitatory responses to baroreflex perturbation. Whereas experimental and limited clinical evidence suggests impairment of baroreflex mechanisms as the etiology of these attenuated responses, an alternative mechanism would be an inability of patients with CHF to increase sympathetic neural outflow above markedly elevated baseline levels. Hemodynamic and sympathetic neural responses (peroneal microneurography) were therefore compared of normal subjects (n = 10) and patients with CHF (n = 10) during the non-baroreflex sympathoexcitatory stimulus of the cold pressor test. The cold pressor stimulus produced increases in arterial pressure and heart rate in both groups. During hand immersion in ice water, normal subjects demonstrated significant increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity expressed as burst frequency (20 +/- 2 to 28 +/- 3 bursts/min, p less than 0.01), total integrated nerve activity (224 +/- 41 to 342 +/- 62 U/min, p less than 0.05), and total activity corrected for accompanying changes in heart rate (375 +/- 81 to 538 +/- 118 U/100 heart beats, p less than 0.05). Similarly, despite elevated control levels of sympathetic activity, patients with CHF also demonstrated significant sympathoexcitatory responses to the cold pressor stimulus, with increases in muscle sympathetic nerve burst frequency (60 +/- 7 to 67 +/- 7 bursts/min, p less than 0.01) total integrated nerve activity (818 +/- 159 to 1,015 +/- 191 U, p less than 0.001), and total activity corrected for accompanying changes in heart rate (1,008 +/- 178 to 1,173 +/- 201 U/100 heart beats, p less than 0.01). 
Detection of hepatitis C viral RNA in serum of a patient with acute non A, non B hepatitis. The sequence of serologic events in a patient with acute type C hepatitis associated with intravenous drug abuse is described. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid was detectable in serum during the acute episode of hepatitis, whereas antibody to the hepatitis C virus appeared later, after the acute illness had subsided. The patient developed chronic hepatitis with persistently elevated serum aminotransferase activities. Both hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid and antibody to hepatitis C virus persisted in serum, together with elevated serum aminotransferases. Thus, detection of HCV RNA may be useful in the diagnosis of acute type C hepatitis, particularly in the absence of detectable antibody to the hepatitis C virus. 
A circulating factor(s) mediates cell depolarization in hemorrhagic shock. Cell depolarization in hemorrhagic shock has been attributed to hypoperfusion, but the mechanism remains unclear. Suspensions of single cell lines loaded with the potential-sensitive fluorescent dye bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbiturioc acid) trimethine oxonal (DIBAC) and exposed for 30 minutes to rat plasma drawn either before or after hemorrhagic shock (bled 20 mL/kg: mean arterial blood pressure less than 40 mmHg) were studied. Plasma drawn after, but not before, hemorrhage led to partial depolarization regardless of cell type (rat H9C2 skeletal muscle, A-10 smooth muscle, C-9 liver, adrenal, kidney, red blood cell [RBC], white blood cell [WBC]) or species (cat, dog, pig RBC; cat WBC; mouse C2C12 skeletal muscle; and human intestinal smooth muscle [HISM]). Dialysis did not remove the factor(s), suggesting a molecular weight of more than 10,000 daltons. The factor appeared within 5 minutes of shock. The depolarization amplitude increased as a function of plasma concentration and demonstrated saturation kinetics indicating specific receptor binding. Cells were equivalently oxygenated, excluding hypoperfusion as a necessary condition for depolarization. Tumor necrosis factor or platelet activating factor alone or in combination were not effective in this system. Stable measurements can be obtained with this noninvasive system that avoids cell injury consequent to cell impalement with electrodes. This system provides a sensitive in vitro bioassay that should permit identification of the plasma factors mediating cell depolarization, as well as definition of the responsible intracellular mechanisms. 
Ten-year survivors after surgical treatment and perioperative irradiation for esophageal carcinoma. Ten of 150 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and surgically treated, survived for more than 10 years. All 10 underwent a complete resection of the primary tumor and extensive lymph node dissection plus perioperative irradiation. The clinicopathologic findings in these 10 patients were reviewed. Five were female. Seven of the tumors exceeded 6 cm in length; seven were early stage, and the remaining three were advanced stage tumors. Lymph node metastases were evident in three, lymph vessel permeation was recognized in four, and no vascular vessel permeation was seen in any tumor. Two tumors had a characteristic appearance of carcinoma with lymphoid stroma, suggesting a good prognosis. In six for which cytophotometric DNA analysis could be done, four were type II, two were type III, and none was type IV. Thus, a complete resection of the primary tumor and extensive lymph node dissection can lead to a long survival time even for those with an advanced primary esophageal carcinoma. 
Dysphagia after Nissen fundoplication. Nissen fundoplication is a commonly used antireflux operation. After this operation symptoms such as dysphagia, inability to belch and vomit, and gas bloating are frequently reported in the literature. In 32 patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication 3.5-18 years ago, postprocedure dysphagia was studied using conventional manometry and 24 h ambulatory pressure and pH recording. Our study indicates that dysphagia tends to decrease after surgery. Neither conventional nor ambulatory pressure recording revealed motor abnormalities that could be held responsible for the dysphagia. Therefore, the data do not support the concept that dysphagia is a major complication of Nissen fundoplication. 
Pulmonary hypertension in a lupus clinic: experience with twenty-four patients. The clinical and serological findings on 24 patients with pulmonary hypertension (PHT) seen at the Lupus Clinic of St. Thomas' Hospital, London are presented. Twenty-two patients had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), one other a primary antiphospholipid syndrome and another an SLE/progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) overlap syndrome. In 21 of the 24 patients, the disease resembled the primary idiopathic variety with clear lung fields and no clinical evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism, although angiography and nuclear perfusion scans were not performed. Two patients clearly suffered from thromboembolic PHT, one with SLE and one with an antiphospholipid syndrome. One patient with SLE/PSS overlap syndrome developed pulmonary fibrosis. The frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and antibodies to cardiolipin was 68% which appears to be higher than generally found in patients with SLE, and the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Other associated features of the antiphospholipid syndrome in this group were uncommon. Death occurred in 13 of the 24 patients, 4 were lost to followup and 7 are known to be alive. The cause of death was circulatory failure in the majority; sudden death once this complication occurred was particularly common. One patient died from adult respiratory distress syndrome and one from hemorrhagic shock while undergoing heart/lung transplantation. Two patients underwent successful heart/lung transplantation. One, however, died of a mesenteric occlusion and bowel infarction following a second lung transplantation because of rejection of the first heart/lung transplantation after one year. The other patient is alive and well 2 years later. 
Accelerated fractionation radiation therapy for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We treated 14 patients who had advanced head and neck cancer with an accelerated fractionation schedule of irradiation consisting of two fractions given 6 hours apart. In the morning a volume of 1.7 Gy was given to an area that encompassed the entire tumor, enlarged lymph nodes, and all areas at risk for microscopic disease. Six hours later, 1.1 Gy was given to an area that included only the tumor and any enlarged lymph nodes, with a 2-cm margin. The treatment was well tolerated; of the 13 patients who completed therapy, six did not require a break in therapy, and seven patients did. The median rest period was 2 days. There was no grade 4 toxicity. Grade 3 toxicity included skin changes (one case), mucositis (two), dysphagia (two), weight loss (three), and a decrease in the hemoglobin level (one case). The response rate in the 13 who completed therapy was 13/13 (100%); 11 of the 13 (83%) had a complete response. Only one of the 11 who achieved a complete response had failure at the primary site. At a median follow-up of 24 months, the absolute survival was 7/13 (54%) and the corrected survival was 7/10 (70%). This technique permits radiation therapy to be given on an accelerated schedule without a planned break in treatment. The overall response rate and survival at 2 years was excellent. 
Both intravenous lidocaine and morphine reduce the pain of postherpetic neuralgia. We studied the analgesic efficacy of an intravenous infusion of lidocaine and morphine in 19 adults with well-established postherpetic neuralgia in a three-session, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Compared with saline placebo, both lidocaine and morphine reduced pain intensity. Reductions in pain did not correlate with side effects produced by the infusions. For morphine, there was a significant correlation between reductions in pain intensity and blood level achieved. In the majority of subjects who reported definite pain relief, allodynia also disappeared. The results show that neuropathic pain can respond to opioids and to systemically administered local anesthetic drugs. 
Acoustic neuroma (schwannoma) surgery 1978-1990. A series of 151 patients with 154 acoustic schwannomas have been operated upon in Manchester Royal Infirmary by a joint Otological and Neurosurgical team, employing either the translabyrinthine or the suboccipital approach. The perioperative mortality rate was 3 per cent. Anatomical preservation of the facial nerve was achieved in 89 per cent of tumour removals and a good to normal functional result in 79 per cent of cases. Attempts at hearing preservation have been unsuccessful, largely because of the small number of patients in the series in whom useful hearing was present preoperatively. Complications included major brain stem ischaemia (1.2 per cent), CSF fistula (5 per cent) and facial dysaesthesia (7 per cent). The incidence of mortality and morbidity is directly related to tumour size and to the experience of the surgeons. A number of patients experienced an unusual type of post-operative dreamlike state which appeared to be a form of hypnagogic hallucination, and the possible neurophysiological mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is discussed. The continuing failure to attain the ideal of early diagnosis is lamented, and the importance of a flexible bidisciplinary surgical approach emphasized. 
Headaches in adolescents. Diagnosis and management. A thorough history, general physical examination, neurologic evaluation, and charting of the temporal pattern of the headache will allow the correct diagnosis to be made under most circumstances. Laboratory testing is tailored to the specific headache syndrome. Psychological factors are important in all forms of adolescent headache and should be evaluated in each and every case. Once the correct diagnosis has been made, a comprehensive approach to the patient's problems, medical and psychological, will usually result in improvement. 
Hypophysectomy inhibits the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor alpha by rat macrophages: partial restoration by exogenous growth hormone or interferon gamma. We recently demonstrated that GH and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) act in a similar manner to prime macrophages in vitro and in vivo for enhanced superoxide anion release. In this report we investigated the physiological role of the pituitary gland and GH in in vivo priming of resident peritoneal macrophages for the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in vitro. Compared to normal rats, hypophysectomized animals had an 83% reduction in macrophage production of TNF alpha after in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Sham operation had no significant effect on the ability of macrophages to secrete TNF alpha in response to lipopolysaccharide. Both native pituitary-derived porcine GH (48 micrograms/rat.9 days) and native pituitary-derived rat GH (96 micrograms/rat.9 days) more than tripled the in vitro production of TNF alpha by macrophages from hypophysectomized rats (342 and 358 vs. 112 U/mg protein for placebo-treated rats, respectively). Each of these preparations of GH also increased growth more than 6-fold in hypophysectomized rats (32 and 30 g vs. 5 g in placebo controls). Heat inactivation of native pituitary-derived porcine GH significantly reduced its in vivo ability to augment both TNF alpha synthesis by macrophages and body growth. Recombinant rat IFN gamma (2000 U/rat.9 days) more than tripled the production of TNF alpha by macrophages from hypophysectomized rats (343 vs. 112 U/mg protein). In contrast to its in vivo effects, addition of GH in vitro to macrophages from hypophysectomized rats did not prime these cells for the synthesis of TNF alpha, indicating an indirect mechanism of action for GH. To further test the biological relevancy of GH with respect to synthesis of TNF alpha, hemorrhagic necrosis of TNF alpha-sensitive murine methyl-cholanthrene-induced tumors was assessed in pituitary-intact mice. Native porcine GH (133 micrograms/mouse.7 days) significantly augmented both the necrosis to tumor ratio and the hemorrhage to tumor ratio. These findings establish the physiological relevance of the pituitary gland and GH in the priming of macrophages for TNF alpha synthesis. 
Increased occurrence of arrhythmias in men with ischaemic type ST-segment depression during long-term ECG recording. Prognostic impact on ischaemic heart disease: results from the prospective population study 'Men born in 1914', Malmo, Sweden. The objective of this long-term ECG (LTER) study in 394 68-year-old men, selected at random from the general population of Malmo, Sweden, was to determine the prevalence and occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and their impact on morbidity and mortality from IHD. According to Lown classification, 29.4% (116 men) had ventricular arrhythmia (VA) group 4-5. Serious ventricular arrhythmia (Lown group 4-5) was more common in men with asymptomatic ischaemic type ST-segment depression (STD) than in those without it (37.8% vs. 26.7%: P less than 0.05). During the mean follow-up period of 53.1 months there were seven IHD deaths (6%) among the 116 patients with VA, Lown 4-5, and nine IHD deaths (3.2%) among the 278 patients without serious VA, Lown 0-3, (P = 0.26). Six and three of these deaths, respectively, were considered to be sudden (P = 0.022). The increased cardiac event rate (fatal or non-fatal MI or deaths due to chronic IHD) associated with a serious ventricular arrhythmia disappeared when history of IHD at baseline and occurrence of STD during LTER were taken into account. The study did not provide any evidence to suggest that ventricular arrhythmia was triggered by myocardial ischaemia. Five of 9 (56%) deaths due to IHD in men with STD occurred among the 38% (37/98) of patients who belonged to Lown class 4-5. It is concluded that the prognostic information derived from LTER can be improved by combined monitoring of STD and ventricular arrhythmias. 
Effect of intravenously administered dexmedetomidine on pain after laparoscopic tubal ligation. Ninety-six women undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation were randomized to receive intravenously either 0.2 or 0.4 microgram/kg of dexmedetomidine, 60 micrograms/kg of oxycodone, or 250 micrograms/kg of diclofenac for postoperative pain in a double-blind study design. The study drugs were administered in the recovery room for moderate or severe pain and were repeated until pain subsided or disappeared. In the group receiving diclofenac, 83% of the patients required analgesic supplementation with morphine. This contrasted (P less than 0.01) with 33% of the patients receiving either oxycodone or the higher dose of dexmedetomidine. After the first dose of oxycodone was injected, the visual analogue scale for pain (0%-100%) was reduced from 58% to 33%, whereas corresponding pain relief was only achieved after the third injection of 0.4 microgram/kg of dexmedetomidine. Repeated doses of 0.2 microgram/kg of diclofenac or dexmedetomidine did not reduce the visual analogue scale value by more than 17%. More sedation was seen with the higher dose of dexmedetomidine than with either diclofenac or oxycodone (P less than 0.001). Both doses of dexmedetomidine decreased heart rate when compared with diclofenac (P less than 0.001). In the group given 0.4 microgram/kg of dexmedetomidine, 33% of the patients required atropine for bradycardia. The authors conclude that after laparoscopic tubal ligation, intravenously administered dexmedetomidine relieves pain and reduces opioid drug requirement but is attended by sedation and a high incidence of bradycardia. 
Supraventricular tachycardia associated with continuous furosemide infusion. Three cases of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) associated with the use of furosemide infusion (FI) in children following cardiac surgery are reported. The SVT occurred three to seven hours after starting an infusion at 1.0 mg.kg-1.hr-1. All three patients had a diuresis of 8-10 ml.kg-1.hr-1 compared with a mean average of 2.5 ml.kg-1.hr-1 in 22 other patients who had received a similar infusion. A rapid fluid shift was the most likely mechanism of the tachycardia. Sotalol was effective in controlling the tachycardia in the two patients in whom it was tried. We now recommend a starting dose of 0.3 mg.kg-1.hr-1 in using furosemide as a continuous infusion, with hourly increments of 0.1 mg.kg-1.hr-1 until the desired diuresis is obtained. 
Influence of the lumbar interspace chosen for injection on the spread of hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine. Forty patients undergoing elective Caesarean section were allocated randomly to receive hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine 2.5 ml at either the L2-3 (n = 20) or L4-5 (n = 20) interspace. Spinal injection was performed with a 29-gauge needle in 38 patients and a 25-gauge needle in two. The onset time to analgesia at T10 and T6 was significantly faster and the level of analgesia at 5 and 10 min after injection significantly higher after injection at L2-3. Maximum height and range of analgesia, the level of analgesia at 15 and 20 min after injection and the number of episodes of hypotension were not significantly different between the two groups. One case of post-dural puncture headache was recorded after use of a 29-gauge needle. Overall, the choice of lumbar interspace influenced the rate of onset of analgesia, but not the final dermatomal level (mean and range) of analgesia achieved. 
Noninvasive methods in the diagnosis of ruptured aneurysm of Valsalva. Usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging and Doppler echocardiography. A ruptured aneurysm of noncoronary sinus of Valsalva was diagnosed noninvasively by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as by Doppler echocardiography. Diagnosis of this disease by MRI has not been reported previously. 
Is a chest radiograph necessary in the evaluation of every febrile infant less than 8 weeks of age? This study was designed to examine the relationship between respiratory signs and the likelihood of having an abnormal chest radiograph in a sample of febrile infants less than 8 weeks of age. The sample consisted of 242 infants who were admitted during a 3-year period with temperatures greater than or equal to 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) and had a chest radiograph. The house officer recorded the presence of respiratory signs and symptoms including rhinorrhea, tachypnea, cough, rales, wheezes, retractions, and rhonchi. Each chest radiograph was reviewed independently according to predetermined criteria by a senior radiology resident and an attending pediatric radiologist. Interobserver agreement was 91%. Both observers were blind to the infants' respiratory signs. The chest radiograph interpretations were compared with the presence of respiratory signs. Of the 242 cases, 228 had chest radiographs available for interpretation. Of these, 27 chest radiographs (12%) were identified as abnormal, including 6 where there was initial disagreement as to the presence of an abnormality. Twenty-five (31%) of 80 infants with any respiratory signs had an abnormal chest radiograph, whereas only 2 (1%) of 148 asymptomatic infants did. The sensitivity of respiratory signs was 93% (confidence interval = 76% to 99%). These findings suggest that in the absence of respiratory signs, febrile infants are unlikely to have an abnormal chest radiograph. 
Mammographic localization and biopsy of nonpalpable breast lesions. A 5-year study. A malignancy rate of 24% was achieved as a result of needle localizations and biopsies of 548 nonpalpable mammographically detected breast lesions in 507 consecutive patients during a 5-year period. Malignancy was present in 74 (23.8%) of 311 irregular soft-tissue densities, in 40 (19.6%) of 204 cases with clustered microcalcifications, and in 33 cases (54.5%) when both features were present. Same-day admission and discharge were achieved in 491 patients and local anesthesia supplemented with intravenous sedation was used in 73 (74%) of the 98 patients (in 1989) by the end of the study period. Nonpalpable cancers were categorized pathologically as stage 0 in 25 patients (20.8%), stage I in 67 patients (55.8%), stage IIA in 24 patients (20.0%), and stage IIB in four patients (3.3%). The malignancy rate rose sharply from the fourth to the fifth decade. 
Effects of hypoxaemia and bradycardia on neonatal cerebral haemodynamics. Near infrared spectroscopy has been used to assess the effects of bradycardia and hypoxia on the cerebral circulation in the premature neonate. The technique is well tolerated and can be applied in almost any infant. Continuous monitoring of changes in cerebral oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total haemoglobin is possible. Total haemoglobin is analogous to cerebral blood volume; thus information on circulatory changes as well as oxygenation state can be obtained. Twenty five babies had cerebral monitoring carried out using this technique. During episodes of hypoxia, both spontaneous and induced, impairment of haemoglobin oxygenation within the brain was detected together with an overall increase in the total mean haemoglobin concentration, which was 0.8 x 10(-2) mmol/l. Bradycardia with apnoea also led to impairment of cerebral oxygenation, and to a rapid fall in the concentration of total mean haemoglobin to 1.4 x 10(-2) mmol/l, which was followed in some cases by an increase to above the resting value on recovery of the heart rate to a mean of 0.7 x 10(-2) mmol/l. These disturbances to total haemoglobin concentration represent abnormalities of cerebral blood volume that may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neonatal cerebral injury. 
Reirradiation for extremity soft tissue sarcomas. Local control and complications. The treatment for patients who have locally recurrent soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity after surgery and radiation therapy is primarily amputation. A second course of radiation and local excision is usually not considered because of two major concerns: radiation complications and inability to achieve local disease control. This study examines the clinical course of 32 patients who received a second course of radiation for soft tissue sarcoma. Four groups of patients were defined by the sequence of radiation (preoperative and postoperative) and surgery. Despite high cumulative doses of radiation, complications requiring amputation were rare. Local tumor control was achieved with a second course of preoperative radiation and wide local excision in 15 of 18 (84%). However, local excision and a second course of postoperative radiation resulted in eight of 14 (57%) local failure and cannot be recommended as a comparable therapy to amputation. 
Socioeconomic status in the epidemiology and treatment of hypertension. The association of socioeconomic status (SES), as indexed by educational achievement, with the prevalence, prognosis, and efficacy of treatment of hypertension in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP) was reviewed. The prevalence of hypertension varied inversely with SES during the screening program initiated to identify HDFP eligibles in 14 communities in 1973-1974. There was a strong inverse gradient of 5-year all-cause mortality with SES among the hypertensive participants referred to usual care in the HDFP. The association of mortality with SES among hypertensive subjects was eliminated by the HDFP stepped-care program. A large portion of the efficacy of the HDFP was associated with in-trial blood pressure control. Inasmuch as these results are generalizable to the nation, a large fraction of hypertension-associated morbidity and mortality in the United States was related to lower SES in the 1970s, before widespread implementation of programs resulting in increased awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension. 
Duodenocaval fistula in peptic ulceration. Duodenocaval fistula is usually caused by abdominal trauma. We report a patient in whom it was associated with peptic ulcer. 
Metastatic basal cell carcinoma: report of a case presenting with respiratory failure. Metastasis from basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of skin is rare. A case of a 58-year-old male presenting with increasing shortness of breath and right pleural effusion is described. Open right pleural biopsy demonstrated metastatic carcinoma consistent with BCC. Review of medical records from another hospital revealed that four years previously a recurrent BCC had been excised from the left back. One and three years prior to this excision, a skin lesion at this same site had been treated with electrocautery. Review of the skin excision slides demonstrated infiltrating BCC histologically very similar to the metastatic pleural neoplasm. The patient died two months after the pleural biopsy. At autopsy, the cutaneous BCC had not recurred and metastatic BCC extensively infiltrated the pleura bilaterally, with focal involvement of underlying lung parenchyma, subcarinal lymph nodes, diaphragm, and pericardium. 
Cytarabine and neurologic toxicity. Cytarabine is an effective drug in the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies and its common toxicities are myelosuppression and gastrointestinal disturbance. In the past decade, neurotoxicity has been an increasingly recognized cytarabine effect. Intrathecal (IT) cytarabine may result in myelopathy that is incompletely reversible. Combined IT drug and cranial irradiation may lead to necrotizing leukoencephalopathy. Intravenous (IV) therapy may cause a peripheral neuropathy that varies greatly in its severity. The high IV cytarabine doses now commonly used can cause seizures, cerebral dysfunction, or an acute cerebellar syndrome with an incidence up to 14%. Patient age (greater than 60 years) appears to be the most important risk factor, but drug dose/schedule, cumulative drug dose, renal and hepatic dysfunction, and concomitant use of neurotropic antiemetic agents may also influence the risk of neurotoxicity. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and pharmacology of such cytarabine-induced neuronal injury will allow this drug to be used with greater efficacy and safety. 
Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine in non-Japanese Asians. "The Japanese disease," ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, is not confined to the Japanese only. A similar incidence of 0.8% was found in this study among non-Japanese Asians. Of 5167 patients who attended the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore for cervical spine complaints, 43 patients were found to have ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, forming the largest non-Japanese series. All but one patient were of Mongolian origin, and males were affected four times more commonly than females. Diabetes mellitus was present in 16%. There was a significant association between ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and calcification of other cervical paraspinal ligaments. It is suggested that a generalized tendency to calcification may be an important etiological factor in ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Four of the patients required surgery, and in our experience, anterior spinal fusion with removal of the ossified ligament or multilevel laminoplasty gives satisfactory results. 
Differential regulation of rasGAP and neurofibromatosis gene product activities. The ras-encoded p21ras proteins bind GTP very tightly, but catalyse hydrolysis to GDP very slowly. In humans, two genes encode proteins that stimulate this GTPase activity (GAP, or GTPase-activating proteins), one of relative molecular mass 120,000, referred to as p120-GAP, and another NF1-GAP, which is encoded by the neurofibromatosis type-1 gene. Both GAPs are widely expressed in mammalian tissues. Here we show that although they will both bind oncogenic mutants of p21ras, neither will stimulate their GTPase activity. NF1-GAP binds to the p21ras proteins up to 300 times more efficiently than p120-GAP. The two GAPs are inhibited to different extents by certain lipids: micromolar concentrations of arachidonate, phosphatidate and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate affect only NF1-GAP. This inhibition does not compete with p21ras, and lipid-inactivated NF1-GAP can still bind p21ras. We used the detergent dodecyl maltoside, which inhibits only NF1-GAP, to distinguish between the two activities in cell extracts and found both types present together in several mammalian cell lines. In contrast, GAP activity in extracts of Xenopus oocytes was not affected by dodecyl maltoside. By these criteria, the mammalian cells contain both GAP activities and the oocytes have only p120-like GAP activity. These results indicate that more than one GAP regulates p21ras in the same cell. 
Anti-Ri: an antibody associated with paraneoplastic opsoclonus and breast cancer. The serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 8 women with ataxia, 6 of whom also had eye movement abnormalities believed to be opsoclonus, were found to contain a highly specific antineuronal antibody we call anti-Ri. Seven of the 8 women also had or developed cancer: carcinoma of the breast in 5, adenocarcinoma in an axillary lymph node in 1, and carcinoma of the fallopian tube in 1. Four patients presented with the neurological disorder; the cancer was diagnosed first in the other 4. Immunohistochemical studies using serum or CSF from all 8 patients revealed a highly specific antibody interaction with central nervous system neuronal nuclei but not with glial or other cells; the titer ranged from 1:5,000 to 1:320,000 in serum and from 1:2,000 to 1:16,000 in CSF. Biotinylated IgG from the patients' serum reacted with the tumors of 3 of 4 patients with anti-Ri antibody but not with breast cancers from patients without anti-Ri antibody. Immunoblots against cerebral cortex neuronal extracts identified protein antigens of 55-kd and 80-kd relative molecular mass. Serum titers by immunoblot ranged from 1:500 to more than 1:40,000 and CSF titers, from 1:10 to 1:2,000. The relative amount of anti-Ri was always higher in CSF than in serum. The antibody was not present in sera from normal individuals; patients with breast cancer without opsoclonus; other patients with opsoclonus; or patients with other paraneoplastic syndromes related to breast, ovarian, or small-cell lung cancer. We conclude that the presence of anti-Ri antibody identifies a subset of patients with paraneoplastic ataxia and eye movement disorders (opsoclonus) who usually suffer from breast or other gynecological cancer; the antibody when present is a useful marker for an underlying malignancy. 
Analgesic effect of intraarticular morphine after arthroscopic knee surgery BACKGROUND. Opioids can produce potent antinociceptive effects by interacting with local opioid receptors in inflamed peripheral tissue. In this study we examined the analgesic effects of the intraarticular, as compared with intravenous, administration of morphine after arthroscopic knee surgery. METHODS. In a double-blind, randomized trial, we studied 52 patients who had received one of four injections at the end of surgery. The patients in group 1 (n = 18) received 1 mg of morphine intraarticularly and saline intravenously; those in group 2 (n = 15), saline intraarticularly and 1 mg of morphine intravenously; those in group 3 (n = 10), 0.5 mg of morphine intraarticularly and saline intravenously; and those in group 4 (n = 9), 1 mg of morphine and 0.1 mg of naloxone intraarticularly and saline intravenously. The volume of the intraarticular injections was 40 ml, and that of the intravenous injections was 1 ml. After 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 24 hours, postoperative pain was assessed with a visual-analogue scale, a numerical-rating scale, and the McGill pain questionnaire. The need for supplemental analgesic agents, the patients' vital signs, and the occurrence of side effects were monitored. RESULTS. All pain scores were lower in group 1 than in group 2 at all times. The differences were significant (P less than 0.05) at three, four, and six hours (mean [+/- SD] visual-analogue score at six hours, 9 +/- 13 mm vs. 37 +/- 31 mm). The mean (+/- SD) consumption of supplemental analgesic medication per 24 hours was significantly lower in group 1 (36 +/- 51 mg of diclofenac and 1.2 +/- 3.4 mg of meperidine) than in group 2 (75 +/- 42 mg of diclofenac and 14 +/- 18 mg of meperidine, P less than 0.05). The visual-analogue scores in group 3 were slightly but not significantly higher than those in group 1 at all times except 6 and 24 hours after injection. The visual-analogue scores were significantly higher in group 4 than in group 1 one to four hours after injection (P less than 0.05), indicating that the analgesic effect of intraarticular morphine was reversible by naloxone. CONCLUSIONS. Low doses of intraarticular morphine can significantly reduce pain after knee surgery through an action specific to local opioid receptors that reaches its maximal effect three to six hours after injection. 
Possible association between mutant frequency in peripheral lymphocytes and domestic radon concentrations To investigate whether previously found geographical correlations between leukaemia incidence and exposure to radon are reflected in a detectable mutagenic effect on individuals, the frequency of mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase gene (hprt) in peripheral blood T lymphocytes was measured in subjects with known domestic radon concentrations. These concentrations were measured in December, 1989, in houses in Street, Somerset, UK, by passive alpha-track radon detectors. 20 non-smoking subjects aged 36-55 years were selected from the patient list at the local health centre on the basis of the radon concentrations in their homes--the range selected varied by a factor of ten. Blood samples for preparation of T lymphocytes were taken in July, 1990. There was a significant association between the log mutant frequency and radon concentration (t = 3.47, p less than 0.01). A second analysis of a further set of radon measurements (October, 1990, to January, 1991), in both living rooms and bedrooms, and repeated mutant frequency determinations also showed a significant relation, which remained significant even after exclusion of the highest frequency and adjustment for subject's age and cloning efficiency. These data must be regarded as preliminary and further more extensive studies should be done to determine whether the observed association is causal. 
Oxygen delivery-dependent oxygen consumption in acute respiratory failure. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether oxygen consumption (VO2) is dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2) in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and non-ARDS acute respiratory failure. DESIGN: Intervention study of a consecutive sample of patients admitted to the ICU with the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Thirteen consecutive patients with a diagnosis of ARDS and 11 with a diagnosis of respiratory failure not due to ARDS. Patients were monitored with an oximetric pulmonary artery catheter and mechanically ventilated. INTERVENTIONS: DO2 was decreased by the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (20 cm H2O), and subsequently increased by an iv infusion of dobutamine (10 micrograms/kg.min). RESULTS: After the application of PEEP, DO2 decreased significantly in both groups. However, VO2 decreased significantly (p less than .01) only in the ARDS group. When dobutamine was infused, DO2 increased significantly (p less than .01) in both groups, but VO2 increased only in ARDS patients. DO2 correlated significantly with VO2 both in ARDS (r2 = .81, p less than .01) and in non-ARDS (r2 = .38, p less than .05) patients. The correlation coefficient was significantly higher for ARDS than for non-ARDS patients. Comparing the slopes of the regression lines, a stronger dependency of VO2 on DO2 was found in ARDS than in non-ARDS respiratory failure (p less than .001). The oxygen extraction ratio correlated with DO2 in non-ARDS patients (r2 = .49, p less than .05), but not in ARDS patients. CONCLUSIONS: VO2 is dependent on DO2 over a wide range of DO2 values in acute respiratory failure. This dependency phenomenon is much stronger in ARDS than in respiratory failure due to other causes. Due to the abnormal dependency of VO2 on DO2, changes in the oxygenation status may not be reflected by changes in mixed venous oxygen saturation in ARDS. 
Effect of metoclopramide on angiotensins, aldosterone, and atrial peptide during hypoxia. The coupling of aldosterone with renin is altered during acute hypoxemia. We measured the various components of the renin-angiotensin system and the plasma levels of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (iANF) during room air and hypoxic gas-mixture breathing before and after administration of metoclopramide, a competitive antagonist of dopamine. Seven resting volunteers were studied 1 wk apart under room air and hypoxic conditions (inspired O2 fraction 0.12). During hypoxemia, the release of aldosterone induced by metoclopramide was significantly smaller. This change was associated with a slight increase in iANF and with a decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels, without any change in immunoreactive blood angiotensin I concentrations. Plasma electrolytes and blood acid-base status did not show relevant changes, nor did blood pressure and heart rate. We conclude that the decreased aldosterone concentrations seen under hypoxemia are related to decreased angiotensin II levels. Other influences, such as elevated ANF, may also mediate this effect. 
Selective pulmonary vasodilation by low-dose infusion of adenosine triphosphate in newborn lambs. The systemic and pulmonary vascular effects of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) were investigated in 12 newborn lambs during normoxia and during alveolar hypoxia (10% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 85% nitrogen). Lambs had catheters in the descending aorta, main pulmonary artery, and were studied after a 3-day recovery. We infused ATP or an equal volume of saline solution (control) into the right atrial line in doses ranging from 0.01 to 2.5 mumol/kg per minute. In normoxic lambs, ATP caused a significant decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance in doses of 0.08 to 2.5 mumol/kg per minute, and in systemic vascular resistance in doses of 0.3 to 2.5 mumol/kg per minute. Infusion of ATP in hypoxic lambs caused decreases in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance in all the doses tested. Systemic vascular resistance decreased, and cardiac output and heart rate increased in doses greater than 0.3 mumol/kg per minute in hypoxic lambs during ATP infusion. The effects of ATP in hypoxic lambs were not blocked by propranolol, indomethacin, or theophylline. Plasma ATP levels in left atrial blood samples did not change significantly during the infusion of ATP. We conclude that ATP is a vasodilator in lambs, and its effects are specific for pulmonary circulation at doses of less than or equal to 0.15 mumol/kg per minute. The vasodilator effects of ATP appear to be independent of P1 purinergic and beta-adrenergic mechanisms, and of prostacyclin synthesis. 
Randomized, double-masked study of cyclosporine compared to prednisolone in the treatment of endogenous uveitis. Fifty-six patients with bilateral sight-threatening noninfectious intermediate or posterior uveitis participated in a randomized double-masked study of the use of cyclosporine vs prednisolone in their treatment. Applying the end-point definitions, visual acuity or vitreal haze improved in only 13 of 28 (46%) patients in each group. The macular edema resolved in seven of 15 patients of the cyclosporine-treated group, and in ten of 16 patients of the prednisolone-treated group (P = .376). Patients whose therapies failed both cyclosporine and prednisolone trials were treated with both drugs, which resulted in additional patient improvements. Secondary effects were observed in both therapeutic alternatives, the most notable being alterations in serum creatinine concentration and hypertension with the dosage of cyclosporine used. 
Vipoma of the pancreas complicating ulcerative colitis. We report a case of vipoma of the pancreas in conjunction with ulcerative colitis in a 20-yr-old woman. Twenty months after the onset of ulcerative colitis, the patient complained of watery diarrhea and was found to have an electrolyte disorder. A pancreatic tumor was detected by ultrasonography and computed tomography, along with an elevation of serum vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). The secretory diarrhea diminished dramatically, and the serum VIP level decreased into the normal range immediately after resection of the pancreatic tumor. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a pancreatic vipoma. Despite removal of the vipoma, she underwent restorative proctocolectomy and ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis 2 yr later due to progression of the ulcerative colitis. Postoperative course was uneventful, with excellent functional results. Knowledge of this rare condition accompanying ulcerative colitis may help in the management of the patient with an atypical clinical course. 
Establishment of permanent renal tubule cell lines by infection with the wild-type and a thermosensitive mutant of the simian virus 40. This study summarizes the properties of rabbit renal tubule cell lines transformed by the simian virus 40 (SV40). By infection with the wild type SV40, it was possible to establish three different cell lines exhibiting the main functions of proximal (RC.SV1), thick ascending limb-distal (RC.SV2), and collecting (RC.SV3) tubules. Another cell line infected with a thermosensitive mutant of SV40 (RC.SVtsA58) was highly sensitive to arginine vasopressin when cells were cultured at the restrictive temperature of 39.5 degrees C, suggesting they derived from principal cells of the collecting tubule. 
Hepatocarcinoma in cirrhosis. Is antithrombin III a neoplastic marker? It has been reported that hepatoma (HCC) cells produce abnormal proteins such as erytropietin, fibrinogen, prothrombin, and, recently, antithrombin III (AT III). In a preliminary report, we reported increased AT III levels in patients bearing HCC independent of their clinical liver status. The present study was performed to assess antithrombin III levels and other serological data present in patients with cirrhosis and in patients with cirrhosis and clinical findings of neoplastic disease. In 70 well-matched patients (47 with cirrhosis and 23 with cirrhosis and proven HCC) serum total cholesterol, albumin, prothrombin, alkaline phosphatase, AFP, aminotransferases, and AT III were determined. Together with AFP and alkaline phosphatase, patients with HCC had higher values of AT III (88 +/- 7%) and total cholesterol (184 +/- 17 mg/100 ml), as compared with cirrhotic patients (AT III 56 +/- 3.6%; total cholesterol 113 +/- 5 mg/100 ml) (P less than 0.001). No difference was observed between these two groups for albumin, prothrombin, and aminotransferases. In HCC patients, AT III levels were related to the total cholesterol level (R2 = 0.317), whereas in the cirrhotic patients it correlated with the prothrombin level (R2 = 0.274). These data suggest that in HCC patients a greater rate of synthesis of AT III occurs, whereas in cirrhotic patients lower levels of AT III occur due to impaired synthesis or increased catabolism of the protein. The serial determination of AT III in cirrhotic patients as a means of detecting neoplastic transformation is suggested. 
Hospital mortality and long-term survival after pulmonary resection in the elderly. We have studied the hospital mortality and long-term survival in two groups of patients: those between 50 and 69 years of age (group 1, n = 136) and those older than 70 years of age (group 2, n = 43). The two groups were similar in terms of the distribution of histological type and postsurgical staging. The patients were treated by either lobectomy or pneumonectomy; the lobectomy rate was similar in both groups: 61% and 51% (not significant). Hospital mortality for group 1 was 4.4% and for group 2, 6.9%. Mortality was higher in both groups after pneumonectomy compared with lobectomy, but this was not significant (group 1, 6.2% versus 1.9%; group 2, 9.1% versus 4.7%). Hospital mortality after pulmonary resection was greater in the elderly, but this was not significant (lobectomy: 1.9% [group 1] versus 4.7% [group 2]; pneumonectomy: 6.2% [group 1] versus 9.1% [group 2]. The overall long-term survival at 2 and 4 years was 62.3% and 50.0% for group 1 and 72.5% and 66.6% for group 2. We suggest that the operative risk in the elderly is not prohibitive and the long-term results are acceptable. Patients should not be denied operation on the basis of age alone. 
The treatment of small acoustic tumors: now or later? Prior to the advent of microneurosurgery, the operative mortality for acoustic tumor removal was high and management often consisted of observation until sufficient symptoms warranted removal. The treatment of these tumors has evolved, and recent introduction of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the diagnosis of very small intracanalicular acoustic tumors before hearing has been significantly affected. For such tumors, some surgeons advocate the premicrosurgical philosophy of observation rather than removal. Our results of small acoustic tumor removal with attempt at hearing preservation were reviewed. From 1961 to June 1989, 39 acoustic tumors 0.5 cm or less were removed by the middle fossa approach. Measurable hearing was preserved in 67%, and facial function 1 year postoperatively was normal or nearly normal in 97%. There was no other permanent operative morbidity. Given our results, early surgical removal of small acoustic tumors is advocated. 
Subtotal parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic renal failure. Twenty-seven patients on chronic haemodialysis and with secondary hyperparathyroidism underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy during the period 1985-1989. The operation was indicated by severe clinical symptoms and evidence of radiological abnormalities not responsive to conservative treatment (low phosphorus diet, phosphate binding substances, oral calcium and vitamin D). If despite intensive medical management, inadequate control of parathyroid hyperplasia continues surgical intervention becomes necessary. Ultra-sonography was performed pre-operatively in all 27 cases and detected 42 of 99 glands (42.5 per cent). Also scintigraphy was carried out in every patient but it gave a relatively low detection rate (24.5 per cent). Surgery was followed by improvement in 20 patients and progression of hyperparathyroidism in seven cases. Three of the seven patients failed to improve after subtotal parathyroidectomy, necessitating a re-intervention; the remaining four responded sufficiently to medical therapy. From our experience we conclude that subtotal parathyroidectomy for renal hyperparathyroidism is recommended. 
Telephone versus face-to-face mode for collecting self-reports of sequences of behavior. This study compared telephone vs face-to-face interviews as ways to collect self-reported sequences of daily activities. Twenty-seven persons with spinal cord injury in a rehabilitation hospital participated. The Self-Observation and Report Technique was used to obtain, in the participants' own words, two reports per week of 24-hour sequences of activities. One report per week was given over the telephone and one in person. Each behavior was coded for activity, assistance, companions, and locations. Nineteen measures assessing independence, level and diversity of activity, mobility, and social contacts were derived from the last four interviews for each participant. Differences in the measures derived from each mode were tested. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the self-reports to data on activities recorded by trained observers. Measures from the two modes did not differ, nor did the percent agreements with observation data. Investigators can use the more convenient and efficient telephone mode with confidence. 
Adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Screening mammography can detect cancer in its early stages, when it is potentially curable. Adjuvant chemotherapy is of major benefit in node-positive patients. It is also beneficial in certain node-negative patients with a high risk of breast cancer recurrence; these patients should be identified and offered adjuvant therapy or enrolled in a clinical trial. 
Surgical management of the conal (supracristal) ventricular septal defect. Surgical management of the conal (supracristal) ventricular septal defect differs significantly from the management of the perimembranous (infracristal) ventricular septal defect. The absence of a portion of the conal septum can lead to prolapse of the right cusp of the aortic valve, which predisposes these patients to aortic insufficiency. Between January 1980 and December 1989, 36 children with conal ventricular septal defect underwent intracardiac repair. Diagnosis was by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and intraoperative exploration. Preoperative evaluation showed that 26 patients (72%) had aortic valve prolapse and 16 (44%) had aortic insufficiency. Pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratios ranged from 1:1 to 3.5:1 (mean 2.0:1.0). Ten patients (27%) were believed to have clinical congestive heart failure. Age at the time of operation ranged from 2 weeks to 18 years (mean 5.5 years). Operative exposure was through the pulmonary artery (26), aorta (4), right ventricle (3), or right atrium (3). Simultaneous aortic valve suspension for aortic insufficiency was performed in four patients. Operative survival was 100%. Follow-up is complete in all patients and ranges from 0.5 to 9 years (mean 4.3 years). All patients are in normal sinus rhythm. No residual ventricular septal defects have been identified. Twenty-three of 36 patients (64%) have no evidence of aortic insufficiency; 12 of 36 (33%) have trivial or mild aortic insufficiency. One patient with initial severe aortic insufficiency underwent repeat aortic valvuloplasty 3 years after ventricular septal defect closure and aortic valve suspension. No patients have required aortic valve replacement. Surgical management of the conal ventricular septal defect differs from that of the perimembranous ventricular septal defect in two critical aspects. The operative approach should be through the pulmonary artery. This allows the best exposure of the remaining conal septum and the pulmonary and aortic valve leaflets, facilitating closure of the defect without injury to the valves or conduction system. Conal ventricular septal defects should undergo early closure, regardless of shunt volume, to prevent progressive aortic insufficiency. 
Treatment of cardiogenic shock with the Hemopump left ventricular assist device. A multiinstitutional study is in progress to evaluate the Hemopump in the treatment of cardiogenic shock. Fifty-three patients with refractory cardiogenic shock were selected for Hemopump assistance. The hemodynamic definition of cardiogenic shock included (1) a cardiac index of less than 2.0 L.min-1.m-2, (2) pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of greater than 18 mm Hg, and (3) a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or a left ventricular work index of less than 1,500 g-m.m-2.min-1. The Hemopump was successfully inserted in 41 of 53 patients (77.3%). A significant improvement in the hemodynamic status was seen during Hemopump assistance. A minimal level of hemolysis was observed. No leg ischemia was observed. The 30-day overall survival of the Hemopump group was 31.7%. Criteria establishing indications for use and clinical utility are proposed. We conclude that the Hemopump provides significant hemodynamic support of the patient in cardiogenic shock allowing for recovery from ventricular stunning in marginal ventricles, and that in select patients the Hemopump may offer a major improvement in survival over conventional therapy. 
Relation of symptoms to contractility and defect size in infants with ventricular septal defect. Forty-two infants with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) (21 asymptomatic and 21 symptomatic) were compared with 17 control infants to determine if symptoms of congestive heart failure (i.e., tachypnea/poor growth) were due to depressed contractility or defect size, or both. Echocardiographic indexes of defect size, left ventricular performance (shortening fraction), preload (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension), afterload (left ventricular end-systolic wall stress) and contractility (the relation between velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and wall stress) were measured. Clinical assessment included measurement of weight and respiratory rate. Pulmonary and systemic blood flow were assessed in 17 symptomatic and 3 asymptomatic patients by cardiac catheterization. Although there was no significant difference in age, the symptomatic group had significantly lower weight (5.5 +/- 2.9 vs 7.3 +/- 2.3 kg, p less than 0.05) and a higher respiratory rate (53 +/- 14 vs 43 +/- 6 breaths/min, p less than 0.05), compared with control subjects. The mean pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio in the symptomatic group was 2.9:1. Preload indexed for body surface area was significantly higher in the groups with a VSD compared with control subjects (asymptomatic, 8.5 +/- 1.7 cm/m2; symptomatic, 9.1 +/- 1.7 cm/m2; control subjects, 6.8 +/- 1.1 cm/m2; p less than 0.05). Shortening fraction, afterload and contractility were not significantly different among all groups. A defect size greater than 0.5 cm (or defect size indexed for body surface area greater than 1.8 cm/m2) was predictive of the presence of symptoms. It is concluded that contractility is normal in infants with a VSD. Symptoms may be related to pulmonary congestion. 
Bladder outlet obstruction treated with transurethral ultrasonic aspiration. One-year follow-up on 59 patients. Fifty-nine males with bladder outlet obstruction were treated with transurethral ultrasonic aspiration of the prostate. Utilizing a 26.5F urethral sheath, surgery was accomplished with a 10F, 0-700-micron-vibration-level ultrasonic tip with an excursion rate of 39 kHz. Complete removal of the adenoma was accomplished followed by transurethral electrocautery biopsies of both lateral lobes to compare pathologic specimens. One year follow-up revealed satisfactory voiding patterns in 57 of 59 men (96%). Bladder neck contractures developed in 2 men. Pathologic comparisons showed 100 percent correlation between aspirated and TUR specimens (56 BPH, 3 adenocarcinoma). Forty-seven men were active sexually preoperatively (6 with inflatable penile prostheses). Post ultrasonic aspiration, 46 men had erectile function similar to preoperative levels with 1 patient suffering erectile dysfunction. Forty men (85%) had antegrade ejaculation while 7 (15%) experienced retrograde or retarded ejaculation. No patients were incontinent. 
Histopathology of childhood pneumonia in developing countries. Acute lower respiratory infection in children is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Viral and bacterial agents incite characteristic host responses at the level of the bronchi, bronchioles, alveolar walls, and air spaces that correlate with the clinical course. A systematic review of histopathologic features will enhance the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms and cofactors that influence the disease process, particularly how tissue injury may be influenced by nutritional status and access to antibiotics. Research priorities include immunologic assessment, micronutrient assays, and standardized autopsies in developing countries. DNA probes for organisms and immunocytochemical identification of cell markers in tissue promise a new era in microscopic visualization of pathogen-host interactions. International collaborative research between ministries of public health and medical universities must be encouraged as a means of providing technical assistance and of advancing new knowledge. Systematic standardized autopsy studies from multiple geographic areas may help define pathologic mechanisms, monitor the natural history of disease, and evaluate interventions in diverse populations. 
Outcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction who are ineligible for thrombolytic therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine what proportion of patients with acute myocardial infarction are not eligible for thrombolytic therapy and to assess their natural history. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A large community-based hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized during a 27-month period. MEASUREMENTS: Of 1471 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 230 (16%) received thrombolytic therapy according to the protocol and an additional 97 (7%) received nonprotocol thrombolytic therapy, primary coronary balloon angioplasty, or both because of contraindications. The other 1144 patients (78%) did not receive reperfusion therapy. MAIN RESULTS: The patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy were older, more likely to be women, and more likely to have a history of hypertension, previous myocardial infarction, or chronic angina (all comparisons, P less than 0.002). An average of 1.9 reasons for exclusion were identified per patient among the ineligible patients. Mortality was fivefold higher among ineligible patients (19%; Cl, 16% to 21%) than among protocol-treated patients (4%; Cl, 1% to 6%) (P less than 0.001). In-hospital mortality rates for excluded patients were 28% (Cl, 23% to 32%) in elderly patients (age, greater than 76 years; n = 396); 29% (Cl, 23% to 35%) in patients with stroke or bleeding risk (n = 209); 17% (Cl, 14% to 20%) in patients with delayed presentation (greater than 4 hours after the onset of chest pain; [n = 599]); 14% (Cl, 11% to 16%) in patients with an ineligible electrocardiogram (ECG) (n = 673); and 26% (Cl, 21% to 32%) in patients with a miscellaneous reason for exclusion (n = 243). Independent predictors of increased mortality were: age greater than 76 years, stroke or other bleeding risk, ineligible ECG, or the presence of two or more exclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic therapy is currently used in the United States for only a minority of patients with acute myocardial infarction: those who have low-risk prognostic characteristics. 
Hypercarbic acidosis reduces cardiac resuscitability. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Marked increases in myocardial hypercarbia and acidosis accompany cardiac arrest and resuscitation. To investigate whether hypercarbic acidosis independent of oxygenation is of itself detrimental to cardiac resuscitation, three groups of six Sprague-Dawley rats were ventilated with gas mixtures containing concentrations of inspired CO2 (FICO2) of 0.0, 0.3, or 0.5, with oxygen fractions held constant at 0.5. After 4 mins of ventricular fibrillation, mechanical chest compressions were initiated with a pneumatic thumper; 2 mins later, transthoracic defibrillation was attempted. RESULTS: Each animal ventilated with FICO2 of 0.0 or 0.3 was successfully resuscitated. However, none of the animals ventilated with FICO2 of 0.5, in which aortic pH was less than 6.67 and aortic PCO2 was greater than 200 torr (greater than 26.7 kPa), was resuscitated (p less than .001). This finding contrasted with a second control group of seven identically treated animals which, in the absence of cardiac arrest, demonstrated no adverse effects after ventilation with an FICO2 of 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in FICO2 to levels of 0.5 under conditions of constant arterial oxygenation and controlled coronary perfusion pressure preclude successful resuscitation in this rodent model of CPR. 
Human papillomavirus type 16 DNA in anal cancers from six different countries. An association between anal squamous cell carcinoma and human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 DNA has been documented in the UK. If HPV type 16 is an important aetiological factor in the development of this tumour it would be expected to occur in anal cancer tissues from other parts of the world. In this study a series of 173 anal squamous cell carcinoma tissue samples from five centres around the world have been examined by DNA hybridisation for HPV type 16 DNA sequences. HPV type 16 DNA was found in 50 of 173 (29%) of these. The prevalence of HPV associated anal squamous cell carcinoma was significantly lower in tissue from India and South Africa than in the Swiss, Polish, or Brazilian samples. HPV associated anal squamous cell carcinoma does occur in other countries and further investigations of the prevalence of these tumours in association with other HPV types are required. 
An extensive experience with postoperative pain relief using postoperative fentanyl infusion. From October 1, 1987 through December 31, 1989, 517 patients who were undergoing both thoracic and abdominal surgical procedures were treated for postoperative pain with epidural fentanyl citrate infusion under the direction of an anesthesia pain service. Infusion rates of 4 micrograms/mL of solution were essentially the same for all subjects. Sixty-five percent of patients experienced superior pain control without the use of adjunctive analgesia. Twenty-eight percent of subjects achieved satisfactory pain control but required additional low-dose analgesics. Only 7% of patients remained uncomfortable despite additional intravenous narcotic administration. There were no deaths or respiratory arrests. Six percent of patients experienced nausea, and 0.8% of the cohort required catheterization for urinary retention. This technique of postoperative pain control was safe and provided excellent results. Catheter position was a major determinant of the efficacy of the method. 
Adenovirus-mediated transfer of a recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin gene to the lung epithelium in vivo The respiratory epithelium is a potential site for somatic gene therapy for the common hereditary disorders alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) deficiency and cystic fibrosis. A replication-deficient adenoviral vector (Ad-alpha 1AT) containing an adenovirus major late promoter and a recombinant human alpha 1AT gene was used to infect epithelial cells of the cotton rat respiratory tract in vitro and in vivo. Freshly isolated tracheobronchial epithelial cells infected with Ad-alpha 1AT contained human alpha 1AT messenger RNA transcripts and synthesized and secreted human alpha 1AT. After in vivo intratracheal administration of Ad-alpha 1AT to these rats, human alpha 1AT messenger RNA was observed in the respiratory epithelium, human alpha 1AT was synthesized and secreted by lung tissue, and human alpha 1AT was detected in the epithelial lining fluid for at least 1 week. 
Silent ischemia and severity of pain in acute myocardial infarction. An overall low tendency to complain of pain, due to a low perception of pain, has been suggested in the pathogenesis of silent ischemia, independent of the extent of the diseased coronaries and a history of previous acute myocardial infarction. This hypothesis has been tested indirectly in this retrospective study by comparison of the use of analgesics during admission for a first acute myocardial infarction with the occurrence of silent ischemia at exertion tests four weeks after discharge from hospital. The study did not show a lower use of analgesics in patients with silent ischemia, but this may be due to methodologic problems. Suggestions are given for another study design to overcome these problems. 
Corneal choristoma with microphthalmos. We report two rare cases of corneal choristoma with microphthalmos. In both cases, the whole thickness of the cornea, as well as the anterior chamber and iris, was replaced by cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. In case 1, diagnosed as dermoid choristoma, the cutaneous tissue contained skin appendages and subcutaneous fibrofatty tissue extended into the vitreous cavity. The fibrous mass in the cavity contained fragments of retina. In case 2, diagnosed as a dermislike choristoma, the cutaneous tissue lacked skin appendages. These choristomatous cutaneous tissues hindered normal growth of ocular structures, resulting in microphthalmos. Use of computed tomography was helpful in evaluating the extent of ocular tissue involvement and accompanying intraocular malformations. 
Radiation-induced meningiomas: experience at the Mount Sinai Hospital and review of the literature. From the records of The Mount Sinai Hospital, seven cases which met established criteria for radiation-induced meningiomas were identified. This represents the largest series of radiogenic meningiomas documented in North America and includes both intracranial and intraspinal tumors. The records and pathological specimens were reviewed and these data analyzed with other cases retrieved from the world literature. This study reveals that radiation-induced meningiomas can be categorized into three groups based on the amount of radiation administered: 1) low dose; 2) moderate dose and miscellaneous; and 3) high dose. The overwhelming majority of cases had received low-dose irradiation (800 rad) to the scalp for tinea capitis and the second largest group resulted from high-dose irradiation for primary brain tumors (greater than 2000 rad). The unique features distinguishing radiation-induced meningiomas from other meningiomas are reviewed. Although histologically atypical tumors were common in this series, overt malignancy was not encountered. The preoperative management of these lesions should include angiography to evaluate for large-vessel occlusive vasculopathy, a known association of meningiomas induced by high-dose irradiation. Given the propensity these tumors possess for recurrence, a wide bony and dural margin is recommended at surgical resection. 
Radical prostatectomy for stage A adenocarcinoma of the prostate: staging errors and their implications for treatment recommendations and disease outcome. Of 148 patients with clinical stage A1 (32) or A2 (116) disease who had radical prostatectomy only 63% and 62%, respectively, had pathological stage A disease. Although 25% of those with clinical stage A1 and 9% of those with clinical stage A2 disease had no cancer at radical prostatectomy, 12% and 29%, respectively, had pathological stage C disease or higher. Clinical Mayo grade 1 was never associated with extracapsular disease but 60% of those with grade 3 or higher tumor did have extracapsular disease. Over-all survival was comparable to the expected survival. Clinical stage A2 cancer was associated with a significantly higher progression rate (when prostate specific antigen values were considered, p = 0.0011) and cancer death rate (p less than 0.045) than stage A1 disease, whereas pathological stage was not significantly related to disease outcome, possibly because of the use of adjuvant treatment (hormonal or radiation) for some patients with pathological stage C or higher disease. The vagaries of clinical staging associated with stage A disease, as well as the previously documented progression on long-term followup (8 to 10 years) in younger (60 years old or less) patients with stage A1 prostate cancer make radical prostatectomy with its limited morbidity an acceptable treatment choice. 
Morphine compared with diamorphine. A comparison of dose requirements and side-effects after hip surgery. The dose requirements and side effects of morphine were compared with those of diamorphine administered by patient-controlled analgesia in 40 patients following elective total hip replacement. Patients were allocated randomly to receive in a double-blind manner either morphine or diamorphine for postoperative pain relief. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to postoperative sedation, nausea, well-being, pain relief and requirements for antiemetic drugs. The dose requirement for diamorphine was approximately 50% of that for morphine. 
The Foot Function Index: a measure of foot pain and disability. A Foot Function Index (FFI) was developed to measure the impact of foot pathology on function in terms of pain, disability and activity restriction. The FFI is a self-administered index consisting of 23 items divided into 3 sub-scales. Both total and sub-scale scores are produced. The FFI was examined for test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct and criterion validity. A total of 87 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were used in the study. Test-retest reliability of the FFI total and sub-scale scores ranged from 0.87 to 0.69. Internal consistency ranged from 0.96 to 0.73. With the exception of two items, factor analysis supported the construct validity of the total index and the sub-scales. Strong correlation between the FFI total and sub-scale scores and clinical measures of foot pathology supported the criterion validity of the index. The FFI should prove useful for both clinical and research purposes. 
Role of hepatitis C virus in non-B chronic liver disease. To assess the contribution of the recently identified hepatitis C virus to chronic liver diseases of unknown cause and chronic hepatitis attributed by exclusion to non-A, non-B hepatitis, we tested for antibody to hepatitis C in hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients with a spectrum of chronic liver diseases. Antibody to hepatitis C virus, a marker of hepatitis C infection, was detected with a first-generation radioimmunoassay at the following frequencies in the following patient groups: 69% of transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis; 53% of non-transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis; 26% of hepatitis B surface antigen-negative hepatocellular carcinoma; 8% of cryptogenic cirrhosis; 5% to 7% of autoimmune chronic liver diseases; 19% of patients with miscellaneous types of chronic liver disease; and 0.67% of healthy controls. Among non-transfusion-associated cases, 81% with a history of intravenous drug use but only 18% with occupational exposure as health workers had antibody to hepatitis C virus. Among cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 63% of Japanese patients but only 11% of American patients had evidence of hepatitis C infection. Comparison in a subgroup of 79 serum samples of a second-generation radioimmunoassay with the first-generation assay demonstrated a 12% increase in antibody frequency from 30% to 42%. We conclude that hepatitis C plays a substantial role in transfusion-associated and non-transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis as well as in hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in Japan, a limited role in cryptogenic cirrhosis, and essentially no role in autoimmune chronic liver diseases. Application of more sensitive immunoassays will increase the frequency of antibody seropositivity in all subgroups, but relative distinctions among risk groups are likely to remain. 
Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. A histopathologic study. Histopathologic examination was done on 18 cases after percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT) for hepatocellular carcinoma. In eight cases, the lesion was treated by PEIT alone; in the other ten cases, PEIT was combined with transcatheter arterial embolization. The lesion was completely necrotic in 13 cases, 90% necrotic in four cases, and 70% necrotic in the rest. In addition, PEIT seemed to be effective against intercapsular, extracapsular, and vascular invasions. In the four cases of incomplete necrosis, the viable cancer tissue remained in small tumor nodules around the main tumor, in portions isolated by septa, or along the edge of the lesion. Therefore, ethanol should be injected not only into the center of the lesion, but also into sites close to its edge. Ethanol did not damage noncancerous liver parenchyma distant from injected sites. Local dissemination of the cancer cells was not found in any case. Therefore, PEIT seems to be a valuable therapy and may be an alternative to surgery in some cases. 
Contact-tip Nd:YAG laser applications: squamous nasal papillomatosis. Concurrent use of nasal endoscopes and the contact-tip Nd:YAG laser provides the necessary visualization and control for treating a widespread condition such as nasal papillomatosis. This laser should decrease the likelihood of spread to other sites within the patient's upper respiratory tract or to attending health care personnel. 
Pressure-diameter relationships of the upper airway in awake supine subjects. In awake supine normal subjects, dimensional changes of the oropharyngeal airway were measured during exposure to negative intraluminal pressures. The pressure was generated 1) "actively" by subjects inspiring against an externally occluded airway or 2) "passively" by external suction at the mouth during voluntary glottic closure with no inspiratory effort. Airway dimensions were imaged with X-ray fluoroscopy and anteroposterior diameters measured at levels corresponding to cervical vertebra 3 and 4 (C3 and C4). Cephalad axial displacement of the hyoid bone (CDHY) was also measured. During the "active" maneuver, airway diameters and position were maintained at resting levels despite airway pressure up to -15 cmH2O. In contrast, during the passive maneuver at -15 cmH2O, C3 was only 15 +/- 9% and C4 only 47 +/- 8% of control; CDHY was 5.6 +/- 1.8 mm. In three subjects airway wall apposition occurred and persisted until an active inspiratory effort. We conclude that, in the absence of inspiratory effort, negative oropharyngeal airway pressures result in marked narrowing and cephalad displacement of the upper airway, even during wakefulness. Therefore, our data suggest that the complex interaction of upper airway and thoracic muscle activity is critical in determining the effective compliance and patency of the upper airway, which is readily collapsible even in normal subjects. 
Human immunodeficiency virus induction of malignant transformation in human B lymphocytes. Aggressive B-cell lymphomas are occurring with increasing incidence among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Several lines of evidence implicate both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and c-myc activation in the pathogenesis of a major subset of these tumors. These observations prompted our investigation of interactions among EBV, c-myc, and HIV in primary B cells. We show that nonimmortalized peripheral B lymphocytes from EBV-seropositive, HIV-seronegative donors can be infected by HIV and that a subset of these lymphocytes become transformed. Malignant transformation was documented by several criteria. These cells displayed altered growth properties, propagating in 1% serum and cloning in soft agar, and formed invasive tumors of Burkitt lymphoma phenotype after subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Such cells revealed marked enhancement of EBV DNA and RNA and of endogenous c-myc transcripts and protein. HIV-1 infection of already immortalized B-cell lines led to a similar upregulation of EBV and c-myc transcripts. These data indicate that HIV has properties of a transforming retrovirus, as it mediates two events linked to B-cell neoplasia: deregulation of c-myc and activation of EBV. They also raise the possibility of a role for HIV, apart from induction of immune suppression, in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
Hepatitis C in patients undergoing liver transplantation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) among patients undergoing liver transplantation and the relation between anti-HCV and post-transplant hepatitis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. PATIENTS: Serum samples from 128 patients who underwent liver transplantation. Sixty-six patients who had 6 months of follow-up and for whom both pretransplant and post-transplant serum samples were available were included in a study to asses the relation between anti-HCV and post-transplant hepatitis. MEASUREMENTS: Sera were tested for anti-HCV using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and, if positive, two confirmatory tests were done. Patients had a biopsy every week until two specimens showed no abnormal findings. MAIN RESULTS: Only patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (15 of 30; 50%), alcoholic cirrhosis (7 of 19; 37%), and chronic hepatitis B infection (3 of 11; 27%) were anti-HCV positive. No patient with another form of chronic liver disease or with acute liver failure due to non-A, non-B hepatitis was anti-HCV positive. After transplantation, loss of anti-HCV was frequent and acquisition rare. Hepatitis developed in the graft in 17% of patients, but the incidence was similar among anti-HCV negative and anti-HCV-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C virus is a common cause of chronic liver disease in patients requiring liver transplantation, but anti-HCV is rarely found in patients with acute liver failure. Previous HCV infection, based on detection of anti-HCV, is not an independent risk factor for post-transplant hepatitis. 
Microscopic activity in ulcerative colitis: what does it mean? To determine the prognostic importance of microscopic rectal inflammation we followed up 82 patients (aged 21 to 78 years, 44 men) with chronic quiescent ulcerative colitis over 12 months. At trial entry each patient underwent a rectal biopsy and sections were graded independently by two histopathologists. A chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate of varying severity was present in all biopsy specimens, and 58% had crypt architectural irregularities. In addition, 32% had evidence of acute inflammatory activity: 28% acute inflammatory cell infiltrate, 11% crypt abscesses, and 22% mucin depletion. Agreement between the two histopathologists for the presence of each of these features was 94% (90-98%). During the 12 month follow up 27 patients (33%) relapsed after a mean interval of 18 weeks (range 3-44 weeks). Relapse rates were unrelated to duration or extent of disease or to the type of maintenance drug treatment. In patients with an acute inflammatory cell infiltrate 52% relapsed, whereas in the absence of such an infiltrate only 25% relapsed (p = 0.02). Similarly, relapse rates were higher in the presence of crypt abscesses (78% v 27%, p less than 0.005), mucin depletion (56% v p less than 0.02), and breaches in the surface epithelium (75% v 31%, p = 0.1). The presence of a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate or crypt architectural irregularities, however, bore no relation to the frequency of colitis relapse. 
Mechanisms of disease in Hantavirus infection: pathophysiology of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute viral disease that occurs over wide areas of Europe and Asia. Hantaviruses are the cause of this syndrome. The hallmark of HFRS is the triad of fever, hemorrhage, and renal failure. In its severe form it is associated with significant mortality. The syndrome evolves through five phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, diuretic, and convalescent. The central physiologic derangement in HFRS is vascular dysfunction, manifested by impaired vascular tone and increased vascular permeability. The systemic effects of this dysfunction account for the occurrence of hypotension and shock, while local effects are probably important in the development of renal failure. Shock in HFRS has distributive and oligemic features, while renal failure has features of acute tubular necrosis. Hemorrhage is a consequence of vascular injury and a deficit of functional platelets. Vascular and platelet dysfunction are both compounded by uremia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation contributes to hemorrhage in some patients. Although hantaviruses are infectious for endothelial cells and may cause direct injury, a large body of evidence suggests that immune mechanisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of HFRS. 
Prognostic factors of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood. An International Society of Pediatric Oncology study. Pretreatment characteristics of 57 patients with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) registered by the International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) between January 1975 and December 1983 were identified to perform a prognostic factor study. Living status and disease-free survival (DFS) time were assessed for all patients on January 1, 1988. By multi-variate analyses, lymph node involvement (P = 0.0003) and tumor invasiveness (P = 0.007) were identified as the most significant covariates correlated with survival. A model including N stage (P = 0.001) and age (P = 0.03) was selected for predicting DFS rates. Children between 5 and 10 years of age had better DFS rates than those younger than 5 years of age or those older than 10 years of age. The authors suggest a prognostic classification that could allow treatment to be adjusted according to clinical staging. 
Blood pressure during sleep: antihypertensive medication. To investigate whether excessive reduction of blood pressure (BP) by antihypertensive medications correlates with myocardial infarction, especially during sleep in elderly patients, we used telemetry and cuvette dye-dilution methods to assess the direct BP and the hemodynamics of 68 inpatients with essential hypertension during wakefulness and sleep. There were 25 patients greater than or equal to 60 years old (OH-group) and 43 were less than or equal to 59 years old (YH-group). Of the OH-group, 36% showed high BP during the day, with marked decreases (minimum BP less than 110/70 mm Hg) during sleep. Average cardiac index (CI) of the OH-group was low during wakefulness and extremely low during slow-wave sleep. Changes of mean BP in the OH-group correlated with changes in total peripheral vascular resistance index (TPRI) during sleep, but this correlation was not observed in the YH-group. The antihypertensive effects on nocturnal BP of the various medications was: central adrenergic inhibitors less than or equal to beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity less than or equal to alpha (alpha beta) blockers less than or equal to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors less than or equal to calcium antagonists. Because BP and CI were found to be very low and TPRI seems to play an important role in BP regulation in sleeping elderly patients, excessive antihypertensive medication may be harmful to this subgroup. However, because the effects on nocturnal BP differ among various antihypertensive treatments, further research is required on the relation between antihypertensive medication and the hemodynamics of sleeping elderly hypertensive patients. 
Changes in hepatic haemodynamics and hepatic perfusion index during the growth and development of hypovascular HSN sarcoma in rats. Experimental liver tumours were induced in the Hooded Lister rat by the intraportal inoculation of 10(6) HSN sarcoma cells. The hepatic perfusion index was raised 10 days after the inoculation of cells (at the micrometastatic stage) and when overt tumour was present 20 days after inoculation. Overt tumours were hypovascular compared with normal liver. Portal venous flow and portal venous inflow fell significantly when the hepatic perfusion index was increased, but hepatic arterial flow did not alter. Portal vascular resistance and splanchnic vascular resistance were both increased in tumour-bearing animals but portal pressure, arteriosystemic shunting and portosystemic shunting did not increase significantly at any stage during the growth of hepatic tumour. These findings confirm that the hepatic perfusion index can be elevated in the presence of both micrometastic and overt hepatic tumour and that the changes are not due to either arteriosystemic shunting or mechanical portal venous obstruction. 
Gliomatosis peritonei with malignant transformation: a case report and review of the literature. Gliomatosis peritonei is the implantation of glial tissue within the peritoneal cavity associated with ovarian teratomas. Previous reports have emphasized improved outcomes when these implants are found to be mature, even if the ovarian component is immature. A 16-year-old female with grade 3 immature teratoma was found on two subsequent laparotomies to have extensive peritoneal implantation of mature glial tissue. More than 5 years after the original surgery she was found to have a malignant abdominal glial neoplasm. This case illustrates a rare finding of malignant transformation of previously mature gliomatosis peritonei. 
Limited benefit of atropine as premedication for colonoscopy. A prospective double-blind trial was performed comparing atropine (0.5 mg) by slow intravenous administration to placebo as premedication for colonoscopy, to assess the possible beneficial effects of this vagolytic agent on the performance and safety of the procedure. A total of 77 patients was randomly assigned to receive atropine (38 patients) or placebo (39 patients) before colonoscopy in conjunction with our standard initial medications for conscious sedation (meperidine, 0.4 mg/kg and midazolam, 0.03 mg/kg). Total procedure time was 31 min for the atropine group and 35 min for the placebo group (p greater than 0.05), and there was no overall difference in the total amount of intra-procedural medications required. No statistically significant differences were observed relative to the number or severity of vagal episodes, and neither the endoscopist nor the patients noted any differences in the ease or tolerance of the procedure (p greater than 0.05). Although these results fail to demonstrate a significant benefit of atropine when given routinely as premedication for colonoscopy, this study does not rule out the potential usefulness of atropine in counteracting vagal episodes when they occur. 
Effects of cytokine combinations on acute phase protein production in two human hepatoma cell lines. We evaluated the effects of binary combinations of four cytokines on production of the positive acute phase proteins alpha-1 antichymotrypsin, haptoglobin and fibrinogen, and the negative acute phase proteins albumin and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in two human hepatoma cell lines. The effects of the cytokine combinations on the five proteins varied; each protein exhibited a unique and specific pattern of response to the cytokine combinations. In Hep G2 cells, antichymotrypsin was induced by all four cytokines, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-alpha, and transforming growth factor beta 1 alone, and their effects in binary combinations could be attributed to additive or minimally synergistic interactions. Fibrinogen was induced only by IL-6 and this induction was inhibited by IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha or transforming growth factor beta 1. Haptoglobin was also induced only by IL-6, but TNF-alpha was the only cytokine that inhibited this induction at all concentrations of IL-6. Each of the four cytokines alone down regulated production of AFP and albumin. However, binary combinations of the four cytokines were simply additive, for the most part, in inhibiting AFP production, whereas the inhibitory effects of combinations of cytokines on albumin production differed significantly from simple additive effects. These observations, taken together with studies of effects of cytokine combinations on other acute phase proteins, indicate that the various acute phase proteins respond differently to different combinations of cytokines and that the potential exists for highly specific regulation of synthesis of individual plasma proteins by cytokine interactions. These findings imply that the acute phase response in vivo represents the integrated sum of multiple, separately regulated changes in gene expression. 
Anal tonometry: a quick method of anal manometry. Evaluation of anal sphincter tonic activity is important in the proctologic clinic. However, manometric techniques are expensive, complex, and only available in some centers. Because there is often an in-office need for having objective measurements of anal tonic activity, in our clinic we introduced a simple method for measurement of anal pressures. This method is based on the flow of air in an open circuit by using a rubber probe with a side opening at one end. Pressure is assessed by an ordinary manometric gauge for arterial pressure. With this simple instrument, the following parameters are measured: 1) anal resting pressure, 2) squeeze pressure, 3) functional length of the anal canal, and 4) descent of the perineum on staining. After testing the technique in 100 healthy persons, it was applied to 130 patients with several proctologic disorders. Differences in pressures were found between controls and patients with anal fissure (high resting pressures), and patients with anal incontinence (low resting and/or squeeze pressures). A correlation was also found between the descending perineum measured by this method and by defecography. This simple instrument is useful in the office as the first approach to the function of the anal sphincters and the pelvic floor. Nowadays, so-called anal tonometry is part of the proctologic examination in our department, because it is simple, reliable, and takes only a few minutes. 
Verification of a new clinicopathologic staging system for colorectal adenocarcinoma. Rectal adenocarcinoma is said to have a poorer outcome than colon adenocarcinoma when compared on the basis of Dukes' staging. However a new staging system, determined by a multivariate analysis of 147 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma, has revealed three other variables significantly related to outcome. Therefore this study analyzed the authors' experience with colonic carcinoma during the same time period as they had studied for rectal carcinoma to determine whether the new staging system is valid for colon carcinoma as well, and, if so, to compare the outcome of patients with colon and rectal carcinoma on the basis of this new staging. A total of 603 patients with 611 colonic adenocarcinoma were operated on at the University of Chicago Medical Center between 1965 and 1981. Two hundred seventy-nine adenocarcinomas (45.7%) were located proximal to the splenic flexure and 332 (54.3%) were located between the splenic flexure and the rectosigmoid. Four hundred sixty-two patients underwent segmental colectomy, 46 subtotal colectomy, 26 total colectomy, 18 proctocolectomy, 5 abdominal-perineal resection, 1 appendectomy, while 20 had local excision of the tumor through colotomy and 25 had permanent diverting stoma as the only procedure. The operative mortality rate was 6.1% in the whole group, but was only 2.7% in the group of potentially curable patients. Complete follow-up was obtained in all patients. To validate a previous staging system for Dukes' B and C rectal adenocarcinoma, the authors investigated the correlation between 5-year survival for colonic carcinoma patients and all relevant variables that they had considered potentially meaningful in the previous study with rectal adenocarcinoma. The resulting multivariate analysis using Cox regression showed that the four variables found previously to be significantly related to outcome for rectal adenocarcinoma patients (stage, race, tumor morphology, and vascular and/or lymphatic microinvasion) were the only four variables significantly (p less than 0.05) associated with outcome for colonic adenocarcinoma patients. In addition, by using the results of their previous staging system for rectal adenocarcinoma patients, they 'predicted' the 5-year survival rates of the colon adenocarcinoma patients, divided in 16 staging subgroups. In subgroups of at least 15 patients, the rectal staging system predicted the outcome to within 1 to 6 percentage points of the observed outcome of the colonic adenocarcinoma patients. Thus this study validates this staging system, incorporating stage, race, tumor morphology, and microinvasion to predict 5-year survival rate more accurately than Dukes' staging alone for both colon and rectal adenocarcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Acute twin-twin transfusion: a possible mechanism for brain-damaged survivors after intrauterine death of a monochorionic twin. Intrauterine death of one twin in monochorionic pregnancies is associated with increased mortality and morbidity for the survivor. This has been attributed to the consequences of intrauterine disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) initiated by the dead twin. We describe a case in which the fetal cerebral and renal lesions typically found in survivors occurred without any derangement in coagulation. Instead, acute twin-twin transfusion was suggested by the presence of severe anemia in the surviving fetus at delivery. We suggest that the lesions frequently found in the survivors are often due to acute hemodynamic and ischemic changes resulting from acute twin-twin transfusion at the time of intrauterine death, rather than to late-onset DIC. This hypothesis has an important implication for future management: Intervention must occur before intrauterine death if neurologic sequelae in the survivor are to be prevented. 
A critical review of the relationship between impaired fibrinolysis and myocardial infarction. To explore the relationship between impaired fibrinolysis and myocardial infarction, we conducted a literature search and reviewed the published data. The results indicate that myocardial infarction has a significant influence on fibrinolytic activity and that impaired fibrinolysis is more frequent in patients who have had a myocardial infarction than in healthy control subjects. Prospective cohort studies indicate that tests for global fibrinolytic activity are not of prognostic value for first or recurrent myocardial infarction. However, high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor and low levels of tissue plasminogen activator activity were associated with an increased risk of reinfarction in survivors of a first myocardial infarction. Whether this relationship between impaired fibrinolysis and reinfarction is causal or coincidental is unclear. There is evidence that impairment of fibrinolytic activity is more marked in patients with myocardial infarction who have minimal coronary atherosclerosis than in those who have marked atherosclerosis, suggesting that impaired fibrinolytic activity might be of pathogenetic importance in this small subgroup of patients. 
Phosphorus metabolites in the human placenta estimated in vivo by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Normal human placental metabolism has been studied in vivo by image localised 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 13 women with anterior placentas; five, however, were too fat for useful spectral signals to be obtained. Magnetic resonance spectra of good quality which were considered to have arisen from the placenta were obtained from seven women with uncomplicated pregnancies (median gestational age 35 weeks, range 28-39). One other woman had a twin pregnancy in which one fetus had died a few days before. The phosphodiester signal from the placenta of the dead fetus was outside the 95% confidence intervals for normal placentas, suggesting that this technique may potentially be useful in the assessment of placental function. 
Caffeine clearance by enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique: a simple, inexpensive, and useful indicator of liver function. The clinical value and sensitivity of serum caffeine clearance measurement has been evaluated as an indicator of hepatic disease. After a 17 hour caffeine exclusion period, 300 mg of caffeine citrate was administered orally to the study subjects. Serum samples were taken four and 16 hours later. Serum caffeine concentrations were measured using an enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) and a clearance value derived. Conventional liver function tests were measured at the same time. A total of 103 subjects attending the medical unit in a district general hospital were studied. Twenty one had alcoholic liver disease, 11 non-alcoholic cirrhosis, nine non-cirrhotic liver disease, 21 suspected liver disease, six hepatic tumours, and 35 were hospital and normal control subjects. Caffeine clearance values were lowest in subjects with alcoholic liver disease (median 0.19 ml/min/kg, range 0.04-0.61 ml/min/kg) and significantly reduced in all subjects with liver disease (median 0.32 ml/min/kg, range 0.04-2.68 ml/min/kg) compared with control subjects (median 1.27 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.001). In subjects with suspected liver disease subsequently shown to have another explanation for abnormal liver function test results, caffeine clearance values were normal (median 1.31 ml/min/kg, range 0.23-2.64 ml/min/kg) and significantly different, p less than 0.001, from those of subjects with liver disease. Serum albumen values were not different for these latter two groups. Using a cut off value of 0.86 ml/min/kg, caffeine clearance measurement was 100% sensitive for alcoholic liver disease and 89% sensitive for all liver disease. The respective sensitivities for conventional liver function test measurement were 76% and 83%. In the suspected liver disease group, caffeine clearance was abnormal in only 24%, conventional liver function tests were abnormal in 95%. 
Efficacy of multiple balloon aortic valvuloplasty procedures. The Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry Investigators. To determine the efficacy of a second balloon aortic valvuloplasty procedure in comparison with the original procedure, 47 patients (18 men, 29 women; mean age 77 +/- 10 years) who underwent two balloon aortic valvuloplasty procedures over a mean interval of 6.4 months between procedures (range 2 days to 15 months) were retrospectively examined. The mean pressure gradient across the aortic valve was significantly higher before the first than before the second valvuloplasty procedure (62 +/- 21 vs. 53 +/- 21 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) and after the first compared with after the second procedure (32 +/- 13 vs. 28 +/- 14 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). The cardiac output and stroke volume after the first procedure were significantly greater than the values for these variables after the second procedure (4.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.1 liters/min; p less than 0.05; and 54 +/- 17 vs. 47 +/- 15 ml/beat; p less than 0.05, respectively). There were no significant differences in the change observed in any variable between the first and second procedures. At a mean follow-up interval of 5.3 months (range 6 days to 15 months) after the second procedure 18 (38%) of the 47 patients had died, 12 (25%) required surgical valve replacement and 4 (8%) required a third valvuloplasty procedure. Overall, 31 (66%) of 47 patients met clinical failure end points after the second procedure. Three patients had two failure end points. The 47 patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the interval between valvuloplasty procedures. 
In situ hybridization analysis of human papillomavirus DNA in oral mucosal lesions. Commercial biotinylated DNA probes specific for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11; 16 and 18; and 31, 33, and 35 were used for in situ hybridization analysis of 105 oral mucosal specimens from 5 cases of verruca vulgaris, 15 cases of condyloma acuminatum, 30 cases of squamous papilloma, 20 cases of hyperkeratosis/acanthosis, 15 cases of epithelial dysplasia, 5 cases of carcinoma in situ, and 15 cases of squamous cell carcinoma. Positive hybridization signals were found in 26 specimens (24.8%). Only HPV-6/11 was detected. HPV DNA occurred significantly more often (p less than 0.005, chi-square analysis) in condyloma acuminatum (100%) and verruca vulgaris (100%) than squamous papilloma (13.3%), hyperkeratotic/acanthotic lesions (10%), and malignant and premalignant lesions (0%). The tongue (19.1%) and labial epithelium (17.1%) were infected most frequently. Nuclear reaction products indicating HPV infection were associated primarily with koilocytes. These results demonstrate the usefulness of commercial biotinylated probes for HPV DNA analysis in routine paraffin-embedded lesion specimens. They confirm HPV involvement in benign lesions of the oral mucosa but fail to associate HPV infection with oral cancer and precancer. 
Unusual presentation of cutaneous metastatic malignant melanoma. This report describes an unusual presentation of cutaneous metastases suspected to have occurred through lymphatic spread in a patient with malignant melanoma. Punctate papular skin lesions correlated histologically with small tumor foci in the papillary dermis. 
Nocturnal nasal ventilation for treatment of patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure. We reviewed the Mayo Clinic experience with nocturnal nasal ventilation (NNV) and retrospectively assessed the clinical benefits, patient compliance, and complications. NNV had been instituted in 26 patients with daytime hypercapnia and nocturnal hypoventilation due to neuromuscular diseases or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. After initiation of NNV, 21 of 26 patients continued to use this treatment regularly (81% compliance rate) and considered their life-style improved. In this subset of patients, the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide during unassisted breathing decreased from 64 +/- 13 to 51 +/- 7 mm Hg, and the arterial partial pressure of oxygen increased from 58 +/- 12 to 68 +/- 8 mm Hg. No significant change was noted in the forced vital capacity or maximal respiratory pressures. Four of the five patients in whom NNV had been discontinued cited discomfort related to the mask or severity and poor prognosis of the underlying illness as reasons for cessation of treatment. We conclude that NNV is well tolerated by most patients and may improve alveolar ventilation and arterial oxygenation in patients with chronic respiratory failure. 
Histologic characteristics of carotid artery plaque. Carotid plaque characteristics associated with the production of symptoms were identified with quantification of carotid plaque constituents in high-grade stenotic asymptomatic (n = 8) and symptomatic (n = 44) plaques. Asymptomatic plaques contained significantly more fibrous/collagen material (88%) than symptomatic plaques (66%) (p less than 0.05). Hemorrhage constituted 2% and 1% of asymptomatic and symptomatic plaques, respectively. The predominant nonfibrous material was a pink amorphous material mixed with cholesterol, which composed 7% of asymptomatic and 27% of symptomatic plaques (p less than 0.05). No relationship was found between plaque composition and the number of ipsilateral ischemic neurologic events, nor was there evidence of a healing process. B-mode ultrasound scanning had a sensitivity of 94% in identifying plaque with greater than 80% fibrous content. We believe that plaque composition may be a useful discriminating factor in selecting asymptomatic patients for carotid endarterectomy. 
Mitral valve replacement in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is an eosinophil-mediated tissue injury causing multiple organ failure. Cardiac manifestations include subendocardial fibrosis, thrombus leading to peripheral emboli, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and valvar dysfunction. This article describes a patient with the syndrome and reviews surgical experience with valve replacement and long-term prognosis. 
Current practices for treatment of dysentery in rural Bangladesh. A rural area of Bangladesh with a population of 191,000 had 643 health care providers, of whom 324 (50%) practiced allopathic (Western) medicine, 152 (24%) were spiritualists, 109 (17%) were herbalists, and 58 (9%) were homeopaths. Two hundred eight (64%) of the allopaths had no formal training, and only 18 (6%) were graduates of medical school. In a community-based study of 480 children with bloody diarrhea and 480 children with nonbloody diarrhea, allopathic treatment was the most common care provided. Furazolidone and metronidazole were the two most commonly prescribed drugs, given to 26% and 23% of children, respectively, who were seen by a practitioner. Only 25% of children had received oral rehydration therapy. We conclude that in this region of Bangladesh care of acute diarrhea is provided mostly by private medical practitioners who have little or no training; that such care currently is largely irrational; and that the provision of rational care will require the development of simple algorithms that these practitioners can implement for treatment of this disease. 
The otolaryngologic manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): a clinical investigation of 225 patients using ambulatory 24-hour pH monitoring and an experimental investigation of the role of acid and pepsin in the development of laryngeal injury. Occult (silent) gastroesophageal reflux disease (GER, GERD) is believed to be an important etiologic factor in the development of many inflammatory and neoplastic disorders of the upper aerodigestive tract. In order ot test this hypothesis, a human study and an animal study were performed. The human study consisted primarily of applying a new diagnostic technique (double-probe pH monitoring) to a population of otolaryngology patients with GERD to determine the incidence of overt and occult GERD. The animal study consisted of experiments to evaluate the potential damaging effects of intermittent GER on the larynx. Two hundred twenty-five consecutive patients with otolaryngologic disorders having suspected GERD evaluated from 1985 through 1988 are reported. Ambulatory 24-hour intraesophageal pH monitoring was performed in 197; of those, 81% underwent double-probe pH monitoring, with the second pH probe being placed in the hypopharynx at the laryngeal inlet. Seventy percent of the patients also underwent barium esophagography with videofluoroscopy. The patient population was divided into seven diagnostic subgroups: carcinoma of the larynx (n = 31), laryngeal and tracheal stenosis (n = 33), reflux laryngitis (n = 61), globus pharyngeus (n = 27), dysphagia (n = 25), chronic cough (n = 30), and a group with miscellaneous disorders (n = 18). The most common symptoms were hoarseness (71%), cough (51%), globus (47%), and throat clearing (42%). Only 43% of the patients had gastrointestinal symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation). Thus, by traditional symptomatology, GER was occult or silent in the majority of the study population. Twenty-eight patients (12%) refused or could not tolerate pH monitoring. Of the patients undergoing diagnostic pH monitoring, 62% had abnormal esophageal pH studies, and 30% demonstrated reflux into the pharynx. The results of diagnostic pH monitoring for each of the subgroups were as follows (percentage with abnormal studies): carcinoma (71%), stenosis (78%), reflux laryngitis (60%), globus (58%), dysphagia (45%), chronic cough (52%), and miscellaneous (13%). The highest yield of abnormal pharyngeal reflux was in the carcinoma group and the stenosis group (58% and 56%, respectively). By comparison, the diagnostic barium esophagogram with videofluoroscopy was frequently negative. The results were as follows: esophagitis (18%), reflux (9%), esophageal dysmotility (12%), and stricture (3%). All of the study patients were treated with antireflux therapy. Follow-up was available on 68% of the patients and the mean follow-up period was 11.6 +/- 12.7 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Alcohol ablation of atrioventricular conduction Transcoronary ablation of atrioventricular conduction by dehydrated alcohol was attempted in 14 patients with refractory atrial arrhythmias. Alcohol (0.5 or 1.0 ml) was delivered after selective catheterisation of the atrioventricular nodal artery in the 10 patients in whom the artery could be identified by cineangiography. The other four patients underwent electrical ablation when the nodal artery could not be catheterised. Temporary atrioventricular block induced by dilute contrast and cold saline (0.9%) confirmed that the catheter was in the correct position before the alcohol was delivered. In all 10 patients complete atrioventricular block developed after alcohol ablation. The block persisted in all four patients given 1.0 ml alcohol but not in four of the six given 0.5 ml. The mean (SD) creatine kinase (MB fraction) at four to six hours after ablation was 76.5 (49.5) IU after 1.0 ml and 75.5 (43.1) IU after 0.5 ml alcohol (normal less than 20 IU). The overall success rate of alcohol ablation in the whole group on an "intention to treat" basis was 43%. The procedure was a technical success in six of the 10 patients in whom the nodal artery was identified. Transcoronary alcohol ablation of atrioventricular conduction should be considered in patients in whom electrical techniques have been unsuccessful. 
Inadequate immune response among public safety workers receiving intradermal vaccination against hepatitis B--United States, 1990-1991. The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recommends that hepatitis B vaccine be administered by the intramuscular (IM) route (1). However, since November 1990, public safety departments have reported to CDC at least four instances of poor immune response among public safety workers vaccinated against hepatitis B by the intradermal (ID) route of administration. 
Itraconazole in the treatment of coccidioidomycosis. Sixteen patients with coccidioidomycosis were treated with itraconazole for one year. Sixteen suffered from pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, two of them had associated mediastinal lesions, and one suffered from skin coccidioidomycosis. The daily dose used was 400 mg during the one-year period. Patients were clinically evaluated every month and tested for mycosis every three months. All patients except for one showed negative cultures on the third month after treatment began. Effectiveness achieved was excellent in eight patients (50 percent); a very good response was found in seven patients (44 percent); no response was seen in one patient (6 percent). There were four (25 percent) relapses and one dropout. Side effects seen were high blood pressure (19 percent) and lower limb edema (6 percent), which was temporary and at no time required discontinuing the drug therapy. We believe that itraconazole is an effective drug to treat coccidioidomycosis with a wide safety margin. It is well tolerated, and the incidence of relapses was low. 
Factors associated with chronic lung disease in preterm infants. Among 659 infants of 30 weeks' gestation or less born in a regional perinatal centre between 1983 and 1989, 195 were ventilated for four days or more and survived to 28 days, and 87 of these developed chronic lung disease. There was a sevenfold increase in the annual incidence of chronic lung disease over time. During the same period there were significant increases in the number of infants who survived, the incidence of septicaemia, and the use of parenteral lipid emulsions. Chronic lung disease was significantly associated with low birth weight, shorter gestation, duration of ventilation, vaginal delivery, sepsis, and the use of lipid. Respiratory and physiological measurements at 96 hours were significantly worse in infants who subsequently developed chronic lung disease. Initial logistic regression showed that gestation, arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2), and ventilation rate at 96 hours; and birth in 1988 or 1989, were independently associated with chronic lung disease, but when septicaemia and use of lipid during the first 21 days were included, only gestational age (odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.49 to 0.81 for each week) and use of lipid (odds ratio 8.1, 95% CI, 2.32 to 28.0) remained significantly associated with chronic lung disease. The observed increase in incidence of chronic lung disease in this population was associated with earlier use of parenteral lipids in infants of very low gestation rather than with changes in population, survival, or ventilator treatment of respiratory distress syndrome. 
Left main coronary artery aneurysm in association with severe atherosclerosis: a case report and review of the literature. Aneurysms of the coronary arteries occur in from 0.3% to 4.9% of angiograms. Only 12 cases of left main artery (LMA) aneurysms have been reported. Of these, seven were associated with atherosclerosis in patients more than 56 years old. This report details the case of a 39-year-old patient with a large LMA aneurysm associated with atherosclerosis. 
Evaluation of ultrasonically guided biopsies of mediastinal masses. Eighty patients with roentgenographic evidence of mediastinal abnormalities were examined with ultrasonography. Fifty-four lesions were malignant, and 26 lesions were benign. The histologic diagnoses were confirmed by ultrasonically guided fine needle aspiration/cutting needle (Tru-Cut) biopsy, surgical specimens, or transbronchial biopsy. There were no unique ultrasonographic features for diagnosis of specific tumors. Ultrasonically guided aspiration biopsies (UGAB) were performed in 44 of the malignant lesions and in 14 of the benign lesions (nine of the noncystic lesions and five of the cystic lesions). Cytologic diagnosis of malignancies was obtained in 34 (77 percent) of these 44 malignancies; however, accurate histologic classifications of malignancies were achieved in only 24 (55 percent). Accurate diagnoses were achieved in only three (33 percent) of the nine noncystic benign lesions. Ultrasonically guided cutting biopsies (UGCB) were performed in 24 malignant and five benign lesions. All attempts yielded satisfactory specimens for histologic diagnosis. Using UGAB and UGCB together, a positive diagnosis was achieved in 89 percent (39/44) of the malignancies, and accurate histologic diagnosis was achieved in 89 percent and 78 percent (7/9) in malignant and benign noncystic lesions, respectively. Correct histologic diagnosis with UGAB alone is lower in thymoma (55 percent [6/11]) and lymphoma (30 percent [3/10]) but higher in lung cancer (67 percent [8/12]) and metastatic cancer (78 percent [7/9]). There were no complications in this series. We conclude that ultrasonography with UGAB has a high diagnostic yield in diagnosing mediastinal tumors, and UGCB is necessary for thymic tumors, lymphoma, and benign lesions. 
Intrathecal phenol rhizotomy for management of pain in recurrent unresectable carcinoma of the rectum. The medical records of 11 patients with recurrent unresectable adenocarcinoma of the rectum who had intrathecal phenol block for the management of intractable pain were reviewed. There were seven patients with pelvic and four with combined pelvic and perineal recurrences. Five patients had sacral involvement by tumor. Six patients had received prior irradiation. Three patients had good, three had fair and five patients had poor results after phenol rhizotomy. Patients with good results had relief for a median of three months. The over-all survival rate after phenol injection was three months. Phenol rhizotomy is indicated for the relief of intractable pain secondary to recurrent unresectable carcinoma of the rectum in carefully selected patients. 
Etretinate and visual function: a 1-year follow-up study. Concern has been expressed in the literature that the drug etretinate may be potentially retinotoxic. Four patients are reported who have received long-term treatment with etretinate and who have undergone detailed evaluation for the development of visual dysfunction over a 1-year period. Despite prolonged treatment and high total doses no evidence of ocular toxicity attributable to the drug was found in any of the patients. 
MR imaging findings in patients with bone-chip allografts. Increasing use of MR to evaluate primary bone neoplasms has stimulated numerous articles on the initial assessment of these lesions. However, scant MR literature has been written about the postoperative MR appearance. We studied the MR appearance of lesions treated by curettage followed by packing with cancellous bone-chip allograft. We retrospectively reviewed the MR scans of 18 consecutive patients treated in this way. Pathologic diagnoses of these lesions were confirmed according to commonly accepted criteria. The allograft sites showed a distinctive pattern of speckled bright signal on T1-weighted images in eight cases. Thirteen of 18 grafts showed a whorled or speckled pattern of increased signal on the T2-weighted images. Only four allograft regions had predominantly low signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Two of 18 patients had recurrent tumor proved by open biopsy. MR images in these cases showed areas of homogeneous signal that replaced areas of speckled hyperintensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. In both these recurrences the tumor had signal intensity similar to that seen on the preoperative MR study. We conclude that knowledge of the MR appearance of cancellous bone chip allografts is important to avoid misinterpreting areas of high signal on T1- or T2-weighted images as areas of recurrence of tumor and/or hemorrhage. 
The long-term results of artificial sphincters in children. To determine the long-term efficacy of the artificial urinary sphincter, 36 consecutive children in whom a prosthesis was implanted between August 1978 and July 1985 were followed for a minimum of 5 years and re-evaluated within the last 3 months. Of the 36 sphincters 27 (75%) are currently in place; 2 of these 27 sphincters are dysfunctional due to fluid leakage. Of the 25 functioning sphincters 14 have required no further prosthetic operation, 10 needed 1 revision and 1 patient had 5 revisions. Fluid leakage, occurring in 12 patients, was the most common complication requiring reoperation. Twenty patients are completely continent (11 of whom without any medication) and 5 are occasionally damp. The over-all success rate at 2 and 5 years was 84 and 62%, respectively. The mean survival time of the prosthesis was 7.2 years and the mean standard interval was greater than 10.5 years. Patients with higher balloon pressures (81 to 100 cm. water) had more complications, and a decreased rate of success than those with lower pressure balloons (51 to 80 cm. water, p = 0.02). There was no difference in success rates between boys and girls (p = 0.98), although girls who had a prior bladder neck operation tended to have a higher rate of cuff erosion. Sphincters placed after 1980 (model AS800) had a lower reoperation rate than those placed earlier. In selected instances, the artificial urinary sphincter appears to be a viable long-term alternative for management of children with intractable incontinence who have either failed or are unsuitable for other methods of treatment. 
Resting energy expenditure in chronic cardiac failure. 1. Resting energy expenditure has previously been shown to be elevated in the acute phase of heart failure, but the situation in the compensated state of chronic cardiac failure is unclear. Resting energy expenditure was assessed in 14 patients with stable chronic cardiac failure and 14 matched control subjects by using indirect calorimetry. 2. Resting energy expenditure was significantly elevated in the patients with chronic cardiac failure (112.6 +/- 18.1 versus 87.1 +/- 12.2 kJ day-1 kg-1 total body weight, P less than 0.0002; mean +/- SD) as were resting O2 consumption (3.88 +/- 0.64 versus 3.00 +/- 0.43 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.0002), ventilation (164 +/- 40.3 versus 104 +/- 16.2 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.0001) and heart rate (85.8 +/- 16.9 versus 66.6 +/- 6.9 beats/min, P less than 0.001). Both the resting plasma concentration of noradrenaline (4.48 +/- 1.52 versus 2.28 +/- 0.96 nmol/l, P less than 0.0001) and the serum concentration of free fatty acids (0.78 +/- 0.21 versus 0.57 +/- 0.27 mmol/l, P less than 0.03) were greater in the patients with chronic cardiac failure. Analysis of covariance indicated that most of the difference in resting energy expenditure could be accounted for by the elevated ventilation in the patients with chronic cardiac failure. Arm muscle area, an index of wasting, was lower in the patients with chronic cardiac failure (39.1 +/- 13.1 versus 50.5 +/- 9.4 cm2, P less than 0.02) and resting energy expenditure was found to account for some of this difference. 3. We conclude that an elevated basal metabolism occurs in chronic cardiac failure. 
Cirrhosis of the liver. A regenerative process. The ancient story of Prometheus, chained to a rock for defying Zeus by stealing fire from Mount Olympus and subjected to daily tearing at his liver by an eagle, attests to the early recognition of the extraordinary regenerative capacity of the human liver. This process had remained an intriguing mystery over the millennia. In the last 20 years, following the pioneering work of Bucher (1) and Moolten et al (2), there has been an explosion of research that has clarified some of the mechanisms underlying the process of hepatic regeneration. Regeneration implies proliferation and regeneration. After the fetal and postnatal growth of the liver is completed, hepatocytes no longer proliferate actively, but they can proliferate in response to cell death or loss (3). Hepatocyte growth responses are of particular research interest because they occur in vivo and involve cells that are normally quiescent. Hepatic regeneration constitutes a highly regulated process that is best shown by the arrest of liver growth following a partial hepatectomy precisely at the moment the hepatic mass reaches the mass of the original intact liver (3). This suggests that hepatic regeneration after a partial hepatectomy is a strictly regulated nonautonomous growth process that is controlled by the same factors that are responsible for the determination and maintenance of hepatic mass in a normal individual. In response to a partial hepatectomy, hepatocytes enter the cell cycle and progress to DNA synthesis and replication but only in numbers sufficient to restore the hepatic mass. The regeneration response is both synchronized and universal in that it affects all intrahepatic cell lines, including nonparenchymal cells. 
Respiratory failure due to interstitial lung metastases of ovarian carcinoma reversed by chemotherapy. A woman with metastatic ovarian carcinoma developed postoperative respiratory failure due to interstitial lung metastases demonstrated by bronchoalveolar lavage. After chemotherapy, she was able to be removed from mechanical ventilation and has shown progressive resolution of her interstitial lung disease. Metastatic ovarian carcinoma can be a treatable etiology of life-threatening interstitial lung disease. 
Sclerotherapy for multiple glomangiomata. Multiple glomangiomata have always been treated by surgical resection. However, sclerotherapy can be used obliterate the majority of these tumors. 
Polycystic ovarian disease: contribution of vaginal endosonography and reassessment of ultrasonic diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the superiority of vaginal ultrasonography (US) on the abdominal US for the diagnosis of polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD). DESIGN: The US pattern of ovaries was prospectively investigated by abdominal US and, whenever possible, by vaginal US. SETTING: Primary care, institutional. PATIENTS: One hundred forty-four women in whom PCOD was suspected on endocrine grounds and 62 other patients presenting with primary hyperprolactinemia (n = 23) or hypothalamic anovulation (n = 39). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Vaginal US allowed a better analysis of the ovarian stroma. RESULTS: The external ovarian features of PCOD were observed by both routes in less than one third of the 144 patients with PCOD. The internal ovarian features of PCOD were much more frequently observed by vaginal US than by abdominal US (polycystic pattern: 66.7% versus 38.1%, P less than 0.05; increased ovarian stroma: 57.1% versus 4.8%, P less than 0.001). In the 62 patients without PCOD, US features of PCOD were observed in less than 10% of them, except for the uterine width/ovarian length ratio less than 1 and the polycystic pattern (abdominal US: 17% and 34%; vaginal US: 11% and 50%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: An increased ovarian stroma seems to be the most sensitive and specific US sign of PCOD, providing that it can be investigated by vaginal US. 
Dental chair apoplexy. We have reported two cases of intracranial bleeding shortly after a dental procedure. We argue that administration of hypochlorite in gum debridement, application of dental cement, or mechanical stimulation of the alveolar branches of the trigeminal nerve at the pulp may not only result in acute systemic hypertension, but also in the release of vasodilatory neurotransmitters. The combination of a local increase in intracerebral blood flow and simultaneously developing systemic hypertension in an occasional patient may lead to intracranial hemorrhage. 
Portal-systemic encephalopathy: presence of basal ganglia lesions with high signal intensity on MR images. Sixteen patients with cirrhosis of the liver underwent cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transarterial portography to evaluate the relationship between basal ganglia lesions and portal-systemic collateral vessels. No neuropsychiatric disturbance was observed in any of the patients at the time of the MR examination, but four patients with portal-systemic encephalopathy were included in the study. Basal ganglia lesions, characterized by increased signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images, were observed in nine of the 16 patients, including the four with portal-systemic encephalopathy. These nine patients had large portal-systemic collateral vessels that were more than 10 mm in diameter. These collateral vessels were receiving blood from the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) in all nine patients. The lesions involved the globus pallidus and portions of internal capsules in a bilateral and symmetric fashion and did not exhibit mass effect. The authors conclude that there may be a significant relationship between high-intensity basal ganglia lesions and large portal-systemic collateral vessels receiving blood from the SMV. 
A donor splice mutation and a single-base deletion produce two carboxyl-terminal variants of human serum albumin. At least 35 allelic variants of human serum albumin have been sequenced at the protein level. All except two COOH-terminal variants, Catania and Venezia, are readily explainable as single-point substitutions. The two chain-termination variants are clustered in certain locations in Italy and are found in numerous unrelated individuals. In order to correlate the protein change in these variants with the corresponding DNA mutation, the two variant albumin genes have been cloned, sequenced, and compared to normal albumin genomic DNA. In the Catania variant, a single base deletion and subsequent frameshift leads to a shortened and altered COOH terminus. Albumin Venezia is caused by a mutation that alters the first consensus nucleotide of the 5' donor splice junction of intron 14 and the 3' end of exon 14, which is shortened from 68 to 43 base pairs. This change leads to an exon skipping event resulting in direct splicing of exon 13 to exon 15. The predicted Venezia albumin product has a truncated amino acid sequence (580 residues instead of 585), and the COOH-terminal sequence is altered after Glu-571. The variant COOH terminus ends with the dibasic sequence Arg-Lys that is apparently removed through stepwise cleavage by serum carboxypeptidase B to yield several forms of circulating albumin. 
Routine histological compared with immunohistological examination of bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens in disseminated neuroblastoma. The ability to detect infiltration in bone marrow biopsy specimens from patients with disseminated neuroblastoma was assessed by immunohistological and routine histological methods. Frozen cores from 33 staging procedures were tested with UJ13A and UJ127.11. Immunopositive tumour cells were found in 10 of 17 staging procedures in which tumour was detectable by routine histological methods. Positive cells or stromal material were also found in eight of 12 staging procedures in which distorted architecture and fibrosis, but no obvious tumour, had been noted. Paraffin wax embedded cores from 29 of the same staging procedures were tested with antibodies against neurone specific enolase and neurofilament. Only a single core reacted with anti-neurofilament antibody. Neurone specific enolase positive cells or stromal material were found in nine of 15 staging procedures in which obvious tumour was detectable. Although these immunohistochemical techniques proved inferior to routine histology in their ability to detect obvious tumour, the demonstration of immunopositive stromal tissue which was not frankly malignant supports the view that distorted, fibrotic marrow may reflect persistence of neuroectodermal tissue and justifies its distinction from normal marrow when reporting the response to treatment. 
Clinical, radiographic, and histologic study of endodontic treatment failures. One hundred fifty cases of endodontic treatment failures were studied clinically, radiographically, and histologically. Fifty-seven percent of the teeth were asymptomatic. Pain alone and/or associated with swelling was present in 21% of the teeth. There was no correlation between the size of periradicular rarefaction and the occurrence or severity of clinical signs and/or symptoms. Stainable bacteria were demonstrated in 69% of the teeth and were present mostly in the canal. The severity of periradicular inflammation was related to presence of stainable bacteria in the canal. Swelling and pain or a draining sinus tract was often associated with stainable bacteria inside the canal. The development of a radicular cyst associated with an endodontically treated tooth that has failed is not necessarily the cause of endodontic treatment failure. 
The prognostic significance of postoperative residual tumor in ependymoma. Between 1970 and 1989, 29 patients with intracranial ependymomas were evaluated and treated at the Children's Hospital in Boston. With a median follow-up of 82 months, the actuarial survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 61 +/- 10% and 46 +/- 12%, respectively. Anaplastic histological findings were uncommon (2 of 29). Initial postoperative radiotherapy was given to 25 patients, with a median tumor dose of 5360 cGy. With a median time to recurrence of 22 months, local failure (within 2 cm of original enhancing mass) was the predominant pattern of relapse (15 of 16 failures). The presence of radiographic residual disease seen on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans was the most important prognostic variable for patients with intracranial ependymoma. Analysis of the 19 patients who underwent postoperative imaging revealed a 75 +/- 15% 5-year freedom from progressive disease for 9 patients with no residual disease, as compared with 0% freedom from progressive disease for the 10 patients with gross residual disease (P = 0.03). In contrast, the surgical assessment of residual disease was not significant (P = 0.4). Age at presentation was also a significant prognostic factor. The overall actuarial survival rate at 12 years for infants 24 months or younger at diagnosis was 0%, as compared with 62 +/- 13% for older patients (P = 0.03). For non-anaplastic ependymomas, complete surgical resection followed by local-field, high-dose (greater than 54 Gy) radiotherapy appears to offer the greatest chance for long-term survival. Because of the markedly reduced survival rate for patients with radiologically apparent postoperative disease, maximal surgical resection and novel therapeutic endeavors appear warranted for this high-risk group. Future protocols should use postoperative imaging, not operative reports, to stratify patients with ependymoma. 
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation of apparently stillborn infants: survival and long-term outcome. To determine the outcome of apparently stillborn infants who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, we studied the short- and long-term outcome of 93 infants who had an Apgar score of 0 at 1 minute of age and were resuscitated at birth. Sixty-two (66.6%) responded and left the delivery room alive; 26 (42%) of the 62 infants died in the neonatal period and 36 infants were discharged home; of the 36 infants, three subsequently died during infancy. Of the 33 survivors, ten were lost to follow-up after discharge. Developmental assessment of 23 of 33 long-term survivors revealed normal outcome in 14 (61.7%), abnormal results in 6 (26%), and suspect status in 3 (13%). Fifty-eight infants had an Apgar score of 0 at greater than or equal to 10 minutes of age and all except one died; the surviving infant has an abnormal developmental outcome. We conclude that 39% of apparently stillborn infants who were resuscitated survived beyond the neonatal period and that 61% of the 23 survivors who were available for developmental follow-up had normal development at the time of last examination. Survival was unlikely if there was no response after 10 minutes of resuscitation. 
Blood transfusion and oxygen consumption in surgical sepsis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of serum lactic acid values to predict flow-dependent increases in oxygen consumption (VO2) in response to increasing oxygen delivery (DO2) after blood transfusion in surgical sepsis. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care, trauma center. PATIENTS: Twenty-one patients, postsurgical or posttrauma, judged septic by defined criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Serum lactic acid concentrations, DO2, and VO2 were measured before and after transfusion therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall, the DO2 increased from 532 +/- 146 to 634 +/- 225 (SD) mL/min.m2 (p less than .001), and the VO2 increased from 145 +/- 39 to 160 +/- 56 mL/min.m2 (p = .02). These changes occurred with an Hgb increase from 9.3 +/- 1.1 to 10.7 +/- 1.5 g/dL (p less than .001). The patients were grouped by their pretransfusion serum lactic acid values. In those patients with normal (less than 1.6 mmol/dL) serum lactic acid (n = 10), DO2 increased from 560 +/- 113 to 676 +/- 178 mL/min.m2 (p less than .02), and VO2 increased from 150 +/- 25 to 183 +/- 46 mL/min.m2 (p less than .02). However, in the increased serum lactic acid group (n = 17), VO2 was not significantly changed after transfusion (143 +/- 46 to 146 +/- 58 mL/min.m2) despite increased DO2 (515 +/- 163 to 609 +/- 251 mL/min.m2, p less than .01). CONCLUSIONS: Blood transfusion can be used to augment DO2 and VO2 in septic surgical patients. Increased serum lactic acid values do not predict patients who will respond. The absence of lactic acidosis should not be used in this patient population to justify withholding blood transfusions to improve flow-dependent VO2. Patients who have increased lactate concentrations may have a peripheral oxygen utilization defect that prevents improvement in VO2 with increasing DO2. 
Prophylactic minitracheotomy in lung resections. A randomized controlled study. Thirty consecutive patients undergoing lung resections were randomized into two groups: Group A (n = 15) received minitracheotomy postoperatively and group B (n = 15) were control patients. Postoperative respiratory course was monitored by serial clinical assessments, chest x-ray examination, arterial blood gases, sputa bacterial cultures, and the patient's requirement and response to chest physiotherpy. The two groups were similarly matched in age (mean 58.5 years), smoking habits, pulmonary functions, and surgical procedures. Postoperative pulmonary complications of collapse/consolidation developed in 11 patients (two in group A and nine in group B) (p less than 0.03). Four patients (all in group B) required nimitracheotomy in addition to antibiotics and chest physiotherapy to treat their pneumonia. Chest physiotherapy requirement was less in group A than in group B, with a mean number of sessions of seven in group A and eight in group B and a mean total time of 92 minutes in group A and 112 minutes in group B. The mean duration of minitracheotomy was 4.13 days. Minor temporary symptoms resulted from the minitracheotomy in eight patients (42%) and included discomfort, voice changes, subcutaneous emphysema, and stridor. There was one case of long-term morbidity (5%)-skin scarring from wound infection at the site of the minitracheotomy. No postoperative deaths resulted. We conclude that the prophylactic use of minitracheotomy is safe and effective in decreasing postoperative respiratory complications in patients undergoing lung resections. 
Prevalence of chronic migraine headaches--United States, 1980-1989. Migraine headaches, which are characterized by painful, disabling, and recurring symptoms, have no known cause, treatment, or cure. Quality population-based data are needed to improve epidemiologic understanding of chronic migraine headaches. This report uses data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to describe the prevalence of recent trends in the occurrence of chronic migraine headaches in the United States from 1980 through 1989. 
Regulation of cerebral blood vessels by humoral and endothelium-dependent mechanisms. Update on humoral regulation of vascular tone. Recent studies suggest that humoral and endothelium-dependent mechanisms may play an important role in the cerebral circulation. Angiotensin may acutely and chronically increase resistance of large cerebral arteries and reduce cerebral microvascular pressure without changing cerebral blood flow. We hypothesize that the brain may sense reductions in microvascular pressure and initiate compensatory neurohumoral responses to raise arterial pressure. Vasopressin appears to play an important role in regulation of production of cerebrospinal fluid and brain fluid volume. Vasopressin also may be protective when intracranial pressure is elevated. Endothelium-dependent mechanisms also may have important influences on tone of cerebral vessels. Synthesis of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide, or a nitric oxide-containing compound, appears to influence both basal tone and responses of large cerebral arteries to acetylcholine in vivo. Large cerebral arteries dilate in response to increased blood flow in vivo, and this response may be mediated in part by release of a humoral factor by endothelium. Endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles to receptor- and nonreceptor-mediated agonists are impaired during chronic hypertension. The mechanism of impairment of endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles appears to involve production of an endothelium-derived contracting factor. 
Hyperinsulinemia, sex, and risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease BACKGROUND. The possibility that hyperinsulinemia may be involved in the etiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) was first suggested 20 years ago. During the last decade, this possibility has received support from three large prospective studies. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the present study, the association between CVD, glucose intolerance, obesity, and hypertension (the GOH conditions) and hyperinsulinemia was examined cross-sectionally in a representative sample (n = 1,263) of the adult Jewish population aged 40-70 years in Israel. Previously known diabetics were excluded. CVD comprising clinical or ECG evidence of ischemic heart disease, as well as clinical evidence of cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease, was identified in 97 men and 39 women. A significant (p less than 0.01) hyperinsulinemia-sex interaction was found for CVD rate, with the adjusted risk ratios (followed by 95% confidence limits), relative to the rate in 298 normoinsulinemic women, being 1.15 (0.68-1.95) in 328 normoinsulinemic men, 0.85 (0.48-1.49) in 277 hyperinsulinemic women, and 2.27 (1.33-3.08) in 360 hyperinsulinemic men. Age-adjusted CVD rates in men versus women were: a) similar and low among all normoinsulinemic normotensives and hyperinsulinemics free of any of the GOH conditions (all rates less than or equal to 6.5%); b) similar and high among normoinsulinemic hypertensives (13.4% versus 10.4%); c) significantly higher in men among hyperinsulinemic normotensives with glucose intolerance and/or obesity (15.2% versus 3.3%; p = 0.02) and all hyperinsulinemic hypertensives (21.5% versus 12.8%; p = 0.04). These trends remained significant after adjusting for age, ethnic group, and blood lipids. CONCLUSIONS. Therefore, hyperinsulinemia was associated with excess CVD risk in men but not in women, and all excess CVD risk in men was confined to hyperinsulinemic individuals in the presence of glucose intolerance, obesity, or hypertension. 
Increased treatment of hypertension does not explain the decline in stroke mortality in the United States, 1970-1980. The steady decline in mortality from stroke in the United States accelerated markedly in the 1970s. It has been widely assumed that an increase in the rate of treatment of hypertension is the most likely explanation for this major public health achievement. An analysis of available information, however, suggests that improvements in the community control of hypertension in the United States in the period 1970-1980 have contributed in only a minor way. There were 45,357 fewer deaths from stroke in 1980 among those aged 35-74 years than might have been expected if the death rates had stayed the same as in 1970. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Surveys indicate that six million more people received antihypertensive medication in 1980 than in 1970. Results from a pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials of the treatment of hypertension suggest that between 6% and 16% of the reduction in stroke mortality was due to the increased treatment of hypertension. Epidemiological observations indicate that between 16% and 25% of the overall decline in stroke mortality can be attributed to the treatment of hypertension, suggesting that clinical trials probably underestimate the community-wide benefits of treatment. These results also suggest that at least three quarters of the decline in stroke mortality in the United States in the period 1970-1980 is due to factors other than antihypertensive treatment. 
Radial artery hypoplasia: a further association with the VATER syndrome? A case of radial artery hypoplasia in a girl with the VATER syndrome is reported. This finding should alert surgeons dealing with vascular access for dialysis and suggests the possibility of intrauterine ischemia in the etiology of upper limb anomalies in these patients. 
Donor limb vascular events following femoro-femoral bypass surgery. A Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study. Three hundred seventeen patients who had femorofemoral bypass surgery were examined for postoperative vascular changes that developed in the donor limb. "Unmasked" claudication developed in 7%, new claudication related to a "steal" developed in 3.5%, progression of preoperative claudication developed in 1%, new rest pain developed in 1.7%, and new necrosis developed in 0.7% of patients. Postoperatively, the donor limb ankle-brachial index decreased 0.30 or greater in 3% of the patients, decreased 0.15 to 0.29 in 6%, and decreased 0.10 to 0.14 in 6% of the patients. Only eight patients (3%) had a clinical and hemodynamic steal. Late vascular procedures for donor iliac stenosis were few, resulting in an iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 3% and inflow bypasses in 3%. Angiographic patterns of donor and recipient limbs were not predictive of "clinical" or "hemodynamic" steal events. Most new donor limb symptoms of claudication were an unmasking of arterial insufficiency previously present in the donor limb that became apparent when the recipient limb was improved. 
Possible roles of basic fibroblast growth factor in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease: an immunohistochemical study. Prominent features of moyamoya disease are fibrocellular thickening of the intima and enhanced angiogenesis. The pathogenesis of moyamoya disease is, however, unknown. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is an angiogenic factor as well as a potent mitogen for a number of cell types including vascular endothelial and smooth-muscle cells. In order to test the possibility that basic FGF takes part in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease, the authors tested for the presence of this factor using a mouse monoclonal antibody against human recombinant basic FGF. The surgical specimens studied included two sections of the superficial temporal artery (STA) and four samples of dura mater from four patients with moyamoya disease. Surgical specimens were obtained from three patients with other diseases as control tissue. Sections of the STA obtained from the patients with moyamoya disease showed strong basic FGF immunoreactivity in endothelial and smooth-muscle cells, while control sections had only faint and scattered immunoreactivity. All sections of the dura mater obtained from the patients with moyamoya disease also revealed more intense immunohistochemical staining of basic FGF in meningeal and vascular cells than did control sections. These observations indicate that the amount of basic FGF is increased in the tissues of patients with moyamoya disease; thus, basic FGF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease. 
Experimental non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy in the rat: similarities to inflammatory bowel disease and effect of thromboxane synthetase inhibitors. We have validated an established animal model of acute inflammatory bowel disease in indomethacin-treated rats. Studies in both in vitro and in vivo 51chromium-labelled ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (51Cr-EDTA) permeability and tissue myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of inflammatory cell invasion, showed increased permeability and enzyme levels, respectively, in treated animals compared to controls (in vitro 51Cr-EDTA permeability: (mean (SE] control 0.10 (0.02) microliter/mg per tissue, experimental 0.17 (0.02) (p less than 0.01, 2 way analysis of variance); in vivo 51Cr-EDTA permeability: control 3.9 (1.3) (% dose recovered), experimental 12.1 (1.5) (p less than 0.01); tissue myeloperoxidase: control 10.8 (0.4) mU/mg, experimental 17.2 (0.5) p less than 0.01). Pretreatment or simultaneous treatment of indomethacin-treated animals with glucocorticoids, sulphasalazine, or tetracycline reduced the permeability changes and the tissue inflammatory response (in vitro 51Cr-EDTA permeability: (mean (SE] sulphasalazine + indomethacin 0.11 (0.2) microliter/mg tissue (p less than 0.01), prednisolone +/- indomethacin 0.12 (0.02) (p less than 0.01), tetracycline + indomethacin 0.12 (0.02) (p less than 0.01]. Glucocorticoids and sulphasalazine, but not tetracycline, administered after the indomethacin also partially corrected the permeability and inflammatory changes induced by indomethacin (in vitro 51Cr-EDTA permeability: sulphasalazine 0.15 (0.02) microliter/mg, p less than 0.02; prednisolone 0.12 (0.02) microliter/mg, p less than 0.01). This approach was used to investigate the effects of two different thromboxane synthetase inhibitors in indomethacin-treated animals. Simultaneous treatment with thromboxane synthetase inhibitors and indomethacin prevented the 51Cr-EDTA permeability and tissue myeloperoxidase increases induced by indomethacin alone (in vitro 51Cr-EDTA permeability: thromboxane synthetase inhibitors + indomethacin 0.11 (0.01) microliter/mg (p0.01); tissue myeloperoxidase: 11 (0.4) mU/mg, (p less than 0.01). 
Risk factors for bilateral testicular germ cell tumors. Does heredity play a role? Twenty-three bilateral testicular germ cell tumors (four synchronous and 19 sequential tumors) were investigated for potential risk factors. The incidence of maldescensus testis was not found to be higher than in patients with unilateral disease. The histologic findings of the first tumor did not have any effect on the incidence of the second tumor. In 21 patients (four synchronous and 17 sequential tumors), histocompatibility antigens (HLA) were determined; HLA-B14 was increased significantly in the sequential tumor group. Tendencies toward an increase of HLA-DR5 and HLA-DR7 also were found. The HLA-DR1, HLA-DR3, and HLA-DR4 showed a tendency toward a decreased frequency. Therefore genetic factors might be important in the development of sequential bilateral testicular cancers. 
Expression of platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor and their correlation with cellular morphology in glial tumors. This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of two sets of growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), in the induction and maintenance of glial tumors and their phenotypic expression. Explants from eight malignant tumors, five benign tumors, and two nontumor glial cells were analyzed for levels of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of PDGFA, PDGFB, TGF-beta 1, and TGF-beta 2. Results were normalized to the mRNA expression of tubulin, a "housekeeping" gene present in glial cells. Of the 15 explants tested, PDGFB was seen in six, all of which were malignant tumors; PDGFA was seen in all 15 with much higher levels expressed in malignant tumors; and TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 were seen in all 15 without a clear difference between cell types, although expression tended to be higher in malignant tumors. This project supports the theory that the induction and maintenance of glial tumors is likely to be a multifactorial phenomenon. 
The risk of ligation of the left renal vein in resection of the abdominal aortic aneurysm. The left renal vein can be ligated during aortic operation to attain better access to the perirenal aorta. This maneuver has been considered safe, with a low incidence of postoperative renal complications. This study was done to evaluate the risk of left renal vein ligation and its influence on renal function in patients with elective resection of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The records of 332 patients undergoing elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms during a five year period were reviewed. The clinical and operative data of patients who had left renal vein ligation and those who did not were similar. Left renal vein ligation was not associated with an increased mortality rate but was strongly associated with an increase in serum creatinine level and a clinical diagnosis of postoperative azotemia. Nine of 13 patients who had left renal vein ligation had postoperative azotemia compared with 21 of 319 patients without left renal vein ligation (p less than 0.001). The mean change of preoperative and postoperative creatinine value was an increase of 1.92 milligrams per deciliter in patients with left renal vein ligation in contrast with 0.26 milligram per deciliter in patients without ligation (p less than 0.00075). Thus, ligation of the left renal vein increases the risk of postoperative renal complications and its use should be selective. 
Choriocarcinoma of the septum pellucidum: case report. A case of choriocarcinoma of the septum pellucidum is presented. The patient, a 6-year-old boy, demonstrated high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin in his urine, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid, and precocious puberty. The physical conditions and laboratory data returned to normal after surgical removal of the tumor, whole brain irradiation, and chemotherapy. Currently, there is no evidence of recurrence at 5 months after surgery. 
The combined antiischemic effects of the thromboxane receptor antagonist SQ 30,741 and tissue-type plasminogen activator. The thromboxane-receptor antagonist, SQ 30,741, may be used as adjuvant therapy for thrombolysis and has also been shown to have antiischemic activity that is independent of its thrombolytic activity. Since tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and SQ 30,741 may be administered simultaneously, we determined whether the antiischemic effects of SQ 30,741 can be potentiated by t-PA. This was accomplished by combining doses of t-PA and SQ 30,741, which alone were not cardioprotective. Anesthetized dogs were subjected to left circumflex coronary artery occlusion for 90 minutes and reperfusion for 5 hours. The dogs were treated during reperfusion with a dose of t-PA that caused approximately a 30% reduction in plasma fibrinogen alone or in combination with 1.5 mg/kg + 0.4 mg/kg/hr SQ 30,741, which started 10 minutes after initiation of ischemia. At these doses, neither t-PA nor SQ 30,741 alone significantly reduced infarct size (57% +/- 6%, 50% +/- 10%, 57% +/- 6% of the left ventricular area at risk for vehicle controls, t-PA, and SQ 30,741 respectively); however, combination treatment resulted in a significant reduction in infarct size (37% +/- 5% of the left ventricular area at risk). Higher doses of t-PA and SQ 30,741 alone significantly reduced infarct size. The protective effects of t-PA and SQ 30,741 occurred without altering peripheral hemodynamic status. No differences in collateral or reperfusion blood flow were observed between groups. Thus although SQ 30,741 may act to improve the efficacy of thrombolysis, t-PA may in turn enhance the antiischemic activity of SQ 30,741 or at least reduce the threshold dose. 
Measurement of tissue oxygen tension: comparison between two subcutaneous oxygen tonometers. We compared the 95% response time (95% RT) of two tissue oxygen tonometers under two sets of circumstances. We first evaluated the devices during normoxia, hyperoxia, and anoxia in vitro, using a transcutaneous PO2 electrode (PtcO2) as the reference. The responses to normoxia and to different grades of hyperoxia were examined in vivo in 8 healthy volunteers to assess the relationship between changes in subcutaneous PO2 and PtcO2, an estimate of arterial PO2 (PaO2). One subcutaneous method (ScA) used a technique based on a polarographic needle electrode in situ connected to an ammeter; the second method (ScB) was based on a blood gas analyzer system first described by Hunt (Lancet 164;2:1370). ScA and PtcO2 both responded to stepwise changes in ambient oxygen concentration (21-100%) in vitro within 10 seconds; the 95% RT of ScA was 1.39 +/- 0.5 to 2.39 +/- 0.8 minutes and that of PtcO2 was 0.32 +/- 0.1 to 0.49 +/- 0.1 minutes. ScB had a lag of 3 minutes, and the 95% RT was 6.75 +/- 0.5 to 8.2 +/- 0.8 minutes. In contrast to the results in vitro, the response of ScA to changes in FiO2 in vivo was delayed compared with the rapid response of PtcO2, reflecting the physiologic delay of tissue PO2 in response to increased PaO2. The time lag and the long 95% RT of ScB were even more evident in vivo. ScA reacted three to four times faster than ScB, both in vitro and in vivo, to changes in the oxygen environment. The in vitro 95% RT of ScA to changes in ambient oxygen varied from 2 to 3.5 minutes. 
Effects of acute insulin-induced hypoglycaemia on haemostasis, fibrinolysis and haemorheology in insulin-dependent diabetic patients and control subjects. 1. The effects of acute hypoglycaemia on haemostasis, fibrinolysis, blood viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation were examined after acute insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in six normal male subjects and in six male patients with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes. In the control subjects hypoglycaemia caused a significant increase in the concentration of von Willebrand factor, with no change in the concentrations of fibrinogen and cross-linked fibrin degradation products. Fibrinolysis was enhanced, as indicated by significant increases in tissue plasminogen activator concentration and the fibrin plate lysis area, with a fall in plasminogen-activator inhibitor activity, suggesting complex formation. Whole-blood and plasma viscosity increased significantly after hypoglycaemia, but there was no significant change in erythrocyte aggregation tendency. 2. In diabetic patients the increase in the concentration of von Willebrand factor was significantly greater than in the control group (analysis of variance, P less than 0.02). The basal concentration of tissue plasminogen activator was reduced at 3.7 +/- 0.7 mg/l (mean +/- SEM) in the diabetic group compared with 8.5 +/- 1.3 mg/l in the control group (Student's t-test, P less than 0.01), but thereafter the increase in response to hypoglycaemia was similar. The changes in the other variables were not significantly different from the changes in the control group. 3. During acute hypoglycaemia in poorly controlled diabetic patients there is promotion of haemostasis with a greater increase in the concentration of von Willebrand factor, which, in association with the increase in viscosity, might reduce perfusion in diabetic microangiopathy, leading to aggravation of the microvascular complications of diabetes. 
The effects of neurokinin A, neurokinin B, and eledoisin on substance P analysis. Commercial sources for neuropeptide radioimmunoassays have made this sensitive tool available to clinical investigators for monitoring the potential involvement of neuropeptides in pain modulation. We measured substance P-like immunoreactivity in the plasma, saliva, and pericardial fluid of subjects with and without pain (chronic and acute) to determine if substance P levels are altered. Some recent studies have suggested that substance P in various body fluids may be a correlate of chronic pain. To test this correlation it is important to ensure that the assay is measuring what it was designed to measure. Therefore, the influence of three tachykinins on the analysis of substance P concentrations was assessed with a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit. A small (approximately 2 to 6%), apparently nonspecific elevation in measured substance P was found when alpha-neurokinin, beta-neurokinin, or eledoisin was incubated with substance P and its antibody. Our results also indicate an apparent specific affinity of the substance P antibody for alpha-neurokinin (above 1,000 pg/ml) and beta-neurokinin (above 5,000 pg/ml). Substance P levels in the body fluids we tested ranged from 0.47 to 62.88 pg/mg protein (47.4 to 230.8 pg/ml). Levels of the tested tachykinins have not been determined in body fluids. If alpha-neurokinin or beta-neurokinin is found to be present in high concentrations in these fluids, this commercially available substance P kit may overestimate substance P levels. The concentrations of tachykinins necessary to interfere specifically with the assay are 10- to 100-fold higher than substance P in body fluids. 
Role of external bacterial flora in the pathogenesis of acute postoperative endophthalmitis. The source of infecting bacteria is often unknown in postoperative endophthalmitis. Using techniques of molecular epidemiology, the authors demonstrate that an organism isolated from the vitreous was genetically indistinguishable from an isolate recovered from the patient's eyelid, conjunctiva, or nose in 14 (82%) of 17 cases of endophthalmitis. In two cases of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis, after cataract surgery was performed by the same surgeon on the same day, genetic analysis demonstrated that the infecting organisms from the two patients' vitreous were distinct, and, furthermore, that in each case the external isolates were indistinguishable from the vitreous isolate. The results implicate the patients' external tissues as the source of the infecting organism in those cases of acute postoperative endophthalmitis studied. Therefore, attention should be directed toward the external tissues and their microbial flora in the prophylaxis and prevention of postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis. 
Angiographic assessment of the infarct-related residual coronary stenosis after spontaneous or therapeutic thrombolysis The severity of the infarct-related residual coronary stenosis after spontaneous or therapeutic thrombolysis was quantitatively assessed in 91 patients with an acute myocardial infarction who were allocated to treatment in the acute stage with either a thrombolytic agent (100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator given over 3 h, 49 patients) or a placebo (42 patients). Heparin and aspirin were given to both groups until angiography was performed. Digital subtracted images of the infarct-related coronary vessel were obtained 10 to 14 days after hospital admission and were subsequently analyzed with the use of a computer-assisted coronary stenosis measurement system. Neither treatment group differed significantly in age, gender or location of the culprit coronary lesion. Median values (90% range) in the thrombolysis and control groups were, respectively, 1.95 (0.9 to 5.3) mm versus 1.7 (0.9 to 3.4) mm for stenosis length; 1.4 (0.8 to 2.7) mm versus 1.4 (0.9 to 1.8) mm for minimal luminal diameter; 57% (36% to 75%) versus 58% (44% to 71%) for diameter obstruction; 82% (59% to 95%) versus 82% (68% to 92%) for geometric area obstruction; and 78% (58% to 91%) versus 79% (66% to 90%) for densitometric area obstruction. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant for any of these measurements. Thus, in this study no significant differences in anatomy or severity of residual coronary stenosis could be demonstrated at 10 to 14 days after an acute myocardial infarction in patients with a recanalized infarct-related vessel, whether or not thrombolytic therapy was given on admission. These results indicate that with effective antithrombotic treatment, gradual endogenous fibrinolysis or more rapid lysis induced by the infusion of a thrombolytic agent results in a similar infarct-related coronary lesion at the time of hospital discharge. 
A comparative study of the cerebrovascular complications of cocaine: alkaloidal versus hydrochloride--a review. Cocaine, especially in its alkaloidal or "crack" form, has been increasingly associated with cerebrovascular disease. Before the crack epidemic, cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) was also implicated as a cause of stroke. However, less is known about the differences in stroke subtypes, age at stroke onset, or presence of underlying structural cerebrovascular disease with different forms of cocaine use. We compared 26 patients (previously reported) from our four institutions plus 16 cases reported in the literature of stroke associated with alkaloidal cocaine to 63 (57 reported in the literature and six not previously reported from our four institutions) cases of stroke associated with cocaine HCl. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes are equally likely after alkaloidal cocaine use, whereas cocaine HCl is more likely (approximately 80% of the time) to cause hemorrhagic stroke, with approximately half the intracranial hemorrhages occurring from ruptured cerebral saccular aneurysms or vascular malformations. The presence of an underlying cerebral aneurysm was more common among patients with cocaine HCl-associated strokes than alkaloidal cocaine-associated strokes. Cerebral infarction was significantly more common among the alkaloidal cocaine users than in all the cocaine HCl users, and this was also true when alkaloidal cocaine users were compared with parenteral cocaine HCl (intravenous and intramuscular) users. Only hemorrhagic stroke has been reported with intravenous cocaine HCl use. We conclude that the pathogenesis of cocaine-related stroke is heterogeneous, and depends, in part, on the form of cocaine used. 
Monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor/interleukin-8 is a potential mediator of crystal-induced inflammation. The physical interaction of particulates with resident mononuclear phagocytes is a consistent feature in certain forms of crystal-induced inflammation. In this study, we observed that monosodium urate crystals stimulated the rapid release of neutrophil chemotactic activity from monocytes, and that this activity steadily increased over 24 hours. Because the release of monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic activity was markedly diminished by pretreatment of the monocytes with cycloheximide, and was completely removed from conditioned media by adsorption to heparin-agarose, we addressed the possibility that monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor/interleukin-8 (IL-8), a heparin-binding neutrophil-activating polypeptide, might modulate these activities. Urate crystal-induced IL-8 secretion from monocytes was verified by radioimmunoassay. In addition, an IL-8-specific antibody markedly inhibited the neutrophil-activating capacity of the conditioned media from monocytes activated by urate crystals, as well as by inflammatory silica crystals. Last, IL-8 was significantly increased in gouty synovial fluids (range 3.0-16.8 ng/ml, mean 8.4 ng/ml, n = 6) relative to osteoarthritic synovial fluids (range 1.1-1.7 ng/ml, mean 1.5 ng/ml, n = 6) (P = 0.006). We conclude that microcrystal-induced secretion of IL-8 by mononuclear phagocytes may mediate a number of forms of crystal-induced inflammation. 
Massive thyroid oncocytoma. A patient with a massive thyroid oncocytoma is presented. The symptoms of hoarseness and dysphagia were due to compression and were relieved by surgical excision of the tumour. 
Inhibition by sodium-potassium citrate (CG-120) of calcium oxalate crystal growth on to kidney stone fragments obtained from extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Retention of fragments within the kidney after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) continues to be a major shortcoming of this form of stone treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of sodium-potassium citrate to inhibit calcium oxalate crystal nucleation and growth on to stone fragments remaining after ESWL. The continuous flow crystallisation technique was adapted to induce calcium oxalate crystal nucleation and growth on to the surface of fragmented kidney stones and the inhibitory effect of sodium-potassium citrate was assessed by scanning electron microscopy and by determining the relative increase in crystalline mass at final concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 mmol/l. Sodium-potassium citrate significantly inhibited the deposition of new crystalline calcium oxalate in a dose-dependent manner above 2 mmol/l; these findings were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. It was concluded that sodium-potassium citrate may provide an effective means of preventing the formation of new kidney stones by the deposition of calcium oxalate on to residual stone fragments resulting from ESWL and that the technique used is an efficient means of testing the efficacy of therapeutic agents to prevent stone recurrence in patients treated with ESWL. 
Interleukin-6 antisense oligonucleotides inhibit the growth of human myeloma cell lines. IL-6 has been shown to be a plasmacytoma growth factor in mice and is believed to play a key role in the development of human multiple myeloma. We investigated the IL-6 requirements for the growth of two human myeloma cell lines, U 266 and RPMI 8226. These cell lines secreted minute amounts of IL-6 (20 U/ml) and featured IL-6 mRNA. IL-6 receptors were detectable at the surface of malignant cells by immunofluorescence. Antibodies to IL-6 did not alter the proliferation of these myeloma cells. There was a dose-dependent decrease, however, in [3H]-thymidine uptake in the presence of IL-6 antisense (and not sense) oligodeoxynucleotides; in the presence of 20 microM IL-6 antisense, an 80 and 95% inhibition of the proliferation of U 266 and RPMI 8226 cells was observed, respectively. These results provide strong evidence for an IL-6 autocrine proliferation of myeloma cells which may occur via internal interaction between IL-6 and the IL-6 receptor. 
Protection from rotavirus reinfection: 2-year prospective study. To measure protection induced by natural rotavirus infection, 163 infants enrolled in a rotavirus vaccine trial were prospectively followed for 2 years. Serotype 1 rotaviruses were the predominant circulating strains during the study. Over the 2 years of observation, significantly fewer infants infected before enrollment developed a symptomatic reinfection (0 of 21) or any reinfection (4 of 21) compared with previously uninfected infants (P = .0003). Of the 60 infants who developed a primary rotavirus infection in the first year (40 symptomatic, 20 asymptomatic) only 4 were reinfected in the second year compared with 29 of 82 subjects not previously infected (P = .00003). Asymptomatic primary infection appeared to be as protective as symptomatic primary infection. The only symptomatic reinfections occurred in 2 subjects who did not develop rotavirus antibody after the initial detection of rotavirus. An age-related reduction in the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic primary rotavirus infection was also detected. In this study, protection against homotypic serotype 1 reinfection appeared to last greater than or equal to 2 years. 
Spectral turbulence analysis of the signal-averaged electrocardiogram and its predictive accuracy for inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. This study was designed to assess the accuracy of a new noninvasive frequency analysis method for predicting patients with inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) at electrophysiologic study and hence the risk of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms from 3 orthogonal bipolar surface leads were evaluated using a microcomputer-based frequency analysis system that performs analysis of conventional time-domain late potentials as well as incorporating a new technique for spectral analysis of relatively short, overlapping signal segments spanning the whole QRS complex. The spectral analysis technique measured abnormalities anywhere in the entire QRS complex and did so without dependence on any arbitrarily defined frequency, duration or amplitude cutoffs. The hallmark of arrhythmogenic abnormality was hypothesized to be frequent and abrupt changes in the frequency signature of the QRS wave front velocity as it propagates throughout the ventricle around areas of abnormal conduction, resulting in a high degree of spectral turbulence. One-hundred forty-two subjects were studied, including 71 totally normal control subjects ("true negatives"), 33 with both late potentials by time-domain analysis and inducible sustained monomorphic VT ("true positives"), 28 with late potentials but no evidence of spontaneous or inducible sustained monomorphic VT ("false positives") and 10 with inducible sustained monomorphic VT but absence of time-domain late potentials ("false negatives"). The frequency analysis technique correctly classified 100% of the true negatives, 97% of the true positives, 86% of the late potentials false positives and 60% of the late potentials false negatives. The total predictive accuracy of frequency analysis for all groups was 94%, compared with 73% for time-domain late potential analysis. The results suggest that a high degree of spectral turbulence of the overall QRS signal during sinus rhythm may provide a more accurate marker for the anatomic-electrophysiologic substrate of reentrant tachyarrhythmias than detection of late potentials in the terminal QRS region by either time- or frequency-domain analysis. Spectral turbulence analysis is applicable to patients irrespective of the QRS duration and the presence or absence of bundle branch block. 
Changes in hypertension treatment and in congestive heart failure mortality in the United States. The use of antihypertensive agents has increased in recent years and has been more marked among individuals in older age groups (65-74 years) than in middle-aged groups (45-54 years). Because hypertension is a strong risk factor for the development of congestive heart failure, more common use of antihypertensive agents would be expected to reduce the incidence of congestive heart failure. Examination of the national death statistics reveals decreases in congestive heart failure mortality at younger ages with mortality increases at older ages. The reasons for these divergent trends in congestive heart failure mortality in different ages and the apparent inconsistency with respect to the changes in the use of antihypertensive drugs are explored. We speculate that antihypertensive treatment does not completely prevent congestive heart failure but merely postpones its development by several decades. 
Unresectable pancreatic cancer: what is the optimal procedure? We retrospectively reviewed cases of pancreatic cancer to determine the benefit of various methods of biliary decompression and the role of prophylactic gastroenterostomy (GE) in management. Twenty-seven patients had only biliary bypass, and 26 had biliary bypass and GE. Operative mortality was similar for both groups (22% and 19%, respectively). The complication rates were almost identical (37% and 35%). Differences in operative mortality, incidence of cholangitis, and recurrence of jaundice were not statistically significant between patients having biliary decompression via the common bile duct or the gallbladder. Operative mortality associated with choledochoenterostomy was 33% versus 17% for cholecystoenterostomy. Gastric outlet obstruction developed in 5% of patients who did not have GE. We conclude that cholecystojejunostomy is an effective method of biliary bypass. Because its addition did not seem to increase operative morbidity or mortality, we advocate GE at the initial exploration to prevent gastric outlet obstruction. 
The desmoid tumor: "benign" neoplasm, not a benign disease. The desmoid tumor is a rare neoplasm which, because of its histopathologic appearance, has been traditionally considered to be benign. Despite its benign microscopic features, it has an aggressive local behavior and, if not excised adequately, has a tendency to recur locally and invade neighboring structures with significant potential for morbidity, deformity, or even death. Two cases of recurrent extraabdominal desmoid tumors are presented not only because they are highly representative of this disease, but also because they emphasize the need for aggressive surgical treatment. Also, they are unusual and challenging cases from a reconstructive standpoint. Based on this experience and on the most recent literature, we believe that this tumor, regardless of its microscopic features, should be addressed and treated as a malignancy. 
Late recurrent Candida endocarditis. Late recurrent Candida endocarditis (LRCE) developed on a prosthetic mitral valve 22 months after treatment for primary native mitral valve endocarditis. The LRCE was difficult to diagnose; results of two dimensional echocardiography and repeated blood cultures were negative. Only transesophageal echocardiography revealed a vegetation and only lysis centrifugation blood cultures demonstrated candidemia. Postmortem examination revealed a large Candida vegetation on the prosthetic valve and Candida in the mitral valve ring. This case and a review of the literature indicate that Candida endocarditis treated with amphotericin B and prosthetic valve replacement may recur months after treatment, and that LRCE, which is difficult to diagnose and treat, may be best prevented by lifelong antifungal suppressive therapy. 
Differential effects of intrathecal midazolam on morphine-induced antinociception in the rat: role of spinal opioid receptors. The antinociceptive effects of an intrathecally administered benzodiazepine agonist midazolam, alone and in combination with morphine, were examined in the rat by using the tail-flick test. The duration of antinociceptive effect produced by midazolam was significantly less (P less than 0.05) than that produced by morphine. Low doses of midazolam (10 micrograms) and morphine (10 micrograms) produced a synergistic effect in prolonging antinociceptive effect. However, at higher doses (20 or 30 micrograms), these drugs reduced the extent of antinociception produced by each other. Naloxone administration prevented antinociception produced by these drugs, indicating interactions between midazolam and opioid receptors. Midazolam had dual effects on the binding of opioid ligands to the spinal opioid receptors. At low dose, it potentiated the displacement of [3H]naloxone by morphine. At higher doses, midazolam inhibited the binding of opioid ligands to their spinal receptors in the following order: kappa greater than delta greater than mu. These results indicate that differential antinociceptive effects of midazolam on morphine-induced antinociception involve interaction of this benzodiazepine with spinal opioid receptors. 
Neuroendocrine activity in untreated heart failure. Neuroendocrine activity was studied in 60 consecutive untreated patients with dyspnoea and a clinical suspicion of heart failure. On the basis of the so-called Boston clinical criteria the diagnosis of heart failure was regarded as unlikely in 26 patients, possible in 15 patients, and definite in 19 patients. These groups were studied before any drug treatment was started and were compared with a control group of 69 healthy individuals. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration was clearly raised in patients with definite heart failure and slightly raised in patients with possible heart failure. Plasma adrenaline concentration was somewhat raised in patients with definite or possible heart failure, whereas plasma noradrenaline concentration was raised only in patients with definite heart failure. Plasma renin activity was not increased in any of the patient groups and plasma aldosterone concentration was slightly increased only in patients with definite heart failure. In the total patient series there were significant correlations between plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration and markers of the severity of left ventricular dysfunction. There was some evidence of neuroendocrine activation in untreated heart failure: plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide and catecholamines were increased but the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system showed little or no activation. 
Intelligence at six years in relation to neonatal bilirubin levels: follow-up of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Clinical Trial of Phototherapy. Results of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Randomized Controlled Trial of Phototherapy were examined for the relationship of neonatal bilirubin level to neurological and developmental outcome at 6-year follow-up. This analysis focused on 224 control children with birth weight of less than 2000 g. Bilirubin levels were maintained below previously specified levels by the use of exchange transfusion only (24%). Rates of cerebral palsy were not significantly higher for children with elevated maximum bilirubin level than for those whose level remained low. No association was evident between maximum bilirubin level and IQ (Full Scale, Verbal, or Performance) by simple correlation analysis (r = -.087, P = .2 for Full Scale) or by multiple linear regression adjusting for factors that covary with IQ (beta = -.15, P = .58). IQ was not associated with mean bilirubin level, time and duration of exposure to bilirubin, or measures of bilirubin-albumin binding. Thus, over the range of bilirubin levels permitted in this clinical trial, there was no evidence of bilirubin toxicity to the central nervous system. Measures used to control the level of bilirubin in low birth weight neonates appear to prevent effectively the risk of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity. 
Chemotherapy for invasive thymoma. A 13-year experience. From 1977 to 1990, 37 patients with Stage III or IV invasive thymoma (20 men and 17 women; median age, 40 years of age) were referred for chemotherapy to the Padova Medical Oncology Department. All patients initially received the same regimen (50 mg/m2 of cisplatin and 40 mg/m2 of doxorubicin intravenously (IV) on day 1, 0.6 mg/m2 of vincristine IV on day 3, and 700 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide IV on day 4 [ADOC]), recycling at monthly intervals. No life-threatening side effects were noted. The overall clinical response rate (complete response plus partial response) was 91.8%, with 43% complete remissions. Median duration of response and survival were 12 months (range, 2 to 96+ months) and 15 months (range, 5 to 96+ months), respectively. Seven of the 16 complete remissions were pathologically confirmed at subsequent thoracotomy. Other chemotherapy combinations and radiation therapy have been applied as second-line treatment, achieving only minimal responses. In the opinion of the authors, such chemotherapy deserves evaluation for adjuvant and neo-adjuvant treatment of invasive (and/or inoperable) thymoma due to the high complete response rate and overall response rate. 
Comparison of usefulness of high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography and exercise electrocardiography for detection of asymptomatic restenosis after coronary angioplasty. The present study compares the relative usefulness of the maximal treadmill exercise electrocardiography test with the high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography test (echocardiographic monitoring during dipyridamole infusion up to 0.84 mg/kg in 10 minutes) in detecting severe restenosis or coronary artery disease progression (greater than 70% stenosis) in asymptomatic patients 12 months after a primary successful coronary angioplasty. Criteria of positivity were: for the exercise electrocardiography test, an ST-segment shift greater than or equal to 0.1 mV from baseline, 0.08 second from the J point; for the dipyridamole echocardiography test, a transient dyssynergy of contraction, absent or of a lesser degree than that in the baseline examination. The exercise electrocardiography and dipyridamole echocardiography tests revealed a similar feasibility (91 vs 87%, difference not significant). Both tests could be performed in 75 patients. For detection of restenosis or disease progression, or both, the exercise electrocardiography test revealed a sensitivity similar to the dipyridamole echocardiography test (71 vs 71%, difference not significant), but a lower specificity (61 vs 90%). It is concluded that the high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography test is equally feasible but more accurate than the exercise electrocardiography test for noninvasive detection of severe asymptomatic restenosis or disease progression at 1 year after successful coronary angioplasty.
