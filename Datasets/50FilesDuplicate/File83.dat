Comparison of the effects of torasemide and furosemide in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites: a randomized, double-blind study. In a randomized double-blind trial we compared the effects of torasemide, a new loop diuretic, and furosemide in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites during a 3-day period in association with potassium canrenoate (200 mg/day) administration. Doses of loop diuretics administered in this trial (10 and 25 mg/day of torasemide and furosemide, respectively) had been shown to be equipotent in healthy subjects. Torasemide induced significantly greater natriuresis than furosemide (p less than 0.02), with a twofold greater percentage increase in basal values (day 1: 130% vs. 50%; day 2: 104% vs. 42%; and day 3: 65% vs. 26%, respectively). Body weight loss was significantly higher during torasemide (p less than 0.02) administration, and the overall decrease at the end of the treatment was twice as high for furosemide (2.5 +/- 0.6 kg vs. 1.3 +/- 0.4 kg, respectively). Diuresis was also higher during torasemide administration, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.08). The extent of kaliuresis observed during the two treatments was almost identical despite the striking differences in the natriuretic response. The effects of the two treatments on plasma electrolytes, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, mean arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma arginine vasopressin concentration were similar. Both drugs caused increases in plasma renin activity at the end of the treatment, whereas plasma aldosterone concentration slightly increased only after torasemide administration. Despite the presence of a trend toward a more pronounced effect on these parameters after torasemide administration, no significant difference between the two treatments was observed. 
Neurophysiological observations on the effects of botulinum toxin treatment in patients with dystonic blepharospasm. Botulinum toxin treatment improves dystonic blepharospasm by inducing transient paresis of the orbicularis oculi muscle. It is not known if it also reduces the enhanced brainstem neuronal excitability found in this disorder. We have performed conventional electromyography (EMG) and blink reflex excitability studies on fifteen patients with blepharospasm before and after botulinum toxin treatment. Denervation signs were found with needle EMG in all treated muscles. Amplitude of the facial compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and R1 response was reduced after botulinum toxin injections. In blink reflex excitability studies, the recovery of R2 response was enhanced after treatment even when patients were tested at the time of maximal benefit from botulinum toxin injections. The results suggest that there is little influence of botulinum toxin treatment upon the enhanced excitability of brainstem interneurons in patients with blepharospasm. 
Clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of testis. Observation vs retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Between 1980 and 1989, 186 patients with testicular tumors were seen at Roswell Park Memorial Institute. Of these, 66.6 percent (124/186) were diagnosed to have nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGT) and 22 percent (41/186) were clinically determined to have Stage I disease. Patients with clinical Stage I NSGT either underwent observation or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). Recurrence in the observation group of patients was 23.5 percent (4/17) between four and eighteen months (mean 10 months) with the retroperitoneum being the most common site. All but 1 patient (80%) were salvaged with platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Of the 24 patients who had RPLND, 21 percent (5/24) had a false-negative metastatic evaluation. All the patients who had surgically documented metastatic disease were successfully treated with chemotherapy. The similar recurrence rates in the observation group and the false-negative RPLND group suggest that the failure rate in the observation group is a result of the inability to stage accurately patients with NSGT. RPLND continues to be the standard therapy in patients with clinical Stage I disease. Despite its high recurrence rate, observation should, however, be offered to well-motivated and selected patients since salvage platinum-based combination chemotherapy is very effective and the majority of patients in this group are spared a major operative procedure. 
Cure of early-stage Hodgkin's disease with subtotal nodal irradiation. Ninety-four consecutive patients with Stage I or II Hodgkin's disease who presented supradiaphragmatically were treated with radiation therapy alone at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology from January 1978 through December 1986. Fifty-two patients (55%) were staged pathologically, and 42 (45%) were staged clinically. The latter included lymphangiography and/or abdominal computed tomographic scan. Most patients with B symptoms and/or bulky disease were excluded from this series. Seventy-four patients were treated with subtotal nodal irradiation (mantle and periaortic fields). The spleen was treated if the patient had not undergone splenectomy. Twenty patients received mantle irradiation only. No patient received total nodal irradiation. All patients had an initial complete response. With a minimum follow-up of 7 months (median, 7.7 years; seven patients died before 3 years of follow-up, but all other patients had at least 3 years of follow-up), 81 patients (86%) remained disease-free. Six of 52 (12%) of the pathologically staged group had a relapse, as did seven of 42 (17%) of the clinically staged group (P = 0.68). Eight of 57 Stage I patients versus five of 37 Stage II patients had a relapse (P greater than 0.99). Analysis of disease-free survival by age, histologic findings, sex, and sites of involvement did not predict relapse. The pelvis was the most common site of failure (nine patients, 10%). However, only three patients (3%) failed in the pelvis alone. These results indicate that patients who, after adequate clinical staging with selective use of staging laparotomy, are found to have Stage I and II Hodgkin's disease may be treated with subtotal nodal irradiation with a high rate of cure. 
Concurrent nitroglycerin administration decreases thrombolytic potential of tissue-type plasminogen activator. Dynamic coronary vasoconstriction may play a role in coronary artery reocclusion after successful thrombolysis. The effect of nitroglycerin on the thrombolytic effects of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was examined in dogs with an electrically induced occlusive coronary artery thrombus. Eleven dogs were randomly given rt-PA alone and seven rt-PA with nitroglycerin. The dose of rt-PA was 0.75 mg/kg body weight given over 20 min and the dose of nitroglycerin was 125 micrograms/min for 40 min. The reperfusion rate in the dogs given rt-PA alone was 73% (8 of 11 dogs) and that in the rt-PA plus nitroglycerin group was 57% (four of seven dogs) (p = NS). The time to thrombolysis (or reperfusion) in dogs receiving rt-PA plus nitroglycerin was 70% greater than in those receiving rt-PA alone (means +/- SD/29.8 +/- 9.9 versus 17.6 +/- 5.9 min, p less than 0.02), and the duration of reperfusion much shorter (11 +/- 17 versus 42 +/- 16 min, p less than 0.02). Peak coronary blood flow after reperfusion in dogs receiving rt-PA plus nitroglycerin was also less than in those receiving rt-PA alone (36 +/- 52 versus 63 +/- 20 ml/min, p less than 0.02). Reocclusion occurred in all dogs given rt-PA with nitroglycerin and in six of eight given rt-PA alone (p = NS). Plasma concentrations of rt-PA were lower when nitroglycerin was given with rt-PA alone (427 +/- 279 versus 1,471 +/- 600 ng/ml, p less than 0.01). 
Destructive lesions in demyelinating disease. Three cases are presented in which clinical and radiological features suggested the diagnosis of glioma but surgical biopsy revealed a demyelinating process, with tissue destruction and cyst formation in two. One patient had clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Two had probable acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Treatment with high dose steroids is appropriate when there is clinical or investigative evidence to suggest the presence of demyelinating disease, before deciding on biopsy. 
Mortality, cardiovascular risk factors, and diet in China, Finland, and the United States. Mortality, cardiovascular risk factors, and diet were compared in Tianjin province, People's Republic of China; in North Karelia Province, Finland; and in the United States as a whole. People in Tianjin received 7 percent of their energy intake from saturated fats, whereas people in the United States received 13 percent and those in North Karelia received 20. The mean blood cholesterol levels for men were 158 milligrams per deciliter (mg per dl) for Tianjin, 216 mg per dl for the United States, and 241 mg per dl for North Karelia. The smoking prevalence among men was highest in Tianjin (66 percent), followed by the United States (42 percent) and Finland (36 percent). The differences among mortality rates for the three locales were less pronounced among women than among men. Age-standardized total mortality for women was highest for Tianjin and lowest in North Karelia. The reverse was true for men. Age-standardized total mortality for men was lowest in Tianjin and highest in North Karelia. Age-standardized ischemic heart disease mortality for men was lowest in Tianjin (99 per 100,000) and highest in North Karelia (730 per 100,000). For women, the corresponding figures were 83 per 100,000 in Tianjin and 164 per 100,000 in North Karelia. Although salt intake was higher in Tianjin than in North Karelia, the blood pressure was on average lower in persons from Tianjin than in those from North Karelia. The stroke mortality rate in Tianjin, however, was much higher than in either Finland or the United States. 
Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring: prognostic aspects during acoustic tumor removal. Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring with electrical stimulation (IFNMES) has become an integral part of acoustic tumor surgery. We reviewed the records of fifty-six patients who underwent translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removal with IFNMES. There was excellent correlation between intraoperative facial nerve activity and immediate postoperative facial nerve function (24 hours after surgery and at hospital discharge). Our data would suggest that patients who exhibit less than 500 microvolts of ongoing EMG activity during surgery, and who yield at least a 500-microvolt contraction when stimulated with 0.05 milliamps at the brainstem after tumor removal, can expect an excellent immediate facial nerve result (grade I or II). 
An animal model for colon cancer metastatic cell line with enhanced metastasizing ability. Establishment and characterization. We have developed an animal model for colon cancer metastasis and produced a metastasizing tumor after using a microinjection technique to inject SW480 cells into the cecal wall of athymic nude mice during "minilaparotomy." After the metastatic foci formed in murine lung, an in vitro primary culture was performed and a new metastatic cancer cell line, which was designated as CC-ML3, was established. The studies included: 1) the comparison between SW 480 and CC-ML3 in morphology, growth kinetics, seeding and plating efficiency, and karyotype; and 2) carcino-embryonic antigen determination, origination, and metastatic ability of CC-ML3. The results showed that CC-ML3 was significantly different from SW480 in vitro and possessed a high metastatic potential in vivo. This newly developed animal model may thus be useful for studying the biology and pathogenesis of metastasis of human colonic cancer. 
Differential effects of atrial natriuretic peptide and dopamine on urinary protein excretion in chronic glomerulonephritis. 1. To examine whether or not atrial natriuretic peptide-induced proteinuria simply results from increases in urine flow or glomerular filtration rate, we infused dopamine (1 microgram min-1 kg-1) and alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (0.025 microgram min-1 kg-1) into nine patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and nine essential hypertensive patients without renal damage, and compared the effects of the two agents on renal function and urinary protein excretion. 2. In patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, dopamine infusion significantly increased urinary sodium excretion (+59%), renal blood flow (+20%) and creatinine clearance (+14%). However, urinary protein excretion was not changed. Addition of atrial natriuretic peptide to the dopamine infusion further increased urinary sodium excretion and maintained creatinine clearance at the same level. In contrast to the infusion of dopamine alone, atrial natriuretic peptide markedly increased urinary protein excretion (77 versus 229 mg min-1 m2, P less than 0.02). Furthermore, the addition of atrial natriuretic peptide elevated the urinary protein/creatinine ratio (1.55 versus 5.35, P less than 0.05), while dopamine alone did not (1.55 versus 1.45, not significant). 3. In essential hypertensive patients, dopamine and dopamine plus ANP showed renal effects similar to those of chronic glomerulonephritis; however, the urinary excretion of protein was not changed significantly. 4. These results suggest that atrial natriuretic peptide may increase urinary protein excretion mainly by increasing the permeability of the damaged glomeruli to protein rather than by simply increasing urine flow or glomerular filtration. Possible mechanisms underlying the proteinuria-increasing effects of atrial natriuretic peptide are discussed. 
Transabdominal and transvaginal sonography of ovarian masses. This chapter outlined the sonographic appearances of most ovarian tumors using both transabdominal and transvaginal sonography. The use of transabdominal and transvaginal sonography for the early detection of ovarian carcinoma seems promising and should be pursued in several institutions as clinical trials. 
Long-term health risks and benefits of oral contraceptive use. The contraceptive effect of oral contraceptive use provides an important health benefit, particularly in developing countries, where the risks of pregnancy and childbearing are increased. Several important noncontraceptive health benefits of oral contraceptive use include the prevention of endometrial and ovarian cancers. Data are generally reassuring concerning the risks of oral contraceptive use, which include cardiovascular disease and breast and cervical cancer. 
Malignant potential of the cryptorchid testis. A follow-up study of 224 male patients from Rochester, Minnesota, diagnosed with cryptorchidism during the period from 1935 through 1974 was conducted to assess the frequency of subsequent testicular neoplasms. Age-specific rates for testicular neoplasm in this community were used to estimate an expected number for comparison with that observed. Two malignant testicular neoplasms have occurred in this cohort; thus, the standardized morbidity ratio was 11.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 41.1). Of the 158 patients born in the community, 11% were known to have birth weights of less than 2,500 g, approximately twice the expected occurrence. Increased risks were also noted for inguinal hernia, hypospadias, Down's syndrome, cleft lip or palate (or both), clubfoot, and congenital heart disease, for which the standardized morbidity ratios were 3.6, 4.7, 17.8, 11.3, 11.7, and 2.7, respectively. The increased risk for malignant neoplasms observed in this cohort of patients with cryptorchidism is consistent with that found in earlier studies. 
Endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery of the sympathetic chain for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis Endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery of the sympathetic chain has been the preferred treatment for palmar or axillary hyperhidrosis in this unit since 1980. A retrospective study was carried out of the first 112 patients with case material derived from a postal questionnaire, chart review and outpatient assessment. Eighty-five patients undergoing bilateral transthoracic electrocautery who replied to the questionnaire (76 per cent response rate) form the basis of this study. There were 65 females and 20 males with a mean age of 24.3 years (range 15-40 years). The hands alone were affected in 20 patients (24 per cent), the axillae alone in 17 (20 per cent) and both areas in 48 (56 per cent). Mean hospital stay was 3.1 days (range 1-7 days). Outcome was assessed by 92 per cent of patients immediately after operation as 'very much improved' or 'moderately improved', and this assessment persisted in 85 per cent after a mean follow-up of 43 months (range 3-95 months). Cosmetic results were rated as satisfactory by 95 per cent. Apart from pain after operation, morbidity was limited to transient Horner's syndrome in three patients, surgical emphysema in three, and pneumothorax requiring a chest drain in one. A repeat procedure was needed in one patient because of an inadequate first operation. Some compensatory hyperhidrosis occurred in 54 (64 per cent) patients. As a minimally invasive procedure, endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery should be considered the treatment of choice for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. 
Rare presentation of a parapharyngeal schwannoma. Schwannoma, or neurilemmoma, is included in the differential diagnosis of masses in the parapharyngeal space. Schwannomata do not usually cause acute inflammation, and therefore do not tend to present as emergencies as in this case, in which there was acute respiratory embarrassment. 
Primary malignant melanoma of male urethra. A case of primary malignant melanoma of the male urethra is reported. Treatment included partial urethrectomy, bilateral inguinal and iliac lymphadenectomy, and post-surgical systemic chemotherapy. After thirty-six months, the patient is alive with cutaneous, pelvic lymph node, and gastric metastases. 
Parental sex effect in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Since a parental sex effect has been reported in Huntington's disease, we looked to see whether a similar effect is apparent in adult (autosomal dominant) familial ALS. We analyzed the data for 145 patients, with an onset age range of 20 to 68 years and a known affected parent (AP), from 52 families described in the literature. There was a significant increase in the percentage of patients inheriting the gene from an affected mother as a function of the age at onset. There was also a significant correlation between AP and offspring age at onset only when the AP was the mother. 
Carotid endarterectomy in elderly patients Between 1971 and 1989, 749 carotid endarterectomies were performed at our institution for symptomatic carotid occlusive disease in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these procedures, 693 were done in patients 71 through 80 years of age, and 56 were done in patients between the ages of 81 and 90 years. The neurologic morbidity and perioperative mortality in the former group were 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively, whereas in the latter group the corresponding values were 5.4% and 0%, respectively. For the entire group, the neurologic morbidity was 3.1% and the mortality was 1.3%. Of the 23 new postoperative neurologic deficits, 19 (83%) occurred in high-risk patients with severe preoperative neurologic or medical risks, and 14 (61%) of these deficits were minor. In selected elderly patients with symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusive disease, endarterectomy seems to be a safe procedure that is associated with acceptably low perioperative morbidity and mortality. 
Resting energy expenditure in patients with newly detected gastric and colorectal cancers. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured in 104 patients with newly detected gastric or colorectal (GCR) cancer and was compared with two groups of control subjects without cancer: healthy subjects (H control subjects) and patients with nonmalignant diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (GI patients). REE in GCR-cancer patients was not significantly different from REE in GI patients or H control subjects. Comparison of measured REE with predicted REE obtained from prediction equations may erroneously suggest that increased REE is a contributing factor in the development of cancer cachexia. No significant differences in REE were found when patients with liver metastases were compared with patients without metastases. There were no differences in REE between gastric and colorectal cancer patients. The decrease in energy expenditure, which normally occurs during starvation and weight loss in healthy men and women, could not be demonstrated in weight-losing, GCR-cancer patients. In conclusion, elevation of REE contributes little to the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia in GCR-cancer patients. 
Events in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST): mortality in the entire population enrolled [published erratum appears in J Am Coll Cardiol 1991 Sep;18(3):888] To test the hypothesis that suppression of ventricular arrhythmias by antiarrhythmic drugs after myocardial infarction improves survival, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) was initiated. Suppression was evaluated before randomization during an open label titration period. Patients whose arrhythmias were suppressed were randomized in the main study and those whose arrhythmias were partially suppressed were randomized in a substudy. Overall survival and survival free of arrhythmic death or cardiac arrest were lower [corrected] in patients treated with encainide or flecainide than in patients treated with placebo. However, the death rate in patients randomized to placebo therapy was lower than expected. This report describes the survival experience of all patients enrolled in CAST and compares it with mortality in other studies of patients with ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. As of April 18, 1989, 2,371 patients had enrolled in CAST and entered prerandomization, open label titration: 1,913 (81%) were randomized to double-blind, placebo-controlled therapy (1,775 patients whose arrhythmias were suppressed and 138 patients whose arrhythmias were partially suppressed during open label titration); and 458 patients (19%) were not randomized because they were still in titration, had died during titration or had withdrawn. Including all patients who enrolled in CAST, the actuarial (Kaplan-Meier) estimate of 1-year mortality was 10.3%. To estimate the "natural" mortality rate of patients enrolled in CAST, an analysis was done that adjusted for deaths that might be attributable to encainide or flecainide treatment either during prerandomization, open label drug titration or after randomization. Because the censoring procedure excluded patients treated with encainide or flecainide after randomization, the mortality estimate will be less than the unadjusted mortality estimate of 10.3%. 
Acute lung injury following reperfusion after ischemia in the hind limbs of rats. In this study, we proposed that oxygen free radicals participate in the acute pulmonary injury that follows limb ischemia/reperfusion. Using an established model of hind limb ischemia, reproducible lung injury occurred after reperfusion. Lung microvascular permeability was measured with 125I-BSA and increased two-fold after 30 minutes of reperfusion. Pulmonary injury was blocked with DMSO, DMTU, allopurinol, indomethacin, and SOD plus catalase. The degree of pulmonary neutrophil sequestration as assessed by tissue myeloperoxidase activity was significantly diminished in animals pretreated with antioxidants. Pretreatment with indomethacin did not attenuate the neutrophil sequestration within the pulmonary parenchyma. These data suggest that increased lung microvascular permeability and neutrophil accumulation occur following hind limb ischemia/reperfusion. Therapeutic interventions with oxygen radical inhibitors blocked this process, while the prostaglandin inhibitor, indomethacin, only reduced lung permeability. 
Antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens: serologic marker for Sweet's syndrome. Seven patients with a clinical and histologic diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome were tested for the presence of circulating antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Six of the seven patients had detectable antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies at a serum dilution of at least 1:20. Antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were not found in serum from patients with a range of cutaneous diseases, some known to cause clinical or histologic confusion with Sweet's syndrome. The detection of circulating antibodies to the neutrophil cytoplasm may be of possible diagnostic value in Sweet's syndrome. 
Effects of postural changes versus exercise on the electrophysiologic parameters of the accessory pathway. The electrophysiologic profile of the accessory pathway was studied in 17 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation 32 +/- 14 years) with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome who were either lying down in a supine position, standing, or undergoing isometric or dynamic treadmill exercise. There were significant decreases in the PP interval after isometric exercise, standing and dynamic exercise (supine 764 +/- 224, standing 638 +/- 146, isometric 605 +/- 170, treadmill 455 +/- 86 ms; p less than 0.05). Both anterograde and retrograde accessory pathway refractory periods were measured after a constant drive of 400 ms during lying down supine, standing and isometric and treadmill exercise (Bruce protocol stage II). There was no significant decrease in the anterograde accessory pathway refractory period during isometric exercise (lying down 265 +/- 22 to isometric exercise 256 +/- 13 ms, p less than 0.05), but there were significant decreases (p less than 0.05) during standing (246 +/- 24 ms) and treadmill exercise (235 +/- 17 ms). The retrograde accessory pathway refractory period also showed a significant decrease (supine 272 +/- 16, isometric 267 +/- 23, standing 249 +/- 15, treadmill 237 +/- 17 ms; p less than 0.05). The relative change in refractory periods was greater when patients changed from lying down to standing than when they changed from standing to treadmill exercise, despite obvious higher adrenergic neuronal activities during exercise. These findings suggest that testing the accessory pathway during free standing can give a reliable indication of the sensitivity of the accessory pathway to sympathetic stimulation. 
Continuous arteriovenous rewarming: report of a new technique for treating hypothermia. Survival is rare after major trauma if core temperature falls below 32 degrees C. Available rewarming methods are often ineffective. We utilized arterial and venous catheters to create a circulatory fistula through the heating mechanism of a modified commercially available counter-current fluid warmer to achieve simple, rapid extracorporeal rewarming. 
Misoprostol compared with sucralfate in the prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastric ulcer. A randomized, controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and frequency of adverse experiences of misoprostol and sucralfate in the prevention of gastric ulcers in patients receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, single-blind, multicenter trial. PATIENTS: Patients with osteoarthritis receiving treatment with ibuprofen, piroxicam, or naproxen and experiencing abdominal pain were eligible. INTERVENTIONS: Patients who were expected to receive at least 3 months of NSAID therapy and who did not have a gastric ulcer at the time of the initial screening endoscopy were randomized to receive misoprostol, 200 micrograms four times a day, or sucralfate, 1 g four times a day. A gastric ulcer was defined as a lesion of the gastric mucosa 0.3 cm or greater in diameter. Patients were followed clinically, and repeat endoscopies were performed after 4, 8, and 12 weeks. MAIN MEASUREMENT: The development of a gastric ulcer, which was regarded as a prophylaxis failure. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-three patients were evaluable for efficacy analysis. A gastric ulcer developed in 2 of the 122 (1.6%, 95% CI, 0.3% to 6.4%) patients on misoprostol, compared with 21 of 131 patients on sucralfate (16%, CI, 10.4% to 23.7%). The difference in ulcer rates was 14.4% (CI, 10.4% to 19.5%; P less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients receiving chronic NSAID therapy for osteoarthritis, treatment with misoprostol for 3 months was associated with a significantly lower frequency of gastric ulcer formation, compared with treatment with sucralfate (P less than 0.001). 
Characterization of the proliferative response of a CD4-8- thymic T lymphoma cell line to stimulation by thymic cellular elements. E710.2 is a cloned T cell line that was isolated from an AKR/J thymic tumor. This clone expresses Thy-1, heat-stable Ag, and the CD3/TCR complex but does not express CD4 or CD8. When the E710.2 cell line is injected into syngeneic mice, it grows as a malignant tumor in lymphoid organs and the thymus. In contrast, this cell line does not grow in vitro under standard culture conditions. This latter property allowed us to analyze the in vitro responsiveness of this CD4-CD8- cell line to stimulation by pharmacologic agents and cellular elements from the spleen and thymus. E710.2 cells proliferate when stimulated with phorbol esters or when cocultured with thymocytes or splenocytes. We could not detect soluble stimulatory factors in cultures of E710.2 and/or lymphoid cells, suggesting that cell contact might be required for this response. The stimulatory activity in thymus and spleen appears to be broadly expressed, because all cell subsets that were examined from these tissues stimulate this cell line. The stimulation of E710.2 cells is not MHC-restricted and is not inhibited by anti-MHC mAb. Furthermore, the responsiveness of these cells is not decreased when the TCR/CD3 complex is modulated from the cell surface. Similarly, TCR/CD3-deficient E710.2 variant clones retain their responsiveness to thymic and splenic cell stimulation. These findings suggest that there is a TCR-independent pathway of activation in E710.2 that is stimulated by a broadly expressed, non-MHC-encoded molecules(s). 
Coexpression of CD4 and CD8 on peripheral blood T cells and lamina propria T cells in inflammatory bowel disease by two colour immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis. Using two colour immunofluorescence with fluorescein isothiocyanate and phycoerythrin labelled monoclonal antibodies and multiparameter flow cytometry, we investigated the coexpression of CD4 and CD8 antigens on peripheral blood lymphocytes and lamina propria lymphocytes of patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and normal control subjects. Both the absolute number and the proportion of peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+ cells in inflammatory bowel disease were small but significantly increased compared with those in normal control subjects. Peripheral blood lymphocytes activated with phytohaemagglutinin showed appreciably increased coexpression of CD4+, CD8+. These CD4, CD8 positive cells were large and granular. Thus the increased number of peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+ cells in inflammatory bowel disease suggests that chronic immune activation occurs not only in the active state of the disease but also in remission. The proportion of CD4+, CD8+ cells in the lamina propria was greater than in peripheral blood in normal subjects, suggesting chronic immune stimulation of the local immune system. This was also seen in patients with Crohn's disease or inactive ulcerative colitis. The proportion of CD4+, CD8+ cells was, however, significantly less in the lamina propria of patients with active ulcerative colitis. Whether this implies a possible defect in mucosal immunoregulation in active ulcerative colitis cannot be determined from these results. 
The clinical and endocrine outcome to trans-sphenoidal microsurgery of nonsecreting pituitary adenomas. From 1962 to 1987, 126 patients underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery for primary treatment of pituitary adenomas unassociated with clinical or biochemical evidence of hormonal overproduction. There were 73 male and 53 female patients (mean age, 50 +/- 12 years). Before surgery, 56% of the patients (70 of 124) had headaches, 74% (94 of 126) had deterioration of vision, and 12% (15 of 126) had ophthalmoplegia. Endocrine evaluation revealed the presence of hypogonadism in 75% (87 of 115), adrenal insufficiency in 36% (46 of 126), and hypothyroidism in 18% (21 of 122). Plasma prolactin was increased in 65% (56 of 86) with a mean level of 39 +/- 14 micrograms/l (normal, 3 to 20 micrograms/l). Radiologic enlargement of the sella turcica was documented in all cases: 67% (84 of 126) had enclosed and 33% (42 of 126) had invasive adenomas. After surgery, vision was normalized or improved in 75% (71 of 94) of the patients. Thyroid, adrenal, and gonadal functions were improved in 14% (three of 22), 41% (19 of 46), 11% (ten of 87), were unchanged in 82% (100 of 122), 77% (97 of 126), 89% (102 of 115), and worsened in 15% (19 of 22), 8% (ten of 126), 3% (102 of 115), respectively. Permanent diabetes insipidus occurred in 5% (seven of 126). Two patients died during the immediate postoperative period. The recurrence rate in patients with a mean follow-up of 6.4 +/- 4.2 years was 21% (15 of 71). These data indicate that trans-sphenoidal microsurgery is an effective and safe initial treatment for patients with nonsecreting pituitary adenoma and may reverse hypopituitarism. 
Inhibitory effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on mucosal cell proliferation associated with gastric ulcer healing To find out whether non-steroidial anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the proliferation of mucosal cells that normally leads to healing of gastric ulcers a microdissection technique was used to quantify mitosis in gastric glands at the ulcer edge in relation to that in the adjacent mucosa. The regeneration index thus obtained of the ulcer edge was greater in the 9 subjects with gastric ulcers not taking NSAIDs (mean index 3.1 [SEM 0.61]) than that in the 8 patients taking NSAIDs (index 1.49 [0.16]). In rats in which gastric ulcers were produced with a cryoprobe, the ulcers were larger and slower to heal in those receiving indomethacin than in controls; also, immunohistochemical staining indicated significantly fewer mitotic cells in glands adjacent to the ulcer in indomethacin-treated rats (8 mitoses [SEM 3]) than in control animals (25 [5]). The prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol reversed the inhibition of healing and substantially restored the proliferative rate in the animals. Inhibition of epithelial cell division normally involved in gastric ulcer healing would contribute to the high prevalence of gastric ulcer during NSAID therapy. 
Relation of arteriographically defined coronary artery disease to serum lipoprotein particles mapped with monoclonal antibodies. BACKGROUND. This study was designed to investigate the relation of a molecular analysis of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing atherogenic lipoprotein particles to coronary artery disease (CAD) in middle-aged men. METHODS AND RESULTS. Two groups of men were studied. The first consisted of 97 patients with angiographically documented CAD (greater than 50% stenosis of at least one coronary artery). The second group consisted of 145 subjects without symptomatic CAD, who served as controls. In both groups, measurements were obtained for total cholesterol level, triglyceride level, cholesterol contents in apoB- and nonapoB-containing particles (LpB, LpnonB), total apoB and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI levels), lipoprotein particles recognized by monoclonal antibodies anti-apoB (LpBL3, LpBL5, LpBL7) and anti-apoAI (LpAI-2GII). Taking into account age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, smoking habits, and drug consumption, the analysis showed that the mean levels of cholesterol were identical in both groups but differed when cholesterol content in LpB and LpnonB subfractions were assessed, thus reflecting an increase in the low density fraction and a decrease in the high density fraction, respectively. This was confirmed by an increase in total apoB and a decrease in total apoAI. Measurements of LpBL3, LpBL5, LpBL7, and LpAI-2GII particles also discriminated between the two groups. After adjustment for cholesterol content in LpnonB particles, a difference in total apoB was no longer significant between groups, whereas LpBL3, LpBL5, and LpBL7 levels remained significantly higher in CAD patients. CONCLUSIONS. The measurement of separate concentrations of apoB in different particles may permit a more-accurate assessment of CAD risk than measurements of total apoB levels. 
Clinical significance of pericardial rub with regional ventricular dilatation. To elucidate the clinical characteristics associated with regional ventricular dilatation in the early phase of myocardial infarction (MI), 228 patients with acute Q-wave anterior MI were studied. Forty-nine patients (21 percent) had echocardiographically demonstrated regional ventricular dilatation (an abnormal bulge in the left ventricular contour during both systole and diastole) on the third hospital day. Careful auscultation revealed that a pericardial rub was present in 49 patients (21 patients with and 28 patients without regional ventricular dilatation) during the first three days after hospital admission. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the relative importance of pericardial rub with six other clinical variables related to regional ventricular dilatation. Pericardial rub and cardiac output were the significant factors related to the presence of regional ventricular dilatation. Thus, a pericardial rub, in concert with impaired left ventricular function, is a physical sign associated with regional ventricular dilatation, and anatomically transmural infarction is the possible factor explaining their association. 
Diagnosis and management of systemic Wegener's granulomatosis presenting with anterior ocular inflammatory disease. The ocular and systemic features of 10 patients whose Wegener's granulomatosis presented with corneoscleral inflammatory disease are described. Marginal corneal infiltrates were seen in all patients with anterior scleritis and were a valuable sign of disease activity. Nine out of 10 patients had symptoms of systemic vasculitis on presentation; seven had renal impairment; three had chest x-ray abnormalities. Autoantibodies against neutrophil cytoplasmic determinants (ANCA) were present in all cases. In seven patients the scleritis responded well to pulsed immunosuppressive therapy followed by long term oral steroids and cyclophosphamide. Oral steroid therapy alone failed to control severe disease. Corneoscleral disease was not a cause of visual loss. It is important to realise that inflammatory corneoscleral disease may be the presenting feature of a severe systemic vasculitis. 
Chronic anterior uveitis in leprosy: an insidious cause of blindness. Chronic low grade anterior uveitis is the commonest cause of blindness in leprosy. It is usually asymptomatic until the late stages, and often patients seek help only after irreversible visual impairment has occurred. We present herewith several cases of this entity to emphasise the insidious nature of the disease, the extent of ocular damage it can cause, and the importance of early detection and treatment. 
Retinoid-mediated transcriptional regulation of keratin genes in human epidermal and squamous cell carcinoma cells. Vitamin A and other retinoids profoundly inhibit morphological and biochemical features of epidermal differentiation in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential expression of epidermal keratins and their regulation by retinoids, we examined retinoid-mediated changes in total protein expression, protein synthesis, mRNA expression, and transcription in cultured human keratinocytes and in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC-13) cells of epidermal origin. Our studies revealed that the epidermal keratins, K5, K6, K14, and K16, their mRNAs, and their transcripts were diminished relative to actin as a consequence of retinoic acid (RA) treatment. The effects were most pronounced in SCC-13 and were detected as early as 6 hr post-RA treatment, with enhancement over an additional 24-48 hr. Repression was also observed when 5' upstream sequences of K14 or K5 genes were used to drive expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in SCC-13 keratinocytes. Both cell types were found to express mRNAs for the RA receptors alpha and gamma, which may be involved in the RA-mediated transcriptional changes in these cells. The rapid transcriptional changes in epidermal keratin genes were in striking contrast to the previously reported slow transcriptional changes in simple epithelial keratin genes. 
A clinicopathologic study of node-based, low-grade, peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Angioimmunoblastic lymphoma, T-zone lymphoma, and lymphoepithelioid lymphoma. Postthymic (peripheral) T-cell malignancy shows marked diversity in histopathologic appearances as well as in clinical and prognostic aspects. Histologic findings and clinical behavior of 110 cases of the three specific types of low-grade, peripheral T-cell lymphomas, i.e., lymphoepithelioid (LeL), angioimmunoblastic (AILD), and T-zone (TzL) lymphomas, were studied. There were 74 men and 36 women (age range, 24 to 90 years; median, 58). Histologic study of LeL, AILD, and TzL showed prominent reactive features which are distinct from those of high-grade, T-cell lymphomas (pleomorphic/immunoblastic types). Corresponding to the differences in the histologic pictures of each type, there were differences in the clinical pictures and prognosis. Hypergammablobulinemia (greater than 4 g/dl) was more common in AILD than in the others. However, these three types exhibited a widely variegated, sometimes overlapping spectrum of histologic appearances, and it was extremely difficult to distinguish one from the other on several occasions. The same was true of their clinical and laboratory findings, and they had a relatively favorable prognosis as compared with pleomorphic/immunoblastic lymphomas. Although the conventional phenotypic analysis showed the prominent mixture of helper/inducer and cytotoxic/suppressor T-cells with a varying degree of B-cells and histiocytes, the double immunohistochemical study revealed that the neoplastic cells consisted predominantly of helper/inducer cells. Furthermore, five cases (5%) showed the morphologic transition among the three types or development into pleomorphic/immunoblastic lymphoma. They seemed to constitute a comprehensive and yet distinct group of T-cell lymphomas. Based on morphologic findings and clinical data, the authors demonstrated the distinct character of the node-based, low-grade, T-cell lymphomas and also the relationship among the three types in this group. The results of phenotypic and genotypic analyses also support the concept proposed here. 
A new anticancer drug delivery system for the management of carcinomatous peritonitis. To develop a new drug delivery system for the treatment of carcinomatous peritonitis, we constructed 5-fluorouracil poly L-microcapsules (5Fu-mc) by the organic phase separation technique and examined their drug-releasing capacities and anticancer effects. The microcapsules consisted of in vitro dissolvable polymolecular poly L-lactic acid and 5-fluorouracil (5Fu). The 5Fu-mc was about 200 microns in diameter and had a 5Fu content of about 40% (weight/weight). 5Fu-release time from the microcapsules was about 50 hours in vitro and about 48 hours in vivo. After the release of the 5Fu, the poly L-lactic acid was metabolized very slowly in the peritoneal cavity. The 5Fu-mc caused fewer side effects than the equivalent dose of a 5Fu solution. In addition, macroscopic and microscopic examinations of various abdominal organs revealed no toxic effects from the microcapsules. After administration of 5Fu-mc into the abdominal cavity of rats with AH-130 carcinomatous peritonitis, the 5Fu concentration remained at a high level for an extended period in the ascites but fell rapidly to low levels in the plasma. In conclusion, the present studies indicated that the 5Fu-mc were much more effective in prolonging the life of tumor-bearing hosts while producing less systemic side effects than a 5Fu solution. 
New recurring chromosomal translocations in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We identified seven new recurring translocations among 483 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with adequate chromosome banding studies. Four were apparently balanced [t(1;3)(p34;p21), t(7;9)(p15;p23-p24), t(12;13)(p13;q14), t(17;19)(q22;p13)], while three were unbalanced with the formation of a dicentric chromosome [dic(7;9)(p13;p11), dic(7;12)(p11;p12), and dic(12;17)(p11;p11-p12)]. One translocation was observed in five cases, two in four cases, and the remaining four in two cases each. The modal chromosome numbers in these 21 cases were 45 (n = 11), 46 (n = 8), and 47 (n = 2). Eight of the 11 cases with a dicentric chromosome had a modal number of 45. Only a single translocation was found in 14 cases (67%), representing the sole structural abnormality in six cases. In three of the seven translocation subgroups, the blast cells were consistently of B lineage (pre-B, early pre-B, or both); in all others, they represented both the B and T lineages. The small size of these subgroups prevented definitive clinical correlations, although it may be important that two of the four cases with a t(17;19) and an early pre-B-cell immunophenotype had disseminated intravascular coagulation, an event usually observed in acute promyelocytic leukemia or T-cell ALL. These findings add substantially to the existing list of nonrandom chromosomal translocations in childhood ALL and may help to explain the genetic alterations leading to the loss of normal growth control mechanisms in this disease. 
Surgical treatment of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome by epicardial electrical ablation A new operation to eliminate accessory pathways--epicardial electrical ablation--is described. In a group of 201 patients without concomitant disease, the mortality rate was 0.5% and the overall efficacy of the operation for free wall accessory pathways, 98%. A retrospective clinical study of 44 unselected patients was performed to examine how safe epicardial electrical ablation is. The criteria for intraoperative effectiveness were disappearance of both the delta wave and retrograde conduction and inability to induce tachycardia. In the postoperative and follow-up periods, the following were reviewed: electrocardiograms; Holter monitor recordings (24 to 26 hours); release of the myocardial-specific isoenzyme of creatine kinase; intracardiac hemodynamics and myocardial contractility (radionuclide methods); selective coronary arteriograms and ventriculograms; mean work capacity (bicycle ergometer); diagnostic transesophageal electrical stimulation; and histology of the area of ablation. The main conclusion of this study is that epicardial electrical ablation is a highly efficient and safe operation for surgical elimination of parietal accessory pathways in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Its advantages are its technical simplicity and the opportunity to review results immediately during the operation. 
Proportionate mortality trends: 1950 through 1986 Mortality trends in the United States from 1950 through 1986 were analyzed for the conditions that are or have recently been among the six leading causes of death. The age-adjusted mortality rate for all causes has decreased from 841.5 to 541.7 per 100,000 population. Cause-specific, age-adjusted mortality rates have declined from 1950 through 1986 for cerebrovascular disease, injuries, perinatal conditions, heart disease, and influenza and pneumonia. Time trends in the proportion of persons dying of each of these diseases, however, have varied; the proportion dying of cerebrovascular disease, injuries, and perinatal conditions has decreased, and the proportion of persons dying of heart disease and influenza and pneumonia has remained fairly stable from 1950 through 1986. During this same time, age-adjusted death rates have increased for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and have remained fairly stable for malignant neoplasms, while the proportions of persons dying of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and malignant neoplasms have increased dramatically. For people aged 35 to 64 years, malignant neoplasms have now overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death. For those aged 65 years and older, heart disease remains the leading cause of death, accounting for almost 50% of all deaths in persons 85 years and older. 
Hyperoxia prevents hypoxia-induced bronchial hyperreactivity via a cyclooxygenase-independent mechanism. We tested the hypothesis that prior exposure to alveolar hyperoxia prevents the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity, possibly via a cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanism. In 15 sheep, specific lung resistance (sRL) was measured before and after 30 min of exposure to either air or a hypoxic gas mixture (13% O2). The sheep then inhaled 50 breaths of aerosolized 5% histamine solution (n = 9) or 10 breaths of 2.5% carbachol solution (n = 9), and measurements of sRL were repeated. On subsequent days the above protocols were repeated after a 30-min exposure to hyperoxia (O2 greater than or equal to 95%), without or after pretreatment with indomethacin (2 mg/kg). After air-sham exposure, carbachol and histamine increased mean sRL to 370 +/- 40 (SE) and 309 +/- 65% of baseline, respectively. Exposure to the hypoxic gas mixture had no effect on baseline sRL but enhanced the airway responsiveness to carbachol and histamine; mean sRL increased to 740 +/- 104 and 544 +/- 76% of baseline, respectively (P less than 0.05). Prior 30-min exposure to hyperoxia prevented the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity to carbachol (sRL = 416 +/- 66% of baseline) and histamine (sRL = 292 +/- 41% of baseline) without affecting the airway responsiveness to these agents after air. Pretreatment with indomethacin did not reverse the protective effects of hyperoxia or the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity. We conclude that 1) prior exposure to alveolar hyperoxia prevents the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity and 2) neither the protective effects of hyperoxia nor the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity is mediated via a cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanism. 
Pathophysiology of myocardial perfusion in hypertension. Chronic and acute hypertension have multiple untoward effects on the coronary circulation, several of which may either mimic or markedly worsen the clinical manifestations of coronary artery disease. Early after the onset of left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to hypertension, coronary vasodilator reserve is significantly impaired. During cardiac hypertrophy secondary to hypertension, the coronary arteries fail to enlarge in concert with ventricular enlargement. This failure results in a relative decrease by approximately 50% in the ratio of epicardial vessel diameter to the mass of myocardium perfused. The lower range of coronary subendocardial autoregulation is altered by chronic renovascular hypertension. A variety of vascular smooth muscle homeostatic mechanisms are abnormal in genetic models of hypertension, as is endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation. Acute hypertension may enhance constriction to serotonin, most likely through the release of potent vasoconstrictor substances from leukocytes and platelets that adhere to the endothelium as a result of endothelial damage. Finally, many of the consequences of myocardial infarction are worsened in the setting of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Homing and progression patterns of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. The aim of this study was to analyze the homing and progression patterns of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Upon intraperitoneal (IP) transfer, cells from relapse samples of three children with T-lineage ALL spread hematogenously and infiltrated the non-lymphoid and/or lymphoid organs with a pattern reminiscent of the human clinical disease. These mice either died or were killed in extremis at a mean of 9 weeks. Moreover, cell lines established in vitro from two of these samples manifested identical homing and progression in the SCID mouse as compared with the original patients' cells. Thus, long-term culture of the primary leukemic T cells did not alter their invasive potential and migration pattern. When engrafted IP, three cell lines established from pre-B-ALL cases displayed primarily a lymphatic spread with induction of local tumor masses and kidney/liver nodules. Mice were killed at 11 to 13 weeks, but had not developed imminently fatal leukemia. However, when transferred intravenously, one pre-B ALL cell line was able to spread hematogenously and to infiltrate both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. Overall, these data demonstrate that the SCID mouse provides an efficient and reproducible model to study the pathogenesis of childhood ALL, and may be a suitable system for evaluating therapy. 
Hemilaryngectomy for salvage of radiation therapy failures. Radiation therapy has been the treatment most frequently used for early vocal cord cancer with surgery usually in the form of total laryngectomy held in reserve as a salvage option. We report our experience in selected patients who, having failed radiation therapy for their early vocal cord cancers, underwent frontolateral hemilaryngectomy as attempted salvage surgery. Between 1977 and 1986, fourteen patients at the University of Pittsburgh Eye and Ear Hospital underwent hemilaryngectomy for salvage of their stage I vocal cord squamous cell carcinoma after full-course radiation therapy had been unsuccessful. Over this same time period, 77 patients underwent total laryngectomy for salvage of radiation therapy failure. Three patients failed hemilaryngectomy, two of whom were ultimately salvaged with total laryngectomy. Thus a 79% salvage rate was achieved with hemilaryngectomy with an average followup of 90 months. The overall cure rate was 93% (13 of 14) with voice preservation in 86% (12 of 14). Decannulation, postoperative infection, and initiation of oral intake were not influenced by age. Such problems occurred more often in patients undergoing radiation therapy compared to those undergoing hemilaryngectomy without previous radiation therapy. These results indicate that hemilaryngectomy may be used for the salvage of radiation therapy failures of stage I vocal cord carcinoma with good success and without undue morbidity. 
Orthostatic vital signs in emergency department patients. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the variability and define the normal ranges of orthostatic vital signs in an emergency department population. DESIGN: Descriptive. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Adult ED patients with no history of recent blood or fluid losses. MEASUREMENTS: Lying and standing heart rate and blood pressure measured by an automated instrument. RESULTS: In 132 presumed euvolemic patients, the statistical normal ranges (mean +/- 2 SD) of orthostatic vital signs were wide: on standing, the heart rate range was from decreases 5.0 to increases 39.4 beats per minute; for systolic blood pressure, the range was decreases 20 to increases 25.7 mm Hg; and for diastolic blood pressure, the range was decreases 6.4 to increases 24.9 mm Hg. In this sample, 43% had "positive" orthostatic vital signs according to currently accepted values. CONCLUSION: The data from this study indicate that there is a wider than expected variation in orthostatic vital signs among presumed euvolemic ED patients. 
Depression of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity characterizes patients with early myocardial reinfarction after recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator therapy. Twenty patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) had endogenous factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity levels measured throughout the hospital period and those levels were prospectively correlated with the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction until 8 weeks after hospital discharge. Within the follow-up period, recurrent myocardial infarction was observed in 8 patients, whereas the remaining 12 patients showed no clinical evidence of recurrence. The patients in the reinfarction group were characterized by a more pronounced depletion of and sustained lower levels of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity than were the patients with no reinfarction (p less than 0.05). The decrease in fibrinolytic activity during rt-PA therapy was significantly associated with a depletion of functional alpha 2-antiplasmin, the primary plasmin inhibitor. These results indicate that, paradoxically, coronary thrombolysis with rt-PA involves depletion of endogenous factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity levels, which constitutes a risk for early myocardial reinfarction. 
Ig repertoire of human polyspecific antibodies and B cell ontogeny. A total of 463 EBV Ig-secreting clones were derived from embryonic tissues, cord blood, and adult peripheral blood. Subcloning and analysis of the H and K loci (germline vs rearranged DNA status) of 44 primary clones insured clonality in at least 92% of cases. Whatever the cell origin, a somewhat constant proportion of clones (i.e., 11 to 16%) expressed polyspecific antibodies when tested on a panel of nine Ag, including self-Ag. The VH and VK repertoires have been studied using VH1-VH6 and VK1-VK4 family-specific probes. For all EBV clones the VH and VK utilization was similar to that of the normal untransformed population. A correlation was observed between the level of expression and the gene number for VH, whereas a clear distortion appeared for VK. Moreover, the usage pattern of VH and VK families of the polyspecific clones did not significantly differ from that of clones of unknown specificity, suggesting that polyspecificity was not linked to a restricted repertoire. 
Prospective randomized evaluation of two regimens for converting from continuous to intermittent feedings in patients with feeding gastrostomies. Forty enterally fed male patients were randomized to one of two regimens designed to determine the better means of converting them from continuous to intermittent enteral feedings. All patients received a nutritionally complete iso-osmolal 1 kcal/cc formula containing 6 g of nitrogen/L beginning on the second postgastrostomy day. Half of the patients (20) were randomized to a discontinuous regimen abruptly changing from continuous to gradually increasing intermittent feedings until reaching their nutritional goals. Intravenous fluids were given to maintain normal fluid balance. The other 20 patients were randomized to an overlapping regimen, receiving continuous feedings at a decreasing rate while intermittent feedings were progressively increased. Intravenous fluids were used during the first three stages only. There were no significant differences (p less than 0.05) in major diagnosis, type of gastrostomy, age, weight, height, admission or discharge serum albumin concentration, calculated basal energy expenditure (BEE), or nutrient goals (1.5 X BEE, 1.5 g of protein/kg per day). 
First-pass nuclear magnetic resonance imaging studies using gadolinium-DTPA in patients with coronary artery disease. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging has been shown to accurately portray cardiac anatomy and function. To investigate the potential of NMR imaging for the assessment of coronary stenosis in patients with chest pain, ultrafast NMR imaging in conjunction with a T1 (longitudinal relaxation time) contrast agent was performed in 17 patients with chest pain who had undergone cardiac catheterization. These included 12 patients with significant coronary artery stenoses and 4 who underwent repeat NMR study after myocardial revascularization. Cardiac images at rest were obtained during rapid intravenous injection of gadolinium-DTPA (0.04 mM/kg). Electrocardiographic-gated images were acquired over 380 ms, with repetitive images obtained every 3 to 4 s. After contrast injection, there was pronounced signal enhancement in the right ventricular cavity, followed by enhancement in the left ventricular cavity and myocardium. Regional myocardium perfused by a diseased vessel demonstrated a lower peak signal intensity (p = 0.001) and lower rate of signal increase (p = 0.001) than did myocardium perfused by coronary arteries without stenosis. Repeat NMR study after revascularization showed an increase in peak signal intensity (p less than 0.002). These results demonstrate the clinical potential of dynamic gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced NMR imaging for the assessment of coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain. In combination with anatomic and functional NMR imaging, this technique has the potential to provide a comprehensive noninvasive cardiac evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. 
Severe 5-fluorouracil toxicity secondary to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency. A potentially more common pharmacogenetic syndrome. This study describes the inheritance of a defect in pyrimidine catabolism and its association with drug-induced toxicity in a patient receiving 5-fluorouracil (FUra) as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast carcinoma. The study population included the affected patient (proband), nine of her blood relatives, and seven healthy volunteers. The activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the initial enzyme of pyrimidine (and FUra) catabolism, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured in each subject by a specific radiometric assay using FUra as the substrate. The proband had no detectable DPD activity. When enzyme levels in the proband and relatives were compared with that in controls, an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance was demonstrated. This is the third patient with severe FUra toxicity secondary to an alteration in pyrimidine catabolism and the second from our clinic population suggesting that the frequency of this genetic defect may be greater than previously thought. Monitoring DPD activity may be important in the management of patients experiencing severe toxicity secondary to FUra chemotherapy. 
Characterization of liver epithelial cells transfected with myc and/or ras oncogenes. While many liver tumors contain activated myc and ras oncogenes, the mechanisms by which these genes contribute to cellular transformation is poorly understood. Activated versions of the cellular oncogenes, c-myc and/or c-H-ras were transfected into normal rat liver epithelial cells to identify cellular pathways that are altered in the cells containing the oncogenes. The results of these and other investigations indicate that the biological properties associated with the transfection of c-myc include immortalization, reduced contact inhibition of growth, activation of phospholipase A2-mediated pathways, increased sensitivity to transformation with a ras gene, and greatly increased sensitivity to growth factors. The biological properties associated with the transfection of the ras gene include morphological transformation, anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenicity, increased phosphatidylinositol metabolism, the induction of growth-factor processing and secretion, which leads to (exogenous) growth factor-independent tumor growth, and a marked resistance to normal inhibitors of growth such as TGF-beta. It is proposed that the complementary actions of the myc and ras genes in cellular transformation may be related to the ras-induced secretion of autocrine growth factors by cells sensitized to their effects by the myc gene. The increased stimulus for growth coupled to a ras-induced insensitivity to growth inhibitors may lead to clonal expansion of these cells and tumor development. 
Necrolytic migratory erythema: dyskeratotic dermatitis, a clue to early diagnosis. A 57-year-old woman with a 6-year history of a dermatitis that evolved into typical necrolytic migratory erythema is reported. Four biopsy specimens were obtained in 5 years. The early lesions revealed superficial perivascular inflammation in the dermis, minor epidermal spongiosis, and scattered dyskeratotic cells in the upper epidermis. The differential diagnosis of this pattern of dyskeratotic dermatitis, particularly in a chronic eruption, should include consideration of hyperglucagonemia and the possibility of an associated pancreatic islet cell tumor. 
Correlation of occult clonogenic leukemia drug sensitivity with relapse after autologous bone marrow transplantation. Despite initial complete remission rates exceeding 70%, the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) eventually relapse. Improving the therapeutic results in acute leukemia requires detecting, and understanding the biology of, the minimal residual leukemia remaining after therapy and responsible for relapse. To investigate the biologic relevance of an in vitro assay for clonogenic leukemia (leukemia colony-forming units [CFU-L]) as a measure of minimal residual leukemia, we studied 58 consecutive patients with acute leukemia in complete remission undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with cyclophosphamide-based therapy. CFU-L were cultured from the pretransplant remission marrows in 45 of 58 patients: 35 of 43 patients with AML and 10 of 15 with ALL. Clonal rearrangements, identical to the patients' overt leukemia when available, were detected in the occult CFU-L from four of the eight patients with ALL in whom adequate DNA for analysis could be obtained from the CFU-L. None of the uncultured pretransplant remission marrows from the 15 ALL patients showed clonal gene rearrangements. We also determined the in vitro sensitivity of the occult CFU-L to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC), and correlated these results with the outcome of the patients. The sensitivity of the occult CFU-L to 4HC was the only factor that predicted relapse following BMT. The actuarial probability of relapse was 18% in the 23 patients whose CFU-L were sensitive to 4HC compared with 77% in the 22 patients whose CFU-L were resistant (P less than .001). The only factor that influenced the CFU-L sensitivity to 4HC was the type of leukemia. The CFU-L from the AML patients were more sensitive to 4HC than the CFU-L from the ALL patients (P = .001). Occult CFU-L genetically and functionally represent occult leukemia. Therefore, the CFU-L assay should provide a means for studying the biology of minimal residual leukemia and improving the therapeutic results in patients with acute leukemia. 
Intraoperative colonic lavage and primary anastomosis in nonelective colon resection. In selected individuals requiring emergency colon resection, intraoperative colonic lavage with primary anastomosis represents a safe alternative to staged reconstruction. This procedure achieves excellent mechanical preparation of the colon, facilitates safe anastomosis, and avoids the disadvantages associated with multistaged operations. At our institution, 25 patients requiring urgent segmental resection of the left colon have undergone intraoperative colonic lavage. Primary anastomosis without fecal diversion has been performed in 21 of these patients. Obstruction of the large intestine was the indication for operation in 56 percent of the patients in this series. Ten patients (40 percent) required laparotomy for an acute intra-abdominal inflammatory process. No post-operative deaths have occurred in our series, and no patient has sustained clinically evident anastomotic leakage. A pelvic abscess developed in one patient after sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis. Three patients required treatment for wound infection. Based on our results, we recommend resection with intraoperative colonic lavage and primary anastomosis as the preferred treatment for the majority of patients requiring nonelective segmental left colon resection. 
Scrapie-infected spleens: analysis of infectivity, scrapie-associated fibrils, and protease-resistant proteins. Scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF) and protease-resistant proteins (PrP) were isolated from spleens and brains of clinical animals (mice and hamsters) from three scrapie agent-host strain combinations, and their concentrations were compared with infectivity levels. The spleens of infected animals contained lower levels of infectivity, PrP, and SAF than did brains. Regardless of the route of infection, both SAF and infectivity were detected in spleen before brain. Infectivity increased in brains and spleens of 139A-infected mice before the detection and increase in SAF, suggesting that the synthesis of SAF and PrP may not be the limiting factor in agent replication. In contrast to those in ME7- and 263K-infected animals, the Western blot profiles for PrP from brain and spleen of 139A-infected mice exhibited distinct differences. Results indicate that SAF and PrP found in the spleens are both organ- and scrapie strain-specific. 
Randomized study on the effect of collagen impregnation of knitted Dacron velour aortoiliac prostheses on blood loss during aortic reconstruction. Intraoperative blood loss is an important factor in reconstructive surgery for aortoiliac disease because it is clearly associated with an increase in the operative morbidity and mortality rates. To minimize intraoperative blood loss, a blood-tight vascular prosthesis has been developed by impregnating a knitted Dacron prosthesis with bovine collagen. To study a potential reduction of intraoperative blood loss using these collagen-impregnated prostheses, we conducted a prospective randomized trial involving the collagen-impregnated prosthesis and its non-impregnated substrate, the Dacron knitted non-impregnated prosthesis. During a 2.5-year period, 123 consecutive patients (undergoing 81 procedures for aneurysmal disease and 43 procedures for occlusive disease) were admitted for elective aortic reconstructive surgery. Equal numbers of the two prostheses were randomly implanted. Various parameters were monitored: intraoperative blood loss before aortic cross-clamping (phase 1), during implantation of the prosthesis (phase 2) and after release of aorta cross-clamping (phase 3); the number of intraoperative and postoperative blood transfusions; and, finally, all preoperative and intraoperative factors that might contribute to intraoperative blood loss. A significant overall difference in intraoperative blood loss between the collagen-impregnated (2425 ml) and the non-impregnated (1907 ml) group was found (P = 0.003). However, this difference could not be attributed to collagen impregnation because no statistically significant difference in blood loss was found in the relevant period of operation (phase 3). Similar results were observed in patients operated on for both aneurysmal and occlusive disease (2600 versus 2195 ml and 2105 versus 1344 ml respectively). 
Profound hypothermia (less than 10 degrees C) compared with deep hypothermia (15 degrees C) improves neurologic outcome in dogs after two hours' circulatory arrest induced to enable resuscitative surgery. Deaths from uncontrollable hemorrhage might be prevented by arresting the circulation under protective hypothermia to allow resuscitative surgery to repair these injuries in a bloodless field. We have shown previously that in hemorrhagic shock, circulatory arrest of 60 minutes under deep hypothermia (tympanic membrane temperature, Ttm = 15 degrees C) was the maximum duration of arrest that allowed normal brain recovery. We hypothesize that profound cerebral hypothermia (Ttm less than 10 degrees C) could extend the duration of safe circulatory arrest. In pilot experiments, we found that the cardiopulmonary system did not tolerate arrest at a core (esophageal) temperature (Tes) of less than 10 degrees C. Twenty-two dogs underwent 30-minute hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure 40 mm Hg), rapid cooling by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), blood washout to a hematocrit of less than 10%, and circulatory arrest of 2 hours. In deep hypothermia group 1 (n = 10), Ttm was maintained at 15 degrees C during arrest. In profound hypothermia group 2 (n = 12), during cooling with CPB, the head was immersed in ice water, which decreased Ttm to 4 degrees-7 degrees C. The Tes was 10 degrees C in all dogs during arrest. Reperfusion and rewarming were by CPB for 2 hours. Controlled ventilation was to 24 hours, intensive care to 72 hours. In the 20 dogs that followed protocol, best neurologic deficit scores (0% = normal, 100% = brain death) at 24-72 hours were 23% +/- 19% in group 1 and 12% +/- 8% in group 2 (p = 0.15). Overall performance categories and histologic damage scores were significantly better in group 2 (p = 0.04 and p less than 0.001, respectively). We conclude that profound cerebral hypothermia with CPB plus ice water immersion of the head can extend the brain's tolerance of therapeutic circulatory arrest beyond that achieved with deep hypothermia. 
A clinicopathologic study of 153 cases of complete hydatidiform mole (1980-1990): histologic grade lacks prognostic significance. Although the significance of histologic grading in hydatidiform mole has previously been investigated, most studies evaluated patients treated before 1975. Since 1975, many advances have been made in the understanding and treatment of hydatidiform mole, including the division of molar pregnancy into complete and partial hydatidiform mole. We retrospectively studied 153 cases of complete hydatidiform mole diagnosed and treated at the Brigham and Women's Hospital between 1980-1990 to determine the current prognostic significance of histologic grading in this disease. The histologic grade (based on the criteria of Hertig and Sheldon) was compared with the subsequent clinical course, including the rates of spontaneous remission, persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor, metastatic disease, "high-risk" metastatic disease, chemotherapy resistance, and survival. The histologic grade of the original complete hydatidiform mole did not correlate significantly with any index of clinical outcome evaluated. 
Granulomatous vasculitis occurring after cutaneous herpes zoster despite absence of viral genome. Granuloma annulare, sarcoidal and other granulomatous dermatitides, pseudolymphoma, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma have been described as sequelae of herpes zoster. We report a new postzoster reaction, granulomatous vasculitis, that caused flat-topped papules restricted to the affected dermatome. Polymerase chain reaction failed to detect varicella-zoster virus in a biopsy specimen. These results suggest that granulomatous vasculitis occurs without persistence of the viral genome and, perhaps, is a reaction to minute amounts of viral proteins. 
The endocrine effects of long-term treatment with mifepristone (RU 486). Mifepristone (RU 486) is a compound with progesterone as well as cortisol-blocking activities. We investigated the endocrine effects of long-term therapy of 10 patients with meningiomas with 200 mg mifepristone daily for 1 yr. Most patients initially complained of nausea, vomiting, and/or tiredness. In four patients prednisone (7.5 mg/day) had to be given simultaneously in order to overcome these side-effects. In retrospect those patients who presented with the most severe side-effects showed the most rapidly occurring activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis, as measured by an increase of circulating cortisol levels as well as of urinary cortisol excretion. Therapy with RU 486 activated the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in a resetting of this system at a higher level at which the diurnal rhythm and the responsiveness to CRH stimulation were maintained, whereas the sensitivity to dexamethasone had diminished. Secondarily the production of androstenedione and estradiol increased considerably. These endocrine changes were caused by the induction of partial cortisol receptor resistance during therapy with RU 486. The compensatory overproduction of androgens and consequently of estrogens during long-term RU 486 therapy might limit its use as a single treatment in the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancer. 
Acute pandysautonomic neuropathy. Acute pandysautonomic neuropathy is characterized by severe postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction, with relative or complete sparing of motor and sensory function. Of four reported cases with sural nerve biopsies, two were normal and two abnormal, revealing loss of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. We present a patient with pandysautonomic neuropathy and elevated CSF protein whose sural nerve biopsy showed active axonal degeneration. 
A spectrum of bilateral squamous conjunctival tumors associated with human papillomavirus type 16. Three patients with bilateral tumors presenting as multiple keratinizing and verrucous lesions of the bulbar and tarsal conjunctiva were determined by DNA amplification and hybridization studies to harbor human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16). Results of biopsy in two patients showed infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma in one eye and dysplasia or carcinoma in situ in the fellow eye. In the third patient, focal, inflamed, hypertrophic, papillary lesions with pseudoglandular invaginations of the surface epithelium were found in the tarsal conjunctivae of both eyes. These are the first documented cases of bilateral conjunctival tumors associated with human papillomavirus. 
Exaggerated and prolonged thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) test responses in tertiary hypothyroidism. A 60 year old man with panhypopituitarism due to a large meningioma and prolonged and exaggerated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) responses is described. Initial investigations showed a subnormal urinary free cortisol concentration, a low serum cortisol taken at 0900 hours, and a low free T4 concentration. The TSH was towards the upper end of the normal range. Subsequently pituitary function tests showed subnormal production of luteinising hormone in response to luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) and a short synacthen test with a low 30 minute cortisol value. Long synacthen testing showed a normal response at four days, confirming that the abnormalities were due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause. A computed tomogram showed a large meningioma compressing the hypothalamus, pituitary, and temporal lobe. TRH testing showed a prolonged and exaggerated response, consistent with tertiary hypothyroidism. 
Treatment of antenatal myasthenia gravis. Maternal myasthenia gravis has been associated with the presence of neonatal myasthenia and sometimes fatal congenital anomalies. As a result, antenatal therapy directed at fetal sequelae may be indicated. We present the case of a pregnant myasthenic woman whose two previous pregnancies had ended in neonatal deaths from fetal deformations that were presumably due to maternal myasthenia. Serial plasmaphereses and oral prednisone therapy were used in an attempt to depress maternal anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody titers. As anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody titers fell, fetal breathing movements became apparent by ultrasound, and as these titers rose, no fetal breathing movements were apparent. Our patient delivered an infant with transient neonatal myasthenia but normal pulmonary development and no deformations. We suggest that the therapy given may have improved the outcome of this pregnancy compared with her two previous pregnancies. 
Gastrointestinal mucosal injury in experimental models of shock, trauma, and sepsis. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The mucosa of the GI tract serves as an important barrier limiting the systemic absorption of luminal microbes and microbial products. Two methods commonly used to assess the integrity of the GI mucosal barrier are assessment of the extent of microbial translocation and measurement of mucosal permeability to hydrophilic probes. RESULTS: Studies using these methods have provided convincing evidence that the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa is deranged in numerous animal models of shock, trauma, and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the mechanisms underlying mucosal injury under these circumstances remain incompletely understood, current evidence suggests that mucosal damage in shock, trauma, and sepsis is likely due to various combinations of intracellular hypoxia due to ischemia, tissue injury caused by reactive oxygen metabolites, the deleterious effects of various lipid mediators (e.g., platelet-activating factor) and/or cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor), and deficient utilization or supply of key nutritional substrates (e.g., glutamine). 
Pneumatic retinopexy. A two-year follow-up study of the multicenter clinical trial comparing pneumatic retinopexy with scleral buckling. The authors report 2-year follow-up information on 179 of 198 eyes (90%) enrolled in a previously published multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing pneumatic retinopexy (PR) with scleral buckling (SB) for the management of selected retinal detachments. Scleral buckling was compared with PR with regard to redetachment after the initial 6-month follow-up period (1% versus 1%), overall attachment (98% versus 99%), subsequent cataract surgery (18% versus 4%; P less than 0.05), preoperative visual acuity (no significant difference), and final visual acuity of 20/50 or better in eyes with macular detachment for a period of 14 days or less (67% versus 89%; P less than or equal to 0.05). Reoperations after a failed PR attempt did not adversely affect visual outcome. After 2 years, PR continues to compare favorably with SB. 
Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in surgical patients. Venous thromboembolic disease is a common, potentially life-threatening, but preventable complication of surgery. Venographic studies have shown a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis in patients who do not receive prophylaxis. The long-term sequelae of deep vein thrombosis in these patients can be disabling, but the exact prevalence of post-thrombotic complications has not been well documented. Fatal pulmonary embolism has been reported in 0.5% to 1% of patients after major abdominal surgery and in 2% to 6% after total hip replacement. Several methods of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism have demonstrated efficacy, but a surprising number of patients still do not receive prophylaxis. A medical record review in 16 hospitals recently disclosed that only 32% of high-risk patients received prophylaxis, with a range from 9% in a community hospital to 56% in a major teaching hospital. The possible reasons for this comparatively low rate of utilization are discussed. Current issues and future trends in the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism are briefly summarized. 
Certified cause of death in children and young adults with cerebral palsy. The status of 732 children suffering from cerebral palsy from the South East Thames region (births from 1970-9) was ascertained at the end of 1989, and copies of death certificates of the 73 children who have died, aged 4 weeks to nearly 16 years, were obtained. Infantile cerebral palsy (ICD Code 343-) was coded as the underlying cause of death in only 16 (22%) cases. On 28 (38%) certificates there was no mention of any form of cerebral palsy, the proportion in which it was not mentioned increasing with age. In 20 (28%) cases the coded underlying cause of death was respiratory, hence in published national statistics the number of deaths from respiratory causes is inflated. A postmortem examination was known to have been performed in 23 cases, but the recorded information was in some cases limited to a 'terminal event'. The importance of good data on the death certificate, and the significance of published national statistics, need to be communicated to all those involved in the certification process if cerebral palsy and other chronic conditions, which raise the relative risk of death, are not to be under-represented. 
Repair of aortic coarctation in infants. Fifty-three consecutive infants younger than 2 years underwent coarctation repair. A recoarctation occurred in 11 infants (21%). To determine variables associated with recoarctation, we entered preoperative and operative data into a multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. Patient weight was an incremental risk factor for recoarctation instead of age, in contrast to previously published studies. Furthermore, the residual gradient after the operation was a strong incremental risk factor. This risk factor was even more significant when expressed as a ratio of the systolic arm pressure, which takes background hemodynamics into account. Because weight is a more significant risk factor than age, we conclude that deferring operation is indicated only when the infant gains weight. Furthermore, a residual gradient is more important in the hemodynamic setting of a lower systolic arm pressure. 
Dose response characteristics of hypertonic saline dextran solutions. In an effort to find the best hypertonic saline-dextran solution (HSD) for prehospital use, 33 chronically catheterized sheep were bled using a fixed pressure shock model (50 mm Hg x 2 hours) and resuscitated with 4 ml/kg of HSD solution (2-minute bolus). In the first set of experiments colloid was varied and sodium chloride was held constant, as 7.5% NaCl was paired with either 0%, 6%, or 12% dextran 70. A dose-response relationship existed, with cardiac output increasing 20% with each sequential dextran 70 concentration. Mean arterial blood pressure was higher in animals that were resuscitated with either the 7.5% NaCl/6% dextran 70 or 7.5% NaCl/12% dextran 70 solution (p less than 0.05). Using the optimal dextran 70 concentration from the first set of experiments (i.e., 12%), solute was varied in a second set of experiments comparing 0.9%, 3.8%, 7.5%, or 10% NaCl/12% dextran 70. Again, dose-response features were demonstrated, as cardiac output increased as a function of NaCl concentration. However, this response plateaued with the 7.5% NaCl concentration and no advantage was obtained by increasing the NaCl concentration to 10%. We conclude that a 4-ml/kg bolus of 7.5% NaCl/12% dextran 70 solution may be a more effective form of therapy than those previously evaluated. This new solution is now being included in our ongoing clinical trials. 
Diminishment of respiratory sinus arrhythmia foreshadows doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND. The development of a microcomputer-based device permits quick, simple, and noninvasive quantification of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during quiet breathing. METHODS AND RESULTS. We prospectively and serially measured the radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction and the RSA amplitude in 34 cancer patients receiving up to nine monthly bolus treatments with doxorubicin hydrochloride (60 mg/m2). Of the eight patients who ultimately developed symptomatic doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure, seven (87.5%) demonstrated a significant decline in RSA amplitude; five of 26 subjects without clinical symptoms of cardiotoxicity (19.2%) showed a similar RSA amplitude decline. On average, significant RSA amplitude decline occurred 3 months before the last planned doxorubicin dose in patients destined to develop clinical congestive heart failure. CONCLUSION. Overall, RSA amplitude abnormality proved to be a more specific predictor of clinically significant congestive heart failure than did serial resting radionuclide ejection fractions. 
Plasma endothelin in coronary venous blood from patients with either stable or unstable angina. STUDY OBJECTIVE--To test the hypothesis that the active coronary endothelial lesions in unstable angina raise the endothelin concentration in coronary venous blood. DESIGN--Systemic and coronary venous blood samples were obtained from unselected patients with the clinical syndromes of either stable or unstable angina at the time of cardiac catheterisation and coronary arteriography. Control venous blood samples were obtained from healthy laboratory workers and from patients with chronic renal failure treated by intermittent haemodialysis. PATIENTS--Twelve patients with angina: seven with stable symptoms and five with unstable angina. RESULTS--The mean coronary venous endothelin concentration in unstable angina was 2.32 ng/l (range 1.7-3.2 ng/l). In stable angina it was 2.77 ng/l (range 2.1-4.4 ng/l). These values were not significantly different from one another nor from the values obtained in systemic venous blood from either group or from the healthy controls. Circulating endothelin concentrations were much higher in venous blood from the patients treated by haemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS--These data do not support the hypothesis that raised endothelin concentrations in coronary blood in patients with unstable angina may modulate variations in coronary arterial tone thereby contributing to the clinical syndrome of chest pain and electrocardiographic changes at rest. The raised endothelin concentrations seen in systemic venous blood after myocardial infarction may be part of the systemic response to myocardial infarction. 
Effects of an increase in intracellular free [Mg2+] after myocardial stunning on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport. BACKGROUND. Myocardial stunning has been associated with a greater than twofold increase in intracellular free [Mg2+] from 0.6 to 1.5 mM. The effect of this increase in free [Mg2+] on the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ pump was assessed in SR isolated from Langendorff perfused, isovolumic rabbit hearts after 15 minutes of global ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS. Our results indicate that myocardial stunning results in a shift in the Ca2+ sensitivity of oxalate-supported, Ca2+ transport over the entire range of free [Ca2+] associated with the cardiac cycle. Using 0.6 mM free Mg2+ as control, maximal rates of Ca2+ transport occurred at 1 microM free Ca2+ (control, 519 +/- 32; stunned, 337 +/- 37 nmol Ca2+.min-1.mg-1). At 0.56 microM free Ca2+, SR Ca2+ transport was reduced from a control of 351 +/- 49 to 263 +/- 12 nmol Ca2+.min-1.mg-1 at 0.6 mM free [Mg2+]. Moreover, an increase in the free [Mg2+] from 0.6 to 1.5 mM results in a greater shift in the Ca2+ activation curve with no change in the level of maximal activation. Ca2+ transport at 0.56 microM free Ca2+ was shifted in the stunned SR from 263 +/- 12 to 138 +/- 29 nmol Ca2+.min-1.mg-1 at 0.6 and 1.5 mM free Mg2+, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that an increase in free [Mg2+] after stunning in combination with the inherent defect in the SR Ca2+ ATPase may reduce the ability of the cell to regulate Ca2+ to a greater extent than previously observed. This impairment in Ca2+ regulatory function may contribute directly to the increase in diastolic tone and indirectly to the reduced systolic function characteristic of the stunned myocardium. 
Sarcomas of soft tissue and bone. Sarcomas arise primarily from mesenchymal structures at any site in the body, even within visceral stroma and neurovascular bundles. Sarcomas have been associated with prior radiation therapy, toxic exposures, and genetic conditions and soft tissue sarcomas have been distinguished from bone sarcomas. For localized soft tissue sarcoma, tumor grade is the most important prognostic variable. Low-grade tumors are generally cured by wide surgical excision, but there is a significant rate of both local recurrence and development of distant metastasis in high-grade lesions. The treatment of soft tissue sarcoma histologic subtypes is generally similar grade-for-grade, with the exception of rhabomyosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and mesothelioma. Tumor location strongly influences resectability. Radiation therapy has been used successfully in conjunction with conservative surgery to improve local control rates for soft tissue sarcomas, particularly in extremity lesions. Currently, adjuvant chemotherapy remains unproven for most adult soft tissue sarcomas, but is established in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcomas, osteosarcomas, and Ewing's sarcomas. 
Otolaryngologic aspects of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a systemic illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by the bite of a tick in the Ixodes ricinus complex. While the illness is often associated with a characteristic rash, erythema migrans, patients may also present with a variety of complaints in the absence of the rash. The otolaryngologist may be called upon to see both groups of patients, with any number of signs and symptoms referable to the head and neck, including headache, neck pain, odynophagia, cranial nerve palsy, head and neck dysesthesia, otalgia, tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, temporomandibular pain, lymphadenopathy, and dysgeusia. We review our institutional experience with 266 patients with Lyme disease, 75% of whom experienced head and neck symptoms. We also summarize the diagnostic and treatment modalities for this illness. 
Duplex Doppler sonography of the carotid artery: false-positive results in an artery contralateral to an artery with marked stenosis. Anecdotal reports have described a false-positive "jet effect" or velocity increase in the carotid artery contralateral to an artery with significant stenosis or occlusion when using duplex Doppler sonography. In this study, the frequency, significance, and possible reasons for this finding were evaluated by a retrospective comparison of duplex sonography and angiography. Twenty-three patients with unilateral 81-100% carotid artery stenosis who underwent both duplex sonography (16 Acuson, seven Quantum) and angiography were evaluated. In 14 patients, there was an accurate or slight underestimate (less than 20%) of stenosis present in the internal carotid artery contralateral to an artery with tight stenosis/occlusion. In nine, a velocity increase in the internal carotid artery resulted in overestimation (10-80%) of the actual degree of stenosis. In one of these nine patients, real-time images were sufficient to explain the velocity increase on the basis of vessel tortuosity. In one, falsely elevated velocity resulted from inaccurate assignment of the Doppler angle of incidence in a patient in whom real-time visualization of a distal internal carotid lesion was poor. In four of the nine patients, cross filling via the circle of Willis toward the side of greater stenosis occurred. However, seven of 14 patients in whom there was duplex sonography/angiography agreement or slight duplex sonography underestimation also had cross filling. Vertebral artery patency did not correlate well with the presence of a "jet effect." These findings suggest that an increase in blood flow velocity with duplex Doppler sonography in the internal carotid artery on the side opposite an artery with a tight stenosis is a common source of error and is not readily explained by angiographic evidence of collateral flow. 
Influence of isradipine on the maternal and fetal cardiovascular system in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. Nine pregnant women (aged 28.7 +/- 6.9 years) who had developed hypertension (blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg) took part in an open pilot study with the new calcium antagonist isradipine. Dosage was started with 1.25 mg twice daily and was increased weekly to 2.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily until a diastolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 80 mm Hg was achieved. By the time of the last visit before term, blood pressure was significantly reduced to 129/79 mm Hg and heart rate had not altered. External cardiotocography indicated fetal well-being throughout the entire study. Doppler flow measurements showed no deterioration in A:B ratio, resistance index, and pulsatile index. All measurements in the newborn were within normal ranges. In conclusion, isradipine is a safe and effective drug for pregnant women and their fetuses in the management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. 
Abdominal CT findings after liver transplantation in 66 patients. CT scanning is used frequently to assess the condition of patients after liver transplantation. The CT records of 174 adult patients who underwent liver transplantation were studied retrospectively to determine the number and timing of CT studies as well as the frequency and significance of the findings. One-hundred seventy CT scans were obtained in 66 (38%) of the 174 patients, with a mean of 2.6 scans/patient. The interval between transplantation and scanning was 1 day to 24 months; in 59 (89%) of 66 patients, the first CT scan was obtained within 30 days. The acute indications for CT scanning were fever or leukocytosis in 54 (92%) of 59 patients and abnormal liver function tests in five (8%) of 59 patients. CT scans obtained more than 30 days after transplantation were repeat scans in all but seven patients. Indications in this latter group were the same as for the acute group, plus evaluation of hepatic neoplasia in three patients. CT findings included periportal low attenuation in 41 (62%) of 66 patients; ascites in 25 (38%); splenomegaly in 19 (29%); loculated intraperitoneal noninfected fluid collections in 13 (20%); intrahepatic, splenic, pancreatic, or perihepatic abscesses in seven (11%); hepatic infarction in six (9%); splenic infarction in three (4%); and hepatic calcification in two (3%). Other major abnormalities included inferior vena caval thrombosis (one patient), pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery with rupture (one patient), and recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (one patient). CT scanning after liver transplantation is used predominantly in the acute setting to evaluate for liver infarction or intraabdominal abscess. In this setting, CT showed these abnormalities, in addition to tumor recurrence or vascular abnormalities, in 15 (23%) of 66 patients. 
Protein-tyrosine-phosphatase CD45 is phosphorylated transiently on tyrosine upon activation of Jurkat T cells. The leukocyte common antigen (CD45) is an abundant lymphocyte surface antigen that has been reported to be involved in signaling through the T-cell antigen receptor. CD45 is a transmembrane protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. An internal segment comprises two domains each of which is homologous to other protein-tyrosine-phosphatases; the extracellular segment has the hallmarks of a ligand-binding motif. Since tyrosine phosphorylation is an early signal resulting from stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor and CD45 is required for proper activation through the receptor, we explored whether CD45 might be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Treatment of a T-cell leukemia line (Jurkat) with either phytohemagglutinin or anti-CD3 antibodies induced phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD45; treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not. Phosphorylation of CD45 was transient, disappearing within 40 min after phytohemagglutinin treatment. The requirement for stringent conditions of phosphatase inhibition suggests that CD45 is capable of autodephosphorylation in vivo. These observations support recent reports indicating CD45 is involved in an early step in the T-cell activation cascade. They also suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD45 should be explored further as a possible regulatory mechanism. 
Headache in the use and withdrawal of opiates and other associated substances of abuse. The incidence and character of headache were retrospectively studied in 40 opiate addicts and 40 control subjects. The relationships between headache and use and withdrawal of opiates or other associated substances of abuse were investigated. In the opiate-dependent patients, the effects of opiate intake and withdrawal on headache were also investigated during detoxification treatment. A higher (p less than 0.001) incidence of headache was found in the opiate addicts (60%), particularly those with a longer history of addiction, than in the control subjects. A history of different types of headache (tension type headache, migraine-like headaches), which seemed respectively to be associated with the use of certain types of heroin, cocaine intake, and opiate withdrawal, was reported by the addicts who suffered from headache. Out of the 24 patients who completed the detoxification therapy, a migraine-like headache occurred in 37.5% of the subjects after opiate withdrawal. 
Treatment of ulcerated hemangiomas with the pulsed tunable dye laser. Hemangiomas are the most common tumor of infancy and are characterized by rapid growth during the first 6 months of life. During the rapid growth phase, approximately 5% to 10% of the hemangiomas ulcerate. Ulcerated lesions are painful, may bleed, and are at risk for bacterial infection. Previous therapy has included daily local wound care, topical antibiotics, and local and systemic steroids. We treated nine infants (eight female and one male) with ulcerated hemangiomas by means of a vascular-specific (585-nm) pulsed (450-microsecond) tunable dye laser. Eight of the nine patients had a single ulceration, whereas one patient had two ulcerations within a large hemangioma. Six of the ulcerations healed with a single laser treatment. One ulceration required two treatments to heal, and the remaining two required three treatments. Pain was subjectively decreased within 2 to 3 days in all patients after a single treatment. The pulsed tunable dye laser should be considered in the treatment of all ulcerated hemangiomas. 
Pathophysiology of myocardial perfusion in hypertension. Chronic and acute hypertension have multiple untoward effects on the coronary circulation, several of which may either mimic or markedly worsen the clinical manifestations of coronary artery disease. Early after the onset of left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to hypertension, coronary vasodilator reserve is significantly impaired. During cardiac hypertrophy secondary to hypertension, the coronary arteries fail to enlarge in concert with ventricular enlargement. This failure results in a relative decrease by approximately 50% in the ratio of epicardial vessel diameter to the mass of myocardium perfused. The lower range of coronary subendocardial autoregulation is altered by chronic renovascular hypertension. A variety of vascular smooth muscle homeostatic mechanisms are abnormal in genetic models of hypertension, as is endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation. Acute hypertension may enhance constriction to serotonin, most likely through the release of potent vasoconstrictor substances from leukocytes and platelets that adhere to the endothelium as a result of endothelial damage. Finally, many of the consequences of myocardial infarction are worsened in the setting of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Kistrin, a polypeptide platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, enhances and sustains coronary arterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in a canine preparation BACKGROUND. Kistrin is a 68-amino acid polypeptide from the venom of the Malayan pit viper Agkistrodon rhodostoma, which inhibits the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor. Its effect on thrombolysis, reocclusion, and bleeding associated with administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was studied in a canine model of coronary artery thrombosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Coronary patency was monitored for 2 hours by ultrasonic flow probe and repeated coronary angiography. The rt-PA was given as 0.45-mg/kg bolus injections at 15-minute intervals until recanalization or to a maximum of four boluses. Four groups of four or five dogs were studied: a control group that received intravenous heparin (4,000-unit bolus and 1,000 units each hour) and three groups that received heparin and 0.48, 0.24, or 0.12 mg/kg kistrin, administered as a 10% bolus injection and an infusion during a 60-minute period. In the control group, reflow occurred in four of five dogs within 37 +/- 47 minutes but was followed by cyclic reflow and reocclusion. Kistrin at a dose of 0.48 and 0.24 mg/kg reduced the time to reflow to 6 +/- 5 and 10 +/- 3 minutes, respectively, and abolished reocclusion. With 0.12 mg/kg kistrin, reflow occurred in all four animals, within 27 +/- 23 minutes, and reocclusion occurred in two animals. Kistrin induced a dose-related prolongation of the template bleeding time: with 0.48 mg/kg kistrin, the bleeding time was prolonged from 3.8 +/- 1.3 minutes before infusion to 29 +/- 2 minutes during infusion, but it was shortened to 8.3 +/- 2.6 minutes at 90 minutes after the end of infusion. Kistrin also caused a dose-related inhibition of platelet aggregation with ADP and collagen: with 0.48 mg/kg kistrin, platelet aggregation was abolished during the infusion but had partially recovered toward the end of the observation period. Pathological examination of recanalized coronary arterial segments of dogs given 0.48 or 0.24 mg/kg kistrin revealed widely patent arteries with some platelets layered on the damaged intimal surface. CONCLUSIONS. Kistrin increases the rate and extent of thrombolysis with a reduced dose of rt-PA, and it prevents reocclusion. At an effective dose, it is associated with a transient prolongation of the bleeding time and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Kistrin may offer promise as adjunctive treatment to thrombolytic agents in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 
Massive hemorrhage from a ruptured enteric varices of an augmented bladder. Intestinal varices are uncommon and usually occur secondary to portal hypertension. We report a case of variceal rupture in the intestinal segment of an augmentation colocystoplasty. The patient presented in shock from exsanguinating hemorrhage per urethram, and diagnosis was established at laparotomy. Although the bleeding was controlled with excision of the involved intestinal segment, the patient died of multiple organ failure. The diagnosis and treatment of this rare but fatal condition are discussed. 
Intracerebral temperature in neurosurgical patients. Recent laboratory results have indicated that the ischemic brain is very sensitive to minor variations in temperature. This has created new interest in hypothermia and brain temperature. There is, however, very little information available regarding human intracerebral temperature and its relation to body core temperature during normal and pathological circumstances. We therefore made continuous measurements of the temperature of the lateral ventricle in 15 neurosurgical patients utilizing a newly developed technique with copper-constantan thermocouples introduced through a plastic catheter also used for monitoring intracranial pressure. The intraventricular temperature was higher than the rectal temperature during approximately 90% of all measurements. The largest temperature gradient measured was 2.3 degrees C. Usually the difference between the temperature of the rectum and the brain was much smaller, the mean value being 0.33 degrees C. For the patients in the most severe condition, the rectal temperature was sufficiently close to the brain temperature to afford a reliable basis for adequate clinical judgment. 
Complications of the Heitz-Boyer urinary diversion: case report of late development of malignancy. We report on 3 patients with bladder exstrophy followed for more than 15 years after having undergone Heitz-Boyer urinary diversion. One patient had adenocarcinoma at the ureterocolonic anastomoses 16 years after diversion. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a malignancy developing after a Heitz-Boyer procedure. The other 2 patients had significant problems with urinary incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infections. Initial success with this form of urinary diversion can be followed by significant long-term complications. 
Clear cell squamous cell carcinoma. A histologic, immunohistologic, and ultrastructural study. Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) usually show a standard histopathologic picture only varying with regard to their degree of differentiation. The authors describe a case of clear cell SCC that was studied by light and electron microscopy. The clear cells showed an empty cytoplasm that was periodic acid-Schiff and alcian blue negative. By electron microscopy these cytoplasms consisted of empty spaces and were not surrounded by membranes, which would be consistent with lipid vacuoles. The differential diagnosis of this uncommon variant of SCC requires consideration of other clear cell tumors. 
Phrenic neural output during hypoxia in dogs: constant-flow ventilation vs. spontaneous breathing. We studied the effects of removing cyclic pulmonary afferent neural information on respiratory pattern generation in anesthetized dogs. Phrenic neural output during spontaneous breathing (SB) was compared with that occurring during constant-flow ventilation (CFV) at several levels of eucapnic hypoxemia. Hypoxia caused an increase in both the frequency and the amplitude of the moving time average (MTA) phrenic neurogram during both SB and CFV. The change in frequency as arterial saturation was reduced from 90 to 60% during SB was significantly higher than that during CFV [SB, 32.3 +/- 10.9 (SD) breaths/min; CFV, 10.3 +/- 5.8 breaths/min; P = 0.001]. By contrast, the increase in the amplitude of the MTA phrenic neurogram was smaller (SB, 0.62 +/- 0.68 units; CFV, 1.35 +/- 0.81 units; P = 0.01). The changes in frequency with hypoxia during both modes of ventilation resulted primarily from a shortening of expiratory time. Both inspiratory time and expiratory time were greater during CFV than during SB, but their change in response to hypoxia was not significantly different. We conclude that the amplitude response of the MTA phrenic neurogram to hypoxia is similar to that seen during hypercapnia; in the presence of phasic afferent feedback the MTA amplitude response is decreased and the frequency response is increased relative to the response observed in the absence of phasic afferents. 
Captopril improves neurologic outcome from incomplete cerebral ischemia in rats. We investigated the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on neurologic outcome in a rat model of incomplete cerebral ischemia. Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen and fentanyl (10 micrograms x kg-1 i.v. bolus, 25 micrograms x kg-1 x hr-1 i.v. continuous infusion). Animals in group 1 (n = 10) received no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor while animals in group 2 (n = 10) were given 10 mg x kg-1 i.v. captopril 30 minutes prior to the ischemic period. Ischemia was produced by unilateral carotid artery ligation and hemorrhagic hypotension to 35 mm Hg for 30 minutes. Body temperature, arterial blood gases, and arterial pH were maintained constant. Neurologic outcome was evaluated every 24 hours for 3 days using a graded deficit score (0, normal; 18, stroke-related death). On the third day after ischemia, captopril significantly improved neurologic outcome (median deficit score = 4) compared with controls (median deficit score = 18) (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that reduced angiotensin II levels or increased tissue kinin concentrations may decrease ischemic brain injury. 
Ability of high-intensity ultrasound to ablate human atherosclerotic plaques and minimize debris size. To investigate whether high-intensity ultrasound can destroy atherosclerotic plaques while sparing the normal arterial wall, 279 normal human aortic sites and 119 fibrous and 193 calcified plaques, obtained from 24 necropsies, were insonified in a water tank, at 20 kHz and at 5 different power intensities, ranging from 68 W/cm2 (P1) to 150 W/cm2 (P5). These intensities were associated with a total excursion of the ultrasound irradiation apparatus tip from 90 to 268 microns, respectively. Time to perforate normal aortic sites and fibrous and calcified plaques was recorded at each intensity. There was no difference in perforation time between normal aortic sites and fibrous and calcified plaques when high-power levels (P2 to P5) were used. However, at the lowest power (P1), perforation time for the normal aortic wall was significantly longer than for fibrous and calcified plaques: 30 +/- 18 seconds (166 observations), 14 +/- 7 seconds (p less than 0.001) (78 observations) and 12 +/- 8 seconds (p less than 0.001) (115 observations), respectively. When perforation times for normal vessel wall versus fibrous plaque and normal vessel wall versus calcified plaque from the same necropsy specimen were compared in a pairwise manner, the results were: 29 +/- 13 vs 16 +/- 7 (p less than 0.001) (48 paired observations) and 26 +/- 9 vs 10 +/- 5 seconds (p less than 0.001) (55 paired observations), respectively. Regardless of whether paired or unpaired comparison was applied, no significant difference was found in perforation time between fibrous and calcified plaques. The debris did not differ in size as measured separately for normal sites and fibrous and calcified plaques by a computer-interfaced Channelizer and Coulter Counter system. 
The effect of radiation therapy on the fixation strength of an experimental porous-coated implant in dogs. Radiation therapy prevents heterotopic ossification after cemented total hip arthroplasty, but its effect on the fixation of porous-coated devices is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of irradiation on the pullout strength of a porous implant in the canine model. A custom-designed titanium fiber metal-coated cylinder was implanted into the distal femurs of 12 dogs. One femur of each dog was irradiated with 10 Gy, given in four 2.5-Gy daily fractions beginning one day after surgery. Serial bone scans were performed at one, two, four, and six weeks postoperatively. At six weeks, the femurs were harvested, and eight were randomly selected for mechanical testing. Scintigraphic evaluation showed a significant reduction in uptake at one and two weeks in the irradiated limb, but this had returned to normal at four and six weeks. The failure to pullout was significantly less in the irradiated limb compared with the control limb six weeks postoperatively. In this canine model, the pullout strength of the titanium fiber implant was significantly reduced by a dose of radiation commonly used in the prevention of heterotopic ossification. If irradiation is chosen for prophylaxis, either the porous implant should be adequately shielded or a cemented implant should be utilized. 
Disability, residential mobility, and changes in living arrangements. The extent of mobility and changes in living arrangements associated with disability were studied using data from the 1984-86 Longitudinal Study of Aging. It was hypothesized that persons with significant limitations in their ability to perform normal daily activities (ADLs and IADLs) in 1984 would be more likely to move, more likely to be living with others in 1986, and more likely to have entered an institution between 1984 and 1986 than those without limitations. When only those variables that were measured in 1984 were used as predictors, this turned out to be true for institutionalization and for living with others in 1986. However, among those remaining in households, residential mobility showed little relationship to disability when other variables were controlled. When the change in disability between 1984 and 1986 was added to the prediction equation, there were strong relationships between changes in disability and both residential mobility and adjustment in living arrangement, suggesting that people respond quickly to significant changes in disability. However, because we cannot be sure that the changes in disability preceded the mobility or changes in living arrangements, we cannot claim to have established a causal link between these events. 
Change in the expression of a nuclear matrix-associated protein is correlated with cellular transformation. We have identified a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a nuclear matrix-associated protein in NIH 3T3 cells. The immunofluorescence pattern consists predominantly of bright nuclear granule clusters distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, with the exclusion of nucleoli. It recognizes a protein of 190 kDa that is down-regulated to various degrees in a panel of single-oncogene-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Its localization is similar, but not identical, to the spliceosomal speckles. p190 shows a coordinate expression during the growth cycle of nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells; it is synthesized at the highest level under growth arrest conditions. It is expressed in adult mouse brain and is also present in human IMR-90 fibroblasts. 
Small, deep pelvic abscesses: definition and drainage guided with an endovaginal probe. Four small, deep pelvic abscesses were easily drained transvaginally by using an endovaginal transducer for guidance, support, and continuous monitoring of catheter placement. Collections that could not be drained percutaneously or at surgery were effectively managed with this technique. An inexpensive guide (estimated cost, $1.65) facilitated control of the catheter. All four abscesses resolved without further intervention. 
Exercise thallium-201 perfusion scintigraphy in the assessment of coronary artery disease. Exercise thallium-201 perfusion scintigraphy has been used extensively over the last decade for the detection and localization of coronary artery disease. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a refinement of presently available techniques, offering improved identification over planar imaging of individual vessel stenosis and quantification of the extent of abnormally perfused myocardium. In this review, the planar and SPECT techniques are discussed in light of the most recently published large patient series, and with regard to the many factors that affect the sensitivity and specificity of perfusion imaging in identifying coronary artery disease. The clinical implications of exercise perfusion scintigraphy and its future applications in cardiology practice are discussed. 
Obstructive sleep apnea complicating negative-pressure ventilatory support in patients with chronic paralytic/restrictive ventilatory dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and severity of obstructive events and oxyhemoglobin desaturation (dSaO2) in 37 patients with paralytic/restrictive ventilatory insufficiency during use of nocturnal ventilatory assistance provided by means of negative-pressure body ventilators (BVs). Thirteen of the 37 patients had mean oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) less than 95 percent and a mean of ten or more episodes per hour when the dSaO2 was greater than or equal to 4 percent (4%dSaO2/h). In all, 26 of the 37 patients had evidence of significant multiple episodes of dSaO2 while asleep on BVs. Polysomnography performed on three of these patients substantiated the obstructive nature of the dSaO2. Twenty-two of the 37 patients who had a mean SaO2 of 90.6 +/- 7.2 percent and a mean of 17.7 +/- 16.1 4%dSaO2/h on BVs were switched to noninvasive ventilatory assistance by intermittent positive airway pressure (NV-PAP). Their mean SaO2 improved to 96.0 +/- 2.2 percent, and the 4%dSaO2/h decreased to 1.2 +/- 1.8 per hour. All symptoms similar to those of obstructive sleep apnea were relieved. We conclude that BV use is associated with significant dSaO2 in over 50 percent of patients. The dSaO2 is predominantly obstructive in nature but may be due to chronic underventilation in patients using less effective BVs. Patients with a mean SaO2 less than 95 percent or 10 or more 4%dSaO2/h may benefit from conversion to NV-PAP via the nose, the mouth, or an oral-nasal interface. 
Intrahepatic hematoma: a rare complication of exchange transfusion. A four-day-old male neonate who underwent three exchange transfusions for jaundice owing to ABO incompatibility on three consecutive days is presented. A large intrahepatic hematoma developed as a complication of the third exchange transfusion. The baby fully recovered. 
Partial motor epilepsy with "negative myoclonus". Three children had both nocturnal unilateral motor seizures and daytime ipsilateral "negative myoclonus" which occurred so frequently that it resembled asterixis. Neurophysiologic studies demonstrated lateralized spike discharges that were time-locked to postural lapse in the contralateral outstretched arm. The clinical course was characterized by good seizure control with benzodiazepines. 
Treatment of acute migraine with subcutaneous sumatriptan. Sumatriptan succinate, a 5-HT1D receptor agonist, constricts human cranial arteries. Two parallel-group trials for treatment of acute migraines were conducted in the United States. Adult patients were randomized and given either 6 mg of sumatriptan succinate subcutaneously (n = 734) or placebo (n = 370). At 1 hour, sumatriptan was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing moderate or severe headache pain to mild or no pain (70% vs 22%), in completely relieving headaches (49% vs 9%), and in improving clinical disability (76% vs 34%). Sumatriptan also reduced nausea and photophobia significantly better than placebo. Patients with residual migraines received another injection; those who had originally received sumatriptan received either a second active injection (n = 187) or placebo (n = 178), while those who had received placebo received a second placebo injection (n = 335). Statistical evidence for benefit of second sumatriptan injection is absent. Adverse events associated with sumatriptan were tingling, dizziness, warm-hot sensations, and injection-site reactions. Sumatriptan is effective and well tolerated in patients with acute migraine. 
Deletion of sequences upstream of the proteinase improves the proteolytic processing of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expresses structural proteins and replicative enzymes within gag and gag-pol precursor polyproteins. Specific proteolytic processing of the precursors by the viral proteinase is essential for maturation of infectious viral particles. We have studied the activity of proteinase in its immature form, as part of a gag-pol fusion protein, in an in vitro expression system. We found that deletion of p6*, the region in pol upstream of proteinase, resulted in improved processing of the precursor. A modified proteinase is released, but it functions less efficiently than wild type. Improved autoprocessing correlates with increased accessibility of the active site region in the polyprotein carrying the p6* deletion. Our results suggest that p6* is involved in the regulation of proteinase activation, perhaps as a region limiting the interaction of the active site and substrate binding domain with the remainder of the polyprotein. Release of p6* inhibition may be an activation step necessary for infectious particle maturation. 
Dipyridamole echocardiography stress testing in hypertensive patients. Targets and tools. Arterial hypertension can provoke a reduction in coronary flow reserve through several mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive, namely, coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and microvascular disease. These different targets of arterial hypertension should be explored with different diagnostic markers. The transient dyssynergy detected by two-dimensional echocardiography and evoked during dipyridamole infusion is a marker of coronary disease that is equally reliable in normotensive and hypertensive individuals. On the contrary, dipyridamole-induced ST segment depression is frequently elicited in hypertensive patients when angiographically assessed coronary disease is absent. This ischemiclike electrocardiographic response can be found in echocardiographically assessed left ventricular hypertrophy. However, even when left ventricular mass is normal, dipyridamole-induced ST segment depression is associated with an impaired coronary flow response to pacing, which is consistent with microvascular disease. Whether echocardiographically silent electrocardiographic changes are simply diagnostic noises transmitting a misleading false positive response or a potentially important clinical marker of early myocardial damage remains a pivotal though still unanswered question. 
Response characteristics of a dual transcutaneous oxygen/carbon dioxide monitoring system. We tested the response characteristics of a dual transcutaneous (tc) PO2/PCO2 monitoring system in healthy subjects who breathed various gas mixtures, and we compared steady-state tc readings to simultaneous arterial blood gas analysis in 20 stable respiratory outpatients. The electrodes were simple to apply, required very little skin preparation, and had trivial signal drift. In healthy subjects, tcPCO2 lag time during CO2 rebreathing was 16.8 seconds, with a 90 percent response time of 77.9 seconds after CO2 breathing was discontinued. The 90 percent response times of the O2 electrode when subjects breathed a hypoxic mixture was 257 seconds after a lag of 31 seconds. When inhaled gas mixtures were changed from hypoxia to room air, the lag time was shorter (12.5 seconds), but 90 percent response time exceeded 5 minutes. In stable patients with respiratory disease, tcPCO2 and tcPO2 were linearly related to PaCO2 (range, 19 to 53 mm Hg) and PaO2 (range, 45 to 99 mm Hg), respectively (tcPCO2 = 1.4 PaCO2-9.44, with r = 0.90 and SEE = 5.35 mm Hg; tcPO2 = 0.56 PaO2 + 20.4, with r = 0.53 and SEE = 11.7 mm Hg). We conclude that the response of the dual transcutaneous monitoring system is more rapid for the CO2 than the O2 electrode and may be rapid enough to be useful in some clinical settings; however, the O2 system fails to offer the response characteristics and accuracy that would allow it to be substituted for arterial gas tensions in unstable clinical situations. 
Risk factors for stroke as predictors of platelet membrane fluidity in Alzheimer's disease. We have previously reported that increased platelet membrane fluidity identifies a subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who have distinct clinical features including an earlier age of symptomatic onset, a more rapidly progressive cognitive decline, and a decreased prevalence of focal electroencephalographic findings. In the current study, these patients also exhibited a decreased prevalence of risk factors for stroke compared with patients who had normal platelet membrane fluidity. Our findings suggest that the platelet membrane abnormality describes a clinical subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who are less likely to have coexisting cerebrovascular disease than the remaining patients who meet clinical consensus criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease. 
Enhancement of mammary carcinogenesis by high levels of dietary fat: a phenomenon dependent on ad libitum feeding Female 55-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a single intravenous dose of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), 2 mg/100 g of body weight each. At 60 days of age, the rats were divided into four dietary groups (41-42 rats/group):I, 5% corn oil diet fed ad libitum; II, 20% corn oil diet fed ad libitum; III, 5% corn oil diet fed 12% less than group I; and IV, 20% corn oil diet fed 12% less than group II. The 5% and 20% corn oil diets were purified semisynthetic diets that were isonutrient on a caloric basis. All animals were housed individually in single cages; food consumption of each animal was computed daily throughout the study. Sixteen weeks after carcinogen treatment, mean numbers of mammary carcinomas per rat (+/- SE) in groups I, II, III, and IV were 4.1 +/- 0.6, 6.8 +/- 0.7, 3.0 +/- 0.3, and 4.1 +/- 0.5, respectively. Mean weight of mammary carcinomas per rat (g +/- SE) in groups I, II, III, and IV were 3.5 +/- 0.7, 8.0 +/- 1.3, 3.0 +/- 1.1, and 4.6 +/- 1.3, respectively. Mammary carcinoma number and weight were significantly (P less than .01) increased in the animals fed the 20% corn oil diet ad libitum when compared with those fed the 5% corn oil diet ad libitum; however, no significant differences in mammary tumor number or weight were observed between the animals fed a restricted, 20% corn oil diet and those fed a restricted, 5% corn oil diet. The study involving the animals fed the 12%-restricted diets was repeated (38-42 rats/group), with virtually identical results, i.e., the mean number of mammary carcinomas per rat in the groups fed the restricted 5% fat and 20% fat diets at termination of the study was 3.1 +/- 0.4 and 3.7 +/- 0.3, respectively, and the mean weight (g) of mammary carcinomas per rat was 4.3 +/- 1.2 and 4.0 +/- 1.1, respectively (no significant differences). Thus, high levels of dietary fat can significantly enhance mammary carcinogenesis in female rats, but only in animals on an ad libitum feeding protocol. A slight restriction in amount consumed (12% less than ad libitum) abolished the mammary carcinogenic differential between a high-fat and a low-fat diet. 
Recombinant interferon alfa given before and in combination with standard chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first marrow relapse: a Pediatric Oncology Group pilot study. Recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN-alpha) was given to 31 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first on-therapy marrow relapse as the sole treatment (30 megaunits/m2/d intravenously x 10 days) before standard four-drug reinduction and during multiagent continuation therapy (30 megaunits/m2 subcutaneously x 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks). After 10 days of rIFN-alpha, there were two partial remissions (PRs); seven additional patients had either greater than or equal to 25% reduction in the percentage of marrow blast cells or hypoplastic marrow. Two patients had progressive disease with an increase in leukocyte counts. All patients experienced influenza-like symptoms, and there were isolated instances of severe abdominal pain and personality change. Dose-limiting toxicity comprised grade III/IV transaminase elevation (two patients) and syncope with personality change (one patient). Twenty-three of 31 children (74%) subsequently achieved marrow remission using standard agents. One patient was taken off study during teniposide (VM-26) and cytarabine (ara-C) consolidation due to toxicity. Continuation therapy including rIFN-alpha pulse was well tolerated in the remaining children; only one patient required rIFN-alpha dosage reduction (for CNS toxicity). rIFN-alpha toxicity did not necessitate reductions in doses of standard chemotherapy agents or significant delays in therapy. Five patients remain in remission at 26+ to 36+ months; 13 patients relapsed in marrow, one in the meninges (7 months), and one in meninges, mediastinum, and lymph nodes (2 months). Two children were removed from study for marrow transplant. In summary, high-dose rIFN-alpha alone had a modest antileukemic effect. In contrast to the clinical experience with combined rIFN-alpha and chemotherapy in adults, rIFN-alpha given in a pulse-like manner throughout continuation therapy did not compromise the intensity of the standard chemotherapy regimen. 
Enhanced gastric mucosal haemostasis after upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. An endoscopic technique for the measurement of gastric mucosal bleeding time has been developed to study gastric haemostasis in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The relation of gastric mucosal bleeding time to skin bleeding time and nonsterodial anti-inflammatory drug usage was examined in 61 control patients and in 47 patients presenting with bleeding peptic ulcers or erosions. Gastric mucosal bleeding time was shorter in patients with haemorrhage (median 2 minutes, range 0-5 minutes) than in the control group (median 4 minutes, range 2-8 minutes) (p less than 0.001). Skin bleeding times were similar in the two groups (medians 4 minutes in patients with haemorrhage and 4.5 minutes in controls). In 21 patients with haemorrhage who were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the median gastric mucosal bleeding time (2.5 minutes, range 1.0-5.0 minutes) was similar to that in 26 patients with haemorrhage not associated with these drugs (2.0 minutes, range 0.0-5.0 minutes). These results show that gastric mucosal haemostasis is accelerated in response to haemorrhage in the upper gastrointestinal tract, even in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This enhanced gastric haemostasis probably reflects a local protective response to minimise blood loss from the bleeding lesion. 
Prognostic value of serum proteins synthesized by breast carcinoma cells. Several breast carcinoma cell lines or explants of such tumors, as well as examples of lactating or dysplastic breast tissue, synthesized three serum proteins (alpha 2-Zn-glycoprotein, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and alpha-lipoprotein) in vitro. These proteins were detected by immunoperoxidase techniques in 126 breast carcinomas that had been evaluated clinically for more than six years. Alpha-2-Zn-glycoprotein was present in 58% of the carcinomas, whereas alpha 1-antichymotrypsin was seen in 55% and alpha-lipoprotein in 52%. These markers showed a relationship with clinical outcome. Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-lipoprotein were unfavorable determinants, whereas alpha 2-Zn-glycoprotein was detected in lesions with a favorable evolution. Taken individually, these markers have similar but rather weak associations with five-year survival rates; roughly 20% of patients in the "favorable" group died, compared with 33% in the "unfavorable" group. Alpha-2-Zn-glycoprotein in grade 1 tumors was a marker with marginally favorable significance, but alpha 1-antichymotrypsin significantly worsened the prognosis of grade 2 and 3 tumors. Furthermore, stratification of patients according to the number of positive unfavorable markers yielded striking results. Eight percent of patients with none of the unfavorable markers were dead at five years, compared with 55% of those whose lesions expressed three unfavorable markers. 
Total replacement for post-traumatic arthritis of the elbow. Fifty-three of 55 consecutive elbow replacements for post-traumatic arthritis were followed for a minimum of two years (mean 6.3, range 2 to 14.4). The patients presented difficult management problems, having undergone an average of two previous operations per joint; 22 joints had suffered prior complications; 18 had less than 50 degrees of flexion and six were flail. One of three versions of the Coonrad prosthesis was employed in all. During the follow-up period, 10 patients underwent 14 revision procedures for aseptic loosening; 38 elbows are currently without progressive radiolucent lines. In two patients an elbow had to be resected, one for deep infection and the other for bone resorption following a foreign-body reaction to titanium. The current design of the Coonrad prosthesis offers a reliable option for the treatment of post-traumatic arthritis but should be used only in carefully selected patients over the age of 60 years. 
Cardiac rehabilitation services: what are they and are they worth it? The objectives of cardiac rehabilitation include lowering mortality but, more importantly, increasing functional capacity so reducing disability and potentially improving quality of life. The data suggest that cardiac rehabilitation services are worth the patient's costs and efforts and as such, they should be considered an integral component of comprehensive cardiovascular care by cardiologists and primary care physicians. While there is considerable agreement on the roles of exercise testing and training in the three position stands, there are also substantiated, and important, differences in their recommendations on other cardiac rehabilitation services, such as counseling and risk factor management. The challenge for the 1990's is not only to continue to better define the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation services, but more urgently, how to deliver effective services most efficiently. This will help physicians provide optimum care for their patients, will improve the patient's likelihood of regaining for themselves an active and productive life, and should generate a more equitable and accountable reimbursement system for quality health care. 
Risk stratification for arrhythmic events in postinfarction patients based on heart rate variability, ambulatory electrocardiographic variables and the signal-averaged electrocardiogram. The value of heart rate variability, ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) variables and the signal-averaged ECG in the prediction of arrhythmic events (sudden death or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias) was assessed before hospital discharge in 416 consecutive survivors of acute myocardial infarction. During the follow-up period (range 1 to 1,112 days), there were 24 arrhythmic events and 47 deaths. The initial relation between several prognostic factors and arrhythmic events was explored with use of the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates of survival function. Impaired heart rate variability less than 20 ms (p less than 0.0000), late potentials (p less than 0.0000), ventricular ectopic beat frequency (p less than 0.0000), repetitive ventricular forms (p less than 0.0000), left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% (p less than 0.02) and Killip class (p less than 0.02) were identified as significant univariate predictors of arrhythmic events. When these variables were analyzed by using a stepwise Cox regression model, only impaired heart rate variability, followed by late potentials and repetitive ventricular forms remained independent predictors of arrhythmic events. The combination of impaired heart rate variability and late potentials had a sensitivity of 58%, a positive predictive accuracy of 33% and a relative risk of 18.5 for arrhythmic events and was superior to other combinations including those incorporating left ventricular function, exercise ECG, ventricular ectopic beat frequency and repetitive ventricular forms. These results suggest that a simple method of assessment based on heart rate variability and the signal-averaged ECG can select a small subgroup of survivors of myocardial infarction at high risk of future life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death. 
Hemianesthesia, sensory neglect, and defective access to conscious experience. We report a patient with an ischemic stroke in the vascular territory of the right middle cerebral artery who had left spatial neglect and left hemianesthesia. The patient showed a dissociation between defective verbal reporting of somatosensory stimuli delivered to the left hand and physiologic evidence from an autonomic index. This indicates that there was processing of undetected stimuli without the patient's awareness, and suggests that the hemianesthesia was due, at least in part, to somesthetic hemi-inattention. 
Pathogenesis of thrombosis in unstable angina. Plaque rupture of the thinned, weak fibrous cap infiltrated by macrophages and overlying a pool of lipid in the arterial wall initiates the acute thrombotic event of unstable angina. Thrombosis may be advanced within minutes. Most lesions that precede plaque rupture are minor (less than 50% stenosis); thus, thrombus greatly contributes to sudden flow limitation and onset of symptoms. If thrombosis can be totally blocked (not possible with current antithrombotic agents), clinical events should be preventable, and endogenous thrombolysis may be possible within days. Local and systemic factors contribute to arterial thrombosis. With type III injury (fissure into plaque or media) platelet-rich thrombus anchors in the fissure, tracks along the site of deep injury, extends into the lumen, and requires the highest blood level of specific thrombin inhibition (a molar concentration that inhibits the total concentration of prothrombin in circulating blood). Thus, the thrombin content requiring inhibition in type III injury is highest. Local factors for thrombosis associated with type III injury include the rheology of blood flow (increased shear rate forces platelets to the periphery) and substrates in the arterial wall. Plaque substrates include the more thrombogenic collagens (types I and III and diabetic or glycosylated collagen), tissue thromboplastin, lipid gruel, thrombin bound to arterial wall matrix, and decreased prostacyclin. There is a direct relation between platelet deposition (thrombus) and local vasoconstriction, which may perpetuate each other. Thrombus as a substrate is more thrombogenic than type III arterial injury. 
Ossified mucin-secreting choroid plexus adenoma: case report. This is the first report of a fully documented case of an ossified mucin-producing benign choroid plexus tumor. This was a chance finding in a man who complained only of posttraumatic low back discomfort. The ossification of the tumor appears to have been therapeutic. Mucin production may be a defense mechanism. 
Increased incidence of lymphoproliferative disorder after immunosuppression with the monoclonal antibody OKT3 in cardiac-transplant recipients BACKGROUND. A sudden increase in the incidence of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder among the patients in our cardiac-transplantation program was temporally related to introduction of the immunosuppressive drug OKT3. This monoclonal antibody has come to be widely used in recent years both to prevent and to treat rejection after cardiac transplantation. METHODS. In order to identify variables that predict the development of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, we analyzed retrospectively a series of 154 consecutive cardiac-transplant recipients at a single institution. Univariate analyses and multivariate analysis by logistic regression were performed. RESULTS. Among 75 patients who did not receive OKT3, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder developed in 1 (1.3 percent), as compared with 9 of 79 patients who received the drug (11.4 percent); the incidence among the OKT3-treated patients was ninefold higher (odds ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 54.7). According to multivariate analysis, the only factor significantly associated with the development of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder was the use of OKT3 (P = 0.001). A significant increase in risk with increasing doses was also apparent: 4 of 65 patients who received a cumulative dose of 75 mg of OKT3 or less (6.2 percent) had post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, whereas 5 of 14 patients who received more than 75 mg had the disorder (35.7 percent; P less than 0.001). CONCLUSION. The addition of OKT3 to the immunosuppressive regimen increases the incidence of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder after cardiac transplantation, and the risk increases sharply after cumulative doses greater than 75 mg. We suggest that the risks and benefits of prophylactic OKT3 administration be reassessed in the light of these findings, particularly since the value of prophylactic immunotherapy in cardiac-transplant recipients remains to be clearly established. 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and complicated diverticular disease: a case-control study. Fifty patients with severe complications of diverticular disease were compared with two groups of 50 controls, matched for age and sex. The first control group (A) was randomly selected from all emergency hospital admissions, and the second group (B) from patients with uncomplicated diverticular disease. Of the 50 study patients, 24 (48 per cent) were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at the time of admission compared with nine (18 per cent) of control group A and ten (20 per cent) of control group B. Both of these differences were statistically significant, indicating a strong association between the ingestion of NSAIDs and the development of severe complications of diverticular disease. 
Is there a link between fluoridated water and osteosarcoma? To test the hypothesis that fluoride is a risk factor for osteosarcoma, a case control study compared the complete residential fluoride histories of osteosarcoma patients with matched hospital-based controls. Fluoridation was not found to be a risk factor for osteosarcoma in the study population. The trend in the data from this small sample study suggests the hypothesis that a protective effect may exist against the formation of osteosarcoma for individuals consuming fluoridated water. 
Postoperative computed tomography study of pterygomaxillary separation during the Le Fort I osteotomy. Computed tomography (CT) was used postoperatively to assess the pterygomaxillary region in 12 orthognathic surgery patients who had had a Le Fort I osteotomy. Although pterygomaxillary separation was successful in all cases, in only 41.6% of the sides did fractures of the plate not occur. The incidence of low pterygoid plate fracture was 37.5% and that of high pterygoid plate fracture was 25%; 4.2% of sides showed a maxillary tuberosity fracture. Multiple fractures were observed in 8.3% of separated plates. Of 17 pterygoid plates judged clinically to be intact, only 10 were intact as assessed by CT. The significance of these findings and application of CT to evaluation of modifications to the Le Fort I osteotomy is discussed. 
Inhibition of interferon-inducible gene expression by adenovirus E1A proteins: block in transcriptional complex formation. Infection with wild-type adenovirus 5, but not with a mutant lacking the E1A gene, prevented the induction by interferon (IFN) alpha of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in HeLaM cell lines that had been permanently transfected with chimeric CAT reporter genes driven by the transcriptional regulatory regions of the IFN-responsive genes 561 and 6-16. Similar inhibition of IFN-inducible CAT activity was observed in cells that were cotransfected with the same reporter genes and plasmids expressing either the E1A 289- or 243-amino acid protein. These proteins also prevented the induction of CAT activity by IFN-gamma from a cotransfected HLA-DR alpha-CAT gene. Experiments with E1A mutants mapped the inhibitory activity to amino acid residues 38-65 of these proteins. In a HeLa cell line permanently expressing the E1A 289-amino acid protein, the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus was not inhibited by IFN-alpha, suggesting a global blockade of IFN responses. In accord with this theory, induction of 561, 1-8, and (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase mRNAs by IFN was blocked in these cells at the transcriptional level. The observed transcriptional inhibition could be attributed to the lack of formation of the crucial IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcriptional complex. As shown by mobility shift assays, this complex was not formed in the nuclear extracts of IFN-treated adenovirus-infected cells or IFN-treated E1A-producing cells. These nuclear extracts were deficient in both ISGF3 alpha and ISGF3 gamma subunits. However, they did not block the formation of ISGF3 complex from exogenously added components. 
Acute airway obstruction in relapsing polychondritis: treatment with pulse methylprednisolone. We describe 2 adolescents with relapsing polychondritis who developed acute airway obstruction. Both were successfully treated with intravenous steroids for this complication following failure with oral steroids. Early respiratory tract involvement in younger patients seems predictive of a poor outcome and aggressive therapy with intravenous high dose steroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs appears to be indicated. 
Screening dyspepsia by serology to Helicobacter pylori. Owing to limited endoscopy resources, various screening strategies for endoscopy have been proposed. Helicobacter pylori can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity by serology, and therefore we assessed the effects on diagnostic accuracy and endoscopic workload of a policy of screening clinic patients with dyspepsia before endoscopy by a strategy based on age, Helicobacter pylori serology, and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 1153 patients were studied, of whom 842 were of known histological H pylori status (histology group) and 293 had serum assessed prospectively by in-house and commercial ELISAs for detection of IgG antibodies to H pylori. Overall, the screening strategy would have reduced endoscopy workload by 23.3% (95% confidence interval 20.9-25.8%) and would have had a sensitivity for detection of peptic ulcer of 97.4% (94.5-99.1%). No peptic ulcer or malignant disease was missed in the patients studied prospectively, but 6 of 192 peptic ulcers in the histology group would have been missed. A policy of screening young dyspeptic patients for H pylori by serology is more sensitive than symptom-based screening strategies, and may have an important role in reducing endoscopy workload. 
Use of secondary prophylaxis against myocardial infarction in the north of England OBJECTIVE--To record the use of secondary prophylactic drugs in patients discharged from hospital having had a myocardial infarction. DESIGN--Prospective postal questionnaire survey of a random one in two sample of general practitioners in the region. SETTING--The nine family practitioner committee areas within the Northern Regional Health Authority. PATIENTS--Patients who had had a myocardial infarction and were discharged to their general practitioner. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Whether beta blockers or aspirin, or both, were given on discharge. RESULTS--Of 267 patients, 158 (59%) were treated suboptimally in that they did not receive a secondary prophylactic drug to which they had no contraindication. For most patients this entailed underuse of one drug, but 17 (6%) of patients received no treatment. beta Blockers were 2.5 times less likely to be used than aspirin. Treatment was not associated with the age or sex of the patient, risk of further infarction, or hospital of discharge. CONCLUSIONS--Secondary prophylaxis after myocardial infarction is practised haphazardly. It should be offered to all patients who can tolerate it, after a trial period to assess any side effects of the drugs if necessary. 
Management of the medial canthal tendon in nasoethmoid orbital fractures: the importance of the central fragment in classification and treatment. The medial canthal tendon and the fragment of bone on which it inserts ("central" fragment) are the critical factors in the diagnosis and treatment of nasoethmoid orbital fractures. The status of the tendon, the tendon-bearing bone segment, and the fracture pattern define a clinically useful classification system. Three patterns of fracture are appreciated: type I--single-segment central fragment; type II--comminuted central fragment with fractures remaining external to the medial canthal tendon insertion; and type III--comminuted central fragment with fractures extending into bone bearing the canthal insertion. Injuries are further classified as unilateral and bilateral and by their extension into other anatomic areas. The fracture pattern determines exposure and fixation. Inferior approaches alone are advised for unilateral single-segment injuries that are nondisplaced superiorly. Superior and inferior approaches are required for displaced unilateral single-segment injuries, for bilateral single-segment injuries, and for all comminuted fractures. Complete interfragment wiring of all segments is stabilized by junctional rigid fixation. All comminuted fractures require transnasal wiring of the bones of the medial orbital rim (medial canthal tendon-bearing or "central" bone fragment). If the fracture does not extend through the canthal insertion, the canthus should not be detached to accomplish the reduction. 
PAF-induced bowel necrosis. Effects of vasodilators. Ischemic bowel necrosis in the rat is produced by injecting platelet-activating factor (PAF) intravenously. Since intestinal hypoperfusion is observed after PAF injection, we hypothesize that mesenteric vasoconstriction is the mechanism of bowel injury. We thus studied the effects of vasodilators in this model. We found that: (1) Phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615 (leukotriene antagonist) and PGE1 counteracted the PAF-induced mesenteric flow reduction and ameliorated the bowel injury. However, phenoxybenzamine and prazosin were relatively ineffective in correcting PAF-induced hypotension, showing that bowel injury can be prevented independently of the hypotensive state. (2) Nitroglycerin failed to prevent bowel injury, although it improved the mesenteric blood flow. Thus, in opposition to our initial hypothesis, correction of the mesenteric flow reduction induced by PAF does not always prevent intestineal necrosis. (3) Only phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615, and PGE1 ameliorated PAF-induced hemoconcentration and bowel injury. This suggests a correlation between vascular injury (expressed by "leaky" vessels and the consequent hemoconcentration) and bowel necrosis. (4) Although both nitroglycerin and hydralazine relax smooth muscle, hydralazine seemed to aggravate bowel necrosis. The mechanism remains unclear. 
Greater loop chloride uptake contributes to blunted pressure natriuresis in Dahl salt sensitive rats. A blunted pressure natriuretic response is present in Dahl salt sensitive rats. To determine whether this results from tubular or glomerular mechanisms, late proximal, early distal, and late distal micropuncture were performed in salt resistant (R), salt sensitive (S), or salt sensitive rats with renal perfusion reduced to that of R rats (S-AC). Differences in neuro-endocrine background between groups were eliminated by renal denervation and by fixing plasma aldosterone, norepinephrine, and vasopressin levels by infusion. Renal perfusion pressure was greater (P less than 0.05) and inulin clearance less (P less than 0.05) in S than R rats. Urinary sodium excretion, however, was not different. S-AC had renal perfusion pressures that were similar to R rats and inulin clearance similar to S rats. Urinary NaCl excretion was less (P less than 0.05) than either group. Single nephron inulin clearance, fluid, and chloride delivery to late proximal sites were not different between groups. Absolute and fractional chloride delivery to early distal sites was less (P less than 0.05) in S-AC than R or S but not different between R and S. Late distal chloride delivery was not different between any group. Calculated loop chloride reabsorption was greater in S-AC than R or S. Thus, the lower urinary NaCl excretion in S-AC rats is in part due to increased loop chloride reabsorption. This effect is probably intrinsic to the S kidney as it occurs despite renal denervation when plasma levels of vasopressin, norepinephrine, and aldosterone are fixed. The increased loop chloride uptake is abolished when perfusion pressure increases. 
Fistula-in-ano in Crohn's disease. Results of aggressive surgical treatment. The outcome of aggressive surgical treatment of 64 symptomatic anal fistulas in 55 patients with Crohn's disease has been studied. Forty-one fistulas, in 33 patients, were treated by conventional fistulotomy (17 subcutaneous, 19 intersphincteric, 5 low transsphincteric fistulas). Thirty wounds (73 percent) healed within 3 months and eight more wounds (93 percent) healed within 6 months. Three wounds did not heal within 12-18 months. Two of these patients subsequently required proctocolectomy. Wound healing was not influenced by the presence of rectal Crohn's disease or granulomatous inflammation in the tract. No change in continence was experienced by 26 of the 33 patients who underwent fistulotomy. Three patients required proctocolectomy and the remaining four patients experienced minor degrees of incontinence postoperatively. Sixteen high transsphincteric, five suprasphincteric, and one extrasphincteric fistula in 22 patients were treated by laying open external tracts and placing a noncutting seton through the sphincter, which was left in place for prolonged periods to maintain drainage. During follow-up (6 months to 10 years, median 2.5 years), three fistulas healed and seven remained quiescent. Nine patients required further treatment by a new seton and three patients required proctocolectomy. Eight of the 22 patients who had a seton inserted had no change in continence, and six patients in this group developed minor changes in continence, mostly related to diarrhea associated with intestinal disease. Anal fistulas in Crohn's disease, which involve minimal sphincter muscle, can be successfully treated by fistulotomy. High fistulas should be treated with seton drainage to limit recurrent suppuration and preserve sphincter function. 
Clinical applications of carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography. During an 18-month period 33 patients in whom there were contraindications to the use of iodinated contrast arteriography underwent 40 carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriograms for lower extremity ischemia (19), severe hypertension and renal insufficiency (12), or arterial aneurysm (2). Contraindications to iodinated contrast agents included renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, and contrast hypersensitivity. Sixteen aortic, 15 iliac-femoral-popliteal-tibial, five aorta-iliac-femoral and four aorta-iliac-femoral-popliteal-tibial carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography studies were performed. In 11 studies, imaging of selected arterial segments required the addition of 10 to 60 ml of dilute nonionic contrast. Guided by carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography studies four femoral-tibial bypasses, three aneurysmorrhaphies, two aortorenal bypasses, one aortofemoral bypass and one femoral-femoral bypass were successfully performed in 11 patients. In addition, carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography directed angioplasties of the common iliac (4), superficial femoral (6), popliteal (3), or tibioperoneal trunk (1) were performed in 10 patients. Complications of carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography included transient deterioration in renal function in three patients in whom 20 ml of nonionic contrast was used, a nonfatal myocardial infarction after a popliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in one patient, and transient tachypnea and tachycardia during a carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography study in one patient. Diagnostic arteriograms are obtainable using carbon dioxide as the contrast agent. Carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography permits patients with symptomatic arterial disease at high risk for contrast related complications to safely undergo arteriography and subsequent arterial reconstruction or endovascular intervention. 
Myocardial perfusion imaging with thallium-201 to evaluate patients before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Thallium-201 imaging may be used to help determine the distribution and amount of myocardium in jeopardy and the success of revascularization after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Single photon emission computed tomography is particularly advantageous because of its ability to differentiate vascular territories and thus evaluate patients with multivessel disease. Myocardial infarction resulting from complications such as distal embolization and side-branch occlusion can be detected. Thallium-201 imaging early after angioplasty may show abnormal results caused by transiently insufficient coronary flow reserve. However, studies performed 6 weeks or more after angioplasty accurately detect early restenosis and may identify those individuals likely to become symptomatic and eventually develop restenosis in the future. 
Comparative experience with smooth and polyurethane breast implants using the Kaplan-Meier method of survival analysis. Smooth-walled silicone implants have been widely used in breast surgery. Capsular contracture, causing undesirable firmness and spherical deformity, has been a common problem. Recent studies suggest that polyurethane-covered breast implants are associated with a lower incidence of capsular contracture. The statistical methodology employed in some of these studies, however, may be subject to criticism. Between July of 1984 and June of 1990 (72 months), 427 polyurethane breast implants were used in 279 patients and 439 smooth prostheses were used in 250 patients for a variety of aesthetic and reconstructive procedures. The occurrence of capsular contracture was carefully monitored and then analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method of survival analysis. This method is particularly well suited to analysis of these types of clinical data because it allows for the fact that contractures occur at varying intervals after surgery and that follow-up of patients is incomplete. The probability of capsular contracture with smooth-walled prostheses was found to be significantly greater than with polyurethane-covered implants in each group of patients studied (p less than 0.05). Other complications occurred at a similar rate regardless of prosthesis type. This study supports the belief that polyurethane breast implants have a lower contracture rate; furthermore, it introduces the Kaplan-Meier method for analyzing the outcome of alternative plastic surgical therapies. 
Limb-sparing surgery in skeletally immature patients with osteosarcoma. The use of an expandable prosthesis. Limb-sparing surgery has a definite role in the treatment of osteosarcoma in children. Increased survival, however, raises problems of limb-length discrepancy and prosthetic longevity. The concept of an expandable adjustable prosthesis addresses the problem of leg-length discrepancy. The problem of prosthesis longevity will require further long-term evaluation of current designs and methods of fixation, as well as the development of a permanent prosthesis or biologic replacement. At skeletal maturity, the expandable prosthesis may either be maintained or substituted with another implant or biological alternative if warranted by the clinical situation. 
Idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins. Nonthrombotic occlusion or stenosis of the mesenteric veins is a rare cause of intestinal ischemia that usually occurs in association with systemic vasculitis. The current report includes four male patients with segmental ischemic colitis caused by idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia in the small mesenteric veins and their intramural branches; neither vasculitis nor arterial involvement were present. Three of the four patients were less than or equal to 38 years of age; the fourth was 67. All four patients were previously healthy and had no history of drug use of any kind. Clinical findings included abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, and colonic strictures discovered by barium enema. The intima of the mesenteric and intestinal mural veins was focally thickened by a marked increase in cells and matrix between the endothelium and internal elastic lamina, whereas the vessel walls external to the thickened intima appeared normal. Histochemistry and immunoreactivity with antibodies to muscle-specific actins (HHF-35) disclosed that the intimal thickening was caused by proliferation of smooth muscle cells in a proteoglycan matrix. All patients recovered completely after segmental resection of the ischemic portion of the colon and had no recurrence of intestinal symptoms on follow-up of up to 7 years. These unusual venous lesions do not appear to have been previously described; their etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. 
In situ human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in South African and British patients: evidence for putative HPV integration in vivo. In South Africa asymptomatic wart virus infection diagnosed by morphological criteria occurs in 16-20% of all ethnic groups; the incidence in black women is 66%. To identify human papillomavirus (HPV) types the prevalence of HPV in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in South African women (n = 72) with age matched British women (n = 73) was compared by non-isotopic in situ hybridisation (NISH) using digoxigenin labelled probes for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35 on archival biopsy specimens. A higher proportion of British biopsy specimens (68%) contained HPV than those from South Africa (50%) in CIN 2 and 3; this difference was due to HPV 16. Thirty six per cent of the positive biopsy specimens from South African women also contained HPV 33/35 compared with 16% in the United Kingdom. There was no difference in HPV detection with age in either group. These data indicate that HPV types vary geographically, with "minor" HPV types being more common in South Africa. Three qualitatively distinct NISH signals were observed; a diffuse (type 1) signal in superficial cells, mainly koilocytes; a punctate signal (type 2) in basal/"undifferentiated" cells in CIN 3; and combined type 1 and 2 signals in CIN with wart virus infection (type 3). The punctate signal may represent HPV integration. 
A controlled study of caudal epidural injections of triamcinolone plus procaine for the management of intractable sciatica. The management of sciatica due to lumbar nerve root compromise remains controversial, probably because few well-controlled studies of conservative management have been performed. This preliminary study assesses the efficacy of epidural injections of 80 mg triamcinolone acetonide plus 0.5% procaine hydrochloride in saline, administered via the caudal route, in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial with 1 year follow-up. Twenty-three patients were entered into the study: 12 received treatment and 11 placebo. The active group showed significant pain relief (P = 0.02) and a significant increase in mobility (P = 0.01) at 4 weeks, which resulted in improved quality of life (P = 0.02). At 1 year, subjective and objective measures improved in both groups. The improvement was greater in the actively treated group, but only the objective assessment (straight leg raise) was statistically significant. 
A prospective study of incisional time, blood loss, pain, and healing with carbon dioxide laser, scalpel, and electrosurgery. Carbon dioxide laser incisions are reported to be less painful, less bloody, and less prone to seroma formation and to heal better than scalpel or electrosurgical incisions. We compared all three modalities in a prospective randomized study of cholecystectomy incisions. Time required for the incision and incisional blood loss was less with electrosurgery than with the carbon dioxide laser or scalpel. Postoperative pain and wound healing, however, were the same for all three techniques. The carbon dioxide laser appears to offer no advantage over conventional means of making a standard incision. 
Glial swelling following human cerebral contusion: an ultrastructural study. The ultrastructural features of cerebral contusion seen three hours to 11 days after head injury were studied in 18 patients undergoing surgery. Massive astrocytic swelling ("cytotoxic" oedema) was seen three hours to three days after injury, maximal in perivascular foot processes, and compressing some of the underlying capillaries. The tight junctions were not disrupted. Neuronal damage was most marked three to 11 days after injury. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to oedema formation and neuronal degeneration are discussed. 
Extraperitoneal approach for repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms are characterized by dense perianeurysmal fibrosis involving the adjacent organs. Attempts to isolate the aneurysm can lead to operative injuries of these structures, thus increasing the rates of complications and mortality. In the last 12 years 45 patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent aneurysm resection at the Department of Vascular Surgery of the University of Rome. The aneurysm was resected through a standard, midline transperitoneal approach in 39 patients, through a thoracophrenolaparotomy in two patients, and through a left-flank extraperitoneal approach in the last four patients. The extraperitoneal approach simplified aneurysm dissection and aortic clamping with no cases of postoperative morbidity or death. In addition, we reviewed the CT scan findings of 12 patients surgically treated for inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. The amount of fibrosis in the anterior wall of the aneurysm was greater than in the left posterolateral aspect (p = 0.008). We conclude that the left-flank extraperitoneal approach is the most anatomically advantageous route for repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
Induction of sustained patency after clot-selective coronary thrombolysis with Hybrid-B, a genetically engineered plasminogen activator with a prolonged biological half-life. BACKGROUND. Despite the utility of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in eliciting coronary thrombolysis clinically, early reocclusion remains a problem, occurring despite anticoagulation in 5-30% of patients with initially successful recanalization. This study evaluated the utility of Hybrid-B, a molecular variant of t-PA with a prolonged half-life in the circulation, in eliciting coronary thrombolysis and maintaining patency in the presence of a continuing thrombogenic stimulus. METHODS AND RESULTS. In intact, anesthetized dogs, either 18 mg Hybrid-B over 30 minutes (n = 15) or 50 mg t-PA (Activase) over 60 minutes (n = 8) was administered starting 60 minutes after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion was induced with a thrombogenic copper coil. Time to lysis averaged 54 +/- 26 (means +/- SD) minutes and 64 +/- 34 minutes with Hybrid-B and t-PA, respectively (p = NS). When Hybrid-B was administered as a bolus (20 mg over 1 minute) to induce a high initial concentration in blood, time to lysis was shortened markedly and averaged 15 +/- 5 minutes. Dogs given Hybrid-B by either infusion or bolus exhibited prolonged time to reocclusion (337 +/- 192 minutes compared with 192 +/- 125 minutes in dogs given t-PA, p less than 0.03), reflecting maintenance of a subthrombolytic but persistently active concentration of activator in blood. Despite the persistence of Hybrid-B in blood, concentrations of fibrinogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin were not depleted markedly and remained at 77 +/- 25 and 56 +/- 24%, respectively, of control values. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, Hybrid-B, a novel variant of t-PA with unique pharmacokinetic properties, elicits prompt, sustained, and clot-selective coronary thrombolysis. 
The use of masseter electromyography with electroneurography in the evaluation of facial paralysis. In the evaluation of facial paralysis, electroneurography provides a quantitative assessment of the degree of degeneration. Near the endpoint of degeneration, the facial musculature compound action potential may be contaminated by masseter artifact resulting from supramaximal stimulation. We propose the use of both masseter electromyography and electroneurography in the evaluation of advanced degeneration to better define the current level for supramaximal stimulation, to eliminate masseter artifact, and to more accurately assess the degree of facial nerve degeneration. 
Usefulness of weightlifting training in improving strength and maximal power output in coronary artery disease. The effects of 10 weeks (20 sessions) of combined weightlifting and aerobic training (n = 10) were compared with the effects of aerobic training alone (n = 8) on indexes of strength and aerobic exercise capacity in 18 men with coronary artery disease (CAD). Initial test performance was similar between groups. After aerobic training, the maximal load that could be lifted once only (1-repetition maximum) in single-arm curl, single-leg press and single-knee extension exercises increased by 13% (11.8 to 13.3 kg; p less than 0.01), 4% (97.0 to 101.0 kg; difference not significant) and 5% (28.2 to 29.7 kg; difference not significant), respectively; corresponding gains with combined weightlifting and aerobic training were 43% (12.2 to 17.4 kg; p less than 0.01), 21% (99.0 to 120.0 kg; p less than 0.01) and 24% (29.0 to 36.0 kg; p less than 0.01). After aerobic training, the initial 1-repetition maximum could be lifted an average of 4 times, compared with 14 times after combined training. Maximal progressive incremental cycle ergometer power output increased by 2% in the aerobic control group (1,088 to 1,113 kpm/min; difference not significant) and by 15% (1,030 to 1,180 kpm/min; p less than 0.05) in the experimental group. Cycling time at 80% of initial maximal power before attaining a Borg (0 to 10) rating of perceived exertion of 7 (very severe) increased by 11% (604 to 672 seconds; difference not significant) and by 109% (541 to 1,128 seconds; p less than 0.05) in the control and weight-trained patients, respectively. 
Neoplasms associated with pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma. We found a high prevalence of pulmonary and extrapulmonary neoplasms in patients with pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma (PEG) who were studied at our institution. Among 21 patients with PEG, 10 (48%) had associated benign (one patient) or malignant (nine patients) tumors. Patients with tumors were older at the time of diagnosis of PEG (48.9 vs 34.5 years). Tumors included three lung carcinomas, one pulmonary carcinoid tumor, two lymphomas, five extrapulmonary carcinomas, and one mediastinal ganglioneuroma. Two malignant neoplasms developed in each of two patients. Six tumors preceded, three followed, and three occurred concomitantly with the diagnosis of PEG. Slides from eight PEG-associated tumors and 18 control neoplasms from patients without PEG were also stained immunohistochemically for S100 protein. Four PEG-associated (50%) and 11 control (61%) tumors contained S100 protein-positive interstitial cells. Our study suggests, but does not prove, that there may be more than a random association between PEG and neoplasms. Cigarette smoking, moreover, is an important risk factor for both PEG and lung carcinomas. Our immunohistochemical findings indicate that S100 protein-positive cells in tumors usually bear little or no relationship to PEG. In patients with an underlying malignant neoplasm, PEG simulates pulmonary metastases clinically and, occasionally, histopathologically. 
One hundred patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer treated by resection: analysis of prognostic determinants. One hundred patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer underwent 'radical' liver resection from 1980 to 1989. At least 1 cm of normal parenchyma surrounded the tumour and no microscopic invasion of resection margins was evident. The disease was staged according to our own staging system. Lobectomy was performed in 50 patients and non-anatomical resection in the remainder. The postoperative mortality rate was 5 per cent and the major morbidity rate was 11 per cent. The actuarial 5-year survival rate for patients in stages I, II and III was 42 per cent, 34 per cent and 15 per cent respectively (P less than 0.001). The overall actuarial 5-year survival rate was 30 per cent. The prognostic importance of various patient and tumour variables was evaluated by univariate analysis and then by multivariate analysis. Age of patient, site of primary, disease-free interval between treatment of primary and of hepatic metastases, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and number of metastases, did not relate to prognosis, while sex (P = 0.024), stage of primary (P = 0.026), extent of liver involvement (P less than 0.001), distribution of metastases (P = 0.01) and type of surgery (P = 0.028) significantly affected prognosis as single factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the extent of liver involvement and stage of the primary tumour were independent predictors of survival. We conclude that liver resection is effective in selected patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. In resectable patients it is not yet possible to formulate a clear prognosis based on clinical factors. The extent of liver involvement and the staging system used may be significant, although not absolute, indicators of outcome. 
Secondary erythrocytosis due to a cerebellar hemangioblastoma: demonstration of erythropoietin mRNA in the tumor. Cerebellar hemangioblastoma is a rare cause of secondary erythrocytosis. Although the erythrocytosis is a result of erythropoietin (Ep) stimulation, direct evidence of Ep synthesis by the tumor has been lacking. In an erythrocytotic patient with a cerebellar hemangioblastoma we found elevated levels of Ep in the tumor cyst fluid and for the first time demonstrated Ep mRNA in the tumor by Northern blotting. This finding confirms cerebellar hemangioblastoma as a site of ectopic Ep production. 
Midazolam use in the emergency department. Midazolam is a new imidazobenzodiazepine derivative that is two to three times as potent as diazepam, is water-soluble, has a rapid onset and short duration of action, and produces a profound amnestic effect. These properties make it an extremely useful drug for outpatient sedation. We performed retrospective review of midazolam use in a general emergency department over a one-year period. Midazolam was used in 120 patients, 71 men and 49 women, with an average age of 46 years. The average dose given was 3.4 mg, with a range of 1 to 10 mg. In 69 of the cases (57%) other drugs were administered, most commonly an opiate. There were only four adverse reactions. One patient developed urinary retention, one patient vomited, and two patients were somnolent for a prolonged period of time. There were no serious cardiovascular or respiratory problems. We conclude that midazolam is a safe drug to use in the emergency department. Close monitoring of the patient and the availability of airway support equipment are mandatory. 
Risk factors for falls as a cause of hip fracture in women. The Northeast Hip Fracture Study Group. BACKGROUND. Although even in the elderly most falls are not associated with fractures, over 90 percent of hip fractures are the result of a fall. Few studies have assessed whether the risk factors for falls are also important risk factors for hip fracture. METHODS. To examine the importance of risk factors for falls in the epidemiology of hip fracture, we performed a case-control study of 174 women (median age, 80 years) admitted with a first hip fracture to 1 of 30 hospitals in New York and Philadelphia. Controls, matched to the case patients according to age and hospital, were selected from general surgical and orthopedic surgical hospital services. Information was obtained by direct interview. RESULTS. As measured by the odds ratio, increased risks for hip fracture were associated with lower-limb dysfunction (odds ratio = 1.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.8), visual impairment (odds ratio = 5.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 13.9), previous stroke (odds ratio = 2.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 4.0), Parkinson's disease (odds ratio = 9.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 76.1), and use of long-acting barbiturates (odds ratio = 5.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 45.0). Of the controls, 44 (25 percent) had had a recent fall. The case patients were more likely than these controls to have fallen from a standing height or higher (odds ratio = 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 5.7). Of those with hip fracture the younger patients (less than 75 years old) were more likely than the older ones (greater than or equal to 75 years old) to have fallen on a hard surface (odds ratio = 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 3.7). CONCLUSIONS. A number of factors that have been identified as risk factors for falls are also associated with hip fracture, including lower-limb dysfunction, neurologic conditions, barbiturate use, and visual impairment. Given the prevalence of these problems among the elderly, who are at highest risk, programs to prevent hip fracture should include measures to prevent falls in addition to measures to slow bone loss. 
Tumor markers in cancer of the colon and rectum. The primary role that tumor markers for cancer of the colon and rectum have at this time is for postoperative surveillance of those patients resected for cure who are at risk for recurrence of the disease. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels are followed by most surgeons prospectively after the potentially curative resection. This tumor marker has not been advocated as a screening test for these cancers; however, a preoperative CEA serum level is determined in those patients before the initial surgery for colon or rectal cancer. The serum level of CEA is mainly determined by tumor differentiation and stage of disease. If the CEA serum level begins to increase during the postoperative surveillance period, the recurrence of colon or rectal cancer must be suspected. Further investigations are then performed to identify the location and resectability of the recurrent disease. Monoclonal antibodies labeled with radioisotope are presently being used clinically to identify recurrence of colon and rectal cancer. Used in conjunction with elevated serum CEA levels (or other determinants of recurrent disease) these tumor markers can specifically identify site(s) of cancer recurrence. Theoretically, by attaching cancer-fighting agents (i.e., chemotherapeutic agents) to the monoclonal antibody, the site of tumor recurrence can be potentially treated, too. Hence, these "tumor-seeking missiles" may one day be used to treat cancer recurrence. 
Fluid collections developing after pancreatic transplantation: radiologic evaluation and intervention. The usefulness of real-time sonography, duplex sonography, computed tomography (CT), cystography, diagnostic aspiration, and percutaneous drainage in the diagnosis and treatment of peri-pancreatic-transplant fluid collections was retrospectively assessed in 46 recipients of extraperitoneal pancreatic transplants. Forty-four abnormalities were identified in the extraperitoneal space at sonography, including four pancreatic pseudocysts associated with malfunction of the pancreatic duct, seven abscesses, six hematomas, nine urinomas, six early postoperative fluid collections that spontaneously resolved, six cases of pancreatitis, and six cases of vascular occlusion. Sonography (including pulsed Doppler sonography) was the procedure of choice in detecting fluid collections and diagnosing pancreatitis, rejection, vascular thrombosis, and pancreatic duct malfunction. CT was diagnostic in four of six hematomas; cystography was diagnostic in seven of nine urinomas. Sonographically guided percutaneous intervention enabled three patients to avoid surgery and allowed optimal surgical planning for six patients. 
Reversible symptomatic biliary obstruction associated with ceftriaxone pseudolithiasis. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, has been associated with the development of sludge or stones in the gallbladders of some patients treated with this medication. Such precipitates, which are usually reversible upon discontinuation of the drug, sometimes cause symptoms, have simulated acute cholecystitis, and have even led to cholecystectomy in some cases. We report the first known instance of biliary obstruction and secondary pancreatitis in association with reversible ceftriaxone-induced pseudolithiasis. 
Serosal invasion as the single prognostic indicator in stage IIIA (T3N1M0) gastric cancer. Prognostic factors of gastric cancer with positive serosal invasion and regional lymph node metastasis were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Sixty-seven patients with the T3N1M0 subgroup of stage IIIA disease were evaluated, in which 34.9 +/- 13.4 nodes were dissected in extended lymph node dissection, and 6.5 +/- 6.2 were metastatic. Routine postoperative systemic chemotherapy with mitomycin C and N1-(2'-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil was administered. With this approach, the 5-year survival rate of stage IIIA disease was 47.6%. By Cox proportional hazards model, diameter of serosal invasion was the only significant determinant of prognosis in the T3N1M0 subgroup. The predicted 5-year survival rate for 24 patients with serosal invasion less than 3.0 cm in diameter was 59.5%, compared with 11.5% for 38 patients with invasion of 3.0 cm or larger in diameter. The number of metastatic nodes and the type of operation (total gastrectomy or less than total gastrectomy) did not affect the prognosis. When gastric cancer has both positive serosal invasion and metastatic regional lymph nodes, the diameter of serosal invasion is the more important factor for predicting prognosis. 
Typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ear infections related to outcome of treatment. Of 142 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) ear infections, 88 (62 per cent) had chronic otitis media and 54 (38 per cent) external otitis. Following serotyping and pyocin typing of their bacteria, and relating the type to outcome, patients could be divided into three groups: (1) 120 patients who had no recurrence with isolation of only one PSA strain, (2) 13 patients who had recurrent infections and in whom the same PSA strain was isolated in repeated cultures, and (3) nine patients who had recurrent disease, but who had a change in their PSA strains. Most of the PSA strains isolated from patients in groups (1) and (2) were stable to pyocin, and resistent to gentamicin. Patients in the first group were all cured initially by medical management. Of the nine patients in group (3) who had a different serotype on repeated cultures, medical treatment was successful in eight (89 per cent), but of the 13 patients in group (2) who had the same Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype cultured, medical therapy failed in six (46 per cent) and mastoid surgery was required. Serotyping of Pseudomonas aeruginosa otitis may be helpful in predicting the type of management in patients who have recurrent infections. 
Deep UV photochemistry of chemisorbed monolayers: patterned coplanar molecular assemblies. Deep ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is shown to modify organosilane self-assembled monolayer (SAM) films by a photocleavage mechanism, which renders the surface amenable to further SAM modification. Patterned UV exposure creates alternating regions of intact SAM film and hydrophilic, reactive sites. The exposed regions can undergo a second chemisorption reaction to produce an assembly of SAMs in the same molecular plane with similar substrate attachment chemistry. The UV-patterned films are used as a template for selective buildup of fluorophores, metals, and biological cells. 
Positron tomographic assessment of 16 alpha-[18F] fluoro-17 beta-estradiol uptake in metastatic breast carcinoma. The positron-emitting estrogenic steroid 16 alpha-[18F]fluoro-17 beta-estradiol (FES) has been shown to exhibit selective uptake in primary breast carcinomas; the uptake of tracer by positron emission tomography (PET) is strongly correlated with the tumor estrogen-receptor concentration. We have now extended the use of this radiopharmaceutical for imaging of metastases of breast carcinoma by PET in 16 patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. Increased uptake of FES was identified on PET images in 53 of 57 metastatic lesions (93%); only two apparent false-positive foci of FES uptake were seen. In seven of the patients, evaluable PET studies were obtained both before and after initiation of antiestrogen therapy. In all cases, there was a decrease in FES uptake in the tumor deposits after initiation of antiestrogen therapy, and the mean (+/- standard deviation) uptake decreased from 2.22 (+/- 1.23) to 0.80 (+/- 0.42) x 10(3)+ dose/ml. These results indicate that PET with FES has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting metastatic breast carcinoma and provide additional confirmatory evidence that the tumor uptake of this ligand is a receptor-mediated process. 
Acute dacryocystic retention cured by inferior turbinate infracturing. A 30-year-old man with recurrent acute dacryocystic retention had successful infracturing of the inferior turbinate bone in association with probing of the lacrimal outflow system. Enlargement of the inferior nasal meatus by fracturing the turbinate is easy to do and would be indicated before recommending a dacryocystorhinostomy in cases of acute dacryocystic retention in which the causative cast is difficult to eliminate even by large probes that can be passed down the nasolacrimal duct. 
Anti-CD18 antibody attenuates neutropenia and alveolar capillary-membrane injury during gram-negative sepsis. Activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) associated with sepsis. Adhesion of activated PMNs to endothelial monolayers is mediated by the CD18 adhesion-receptor complex on the PMN cell surface. Monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) blocks CD18-dependent PMN-endothelial adhesion in vitro and in vivo. This study was designed to determine the role of CD18-dependent PMN adhesion in ALI associated with gram-negative sepsis. Anesthetized, ventilated (FiO2 0.5, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O) pigs received sterile saline (control, n = 8) or live Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 x 10(8) colony-forming units/ml at 0.3 ml/20 kg/min (septic, n = 9) for 1 hour. A third group (n = 7) received MoAb 60.3, 2 mg/kg intravenously, 15 minutes before Pseudomonas infusion. Animals were studied for 300 minutes. MoAb 60.3 significantly (p less than 0.05) attenuated the neutropenia seen in sepsis (15 +/- 1 vs 6 +/- 1 x 10(3) PMNs/mm3 at 300 min). Alveolar-capillary membrane injury was assessed by bronchoalveolar-lavage protein content and extravascular lung water determination. MoAb 60.3 significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced BAL protein at 300 minutes (388 +/- 75 vs 1059 +/- 216 micrograms/ml in septic animals) and attenuated the increase in extravascular lung water to 240 minutes (7.1 +/- 2 vs 14.2 +/- 1.2 ml/kg in septic animals). Systemic hypotension, decreased cardiac index, pulmonary hypertension, and relative hypoxemia, all characteristic of this model, were not altered by MoAb 60.3. These data suggest that, in this model of septic ALI, neutropenia is, in part, CD18 dependent and that blocking CD18-dependent PMN adhesion protects the alveolar-capillary membrane independently of altered hemodynamic status. 
Evidence for central alpha-2 adrenoceptors, not imidazoline binding sites, mediating the ethanol-attenuating properties of alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists. The role of central adrenoceptors in the ethanol-attenuating effects of alpha-2 adrenoceptor blockers was investigated in mice; the centrally active antagonist atipamezole was compared with L 659,066, which penetrates the brain poorly. L 659,066 (1-10 mg/kg) had no effect on the hypothermia induced by ethanol (2 g/kg) or ethanol ataxia (2.4 g/kg), whereas atipamezole (1 mg/kg) significantly attenuated both ethanol-induced hypothermia and ataxia. Atipamezole (1-3 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the ethanol-induced reduction in exploratory head-dipping in a holeboard test whereas L 659,066 was only effective at a dose of 1 mg/kg, higher doses (3 and 10 mg/kg) and a lower dose (0.3 mg/kg) were ineffective. Atipamezole was without effect on ethanol's locomotor stimulant effect in the holeboard but L 659,066 attenuated this effect at doses less than 3 mg/kg Many alpha-2 adrenoceptor ligands also have affinity for nonadrenergic imidazoline-binding sites. The role these sites may play in attenuating ethanol's effects was investigated by comparing RX 821002 (methoxy idazoxan), which has little or no affinity for imidazoline-binding sites with atipamezole. Both atipamezo 1 e (1 mg/kg) and RX 821002 (0.06-0.2 mg/kg) significantly attenuated ethanol-induced hypothermia, ataxia and reduction in head-dipping, but were without effect on ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation. These results suggest that nonadrenergic imidazoline-binding sites are not implicated in the ethanol-attenuating properties of alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists. 
Pulmonary oedema following relief of upper airway obstruction in the Pierre-Robin syndrome: a consequence of early palatal repair? Pulmonary oedema occurred following relief of an acute upper airway obstruction in an infant with Pierre-Robin syndrome undergoing cleft palate repair. We anticipate an increased prevalence of this phenomenon in view of the present trend for early palatal repair, and would advocate the routine use of a nasopharyngeal airway after operation in infants with severe micrognathia. 
Assessing the denominator problem in community-oriented primary care. Determination of health care needs is an essential cornerstone of community-oriented primary care (COPC). Many physicians, lacking research resources, may generalize their own patient registry data to the community. But practice populations are likely to differ significantly from community populations. This study compared demographics, health status, and medical care utilization in a sample of 990 elderly living in the community and 250 elderly patients registered at the St. Elizabeth Hospital Family Health Center in Youngstown, Ohio. The community survey and patient registries were comparable on key demographic characteristics. But statistically significant differences were observed for functional status and a number of chronic medical conditions. Comparisons of symptomatology, use of health aides, subjective health status, depression, and stress produced no significant differences. Overall health care utilization patterns were similar. The elderly family health center patients were more representative of the non-institutionalized elderly in the community than expected. And although the clinical significance remains uncertain, these findings suggest that this practice sample may be used with caution for COPC planning. But considerably more research must be undertaken in a variety of practice settings before the use of practice populations for COPC planning is widely applied. 
Comparison of thermodilution and transthoracic electrical bioimpedance cardiac outputs. Current methods of measuring cardiac output require the invasive insertion of a thermodilution catheter with its concomitant risks and complications. We examined the noninvasive method of transthoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB) in comparison with thermodilution cardiac outputs in a sample of 44 critically ill patients with poor left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%) and with either ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Dyspnea, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and difference between real and ideal weight had the most marked effects on the correlation between the two methods, with lesser influence by left ventricular ejection fraction, height, weight, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and aortic regurgitation. TEB and thermodilution cardiac outputs were correlated, at r = 0.51 (p less than 0.00009), but the low reliability and low percentage of TEB readings within 0.5 L/min of thermodilution cardiac outputs (31%) renders TEB inadequate for clinical measurement of cardiac outputs in this patient population. 
Rationale for treatment. Based on substantial evidence, the 1984 NIH Consensus Development Conference concluded that the treatment of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol elevations with diet and, when necessary, with drugs, can reduce the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Accordingly, in 1988 the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) published guidelines for defining moderate-, borderline-high-, and high-risk categories for CAD. Many clinical trials have supported the benefits of antihyperlipidemic therapy. Evidence from the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial gave rise to the "2:1 ratio," i.e., that a 1% reduction in total cholesterol level is associated with a 2% decrease in CAD events. The Helsinki Heart Study results indicated that additional benefit may be obtained by raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. Dramatic reductions in LDL and total cholesterol were achieved by the Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias, which also achieved a 35% reduction in CAD events and a two-thirds reduction in both coronary bypass operations and angioplasties. Long-term benefits of cholesterol lowering in terms of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality have been shown in the Coronary Drug Project and the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. Two major studies that have documented angiographic changes as a result of cholesterol lowering are the Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) and the Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS). In both CLAS and FATS, there was a decrease in the development of new lesions and a lowering of the rate of progression of existing lesions. In FATS, there was also evidence that aggressive antihyperlipidemic therapy will decrease existing lesions in some CAD patients. 
Postoperative radiotherapy in the management of spinal cord ependymoma. Fifty-eight patients with histologically verified spinal cord ependymomas were treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital and Atkinson Morley's Hospital between 1950 and 1987. The median age in this series was 40 years (range 1 to 79 years) and the male:female ratio was 1.8:1. Ten patients had tumors in the cervical cord and 10 in the thoracic cord; 14 tumors involved the conus medullaris and 24 the cauda equina. Forty ependymomas were grade I and 13 were grades II to IV (in five patients there was insufficient material for grading). Eleven patients underwent biopsy only, 33 had partial or subtotal resection, and 14 had complete resection. Forty-three patients received postoperative radiotherapy. The median follow-up period was 70 months (range 3 to 408 months). Cause-specific survival rates were 74% and 68% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. On univariate analysis, age, histological grade, postoperative neurological function, and era of treatment were significant prognostic factors for survival. The histological grade was the only significant independent prognostic factor. The relative risk of death from ependymoma was 9.0 for patients with tumor grades II to IV compared to grade I (p less than 0.005, 95% confidence interval 2.7 to 30). The survival rates of patients following complete excision were significantly better compared to those after incomplete surgery (p less than 0.025). The majority of completely resected neoplasms were low-grade cauda equina tumors. Despite incomplete surgery, 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates following radical radiotherapy were both 59%, and cause-specific survival rates were 69% at 5 years and 62% at 10 years. This suggests that radiotherapy may achieve long-term tumor control in over half of those patients with residual spinal ependymoma. 
The morphometric histopathology of undescended testes and testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernia: a comparative study. The underlying injury to undescended testes may be hormonal, a transient perinatal form fruste of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism characterized by blunting of the surge in gonadotropins normally seen at age 60 to 90 days. Ischemia is the underlying injury to testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernias. To determine if the histopathology of these 2 injuries is different histomorphometric analyses were performed on semithin microscopic sections of biopsies of 21 control testes, 17 undescended testes and 13 intrascrotal testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernias. The infants in all groups were 30 to 120 days old. The results showed that, as in previous studies, undescended testes at this age are characterized by hypoplasia of Leydig cells, normal germ cell counts and defective maturation of gonocytes into adult dark spermatogonia. In contrast, testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernias were characterized by hyperplasia of Leydig cells, reduced germ cell counts and normal maturation of gonocytes into adult dark spermatogonia. One might conclude that the underlying injury of undescended testes, presumably the blunted surge of gonadotropins, causes a primary hypoplasia and hypofunction of Leydig cells, which in turn causes a secondary defect in transformation of gonocytes into spermatogonia. In contrast, ischemia may primarily cause a tubular epithelial lesion leaving the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis intact and allowing normal transformation of gonocytes into spermatogonia. Reduced gonadotropins and ischemia appear to produce distinctly different primary and secondary pathophysiological effects on the testes. 
Laser-assisted angioplasty in the treatment of prosthetic graft stenosis. Late failure of peripheral bypass grafts has been treated primarily by secondary reconstruction. Laser-assisted angioplasty is an optional therapy that the authors investigated in 28 prosthetic grafts over a two-year period. Twenty-five symptomatic patients with 28 peripheral prosthetic arterial bypass grafts (25 polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] grafts and 1 each of knitted Dacron, Teflon, and umbilical vein) demonstrated graft occlusion (25) or high-grade stenoses (3). All patients underwent standard laser-assisted angioplasty using a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser source and hybrid probe. Twenty-one grafts (75%) were successfully recanalized with adequate restoration of flow through the conduit. All 7 failures were in occluded PTFE grafts that presented with either recalcitrant lesions (5) or perforations (2) at the distal anastomoses. There have been 3 long-term failures (14%) to date in the successfully treated group, all in PTFE grafts. Two patients suffered recurrent thrombosis and 1 developed an inexplicable graft infection five months after laser treatment. Laser-assisted angioplasty appears to be a clinically viable alternative treatment for prosthetic graft stenosis and recanalization of grafts occluded at their distal anastomosis. 
In vivo use of a radioiodinated somatostatin analogue: dynamics, metabolism, and binding to somatostatin receptor-positive tumors in man Somatostatin analogues, labeled with gamma-emitting radionuclides, are of potential value in the localization of somatostatin receptor-positive tumors with gamma camera imaging. We investigated the application in man of a radioiodinated analogue of somatostatin, 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide, which has similar biologic characteristics as the native peptide. The radiopharmaceutical is cleared rapidly from the circulation (up to 85% of the dose after 10 min) mainly by the liver. Liver radioactivity is rapidly excreted into the biliary system. Until 3 hr after injection, radioactivity in the circulation is mainly in the form of 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide. Thereafter, plasma samples contain increasing proportions of free iodide. Similarly, during the first hours after injection, radioactivity in the urine exists mainly in the form of the unchanged peptide. Thereafter, a progressive increase in radioiodide excretion is observed, indicating degradation of the radiopharmaceutical in vivo. Fecal excretion of radioactivity amounts to only a few percent of the dose. The calculated median effective dose equivalent is comparable with values for applications of other 123I-radiopharmaceuticals (0.019 mSv/MBq). 
Myocardial echinococcosis with perforation into the pericardium. Though rare, cardiac echinococcosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of cardiac tumors, particularly in patients originating from endemic areas or with manifestation of hydatid disease in other organs. Diagnosis and localisation of the cysts is best accomplished with non-invasive methods such as 2-D transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography and NMR. Excision of the cardiac cyst from the interventricular septum in a 21 year old patient with polyvisceral echinococcosis was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass. Adjunctive medical therapy with mebendazol is being continued for 24 months postoperatively. Twelve months after surgery the patient is asymptomatic without echocardiographic signs of recurrence. 
Vitamin B6 is effective therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. Fifty-nine women completed a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study of pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Thirty-one patients received vitamin B6, 25-mg tablets orally every 8 hours for 72 hours, and 28 patients received placebo in the same regimen. Patients were categorized according to the presence of vomiting: severe nausea (score greater than 7) or mild to moderate nausea (score of 7 or less). The severity of nausea (as graded on a visual analogue scale of 1-10 cm) and the number of patients with vomiting over a 72-hour period were used to evaluate response to therapy. Twelve of 31 patients in the vitamin B6 group had a pre-treatment nausea score greater than 7 (severe) (mean 8.2 +/- 0.8), as did ten of 28 patients in the placebo group (mean 8.7 +/- 0.9) (not significant). Following therapy, there was a significant difference in the mean "difference in nausea" score (ie, baseline - post-therapy nausea) between patients with severe nausea receiving vitamin B6 (mean 4.3 +/- 2.1) and placebo (mean 1.8 +/- 2.2) (P less than .01). In patients with mild to moderate nausea and in the group as a whole, no significant difference between treatment and placebo was observed. Fifteen of 31 vitamin B6-treated patients had vomiting before therapy, compared with ten of 28 in the placebo group (not significant). At the completion of 3 days of therapy, only eight of 31 patients in the vitamin B6 group had any vomiting, compared with 15 of 28 patients in the placebo group (P less than .05). 
Effect of otitis media on infrared tympanic thermometry. This study was designed to determine if temperature readings using a new tympanic thermometer are affected by otitis media. These readings were also compared to a rectal or oral temperature. Eighty-four children with unilateral suppurative or non-suppurative otitis media diagnosed clinically by their pediatricians were enrolled in the study. Temperatures were measured in both ears using the Thermoscan PRO-1 Instant Thermometer and rectally or orally by a glass or electronic predictive thermometer. For 67 children with unilateral suppurative otitis media the mean temperature in infected ears was 0.38 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in uninfected ears (p = .005). Neither temperatures measured in affected nor those from unaffected ears differed significantly from oral or rectal control readings. For 17 children with unilateral non-suppurative otitis media there was no statistically significant difference between temperatures in affected and unaffected ears or between the temperatures in either ear and the oral or rectal control. Our data show that temperatures taken in ears with suppurative otitis media are slightly higher than those in normal ears. This difference is of minimal clinical significance and does not affect the accuracy when compared to oral or rectal control readings. 
Electrophysiologic analysis of early Parkinson's disease. We have been interested in the application of quantitative measures of motor performance as a possible means of early detection of Parkinson's disease. To assess motor function, we have measured movement time (the physiologic correlate of bradykinesia) and reaction time (simple and directional choice) with an upper limb motor task, and tremor with accelerometry and electromyographic recordings. In this report we describe preliminary data from a Parkinson's disease patient group with symptoms of fewer than 2 years' average duration (compared with an age- and gender-matched normal control group) which indicate that precise, quantitative tests of motor function can detect the slight deviations from normal that are present in early Parkinson's disease. It appears that tests of bradykinesia are most sensitive, and detection of rest tremor is most specific. These tests may be applicable in screening individuals who are suspected of having or are "at risk for" Parkinson's disease and other related disorders. 
Inguinal endometriosis: pathogenetic and clinical implications. In six women with a preoperative diagnosis of incarcerated hernia, surgical exploration of the groin revealed inguinal endometriosis and no hernia. The affected structure was always the extraperitoneal portion of the round ligament. Six of the seven lesions were on the right. Intraperitoneal endometriosis was demonstrated in all patients. Catamenial pain was the pathognomonic symptom in the differential diagnosis of the inguinal mass. Gynecologists and surgeons should bear in mind the possibility that endometriosis may be the cause of symptoms of a suspected incarcerated inguinal hernia. Should this disease be detected at inguinal exploration, a laparoscopy is indicated during the same operation. 
Malignant hepatic tumors: P-31 MR spectroscopy with one-dimensional chemical shift imaging. To determine the clinical feasibility and applicability of phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and to assess its potential for characterization of human hepatic tissue, one-dimensional chemical shift imaging (CSI) was performed in 37 patients with various malignant hepatic neoplasms (30 metastases from a variety of primary tumors and seven hepatocellular carcinomas) and seven healthy volunteers. Tumors were grouped according to the percentage of the analyzed section that was occupied by tumor: less than 50% (group A) or more than 50% (group B). In group B, all phosphomonoester/beta-adenosine triphosphate ratios were significantly higher than normal (P less than .001). Hepatocellular carcinomas and metastases from various primary neoplasms could not be differentiated on the basis of spectral characteristics and metabolite ratios. Limitations of one-dimensional surface coil CSI prevented separation of spectra of small tumors and tumors deep within the liver parenchyma from spectra of normal liver parenchyma. 
Monocyte zinc and in vitro prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-1 beta production by cultured peripheral blood monocytes in patients with Crohn's disease. This study investigated the relationship between zinc status and prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-1 beta production by cultured monocytes in patients with Crohn's disease. Monocyte zinc was significantly decreased in both 12 inpatients and 22 outpatients compared with controls (P less than 0.001) but lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear cell zinc were normal. When cultured monocytes from 10 outpatients with Crohn's disease were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, prostaglandin E2 production increased markedly, coupled with a fall in monocyte zinc. In matched controls, prostaglandin E2 production was significantly less and monocyte zinc remained stable. No difference in interleukin-1 release was noted between patients and controls. The addition of prednisolone to cell cultures suppressed prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1 synthesis, and monocyte zinc did not change. Zinc chloride augmented prostaglandin E2 production in patients, but not controls, and interleukin-1 remained stable. These results demonstrate a link between low monocyte zinc concentration and excessive prostaglandin production in patients with Crohn's disease. 
Depression and chronic fatigue in the workplace. Workers' compensation and occupational issues. There is ample evidence that some forms of depression can be caused or aggravated by work. The relationship of work and chronic fatigue syndrome is questionable, but elements at work can aggravate the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. The role of physicians who can support or discourage beliefs about physical illness is all important, both by what they say and how they treat. In the process of interaction, they can promote or discourage disability. The role of the physician in the workplace is to determine if an illness is work related, if it is disabling, if it requires treatment, and what treatment. The physician must advise if the worker can continue in his or her usual and customary employment and, if not, if he or she can be vocationally rehabilitated from a medical standpoint. Conditions in which physical symptoms are unsupported by physical findings and have diagnostic labels that describe the disorder without indicating either cause or pathology are especially troubling for the physician who must decide if the patient's job caused the symptoms. 
Practice patterns and costs of hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We conducted an observational study at three hospitals in Boston to examine the patterns of practice and the costs involved in the medical management of noncirrhotic, upper gastrointestinal bleeding. A total of 111 patients were identified and studied: 42 from hospital 1, 38 from hospital 2, and 31 from hospital 3. There were no significant differences in the management of the patients, except for the more frequent use of upper gastrointestinal radiography at hospital 3 and the more frequent use of cimetidine at hospital 2. Only a small percentage (3-7%) of patients required surgery, and overall mortality (0-8%) was low. The average cost of hospitalization, determined by using the New England Medical Center cost model, was calculated for direct costs ($3,180). The majority of costs incurred were for hospital bed or intensive care unit stay (63%) and transfusion of blood products (14%), with costs for physicians' services (9%), endoscopy (2%), and upper gastrointestinal radiography (1%) accounting for only a small percentage. This study demonstrates remarkable similarity in practice patterns and resource utilization at three different hospitals and provides data on the actual costs involved in hospitalization for noncirrhotic, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. 
Surgical correction of coarctation in early infancy: does surgical technique influence the result? Between 1979 and 1988, a total of 53 infants less than 1 year of age underwent repair of coarctation. Thirty-seven patients (70%) were younger than 3 months. Median age was 0.9 month. Four different surgical techniques were used: resection with end-to-end anastomosis, patch enlargement, subclavian flap aortoplasty, and subclavian displacement aortoplasty (Meier-Mendonca technique). Hospital mortality was 7.5% and was limited to patients with additional complex intracardiac defects. Neither age nor surgical technique had an influence on the operative risk. Follow-up averaged 15 to 43 months for the four different groups. Restenosis developed in 9 (19%) of 47 patients regularly followed up, 5 (11%) of whom have had reoperation. Age at operation was not a predictor for restenosis, which occurred in 17.4% of patients less than 1 month and 20.8% of those greater than 1 month of age at operation. Patch enlargement and the subclavian displacement technique demonstrated the highest restenosis rates (42% and 43%, respectively). However, patients who underwent patch enlargement had less favorable pathological conditions. It is concluded that results of coarctation repair in early infancy do not depend as much on the operative method itself as on the specific pathological aspect, which largely determines the method of treatment. Some reservation must be made in regard to the subclavian displacement technique. 
Characterization of target injury of murine acute graft-versus-host disease directed to multiple minor histocompatibility antigens elicited by either CD4+ or CD8+ effector cells. The precise identity of effector mononuclear cells capable of eliciting acute graft-versus-host disease (AGVHD) is controversial. In this study, highly purified subsets of donor T cells were used to produce AGVHD to multiple minor histocompatibility (H) antigens in two strain combinations of mice matched for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In the C3H.SW- greater than B6 strain combination, only CD8+ effector cells produced histologic evidence of AGVHD in skin and liver, which peaked 3 weeks after transplant. In the B10.D2- greater than DBA/2 strain combination, CD4+ effector cells, and to a lesser extent, CD8+ cells, mediated disease in skin, liver, and intestine, which peaked during the fourth week after transplant. Analysis of skin and liver from both combinations showed target cell injury that was phenotypically similar and resembled that previously described in human disease in other studies. In addition, prominent epithelial injury also was detected in oropharyngeal mucosa, esophagus, hepatobiliary ducts, and seminal vesicle in both transplant settings. These findings indicate that functionally different subsets of donor T cells may be capable of initiating common pathways of cellular injury in selected target sites in AGVHD, and have potential implications for strategies that seek to ablate disease development by manipulation of donor marrow before transplantation. 
Diarrhea, respiratory infections, and growth are not affected by a weekly low-dose vitamin A supplement: a masked, controlled field trial in children in southern India. Incidence, duration, and severity of diarrhea and respiratory symptoms were monitored weekly for 1 y in 15,419 children 6-60 mo of age in a randomized, placebo-controlled, masked clinical trial conducted in southern India. Half the children received weekly doses of 8.7 mumol (2500 microgram) vitamin A and 46 mumol (20 mg) vitamin E (treated) and the other half, 46 mumol vitamin E (control). Medical and ocular examinations and anthropometric measurements were obtained before and after 52 wk of intervention. Ocular examinations also were obtained after 26 wk. Supplements were delivered weekly from calibrated dispenser bottles by community health volunteers who also recorded each mother's recall of daily morbidity of her child during the previous week. Baseline characteristics of treated and control subjects were similar and documented a prevalence of 11% xerophthalmia and 72% undernutrition. Weekly treatment with the low-dose vitamin A supplement did not influence the incidence, severity, or duration of diarrhea or respiratory infections and did not influence linear or ponderal growth. 
Alcoholism in women. Women differ from men in their drinking patterns and in the biologic consequences of alcohol use. Women more often drink at home and conceal their drinking behavior. Because women have a higher percentage of body fat and a lower percentage of body water than men, the same amount of alcohol causes more severe toxic effects in women than in men. Heavy alcohol consumption in women is associated with gynecologic dysfunction and fetal alcohol syndrome. Depression, anxiety or other psychiatric illness is also common in women alcoholics. Family physicians should be alert to the subtle behaviors that suggest alcoholism and be familiar with the available community resources and treatment options. 
Transperineurial vessel constriction in an edematous neuropathy. The hypothesis that the accumulation of endoneurial edema can exert forces sufficient to occlude transperineurial vessels was tested using light microscopy and computer-assisted morphometry in rat sciatic nerve. Experimental nerves were exposed to a concentration of 10% procaine HCl, which from previous studies has been demonstrated to routinely produce an edematous neuropathy. For each vessel, a "constriction ratio" was defined by dividing its minimum intraperineurial lumen area by the average for minimum endoneurial and epineurial lumen cross-sectional areas. Constriction ratios were 0.91 +/- 0.26 (mean +/- SD) for control vessels and 0.28 +/- 0.25 for vessels in the procaine group (p less than 0.005). In addition, a strong negative correlation was observed between the morphologic demonstration of nerve edema and the transperineurial vessel constriction ratio (r = -0.85; p less than 0.002). It is concluded that in neuropathies characterized by widespread edema and increased endoneurial fluid pressures, the concomitant constriction of transperineurial vessels could diminish nerve blood flow and facilitate nerve injury. 
Successful long-term control of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome with etoposide. A 38-year-old man with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome had an inadequate response to steroids and severe side effects from hydroxyurea treatment, which necessitated withdrawal of the treatment. Successful control of clinical symptoms and eosinophil counts was obtained with etoposide (VP16-213) for 18 months. VP16-213 may be valuable in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome treatment. 
Pediatric heart transplantation at Stanford: results of a 15-year experience. The long-term results of pediatric heart transplantation were evaluated in 53 patients, aged 0.25 to 18.94 years, who received transplants at Stanford University Medical Center between 1974 and 1989. Indications for transplantation were idiopathic cardiomyopathy (68%), congenital heart disease (21%), endocardial fibroelastosis (8%), and doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (3%). Immunosuppression was achieved with combinations of cyclosporine, prednisone, and azathioprine. Thirty-seven of 42 recipients leaving the hospital after transplantation were alive and in New York Heart Association class I at study's end. Cumulative survival was 79% at 1 year, 76% at 3 years, and 69% at 5 years. Fourteen recipients have survived more than 5 years (5.1 to 12.4 years). Hospital readmission for illness has been infrequent, decreasing from 6.8 days to 0.9 days per year over 5 years. Eleven patients have required no rehospitalization. Posttransplant deaths were due to infection (19%), rejection (4%), pulmonary hypertension (4%), coronary artery disease (2%), and lymphoproliferative disease (2%). Retransplantation was required for intractable rejection in 4 patients and advanced coronary artery disease in 2. Hypertension and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were common in individuals receiving cyclosporine. Growth was often impaired in prepubertal children receiving daily prednisone. Based on this 15-year experience, it is concluded that heart transplantation represents a reasonable alternative for selected young patients with end-stage cardiac disease. 
The noncemented porous-coated hip prosthesis. A three-year clinical follow-up study and roentgenographic analysis. This was a retrospective study reviewing 68 hip arthroplasties performed with noncemented, porous-coated components at three institutions in the period between December 1983 and June 1987. Fifty of these were available for follow-up study. The mean follow-up period was three years (range, 18-56 months). Thirty-seven patients were treated by total hip arthroplasty (THA) with porous-coated components, and thirteen were implanted with porous-coated femoral stems with bipolar endoprostheses using a porous-coated femoral stem and a universal head. The mean Harris hip score at follow-up evaluation for the entire group was 85.7 points. Eighty percent of the patients had either a good or excellent result. Those patients implanted with a porous femoral stem with bipolar acetabular components had only 54% good or excellent results compared with 90% good or excellent results for those having THA. Roentgenographic findings included a 59% rate of femoral neck cortex osteopenia, an 80% rate of medial or lateral distal cortical hypertrophy, and an 80% rate of distal bone bridging. All of these roentgenographic changes were secondary to changes in stress transference to the proximal femur. There was no correlation between thigh pain or the degree of bone-prosthesis radiolucencies and the fit of the femoral stem. 
General moderate hypothermia in the surgical treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. The diagnosis and surgical treatment of aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta is difficult and some aspects of management remain controversial. We report 53 patients treated in the period 1983-1988; 25.9% of them had previously been erroneously diagnosed as having mediastinal cysts or tumours. Duplex scanning and computerised tomography were valuable adjuncts in establishing the correct diagnosis, which was confirmed by aortography in 52 patients. Of 49 patients operated upon electively three died with a mortality rate of 6.1%; of the 4 patients operated upon as emergencies 2 died. Fifty patients survived the operative procedure and of the 3 operated upon under normothermia 1 developed paraplegia, whereas of the 47 patients operated upon under moderate hypothermia (30 degrees-31 degrees C) only 1 developed paraplegia. 
Concentration of cefuroxime in serum and middle ear effusion after single dose treatment with cefuroxime axetil. Antimicrobial agents play an important role in the treatment of patients with acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion (OME). The study was undertaken to determine the concentrations of cefuroxime in the blood and middle ear effusions (MEE) of children between 6 and 12 years of age with acute otitis media and chronic OME after a single oral dose administration of cefuroxime axetil, the ester prodrug of cefuroxime. Cefuroxime axetil (250 mg) was administered 2 to 6 hours before either myringotomy for acute otitis media or myringotomy and tube insertion for chronic OME. Blood samples and middle ear aspirates were obtained from 31 children and the samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Cefuroxime was recovered in measurable concentrations in all serum samples and in 15 (79%) of the 19 MEE specimens analyzed. No correlation was seen between cefuroxime MEE concentrations and effusion type, bacteriology or serum concentrations. This study shows that cefuroxime does penetrate into MEE when OME is present and that therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in some patients. 
Symptom reporting in wanted and unwanted pregnancies. This study examined the association between unwanted pregnancy and the reporting of pregnancy symptoms in a sample of 99 pregnant women drawn from an urban, medical school based family practice residency. Of these women, 51 had unwanted pregnancies, and 48 had wanted pregnancies. Women with wanted pregnancies were more likely than women with unwanted pregnancies to report three pregnancy symptoms (amenorrhea, breast tenderness, and morning sickness). This association of symptoms with a wanted pregnancy persisted after controlling for age, race, marital status, contraceptive use, menstrual irregularity, and days since last menses through multiple logistic regression. Findings suggest that symptoms may be underreported by women with unwanted pregnancies. 
Current treatment for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: results and surgical implications. From July 1986 to January 1991, 123 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome underwent operation for ablation of aberrant conduction pathways. There were 85 male and 38 female patients ranging in age from 11 months to 68 years. Associated anomalies included Ebstein's anomaly, sudden death syndrome, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, abdominal aortic aneurysm, neurofibromatosis, other arrhythmias, or other complex congenital heart disease. Forty-one patients had multiple accessory pathways. Operative results showed a 7% initial failure rate, which dropped to 3% after reoperation. One patient had undergone previous operation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome at another institution. Procedures performed concomitantly included mitral or tricuspid valve repair or replacement (6), right ventricular conduit replacement, subaortic resection, Fontan repair, corrected transposition repair, coronary artery bypass, and placement of an automatic internal cardioverter defibrillator. There was no operative mortality. Late follow-up is 27 +/- 16 months, and complications included mitral regurgitation and myocardial infarction. By comparison, in the last 12 months 124 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome underwent catheter ablation using radiofrequency current. There were 9 patients with multiple pathways. One hundred twelve patients (90%) had all accessory atrioventricular connections ablated and have remained free of symptomatic tachycardia. There have been 12 failures (10%), of which 5 have had operation and 7 are being treated medically. Mean follow-up is 7 +/- 5 months, and complications included circumflex coronary artery occlusion, excessive bleeding, valve perforation, and cerebral vascular accident. 
Assessment of aortic and pulmonic stenosis by echocardiography. Doppler and imaging echocardiography are highly useful methods of identifying and quantifying both aortic and pulmonic stenosis. The presence of valve stenosis and associated regurgitation is based on detecting abnormal intracardiac velocity patterns near the affected valve. Defining the specific valve involved and the type of lesion present is based on determining the location and timing of the abnormal velocities. Both color flow imaging and duplex pulsed Doppler with two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging are highly accurate in identifying the lesions present. Quantification of the severity of stenotic lesions requires calculation of the pressure gradient across the valve and estimation of valve area; quantification of volume flow rate is frequently helpful. The pressure gradient is calculated from high velocity data acquired in the stenotic valve orifice by using the Bernoulli equation. Volume flow rate through the valve can be estimated by using Doppler velocity data and two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging data acquired at sites upstream from the stenotic valve. The continuity equation allows calculation of valve area that is based on this noninvasive stroke volume and pressure gradient data. This review characterizes flow patterns present near stenotic valves, discusses the equations required to quantify aortic and pulmonic stenosis, and then describes the clinical approach to the noninvasive quantification of both stenotic lesions. 
Pearly penile papules: absence of human papillomavirus DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. Pearly penile papules clinically resemble the sexually transmitted papular variant of genital condylomata. Histologically, however, pearly penile papules consist of fibropapillomata that lack the characteristic morphologic features of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. To study the possible association of HPV infections with pearly penile papules, we examined tissue specimens from 13 men with pearly penile papules with and without associated penile condylomata. Biopsy specimens were tested for the presence of HPV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. None of the pearly penile papules contained HPV DNA sequences, whereas four of seven cases clinically suspected of being condylomata associated with pearly penile papules contained HPV DNA. These results confirm that pearly penile papule lesions do not contain HPV DNA; therefore, the distinction between pearly penile papules and penile condylomata is clinically significant. 
Decreased plasticity of glucoregulatory responses in aged rats: effects of chronic stress. These experiments were conducted to determine the effects of age and chronic stress on the ability of rats to attenuate stimulus-induced glucose and insulin responses during repeated exposure to a mild stressor. Young (5-month) and old (21-month) Fischer 344 male rats were either exposed to intermittent sessions of an escapable footshock stress for 3 months, or to no chronic stress. Afterwards, blood samples were obtained from each rat before, during, and after the first and fourth exposure to a novel motion stimulus. Between the first and the fourth exposure to the motion stimulus a pronounced attenuation of glucose and insulin responses was seen in both groups of young rats, and in old chronically stressed rats, but not in old control animals. Thus, it appears that the adverse effects of aging on plasticity of glucoregulatory response processes were significantly diminished by exposure of the animals to periodic challenges from their external environment. 
Prognostic significance of atrial fibrillation in advanced heart failure. A study of 390 patients. BACKGROUND. Atrial fibrillation is common in advanced heart failure, but its prognostic significance is controversial. METHODS AND RESULTS. We evaluated the relation of atrial rhythm to overall survival and sudden death in 390 consecutive advanced heart failure patients. Etiology of heart failure was coronary artery disease in 177 patients (45%) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease in 213 patients (55%). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.19 +/- 0.07. Seventy-five patients (19%) had paroxysmal (26 patients) or chronic (49 patients) atrial fibrillation. Compared with patients with sinus rhythm, patients with atrial fibrillation did not differ in etiology of heart failure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on therapy, or embolic events but were more likely to be receiving warfarin and antiarrhythmic drugs and had a slightly higher left ventricular ejection fraction. After a mean follow-up of 236 +/- 303 days, 98 patients died: 56 (57%) died suddenly, and 36 (37%) died of progressive heart failure. Actuarial 1-year overall survival was 68%, and sudden death-free survival was 79%. Actuarial survival was significantly worse for atrial fibrillation than for sinus rhythm patients (52% versus 71%, p = 0.0013). Similarly, sudden death-free survival was significantly worse for atrial fibrillation than for sinus rhythm patients (69% versus 82%, p = 0.0013). By Cox proportional hazards model, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation were independent risk factors for total mortality and sudden death. For patients who had pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of less than 16 mm Hg on therapy, atrial fibrillation was associated with poorer 1-year survival (44% versus 83%, p = 0.00001); however, in the high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure group, atrial fibrillation did not confer an increased risk (58% versus 57%). CONCLUSIONS. Atrial fibrillation is a marker for increased risk of death, especially in heart failure patients who have lower filling pressures on vasodilator and diuretic therapy. Whether aggressive attempts to maintain sinus rhythm will reduce this risk is unknown. 
Limitation of no reflow injury by blood-free reperfusion with oxygenated perfluorochemical (Fluosol-DA 20%). This study was designed to assess the effects of blood-free reperfusion with oxygenated or unoxygenated intracoronary perfluorochemical (Fluosol-DA 20%) on myocardial perfusion and to determine its mechanism or mechanisms of limiting no reflow. Twenty-four dogs underwent 90 min of coronary occlusion followed by 210 min of reperfusion and were randomized to either: 1) blood-free reperfusion with intracoronary oxygenated perfluorochemical (20 ml/kg per min) for 20 min followed by blood reperfusion (n = 8); 2) intracoronary unoxygenated perfluorochemical administered as in those treated with oxygenated perfluorochemical (n = 8); and 3) blood reperfusion alone (control) (n = 8). Regional myocardial blood flow was serially determined and global myocardial perfusion was assessed by an intravenous injection of the fluorescent dye (thioflavin-S). Quantitative studies were performed to determine neutrophil infiltration and extent of endothelial injury. Hemodynamic variables were similar in all groups. The zone of impaired perfusion (thioflavin negative), expressed as a percent of the left ventricle, averaged 10 +/- 2%, 6 +/- 2% and 3 +/- 1%, in control and unoxygenated and oxygenated perfluorochemical groups, respectively (control versus oxygenated perfluorochemical p less than 0.004). The reduction in thioflavin-negative area with oxygenated perfluorochemical was associated with a notable recovery of endocardial blood flow (0.97 +/- 0.22 vs. control 0.39 +/- 0.08 ml/min per g; p less than 0.04) at 210 min of reperfusion. The number of capillaries plugged by neutrophils (per 200 capillaries) in thioflavin-negative areas was similar with both oxygenated (5.9 +/- 1.4) and unoxygenated perfluorochemical (5.4 +/- 0.8) treatment and was significantly less than that with the control group (18.9 +/- 3.2, p less than 0.003). 
Estrogen and estrogen receptors in thyroid carcinomas. Thyroid tissues, composed of normal thyroid (10 cases), Graves' thyroid (4), and papillary carcinoma (10), were measured for the presence of receptors for estrogen (ER) using an enzyme-immunoassay method. The mean value of ER in papillary carcinoma tissues (4.0 +/- 3.6 fmol/mg protein) was higher than that in normal thyroid tissues (0.8 +/- 0.4 fmol/mg protein) or that in Graves' thyroids (2.6 +/- 0.9 fmol/mg protein). In 10 papillary carcinomas, 3 were from male patients and 7 were from females. The mean value of ER in the tumors from male patients (7.2 +/- 5.1 fmol/mg protein) was higher than that from female patients (2.6 +/- 1.7 fmol/mg protein). Another set of 100 thyroid tissues from normal (20 cases), Graves' disease (10), follicular adenoma (8), and papillary carcinoma (62) was also examined for the presence of estradiol (E2) using an immunohistochemical method on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. E2-positive tissues were found in 4 (40%) of 10 Graves' thyroids, 4 (50%) of 8 adenomas, and 47 (76%) of 62 papillary carcinomas. In 62 papillary carcinomas, E2-positive tissues were found in 37 (73%) of 51 female patients and 10 (91%) of 11 male patients. In relation to relapse of the carcinomas, E2-positive carcinomas were found in 10 (71%) of 14 patients with relapse of the disease and in 14 (54%) of 26 patients with no relapse (the difference was not significant). The findings indicate that thyroid carcinomas may be estrogen-dependent, but no definite conclusions could be drawn between the biological behavior of the tumors and the E2-positivity. 
Urinary cotinine measurement in patients with Buerger's disease--effects of active and passive smoking on the disease process. Although Buerger's disease is known to be closely related to smoking, no objective analysis of the smoke-associated problems has been performed. In this study, cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine, was used as a sensitive marker to measure levels of active smoking and the exposure of nonsmokers to tobacco smoke because it has a relatively long half-life and because cotinine levels can be determined by noninvasive means in urine. According to urinary cotinine levels, 40 patients with Buerger's disease were classified as (1) smokers: those with urinary cotinine levels above 50 ng/mg creatinine; (2) passive smokers: those with levels between 10 and 50 ng/mg creatinine; and (3) nonsmokers who did not experience noticeable passive smoking: those with levels below 10 ng/mg creatinine. There were 10 smokers, 9 passive smokers, and 21 nonsmokers. The course of the disease, after the initial treatment at our hospital, was studied retrospectively. Seven of the 10 smokers, none of the 9 passive smokers, and 4 of the 21 nonsmokers experienced aggravation of the disease. Of the four nonsmokers who experienced aggravation, three had still been smokers and one had been exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace at the time of relapse. There was a significant difference in the aggravation rate between the smokers' group and the other two groups. Among the smokers, the seven patients whose conditions worsened showed significantly higher cotinine levels than the three remaining patients who were in the stage of remission. 
Incidence and outcome of surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia among residents of Rochester, Minnesota: 1980-87. A population-based study. The incidence and outcome of surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was studied in Rochester, Minnesota, during the period 1980-1987. Three hundred thirty Rochester men without a diagnosis of prostate or bladder cancer underwent prostatectomy for BPH for the first time. Mean and median ages were both seventy (range: 46-95). The incidence of initial prostatectomy for BPH among men forty-five years of age and older age-adjusted to the 1980 U.S. white male population was 642 cases per 100,000 persons per year (py). Among the 330 men undergoing initial prostatectomy for BPH, 14 (4.2%) had serious intraoperative complications, 32 (9.7%) were rehospitalized for urologic complications within thirty days of surgery, and 13 (3.9%) had other serious complications within thirty days after surgery, including 1 death (surgical mortality 0.3%). Forty-five patients (14%) required blood transfusions within thirty days of surgery. The likelihood of reoperation within six years of the initial surgery was 15.1 percent (95% CI 9.7, 20.6). Short- and long-term postoperative mortality was not statistically significantly different than expected based on age- and sex-specific mortality statistics for Rochester, Minnesota. 
Cerebral haemorrhage in a French prospective population study. The incidence of cerebral haemorrhage was studied from a population-based stroke registry. The incidence was 12.3 per 100,000 per year in women and 13.9 per 100,000 per year in men, with a peak in the eighth decade and a male preponderance. Haemorrhages were deep seated and mostly due to hypertension. Recognised clinical characteristics of haemorrhage are acute onset, convulsion, vomiting, and disturbed consciousness. This study showed that cerebral haemorrhage may present with pure motor deficit or transient deficit preceding the stroke. The mortality was 51% in the first month, and 61% by two years. 
Torticollis in children. Torticollis is a common clinical sign that is found in a variety of disorders. Childhood torticollis differs from the adult form in that congenital types are common and many frequently encountered disorders found in adults are unusual. Pediatric torticollis related to otolaryngologic conditions is reviewed, and three illustrative cases are presented. 
Peritonitis due to Rhizopus in a patient undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. A 61-year-old man who had end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension developed peritonitis due to infection with Rhizopus as a complication of receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). At the onset of infection, the patient was neither acidemic nor hyperglycemic; in addition, deferoxamine had not been administered and Elastoplast dressings had not been applied. The infection occurred after the technique for disinfection of the catheter used for CAPD had been changed. The catheter was removed, and therapy with amphotericin B was initiated. Although the patient died of apparently unrelated causes, an autopsy revealed active fungal infection with multiple abscesses and superficial invasion of the ileal wall. 
Pouchitis--is it a wastebasket diagnosis? Pouchitis is a poorly defined syndrome that is unique to patients with an ileal reservoir. During a prospective follow-up review of 215 patients who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, pouchitis was diagnosed in 30 patients (14 percent). Based on the clinical course, two distinct patterns of pouchitis were recognized: patients who experienced two or fewer episodes (Group 1-18 patients) and patients who experienced at least three episodes (Group 2-12 patients). Histopathologic review of resected colons revealed a preponderance of indeterminate colitis in patients in Group 2 (58.3 percent) compared with patients in Group 1 (0 percent). In Group 1; 88.9 percent of patients responded to therapy with metronidazole. Only 25 percent of patients in Group 2 responded to metronidazole alone. Most patients in Group 2 required sulfasalazine, topical steroids, or both. Of the 30 patients with pouchitis, four (13.3 percent) had a distinct endoscopic pattern of distal inflammation. This subset of patients with short strip pouchitis was successfully treated with topical steroid preparations. The clinical differences suggest different causes of pouchitis in these two groups. 
Capillary haemangiomas: an approach to their management. Twenty-five children with eyelid haemangiomas were reviewed. Fifteen patients with enlarging lesions thought to be at risk of causing amblyopia were treated with intralesional steroids as soon after presentation as possible. This appeared to reduce significantly the incidence of amblyopia. Surgery was reserved for older children in whom no further involution of the lesion was expected. 
Snoring and the risk of ischemic brain infarction. To determine if a history of snoring is a risk factor for brain infarction, I conducted a case-control study of risk factors for ischemic stroke using 177 consecutive male patients aged 16-60 (mean 49) years with acute brain infarction. For each patient I chose an age-matched (+/- 6 years) male control. Arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, snoring (habitually or often), and heavy drinking (greater than 300 g/wk) were risk factors in the stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio of snoring for brain infarction was 2.13. By McNemar's test this association increased strongly if a history of sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, and obesity were all present with snoring (odds ratio 8.00). My study indicates that snoring may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke, possibly because of the higher prevalence of an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome among snorers than nonsnorers. 
Temperature-dependent modulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression in cultured human astroglial cells by dexamethasone and indomethacin. In bacterial meningitis, LPS induces production in cerebrospinal fluid of the cytokines IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), which are the principle mediators of meningeal inflammation. IL-1 beta and TNF alpha induce fever, and elevated temperature may affect cytokine expression. Dexamethasone treatment improves outcome in bacterial meningitis possibly by inhibiting IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. In this report, the effects of elevated temperature and dexamethasone on LPS-stimulated IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA gene expression and protein synthesis were studied in human astrocytoma cell lines and primary cultures of human fetal astrocytes. Cells cultured at 40 degrees C exhibited smaller peaks of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha transcription and protein synthesis compared with cells cultured at 37 degrees C. The addition of dexamethasone before, during, or after exposure of the cells to LPS resulted in temperature-dependent inhibition of IL-1 beta transcription and protein synthesis. The most extensive inhibition occurred in pretreated cells cultured at 37 degrees C. Cotreatment with LPS and dexamethasone also inhibited TNF alpha mRNA transcription at both temperatures. The effects of another antiinflammatory agent, indomethacin, on LPS induction of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA were temperature and cell line dependent. These findings provide a possible explanation for the efficacy of dexamethasone treatment of bacterial meningitis and support the proposal that fever may be beneficial to the host in this disease. 
Anal tonometry: a quick method of anal manometry. Evaluation of anal sphincter tonic activity is important in the proctologic clinic. However, manometric techniques are expensive, complex, and only available in some centers. Because there is often an in-office need for having objective measurements of anal tonic activity, in our clinic we introduced a simple method for measurement of anal pressures. This method is based on the flow of air in an open circuit by using a rubber probe with a side opening at one end. Pressure is assessed by an ordinary manometric gauge for arterial pressure. With this simple instrument, the following parameters are measured: 1) anal resting pressure, 2) squeeze pressure, 3) functional length of the anal canal, and 4) descent of the perineum on staining. After testing the technique in 100 healthy persons, it was applied to 130 patients with several proctologic disorders. Differences in pressures were found between controls and patients with anal fissure (high resting pressures), and patients with anal incontinence (low resting and/or squeeze pressures). A correlation was also found between the descending perineum measured by this method and by defecography. This simple instrument is useful in the office as the first approach to the function of the anal sphincters and the pelvic floor. Nowadays, so-called anal tonometry is part of the proctologic examination in our department, because it is simple, reliable, and takes only a few minutes. 
Analysis of inflammatory cells and complement C3 in bupivacaine-induced myonecrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis of the inflammatory cells and complement C3 in the rat skeletal muscle was performed chronologically in bupivacaine-induced myonecrosis. At 30 minutes after injection, polymorphonuclear leukocytes appeared and increased in number, with a peak value at 12 hours, while macrophages reached the highest level at 2 days. In contrast, T cells comprised only a small population. Two weeks after the injection, all types of the inflammatory cells returned to the normal level. Deposition of complement C3 was recognized at 60 minutes at the surface membrane of degenerating muscle fiber. Our observation suggests the importance of both polymorphonuclear leukocytes and complement C3 in the early stage, and macrophages in the later stage of bupivacaine-induced myonecrosis. In addition, our findings cast doubt on the pathological significance of T cells in this model. 
Anterior urethral polyp associated with hematuria in six-year-old child. Anterior urethral polyps are rare, occur only in male patients, and have been associated with obstruction, terminal hematuria, and enuresis. We believe this is the fifth reported case of anterior urethral polyp associated with terminal hematuria. The radiographic findings, treatment, and pathology are reviewed. 
Toward an integrated understanding of fibromyalgia syndrome. II. Psychological and phenomenological aspects. The present paper is the second of a 2-part series in which extant empirical literature concerning fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is reviewed in order to provide a preliminary approach to forming an integrated understanding of the syndrome. Research on psychological disturbance in FS is reviewed with particular emphasis on affective dysfunction among FS patients. The phenomenology of FS is then described. We attempt to suggest that FS represents a quantitatively and qualitatively experience distinct from similar chronic pain syndromes. Substantive findings in FS research are summarized in the final section and potential ways in which these findings might be integrated to provide a more cohesive model for future research are suggested. 
Protracted outbreak of severe delta hepatitis: experience in an isolated Amerindian population of the Upper Orinoco basin. In an investigation of a 21-year-old epidemic of severe hepatitis, 80 serum samples were studied from two isolated Yanomami Amerindian populations of the Upper Orinoco basin in Venezuela. Of the assayed samples, 30.6% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), 53.7% were considered to reflect immunity to infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and only 16.2% were believed to reflect susceptibility to HBV infection; 82.5% of the samples tested positive for any marker of HBV infection. Thirty-one (39.7%) of 78 samples were also positive for antibody to delta antigen, including 91.6% of those positive for HBsAg and 20.9% of those immune to HBV. Our findings provide evidence of a high prevalence of HBV infection in this population. Furthermore, the high prevalence of antibody to delta antigen strongly suggests that coinfections with HBV or superinfections with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in HBV carriers may be an important factor in the occurrence of an unusually high number of cases of fulminant hepatitis and of chronic liver disease. Serum samples obtained at the beginning of the outbreak 13 years earlier from 36 selected cases in the same population revealed a high rate of HBV infection (96.5%). All six HBsAg carriers from whom enough serum remained to be assayed were positive for antibody to delta antigen. Our findings indicate that the outbreak coincided with the introduction of HDV into a population with an already-high prevalence of HBV infection. 
Hepatobiliary cryptosporidiosis and cytomegalovirus infection mimicking metastatic cancer to the liver. A cholestatic syndrome caused by sclerosing cholangitis and papillary stenosis has been described in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatobiliary cryptosporidiosis and cytomegalovirus infection. The case of a 41-year-old homosexual man with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and cholestasis is reported. A percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram showed that the extrahepatic and right-sided intrahepatic ducts were normal. Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver. Guided needle biopsies of several of these lesions showed severe confluent necrotizing pericholangitis with cytomegalovirus-infected cells. Numerous cryptosporidia were seen attached to biliary epithelium. The unique histopathologic and radiographic features of this case should be added to the spectrum of hepatobiliary manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. 
Obstructed central venous catheters. Restoring function with a 12-hour infusion of low-dose urokinase. Thrombotic obstruction frequently prohibits infusion through or withdrawal of blood from central venous catheters and can occur in conjunction with symptomatic thrombosis of the subclavian vein. Thirty catheters were radiographically proved to be obstructed by thrombus and had not responded to at least one instillation of 5000 units of urokinase. All catheters were treated with a 12-hour infusion of urokinase at the rate of 40,000 units/hour. The obstructing thrombus was either eliminated or reduced in size in all instances and full function was restored in all but one catheter. No bleeding complications were seen. Six patients with obstructed catheters also had symptoms of subclavian vein thrombosis. All patients with symptoms of subclavian vein obstruction became asymptomatic on anticoagulant therapy even though no attempt at dissolving the thrombus obstructing the subclavian vein was made. A 12-hour infusion of low doses of urokinase can safely salvage function of obstructed catheters that otherwise may require replacement. Patients with concomitant subclavian vein thrombosis become asymptomatic on anticoagulant therapy without need to dissolve the obstructing thrombus. 
Enhanced tumor growth of both primary and established human and murine tumor cells in athymic mice after coinjection with Matrigel. Previously we found that the reconstituted basement membrane matrix Matrigel, when premixed with human small-cell lung carcinoma cells and injected subcutaneously into athymic mice, permitted tumor growth, whereas cells injected in the absence of Matrigel did not form tumors. In the present study, we examined additional cell types and determined some of the underlying mechanisms involved in the promotion of tumor formation by Matrigel. The tumor cell lines that we studied included transformed mouse Englebreth-Holm-Swarm tumor cells (T-EHS), human submandibular carcinoma A253 cells, mouse melanoma B16F10 cells, human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells, and human primary renal cell carcinoma cells. When coinjected subcutaneously with Matrigel, these cell lines formed rapidly proliferating tumors. Primary biopsy specimens of human colon carcinoma, when dispersed and coinjected with Matrigel, also formed tumors. Only A253, KB, and B16F10 cells formed small tumors in the absence of Martrigel, but a fivefold to tenfold increase in tumor size was observed in the presence of Matrigel. These data demonstrate a useful method for improving the growth of human tumors in athymic mice. 
GM2-gangliosidosis B1 variant: analysis of beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene mutations in 11 patients from a defined region in Portugal. The GM2-gangliosidosis B1 variant occurs at an exceptionally high frequency in the northern part of Portugal. In most patients, the disease manifests itself as a juvenile form, as opposed to the late-infantile form described for many patients from other parts of the world. We have analyzed the beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene in 11 patients, as well as in some relatives, in order to characterize the underlying abnormalities. They were screened for the two previously identified mutations responsible for the B1 variant phenotype (G533----A, also designated as the "DN allele," and C532---T) by PCR amplification of an 800-bp DNA fragment and subsequent dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides. The fragment amplified from one patient was also subcloned and sequenced. Ten patients, constituting a clinically and biochemically homogeneous group, were found to be homozygous for the DN allele. The other, whose clinical profile more resembled the late-infantile phenotype often described in the literature, was a compound heterozygote carrying the DN allele and another, as yet unidentified, abnormal allele. Our results, corroborated by previously published data, suggest that homozygotes and compound heterozygotes for the DN allele may be distinguishable at the phenotypic level, depending on the nature of the abnormality in the other allele. A common ancestral origin for the DN allele can also be postulated. 
Total cavopulmonary anastomosis versus conventional modified Fontan procedure. The total cavopulmonary anastomosis, lateral tunnel Fontan, has been advocated as a preferred method for Fontan type repair. From 1987 to July 1990, 39 patients underwent total cavopulmonary anastomoses (group 1) and 39 patients underwent modified Fontan procedures (group 2); patients receiving adjustable atrial septal defects were excluded. Diagnoses in group 1 included tricuspid atresia in 5 patients, single ventricle in 32, and pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum in 2. Diagnoses in group 2 included tricuspid atresia in 20, single ventricle in 17, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in 1, and pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum in 1. There were no significant differences in age, weight, cross-clamp time, duration of inotropic support, postoperative effusions, or hospital stay between the two groups. Early mortality in group 1 was 7.7% (3/39) and in group 2, 2.6% (1/39). There was no difference in the incidence of early dysrhythmias or early pacemaker placement. Late mortality was 2.8% in group 1 and 8% in group 2 with a mean follow-up of 18 and 25 months, respectively. Follow-up in group 1 revealed 33 patients in normal sinus rhythm and 1 patient with episodes of supraventricular tachycardia; no additional patients have required pacemakers. Follow-up in group 2 revealed 27 patients in normal sinus rhythm and supraventricular tachycardia in 4 patients; 5 additional patients have required pacemaker placement. There is no apparent difference in early outcome between the total cavopulmonary anastomosis and the conventional modified Fontan. However, there appears to be an increased incidence of late dysrhythmias and the need for pacemaker placement in the conventional modified Fontan group compared with the lateral tunnel group. 
Is adult-onset coeliac disease due to a low-grade lymphoma of intraepithelial T lymphocytes? Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma commonly presents with malabsorption, and debate continues as to whether adult-onset coeliac disease (CD) is itself a form of low-grade lymphoma. A 59-year-old man with adult-onset CD required resection of a segment of oedematous jejunum. Histological examination of this tissue revealed an intense intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Immunophenotypic (CD3-, CD4-, CD8-, CD34-, and CD45 RO-) and cytogenetic (deletion of the Y chromosome and chromosome 9) abnormalities were found, together with monoclonal T-cell-receptor gene rearrangements. Some patients with adult-onset CD may have low-grade lymphoma from the outset of their illness. 
Treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts with octreotide. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common and painful complication of chronic pancreatitis. Seven patients (six male, one female; mean age 49.9 years) with chronic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocysts and persistent pain were treated with the pancreatic anti-secretory drug octreotide for 2 weeks. Octreotide caused no notable changes in the size of the pseudocysts of three patients. In the remaining four patients, the pseudocysts decreased in size by a mean of 42% (range 29-52%), and pain disappeared completely. These findings suggest a role for octreotide in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts. 
Intussusception in cystic fibrosis. Two cases of acute intussusception in older children with cystic fibrosis are reported. Both cases presented with symptoms and signs consistent with meconium ileus equivalent, which delayed the final diagnosis. Both cases required abdominal surgery but made full and uneventful recoveries. 
Home monitoring of transcutaneous oxygen tension in the early detection of hypoxaemia in infants and young children. Twenty three patients (age range 0.5-40 months) with recurrent cyanotic episodes underwent physiological recordings, including transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) from a monitor modified for use at home (Kontron 821S). Of 69 episodes in which the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2, Nellcor N200) was less than or equal to 80% for greater than or equal to 20 seconds and/or central cyanosis was present, the TcPO2 monitor alarmed (less than or equal to 20 mmHg or 2.67 kPa) in every episode. The pulse oximeter identified hypoxaemia in 62 out of 69 episodes, failing in seven episodes due to signal loss from movement artefact. In only seven of 69 episodes was there an accompanying apnoeic pause (greater than or equal to 20 seconds), and heart rate fell to less than or equal to 80 beats/minute in only five of 28 episodes in which an electrocardiogram was recorded. In 32 episodes in which SaO2 fell to less than or equal to 60%, the TcPO2 monitor alarmed after a median time interval of 16 seconds (maximum time interval 30 seconds). The TcPO2 monitor was then used in an uncontrolled trial at home in 350 patients at increased risk of sudden death and/or hypoxaemia. Indications for monitoring included apparent life threatening events or cyanotic episodes (n = 163), prematurity and prematurity related disorders (n = 86), and sudden unexpected death in one or more siblings (n = 122). The TcPO2 monitor detected cyanotic episodes at home in 81 patients, 52 of whom received vigorous stimulation and/or mouth to mouth resuscitation. Twenty one of these 52 patients had further hypoxaemic episodes documented in hospital with pulse oximetry. 
How AIDS forces reappraisal of hepatitis B virus control in sub-Saharan Africa For developing countries the cost-benefit of vaccination in the control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is great since the acute infection is generally subclinical and the benefit is the prevention of small numbers of cases of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Since the pattern of HBV infection in Africa is such that, compared with south-east Asia, infection occurs later in childhood and spread is horizontal rather than vertical, investigation of the method of spread of HBV may result in a means of control other than by vaccination. In the meantime, because of the overlap in the means by which HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are spread, it could be worthwhile taking advantage of existing AIDS prevention programmes to educate people about how to avoid both HBV and HIV infections. 
Treatment of oesophageal perforation: a multivariate analysis. Perforation of the oesophagus was retrospectively analysed in 59 patients. Cause and extent of perforation, localization, quality of the oesophageal wall and therapeutic modes were subjected to univariate analysis. The perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus (39) were also subjected to multivariate analysis. Perforation of the cervical oesophagus is seldom lethal and can be adequately treated conservatively in the majority of cases. Perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus can be divided into two groups, with or without simultaneous perforation of the parietal pleura. The optimal treatment for the group with pleural perforation seems to be resection of the oesophagus and secondary reconstruction, although primary closure is indicated in selected early cases. Perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus confined to the mediastinum can be adequately treated conservatively in most patients. Perforation of the intra-abdominal oesophagus should be treated like any other intra-abdominal visceral perforation, by closure or diversion, even if this results in resection of the oesophagus. 
Comparison of the Finapres and direct arterial pressure monitoring during profound hypotensive anaesthesia. The Finapres was compared with direct intraarterial pressure monitoring in 10 patients undergoing local resection of choroidal melanoma, an operation that requires a period of profound hypotension. Good agreement was recorded for systolic arterial pressure and heart rate over a range of pressures. However, agreement of mean and diastolic pressures was poor, with the Finapres tending to overestimate these values. In cases requiring profound hypotension, direct arterial pressure monitoring remains the method of choice. 
The kissing balloon technique with two over-the-wire balloon catheters through a single 8-French guiding catheter. Some of the newer over-the-wire coronary angioplasty catheters have shaft sizes of 3.0 French (F) or less. The inner diameter of modern 8-F guiding catheters is large enough to accommodate two of such balloon catheters. We report a kissing balloon procedure with two over-the-wire catheters through a single 8-F guiding catheter. 
Superior vena caval thrombosis detected by transesophageal echocardiography. Three patients with clinical suspicion of bacterial endocarditis, induced by either pacemaker or indwelling catheter, underwent transesophageal echocardiography. High short-axis cuts through the great vessels, however, revealed the presence of superior vena caval thrombus in all three patients. Transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive in establishing the diagnosis of superior vena caval thrombus than surface echocardiography. Comparison of transesophageal echocardiography with other diagnostic modalities is needed in assessing its overall sensitivity and specificity. 
Antibody to hepatitis C virus in post-transfusion hepatitis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), their relation to outcome, and the seroconversion rate in patients with post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected serum specimens. SETTING: A referral-based university hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty-three consecutive patients who developed non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis after open-heart surgery. All patients had follow-up with serial serum testing and clinical evaluation. The mean (+/- SD) duration of follow-up after hepatitis onset was 81 +/- 33 months (range, 13 to 132 months). Seventeen patients recovered after acute-phase illness, whereas 46 developed chronic disease which, in 30 cases, was confirmed histologically. MAIN RESULTS: Of 32 patients tested before transfusion, 1 (3.1%) had anti-HCV. Fifty-nine (93%) patients were anti-HCV positive during acute-phase hepatitis: Patients with "early" seroconversion (less than 15 days after hepatitis onset) did not differ from those with "late" seroconversion (greater than 60 days after onset) in epidemiologic, clinical, and biochemical features. The rate of anti-HCV positivity during acute-phase illness was not significantly different among patients who recovered (76%) compared with those who developed chronic disease (95%). At 6 to 12 months, patients whose disease resolved had lower antibody activity than those with progressive disease. Further, during long-term follow-up (1 to 9 years), 53% of patients whose disease resolved but only 6.9% of patients who had progressive disease became anti-HCV negative. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C virus is the major cause of post-transfusion hepatitis in Italy. The time to anti-HCV seroconversion varies widely after hepatitis onset and is not significantly associated with acute-phase features or outcome of disease. 
Effect of enalapril on survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions and congestive heart failure. The SOLVD Investigators BACKGROUND. Patients with congestive heart failure have a high mortality rate and are also hospitalized frequently. We studied the effect of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on mortality and hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure and ejection fractions less than or equal to 0.35. METHODS. Patients receiving conventional treatment for heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 1284) or enalapril (n = 1285) at doses of 2.5 to 20 mg per day in a double-bind trial. Approximately 90 percent of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional classes II and III. The follow-up averaged 41.4 months. RESULTS. There were 510 deaths in the placebo group (39.7 percent), as compared with 452 in the enalapril group (35.2 percent) (reduction in risk, 16 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 26 percent; P = 0.0036). Although reductions in mortality were observed in several categories of cardiac deaths, the largest reduction occurred among the deaths attributed to progressive heart failure (251 in the placebo group vs. 209 in the enalapril group; reduction in risk, 22 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 35 percent). There was little apparent effect of treatment on deaths classified as due to arrhythmia without pump failure. Fewer patients died or were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (736 in the placebo group and 613 in the enalapril group; risk reduction, 26 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 18 to 34 percent; P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. The addition of enalapril to conventional therapy significantly reduced mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and reduced ejection fractions. 
Impact of diagnosis-related groups on the quality of postoperative care of patients with neck dissections. Two hundred eighty patients underwent neck dissection over a 10-year period: 138 during the 5-year period before the institution of Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) reimbursement and 142 during the 5 years after DRG regulations. A comparison of these two groups by site of tumor, stage of disease, histopathology, previous treatment, type of neck dissection, whether neck dissection was carried out alone or in combination with another procedure, presence of preexisting disease, postoperative complications, and mortality revealed no significant differences. A 35% reduction in the length of hospital stay from 16 to 10 days was identified in the post-DRG group with no detrimental effects on patient care. The variables found to have the greatest impact on length of hospital stay were the extent of operation and postoperative complications. 
The long distance effects of brain lesions: visualization of axonal pathways and their terminations in the human brain by the Nauta method. This study aims at determining the reliability and the optimal post-injury survival time for the application of the Nauta technique to the analysis of the human brain. The Nauta method reveals the degeneration not only of nerve fibers, myelinated and unmyelinated, but also of their terminations. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural observations appear to prove that the Nauta technique indeed stains axons in human autopsy material. The optimal survival time for the use of the Nauta method was found to be between nine days and five months. In cases with longer survival times--up to 20 months--the Nauta technique and a previously proposed polarizing technique (showing birefringent breakdown products of myelin) can be used as complementary methods. Applying these techniques to the human brain may help define the anatomical basis of neurological and neuropsychological symptoms important for man. 
Amino acid alterations and encephalopathy in the sepsis syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of amino acid profiles in septic encephalopathy. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Medical wards and medical ICU of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with infections and normal mental status were compared with patients with septic shock and altered sensorium. INTERVENTIONS: Plasma amino acid levels and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores were determined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients with septic shock and altered sensorium had higher circulating concentrations of ammonia (425 +/- 55 vs. 127 +/- 7 mmol/L) and the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine (122 +/- 19 vs. 74 +/- 3 mmol/L) and tryptophan (97 +/- 7 vs. 32 +/- 13 mmol/L), and lower levels of the branch-chain amino acid isoleucine (48 +/- 7 vs. 68 +/- 5 mmol/L) than patients with infections and normal sensorium (p less than .05). Aromatic amino acid levels correlated with APACHE II scores (R2 = .4, p less than .001) and mortality. APACHE II scores were higher in the septic shock patients (30 +/- 2 vs. 8 +/- 1, p less than .001), and these patients had a higher mortality rate (71% vs. 12%, p less than .01). Patients with septic shock who died had higher levels of ammonia (524 +/- 58 vs. 227 +/- 40 mmol/L, p less than .05) and sulfur-containing amino acids (172 +/- 31 vs. 61 +/- 7 mmol/L, p less than .05) than patients who survived. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma amino acid profiles appear to be important in septic encephalopathy and the severity of septic disease. 
Clinical significance of two forms of IgM antibody to hepatitis delta virus. Separation of 7-8 S and 19 S forms of serum IgM antibodies to the hepatitis delta virus by rate-zonal centrifugation was carried out on serum from 24 patients with hepatitis delta virus infection: 4 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis; 5 patients with hepatitis delta virus superinfection progressing to chronicity; and 15 patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus. The high molecular weight IgM form (19 S) was predominantly detected in acute hepatitis delta virus cases, whereas the low molecular weight (7 S) form was found in chronic hepatitis delta virus cases. The serological profile of these two forms of IgM antibody to hepatitis delta virus was investigated in serial samples from five patients with acute hepatitis delta virus superinfection that evolved to chronic hepatitis delta virus. We found that, in the acute stage of the disease, the 19 S form was predominant, whereas 6 mo later a predominance of 7-8 S IgM was observed. These results suggest that IgM antibody to hepatitis delta virus antibody forms are different in acute and chronic hepatitis delta virus infection and that their detection only helps in differentiating an acute infection from a chronic infection but not a hepatitis delta virus-hepatitis B virus-HBV coinfection from hepatitis delta virus superinfection in the acute stage of the disease. 
Combined surgical and interventional radiological approach for complex benign biliary tract obstruction. In patients with complicated high benign biliary strictures surgical technique alone cannot exclude the possibility of recurrent problems, and hepatic atrophy/hypertrophy, portal hypertension and intrahepatic stones may all complicate surgical management. A multidisciplinary approach to these complex cases, which minimizes the need for repeated surgical interventions, has been pursued. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed and an extended limb of the jejunum brought to the abdominal wall to allow access for later radiological intervention. Over a 30-month period 58 biliary-enteric anastomoses for benign disease were performed. Seventeen of these 58 patients were managed using the combined approach. Ten of these 17 patients had complex postcholecystectomy strictures and seven had strictures resulting from inflammatory disease, hepatic resection or congenital problems. A new classification of results of management of bile duct strictures is proposed. Seven patients were classified as 'excellent', six 'good', two 'fair' and two 'poor'. Results were obtained at a mean follow-up of 16 months and it seems likely that in some patients major surgical reinterventions were avoided. 
Hereditary unstable DNA: a new explanation for some old genetic questions? Fragile X syndrome, associated with the fragile X chromosome, is the most common cause of familial mental retardation. The condition is characterised by a heritable DNA sequence that consists of an abnormal number of CCG repeats, and which is unstable in both mitosis and meiosis. We suggest that such heritable unstable DNA sequences could be present in other parts of the genome and that these might explain a number of genetic events that are not well understood in terms of classic genetic mechanisms. Such poorly explained observations include anticipation, incomplete penetrance, variable expression, and possibly imprinting, variegation, and multifactorial inheritance. 
Significance of elevated levels of serum creatine phosphokinase in febrile diseases: a prospective study. The incidence and significance of elevated serum levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in febrile diseases were studied prospectively in all patients admitted with fever to a department of medicine during 1 year. High serum CPK levels were detected in 70 (28%) of 247 febrile patients but in only six (6%) of 105 afebrile control patients (P = .0001). Elevated CPK levels were not related to any specific diagnosis. Logistic regression analysis identified five factors that correlated both significantly and independently with elevation of CPK values: increased blood urea nitrogen level, low serum phosphate level, a stuporous or comatose state, tremor, and muscle tenderness. Myoglobinuria, detected in 14 patients, was predictive of a fatal outcome, but a high CPK level by itself was not an independent correlate of mortality. In summary, CPK elevation is not uncommon in febrile diseases, but because it does not reflect a specific etiology it does not necessarily indicate that an extensive diagnostic work-up is required. 
Asymmetrical ocular pursuit with posterior fossa tumors. We report two patients with posterior fossa neoplasms who demonstrated asymmetrically impaired horizontal ocular pursuit documented with electrooculography. One patient had impaired pursuit contralateral to a pontomedullary lesion, whereas the second patient had impaired pursuit ipsilateral to a pontocerebellar lesion. These patients demonstrate that posterior fossa lesions may impair ocular pursuit either contralaterally or ipsilaterally unlike cerebral hemispheric lesions, which impair ocular pursuit ipsilaterally or bilaterally. 
Effects of a minimally supervised exercise program for mentally retarded adults. Previous exercise studies that attempted to improve the cardiovascular fitness (CVF) of mentally retarded (MR) adults were flawed with methodological shortcomings that prevented conclusive results. At issue in these training studies were fitness test validity and reliability, exactness of duration and intensity of training, and an inordinate amount of supervision. Therefore, we sought to determine whether moderately MR adults (seven males, five females; IQ = 61 +/- 3, age = 25 +/- 3 yr) could improve their CVF through a minimally supervised 16-wk training program. Each subject repeated exercise tests twice on two different modes of exercise, the treadmill (TM) and Schwinn Air-Dyne ergometer (SAE), before training to ensure validity and reliability of initial CVF levels. Intensity and frequency of exercise were closely monitored. An observer was present during the training bouts, but, following initial instructions, no additional encouragement or instructions were given. Although the training program significantly increased peak VO2 (29.2 +/- 8 to 33.5 +/- 9 ml.kg-1.min-1) and peak ventilation (73 +/- 26 to 81 +/- 231.min-1) when assessed on the TM, significant changes in these same parameters were not seen when assessed on the SAE. The importance of these results was discussed. 
Cardiac pacemaker in high spinal cord injury. Bradycardia followed by cardiac arrest is well documented as a complication of acute injury to the cervical spinal cord. This life-threatening bradycardia is attributed to an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system resulting from dissociation of the parasympathetic from the sympathetic responses during the stage of spinal shock. A patient with a C2 complete quadriplegia secondary to birth trauma who experienced symptomatic bradycardia, continuing for 21 months after injury despite intensive medical management, is reported. Clinical improvement followed insertion of a cardiac pacemaker. Possible etiologies for the continuation of abnormal bradycardia episodes after the resolution of spinal shock are discussed. Cardiac pacemaker implantation is advocated for patients with high cervical spinal cord injuries and continuing symptomatic bradycardia not responding to medical measures. 
The risk of dying of prostate cancer in patients with clinically localized disease. From 1966 to 1979, 360 patients with clinical stages A2, B and C1 prostate cancer underwent staging pelvic lymphadenectomy, and completed a course of combined interstitial radioactive gold seeds and external beam radiotherapy. All patients had a normal serum prostatic acid phosphatase level and a bone scan negative for metastases. All patients were followed until death or for a mean of 7.3 years (range 1.2 to 18.25 years) for those alive at analysis. To determine the risk of dying of prostate cancer we reviewed the records of the 142 patients (39%) who died. At analysis 21% of the patients had died of prostate cancer and 17% of other known causes. The cause of death could not be determined in 4 patients (1%). Cardiovascular disease accounted for a fifth of all deaths. The actuarial risk of death of prostate cancer for all patients was 8 +/- 3% (+/- 2 standard errors) at 5 years and 30 +/- 7% at 10 years. The risk of death of all causes was 16 +/- 4% at 5 years and 46 +/- 7% at 10 years. An increased risk of cancer death was associated with established risk factors, including advanced local disease, poorly differentiated histology, pelvic nodal metastases and distant recurrence. We also noted a substantial risk of cancer death in patients who had local tumor recurrence. While previous studies have reported a relatively low incidence of cancer deaths (4 to 17%) in patients initially diagnosed with localized disease, our data suggest that prostate cancer is the major cause of mortality in such patients. Aggressive curative therapy, regardless of treatment modality, should be considered for localized prostate cancer in men with a life expectancy of 10 or more years. 
Self-inflicted eye injuries. Five cases of self-inflicted eye injury are described and discussed. A review of the literature shows that several psychiatric diagnoses have been assigned to people who damage their eyes. A variety of mechanisms to explain this phenomenon are described. 
Dry beriberi: unusual complication of prolonged parenteral nutrition. An adult with Crohn's disease on home total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 8 months presented with peripheral neuropathy and ataxia. The patient was found to be deficient of thiamine. A prompt symptomatic response to intravenous thiamine suggests that the patient had the chronic form of dry beriberi. To our knowledge, this variety of beriberi in a patient on TPN has not previously been reported. 
Double-blind investigation of the effects of propranolol and placebo on the pressure of esophageal varices in patients with portal hypertension. This study was aimed at investigating the effects of propranolol on esophageal variceal pressure in patients with portal hypertension. Variceal pressure was measured at endoscopy using a miniature pressure-sensitive gauge in 20 patients with portal hypertension. Measurements were obtained under baseline conditions and 20 min after double-blind administration of propranolol (0.15 mg/kg; n = 10) or an identical amount of placebo (normal saline, 0.3 ml/kg; n = 10). Under baseline conditions, variceal pressure was similar in propranolol and placebo groups (14.1 +/- 5 mm Hg vs. 14.9 +/- 6.6 mm Hg, respectively; not significant). Placebo had no significant effect on variceal pressure (baseline = 14.9 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; placebo = 15.5 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; not significant), and values after placebo administration were closely correlated with baseline values (r = 0.98; y = 1.1 + 0.97 x; p less than 0.0001). In contrast, propranolol caused a significant decrease in the pressure of esophageal varices (from 14.1 +/- 5 mm Hg to 11.3 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; p less than 0.0002). No significant changes in the size of esophageal varices were observed after propranolol or placebo administration. This study shows (a) the endoscopic pressure-gauge technique has a low variability and may be used to assess acute drug-induced changes in variceal pressure; and (b) propranolol causes significant decreases in variceal pressure in patients with portal hypertension and esophageal varices. 
Acute polyhydramnios associated with chorioangioma. A case report. A case of acute polyhydramnios occurred at 26 weeks' gestation. Prenatal sonography demonstrated a placental chorioangioma. Acute polyhydramnios is clinically distinct from nonacute polyhydramnios and carries a high perinatal mortality rate. As in our case, fetal death often results from complications of prematurity. 
Aortic thrombosis after umbilical artery catheterization in neonates: prevalence of complications on long-term follow-up. We previously reported the early natural history of aortic thrombosis occurring after umbilical artery catheterization in 21 neonates. Ten of those neonates were reevaluated at 36-42 months of age for evidence of hypertension, renal abnormalities, and leg-growth disturbances. They were compared with an age-matched control group of seven infants. Blood pressures were greater than the 95th percentile in three infants and between the 50th and the 95th percentile in six of the 10 infants. Height was less than the fifth percentile for age in four infants with aortic thrombosis. One child had a 1.0-cm discrepancy in leg-length measurements, and seven of nine patients exhibited a 0.5-2.0 cm discrepancy between legs in either thigh or calf circumference. Sonography showed no evidence of residual clot in the aorta or renal vessels. Doppler flow was normal in all cases. Despite resolution of neonatal aortic thrombosis, complications resulting in renovascular hypertension (three of 10 patients) and leg-growth abnormalities (eight of nine) can occur. Hypertension (one of seven) and leg-growth discrepancy (four of seven) were less frequent in the 3-year follow-up of the seven matched control infants. We suggest that infants with known aortic thrombosis receive long-term follow-up to detect these potential problems. 
Light reflection rheography: an effective non-invasive technique for screening patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis. Light reflection rheography is a simple non-invasive technique for assessing venous function in the leg. One hundred and twenty-four patients referred for venography with a clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis were investigated by light reflection rheography to determine the accuracy of the technique in diagnosing acute thrombosis. In half of the patients venography confirmed a deep venous thrombosis. Light reflection rheography had a sensitivity of 92 per cent and a specificity of 84 per cent in detecting acute thrombosis. The technique had a negative predictive value of 92 per cent in selecting those patients with no thrombosis. Light reflection rheography can be performed at the bedside or in the radiography department which makes it a suitable technique for screening patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis. 
Wildervanck or cervico-oculo-acoustic syndrome and MRI findings. In 1952, Wildervanck described the first case of what he styled the cervico-oculo-acoustic (COA) syndrome. This comprises Klippel Feil's (KF) anomaly (congenitally fused cervical vertebrae), congenital sensorineural deafness and Duane's retraction syndrome (deficient abduction with retraction on adduction). Since that original paper, there have been further reports describing this triad, either completely or incompletely. A further case of this syndrome is reported and the first report of MRI head scan findings in this condition is presented. In addition, the origin of mirror movements observed as part of the KF syndrome are discussed. 
Asymptomatic blastomycosis of the central nervous system with progression in patients given ketoconazole therapy: a report of two cases. Ketoconazole (KTZ) has largely replaced amphotericin B as first-line therapy for blastomycosis. However, KTZ penetrates poorly into the central nervous system (CNS), and therapeutic failure may be caused by initially unrecognized CNS infection. Two patients (22% [2/9] of all culture-proven cases of blastomycosis at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, over 15 years) developed CNS blastomycosis while receiving KTZ. Neither initially had CNS symptoms; both had cutaneous and pulmonary disease that responded to KTZ. If KTZ or other fungistatic imidazoles are to continue as primary therapy for blastomycosis, studies are needed to improve the ability to identify patients likely to experience treatment failure or develop CNS disease. Possibly all patients with disseminated blastomycosis, even those without CNS symptoms, should have lumbar puncture and computed tomography of the head before therapy. Critical evaluation of their immune function also may be required before making a therapeutic decision to use KTZ or amphotericin B. 
Treatment of rat prostatic adenocarcinoma with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA): effects on growth and morphology. Rats bearing the Dunning R3327H prostatic carcinoma were castrated and supplemented with testosterone propionate. These rats were then treated with estradiol benzoate or medroxyprogesterone acetate alone or in combination with estradiol. During the treatment period of six weeks, the growth rate of the prostatic tumors was measured. At the end of the treatment period the morphology of the tumors was also studied. It was found that medroxyprogesterone acetate is as effective as estradiol in inhibiting the growth of the Dunning prostatic carcinoma and that the combination of medroxyprogesterone acetate and estradiol was more efficient in that respect than estradiol alone. Morphometric evaluation of the tumor epithelium and stroma showed a decrement of epithelial growth in all treatment groups, while the groups treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate, both alone or in combination with estradiol, also showed an inhibited growth of the tumor stroma. It was concluded that medroxyprogesterone acetate probably has direct inhibitory effects on prostatic tumor cells in the Dunning model and that medroxyprogesterone acetate may act in an additive manner with estradiol. 
Pharmacokinetics of activated protein C in guinea pigs. Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent zymogen of the serine protease, activated protein C (APC), an important regulatory enzyme in hemostasis. In view of the potential of human APC as an anticoagulant and profibrinolytic agent, the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of APC were studied in guinea pigs. The plasma elimination of a trace dose of 125I-APC was biphasic following an initial rapid elimination of approximately 15% of the injected dose within 1 to 2 minutes. This rapid removal of 125I-APC from the circulation was found to be a result of an association with the liver regardless of the route of injection. Essentially identical results were obtained with active site-blocked forms of APC generated with either diisopropylfluorophosphate or D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone, which indicates that the active site was not essential for the liver association. Accumulation of all three forms of APC in the liver peaked at 30 minutes and then declined as increasing amounts of degraded radiolabeled material appeared in the gastrointestinal tract and urine. Removal of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (gla) domain of diisopropylphosphoryl-APC resulted in a 50% reduction in the association with liver and an accumulation in the kidneys. Protein C and protein S were cleared from the circulation at rates approximately one-half and one-fourth, respectively, that of APC. Both in vitro and in vivo, APC was found to form complexes with protease inhibitors present in guinea pig plasma. Complex formation resulted in a more rapid disappearance of the enzymatic activity of APC than elimination of the protein moiety. These findings indicate two distinct mechanisms for the elimination of APC. One mechanism involves reaction with plasma protease inhibitors and subsequent elimination by specific hepatic receptors. The other mechanism involves the direct catabolism of APC by the liver via a pathway that is nonsaturable over a substantial dose range and independent of the active site. This pattern of elimination is distinctly different from that observed with the homologous coagulation enzymes thrombin, factor IXa, and factor Xa. 
Intracarotid chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin for malignant brain tumors. Chemotherapy for tumors of the central nervous system has a limited efficacy presumably because of restricted blood-brain barrier permeability. The advantage of regional intra-arterial administration of anticancer drugs is an increased uptake during the first passage of the drugs through tumor capillaries. Twenty patients with high-grade astrocytomas (HGA) and 28 patients with metastatic brain tumors (MBT) received intracarotid/intravertebral infusion of etoposide and cisplatin. Eight patients with HGA who underwent incomplete resection responded to chemotherapy alone. Four additional patients had complete resection of the tumor. Median survival time of the group (responders and nonresponders) has been 14 months. Twelve patients with MBT responded to chemotherapy alone (six had complete response [CR], and six had partial response [PR]) with a median survival time of 7 months. Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) appears to be effective with acceptable toxicities. Accrual of additional patients is required before a final conclusion can be reached. 
High mebendazole doses in pulmonary and hepatic hydatid disease. Thirty nine children with 71 hydatid cysts were given mebendazole orally in a dose of 100-200 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks and were followed up for a mean (SD) of 63 (24) months. Twenty children (three of them after a second course) were cured and another two avoided at least one operation. No serious side effects of the drug were observed. 
Concomitant lymphangioma and arteriovenous malformation of the orbit. An 8-year-old girl had an orbital-adnexal lymphangioma and ipsilateral orbital and middle cranial fossa arteriovenous malformations. High-resolution magnetic resonance image scanning, orbital ultrasonography, and digital subtraction angiography were used for diagnosis and preoperative assessment. Complications related to this vascular neoplasm included amblyopia, acute hemorrhage with proptosis, exposure keratitis, cosmetic deformity, and recurrent preseptal cellulitis. The girl was treated with both embolization and orbital surgery for recurrent hemorrhage and proptosis. We postulated that the coexistence of a lymphangioma and arteriovenous malformation represents an unusual and extensive maldevelopment of vascular embryogenesis. 
Importance of 6-mercaptopurine dose in lymphoblastic leukaemia. To explore the possibility that higher total dosage of 'maintenance' treatment may have contributed to the recent improvement in outlook of children in the United Kingdom with lymphoblastic leukaemia, details of the amount of 6-mercaptopurine prescribed during the first two years of treatment were studied in an unselected cohort of children diagnosed between 1973 and 1987. Eighty five patients were studied, 30 diagnosed before and 55 after 1980. The group diagnosed after 1980 showed an 18% improvement in relapse free survival at five years. Their median total dose of 6-mercaptopurine had increased by 22%, whereas according to the protocol it should have risen by an average of only 9%. After 1980 boys were prescribed significantly more 6-mercaptopurine than girls, and had fewer dose reductions because of myelosuppression. These findings support the clinical impression that after 1980 an important therapeutic difference resulting from the new United Kingdom acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocols was an increase in the amount of 6-mercaptopurine that children actually received as a result of changes in prescribing guidelines rather than dose. They also provide further evidence that boys tolerate 6-mercaptopurine better than girls, which may be related to the still unexplained difference in prognosis between the sexes. 
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Workshop on antihypertensive drug treatment. The benefits, costs, and choices. Implications for research. Selected portions of the workshop's closing discussion are summarized. Major ongoing clinical trials of antihypertensive drug treatment are described. Some recommendations offered by workshop participants for future research directions are summarized. 
Hypercholesterolemia: the cost of treatment in perspective. Would the money spent on treating hypercholesterolemia save more lives if spent elsewhere? How many dollars must be spent on a treatment to make one person live 1 year longer? This cost-effectiveness analysis uses the cost per year of life gained to compare a wide variety of health care interventions ranging from carcinogen research to screening tests to liver transplants. The comparison calls into question some popular trends. 
Oral ketamine. Its use for mentally retarded adults requiring day care dental treatment. Four cases of severely mentally handicapped young adults requiring day care dental treatment are reported. All had required varying degrees of restraint during previous dental treatments, which had been distressing for the patient, the relatives and the ward staff. In all cases, administration of oral ketamine 10 mg/kg, 30-60 minutes before the procedure, facilitated subsequent induction of anaesthesia. 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: evolution, early results, and impact on nonsurgical gallstone therapies Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a surgical technique first performed in France, has gained widespread acceptance among surgeons in the United States. The abdominal cavity is inflated by carbon dioxide, a video monitor is inserted via a laparoscope placed periumbilically, and the gallbladder is freed and removed from the liver bed by using small subcostal ports for access and dissection. Intraoperative cholangiography is routinely performed, but uncertainty exists about how best to manage choledocholithiasis. Compared with traditional cholecystectomy, initial reports describing laparoscopic cholecystectomy cite shorter recovery times because no large incisions are made, thus potentially reducing the cost and morbidity of cholecystectomy. A survey of 614 early cases supports these claims, with a reported complication rate of 1.5% and quick resumption of normal activities by patients. Because of its promise for reduced morbidity, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is challenging open cholecystectomy as the therapeutic gold standard for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Thus, the standard to which the nonsurgical gallstone therapies, such as lithotripsy and contact dissolution, will be compared may shift to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. As the laparoscopic complications are similar to those of traditional cholecystectomy, such as abscesses and bile leaks, their percutaneous treatment should not change. 
Renal abscess in childhood: diagnostic and therapeutic progress. During the past decade new techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography have been reported to have changed the diagnostic investigation and treatment of renal abscess in adults. To evaluate whether similar changes have taken place in the pediatric age group, a retrospective study of all patients seen between 1979 and 1989 was performed. Seven patients, 0.8 to 14 (mean, 9) years old, with renal abscesses in eight kidneys were identified. Ultrasound and computed tomography proved to be the most valuable diagnostic tools, revealing the diagnosis by showing a hypoechoic or hypodense mass. All patients had an initial trial of intensive antibiotic treatment, which led to resolution of the abscesses in two of the eight kidneys. In all other cases the abscesses were additionally drained, which was done surgically in two and by ultrasonography- or CT-guided percutaneous drainage in four patients. Abscess cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus (three), Escherichia coli (one) and Salmonella Group B (one) and were sterile in one case. Drainage was unsuccessful in only one patient, who subsequently underwent nephrectomy for uncontrolled infection of a diffusely damaged kidney. We conclude that the diagnosis of renal abscesses is greatly facilitated by ultrasonography and CT and that most patients can be cured without operation by antibiotics and, if necessary, by additional percutaneous drainage. 
Potassium accumulation in the globally ischemic mammalian heart. A role for the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. We investigated the contribution of opening of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel to extracellular accumulation of K+ during ischemia with the use of glibenclamide, a specific blocker of this K+ channel. To characterize the electrophysiological effects of glibenclamide during metabolic inhibition (by either application of dinitrophenol or hypoxia) we performed patch-clamp studies in isolated membrane patches of guinea pig myocytes and in intact guinea pig myocytes and studied action potential parameters in isolated superfused guinea pig papillary muscle. We studied the effect of glibenclamide on extracellular accumulation of K+ and H+ in isolated retrogradely perfused globally ischemic hearts of rat, guinea pig, and rabbit. Experimental evidence is presented that supports the conclusions that glibenclamide 1) effectively blocks open K+ATP channels, 2) reverses the dinitrophenol-induced increase of the outward current and prevents the hypoxia-induced shortening of the action potential, 3) decreases the rate of K+ accumulation during the first minutes of ischemia in stimulated hearts, an effect which was entirely absent in quiescent hearts, and 4) does not influence the rate and extent of ischemia-induced extracellular acidification. 
Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and early mortality. To assess morbidity, mortality, and benefit associated with percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy (PEG), we retrospectively studied 42 patients who had had PEG. Mortality was exceptionally high during the first 60 days after PEG (43%), and then stabilized. In nearly half of the cases (20/42) the PEG tube was removed during the first 60 days because of either death or improvement. Patients with malignancy had a significantly higher morbidity and 60-day mortality than the neurologically impaired. We concluded that patients should be carefully selected for PEG because early mortality is high; a 60-day trial of soft nasogastric feedings should be considered before PEG, and could reduce by nearly half the number of patients failing to receive long-term benefit; and patients with malignancy have significantly greater morbidity and mortality after PEG and may not receive the same advantage from the procedure. 
Urologic sarcoma in adults. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center experience based on a prospective database between 1982 and 1989. Urologic sarcoma is a group of rare tumors with a generally poor prognosis. These sarcomas share prognostic characteristics with soft-tissue sarcomas arising from other sites. A staging system that incorporates tumor grade and size is valuable in identifying patients at high risk of dying of disease. Patients with sarcomas that are high-grade, greater than 5 cm in diameter, or metastatic at the time of presentation (MSKCC stages 3 and 4) have a combined 3-year relapse-free survival rate of 26%. Complete surgical resection, preferably with negative margins, still offers the best chance of cure. For reasons that are not clear, multimodality therapy in rhabdomyosarcoma is less effective in adult than in pediatric disease. Present-day chemotherapeutic regimens are ineffective in controlling disseminated sarcoma. The adoption of a uniform staging system coupled with multi-institutional collaboration may allow progress to be made in this otherwise deadly form of genitourinary cancer. 
von Willebrand factor and factor VIII in renal transplant recipients under immunosuppression with cyclosporine and steroids. Sequential measurements over 4 months in 17 patients. In 17 consecutive cadaver kidney transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine (CsA) and steroids, the median of antigenic and functional levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) before transplantation were elevated (vWF:Ag: 206%, vWF:RCof: 202%; FVIII:Ag: 248%, FVIII:C: 224%; normal values 50-150%). Sequential measurements after transplantation and during CsA treatment revealed a transient significant increase of median values with highest amounts of vWF:Ag of 362% (2 p less than 0.0001), FVIII:Ag of 398% (2 p less than 0.001) and FVIII:C of 360% (2 p less than 0.0001) (Friedman test). vWF:RCof did not show statistically significant changes. After 4 months, levels of vWF and FVIII comparable to those obtained before transplantation were observed. In univariate statistical analysis no correlation was found between vWF of FVIII on the one hand and plasma creatinine levels, CsA dose or CsA whole blood through levels on the other hand. However, multivariate statistics revealed to some extent a positive influence of CsA blood levels on vWF:Ag levels. Patients with vascular rejection or chronic CsA nephrotoxicity showed significantly lower levels of vWF:Ag as compared with patients without endothelial cell damage in the kidney (2 p less than 0.05). However, the difference in vWF:Ag levels already existed before transplantation. In contrast to recent reports, plasma vWF levels were not indicative of vascular injury in kidney graft recipients nor was the marked elevation of vWF and FVIII associated with thromboembolic complications ascribed to CsA treatment. 
The relationship between locomotor disability, autonomic dysfunction, and the integrity of the striatal dopaminergic system in patients with multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and Parkinson's disease, studied with PET. 18F-dopa and S-11C-nomifensine (NMF) are positron emitting tracers whose caudate and putamen uptake reflects striatal dopamine storage capacity and the integrity of dopamine reuptake sites, respectively. Using these two tracers, the integrity of the presynaptic striatal dopaminergic system has been studied with positron emission tomography (PET) in 10 subjects with multiple system atrophy (MSA, Shy-Drager syndrome) who had an akinetic-rigid syndrome that was poorly responsive to L-dopa, autonomic failure, and cerebellar ataxia. PET findings for the 10 MSA patients were compared with those for 13 age-matched controls, 8 subjects with L-dopa responsive Parkinson's disease (PD), and 7 subjects with pure autonomic failure (PAF). Influx constants, Ki, reflecting specific 18F-dopa uptake into striatal tissue, were severely reduced in the putamen and caudate of the 10 MSA subjects (mean putamen Ki 0.005 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls; mean caudate Ki 0.007 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls). Reduction of putamen, but not caudate, 18F-dopa uptake correlated with severity and duration of locomotor disability. Eight patients with PD, and a similar degree and duration of locomotor disability to the patients with MSA, demonstrated equal impairment of mean putamen 18F-dopa uptake, but significant preservation of mean caudate function. The 7 PAF patients had normal mean levels of putamen and caudate 18F-dopa uptake, although 1 individual PAF patient had significantly impaired striatal function. The MSA and PD groups of subjects both showed significantly reduced levels of specific striatal S-11C-NMF binding, again caudate function being relatively preserved in PD. It is concluded that in both MSA and PD there is a parallel decline of striatal dopamine storage capacity and reuptake site integrity, probably reflecting a loss of nigrostriatal nerve terminals. Caudate function is relatively preserved in PD compared with MSA. The majority of PAF patients have an intact nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, suggesting that PAF is a condition distinct from PD and MSA in spite of some pathological similarities. PET is capable of detecting subclinical nigrostriatal involvement in PAF patients when this is present. 
Muscle regeneration following segmental necrosis in tenotomized muscle fibers. The aim of this study was to determine how the new myotendinous junctions were re-established at the proximal and distal ends of the soleus muscle after tenotomy. Both proximal and distal tendons of the soleus muscle in mature female rats were severed. The animals were killed and the soleus muscles were removed and prepared for light and electron microscopic examination 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days after the operation. It was found that segmental fiber destruction followed by removal by macrophages occurred at the ends of the soleus muscle fibers. This resulted in the liberation and myogenic activation of satellite cells. By 3 days after tenotomy the fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes could be seen. The myotubes developed within the original basal lamina and reattached to the surviving non-necrotic segments and grew in both length and width so that by 6 weeks postoperation, normal myotendinous junctions had been reformed. This study is the first to show that re-establishment of the myotendinous junction following tenotomy is accomplished by regeneration of the necrotic ends of the tenotomized fibers. 
Composition of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries in women less than 40 years of age with fatal coronary artery disease and implications for plaque reversibility. This study analyzes the composition of atherosclerotic plaques in the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries in 8 women less than 40 years of age (mean 34) with fatal coronary artery disease (CAD) and compares these data to previous studies of 37 adults greater than 45 years of age (mean 59) with fatal CAD. Histologic sections were taken at 5-mm intervals from the entire lengths of the right, left main, left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries. With the use of a computerized morphometry system, analysis of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries showed the major component of plaque to be a combination of cellular (mean percent total plaque area = 65%, standard error = 6%) and dense (19%, standard error = 6%) fibrous tissue. Arterial segments narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area from these young women were compared with similarly narrowed arteries from 37 older patients (32 men [86%]) with fatal CAD previously reported by this laboratory, and showed significantly more cellular fibrous tissue and lipid-rich foam cells, and lesser amounts of dense fibrous and heavily calcified tissue. The large amount of lipid-containing foam cells and relative lack of acellular scar tissue in coronary plaques in these young women suggests a greater potential for reversibility of these plaques in this subset of patients with CAD. 
Orbit-related variation in spatial resolution as a source of artifactual defects in thallium-201 SPECT The cause of 180-degree diametrical artifactual defects in clinical thallium-201 SPECT imaging was investigated using phantom simulation. This artifact was observed on SPECT images acquired with a "body contour" or "peanut" orbit. It was hypothesized that this artifact was caused by differences in spatial resolution that occur when the heart-to-detector distance changes employing noncircular orbits. To test this hypothesis, a series of planar static images of a normal cylindrical phantom was obtained at varying distances from the camera detector head. From these images, tomographic acquisition files were created that simulated tomographic data acquired with circular orbits and elliptical orbits. The reconstructed phantom short-axis slices showed no artifacts for circular orbits. However, for various elliptical orbits, significant regional nonuniformity, similar to the artifacts noted in patients, was observed. The degree of nonuniformity correlated with the long-short axis ratio of elliptical orbits (r = 0.98). In addition, circular orbits with the phantom in an eccentric position resulted in similar nonuniformities. It is concluded that a noncircular tomographic orbit can create characteristic artifacts on thallium-201 SPECT images. For rotational thallium 201 SPECT, a circular orbit with the heart in the center of rotation should be employed. 
Bowel obstruction: evaluation with CT Eighty-four computed tomographic (CT) scans from patients referred for bowel obstruction between January 2, 1988, and December 31, 1989, were retrospectively evaluated. A pair of radiologists without knowledge of patient histories determined the presence or absence of bowel obstruction. Sixty-four patients ultimately proved to have intestinal obstruction, and 20 did not. Diagnosis was established by means of surgery (n = 39), barium studies (n = 17), and clinical course (n = 28). Causes of obstruction included adhesions (n = 37), metastases (n = 6), primary tumor (n = 7), Crohn disease (n = 4), hernia (n = 3), hematoma (n = 2), colonic diverticulitis (n = 2), and other (n = 3). In addition, 83 CT examinations in patients with no history or indication of intestinal obstruction were simultaneously reviewed. The overall sensitivity was 94%, specificity was 96%, and accuracy was 95%. The cause of obstruction was correctly predicted in 47 of 64 cases (73%). Intestinal obstruction was not diagnosed in any of the 83 control patients. CT is most useful in patients with a history of abdominal malignancy and in patients who have not been operated on and who have signs of infection, bowel infarction, or a palpable abdominal mass. 
Postheparin plasma diamine oxidase values in the follow up of patients with small bowel Crohn's disease. Measurement of postheparin plasma diamine oxidase (PHD) activity has been proposed to assess mucosal integrity in several diseases of the small intestine. In Crohn's disease, PHD values identify a group of patients with predominantly small bowel mucosal damage. To determine the role of mucosal involvement in the progression of small bowel Crohn's disease and whether different PHD values can predict different outcomes the changes in PHD values in 41 patients with small bowel Crohn's disease admitted consecutively to our department were investigated. The test was performed during periods of active disease and after either medical or surgical treatment had resulted in improvement. PHD values were significantly lower than in normal subjects (normal range 3.7-7.7 U/ml). In 35 patients with active disease (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) greater than 150) two groups were identified by choosing a cut off value of 2 U/ml: 93% of the 15 patients with PHD values lower than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 1.36 (0.46) U/ml) relapsed at least once in the following year, while only the 20% of the 20 whose values were higher than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 3.69 (1.50)) relapsed in the same period. The data were statistically significant (Yates's corrected chi 2 = 15.63; p less than 0.0001). The positive and negative predictive values of the test were 93% and 80%, respectively. During relapses, PHD values were consistently lower than previous values, and increased significantly after effective medical or surgical treatment. In the six patients in whom there were no changes in disease activity (CDAI persistently less than 150), there was no change in PHD values. 
The renal growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor I axis. Collecting duct is a major site of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) synthesis within kidney. Production of IGF-I at this site is stimulated by growth hormone (GH). IGF-I produced in collecting duct is likely to act on glomerulus and proximal tubule via IGF-I receptors present at these locations. Renal IGF-I may be causative of the glomerular and proximal tubular hypertrophy that occurs in hypersomatotropic states, of compensatory renal hypertrophy, and of renal regeneration following acute ischemic injury. 
Thermochemotherapy in inoperable head and neck cancer. A combined hyperthermia and chemotherapy approach was used to treat five patients with locally advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck whose tumors had failed to respond to chemotherapy. In two patients, tumor had recurred after initial combined modality therapy (surgery/radiation) and had failed to respond to one course of cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (cisplatin/5-FU) chemotherapy. The three remaining patients were enrolled onto a phase II evaluation of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin/fluorouracil for advanced head and neck carcinomas and had failed to achieve a partial remission after one treatment cycle. Palpable cervical tumors were heated to 40 degrees to 42 degrees C for 30 to 40 minutes, during which time cisplatin (100 mg/m2) was infused intravenously. A 5-day infusion of 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2/d) followed. Despite less than a partial response to previous cisplatin/fluorouracil chemotherapy alone, two patients had complete clinical resolution of the heated tumor volume with two cycles of the combined thermochemotherapy approach. One patient achieved a partial remission with this approach. The remaining two patients died shortly after the initial thermochemotherapy treatment, as a result of progressive tumor growth. The two complete responders were subsequently treated with radiation (1 patient) and radical neck dissection (1 patient) and remained without evidence of disease 2 and 26 months after the completion of therapy, respectively. The toxicity of this combined modality approach was acceptable and appeared to be no greater than had been experienced during earlier treatment with chemotherapy alone. Further studies using a combination of these treatment modalities for locally advanced head and neck carcinomas are warranted. 
Cytomegalovirus infection in Gambian mothers and their babies. A 15 month longitudinal study of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in 178 Gambian mothers and their babies was undertaken. Twenty five (14%) of the babies were congenitally infected despite the fact that 87% of their mothers were antibody positive to the virus. Two of the 25 congenitally infected infants had evidence of severe neurological damage; skin sepsis was also a prominent feature in congenitally infected infants. The other children soon became infected. At 6 months of age, 53% of the infants were shedding virus either in urine or saliva. By the age of 12 months 86% of the infants had serological evidence of CMV infection. Preliminary evidence suggests that sibling to sibling infection in crowded compounds might be a major route of transmission. 
Acid secretory responses and parietal cell sensitivity following duodenal ulcer healing with omeprazole, sucralfate, and Maalox. Acid secretory responses and parietal cell sensitivity (PCS) have been studied in 21 duodenal ulcer patients before and after successful treatment with omeprazole (n = 7), sucralfate (n = 7), or Maalox (n = 7). The second study was carried out 3 days after documented healing and withdrawal of treatment in the sucralfate- and Maalox-treated groups and 14 days after documented healing and withdrawal of treatment in the omeprazole-treated patients. Acid output (mmol/hour) was measured as basal secretion, and in response to 0.1 microgram/kg/hour pentagastrin (low-dose) and 6.0 micrograms/kg/hour pentagastrin (high-dose) stimulation. PCS was calculated as the ratio of low dose:high dose acid output (expressed as a percentage). Ulcer healing with sucralfate resulted in significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in low-dose acid output from 36.4% (13.2-51.0) (median [range]) to 8.4% (3.2-45.4) mmol/hour and PCS from 69.1% (44.9-91.4) to 22.0% (16.0-85.6), whereas no significant decreases in any of the measured parameters were noted following ulcer healing with Maalox. Ulcer healing with omeprazole resulted in significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in basal acid output from 6.3 (1.5-22.9) (median [range]) to 2.2 (0-6.9) mmol/hour, and low-dose acid output from 31.0 (6.0-58.0) to 23.0 (1.4-44.8) mmol/hour. These findings suggest that acid secretory responses following ulcer healing vary according to the therapeutic agent used. 
Selective versus routine predischarge coronary arteriography after therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, heparin and aspirin for acute myocardial infarction. TIMI II Investigators. To ascertain whether predischarge arteriography is beneficial in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), heparin and aspirin, the outcome of 197 patients in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) IIA study assigned to conservative management and routine predischarge coronary arteriography (routine catheterization group) was compared with the outcome of 1,461 patients from the TIMI IIB study assigned to conservative management without routine coronary arteriography unless ischemia recurred spontaneously or on predischarge exercise testing (selective catheterization group). The two groups were similar with regard to important baseline variables. During the initial hospital stay, coronary arteriography was performed in 93.9% of the routine catheterization group and 34.7% of the selective catheterization group (p less than 0.001), but the frequency of coronary revascularization (angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery) was similar in the two groups (24.4% versus 20.7%, p = NS). Coronary arteriograms showed a predominance of zero or one vessel disease (stenosis greater than or equal to 60%) in both groups (routine catheterization group 73.1%, selective catheterization group 61.3%). During the 1st year after infarction, rehospitalization for cardiac reasons and the interim performance of coronary arteriography were more common in the selective catheterization group (37.9% versus 27.6%, p = 0.007 and 28.6% versus 11.6%, p less than 0.001, respectively); however, the interim rates of death, nonfatal reinfarction and performance of coronary revascularization procedures were similar. At the end of 1 year, coronary arteriography had been performed one or more times in 98.9% of the routine catheterization group and 59.4% of the selective catheterization group (p less than 0.001), whereas death and nonfatal reinfarction had occurred in 10.2% versus 7.0% (p = 0.10) and 8.6% versus 9.0% (p = 0.87), respectively. Because the selective coronary arteriography policy exposes about 40% fewer patients to the small but finite risks and inconvenience of the procedure without compromising the 1 year survival or reinfarction rates, it seems to be an appropriate management strategy. 
Safety and efficacy of oral flecainide therapy in patients with atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of oral flecainide therapy in patients with symptomatic tachycardia and an extranodal accessory pathway. DESIGN: Open-label, uncontrolled trial with a mean follow-up of 24 months. SETTING: Referral-based, teaching medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty-three patients with symptomatic tachycardia and an extranodal accessory pathway. INTERVENTIONS: Patients had electrophysiologic testing before and after the initiation of oral flecainide therapy and were followed long-term for the presence of symptoms, new physical limitations, and adverse effects of therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Flecainide therapy prevented or slowed (324 +/- 59 ms to 398 +/- 55 ms; P less than 0.001) inducible sustained atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia in 44 of 63 patients (70%). Of the 44 patients discharged from the hospital, 33 (75%) have continued to receive flecainide therapy and have shown no adverse effects (mean follow-up, 24 +/- 10 months). Adverse cardiac reactions (proarrhythmia or sinus node suppression) attributable to flecainide occurred in 11 of 63 patients (17%); in 9 (82%) of these 11 patients, events were detected during either in-hospital monitoring or the electrophysiologic study done before discharge. Structural heart disease was detected by two-dimensional echocardiography in 8 of 11 patients who had adverse cardiac events and in 6 of 52 patients who did not have such events (P less than 0.001). Isoproterenol reversed the effects of flecainide therapy in 11 of 21 patients; 7 of the 11 patients had spontaneous clinical recurrences of tachycardia or palpitations during the follow-up period, but these symptoms occurred in only 1 of 10 patients who did not show isoproterenol-induced reversal (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Oral flecainide therapy was effective in 33 of 63 patients who had tachycardia and an extranodal accessory connection. Hospital monitoring during initial therapy is recommended, and flecainide should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with structural heart disease. An isoproterenol challenge appears to be helpful in predicting late recurrence of tachycardia. 
Motor unit firing rates in postpolio and control subjects during submaximal contraction. Postpolio patients have a deficit in strength recovery after isometric activity. The cause for this is unknown, but may be the result of higher motor unit firing rates during the activity, which leads to excessive fatigue of the motor units. The purpose of this study was to determine whether postpolio subjects recruited motor units at higher firing rates than control subjects. Twelve control and seven postpolio subjects were tested for maximal voluntary contraction of the quadriceps isometrically. Randomly, subjects performed isometric contractions for five 10-s periods freely against gravity (threshold) and at 20% and 40% of maximal voluntary contraction. Decompositional motor unit electromyographic analysis was used to measure motor unit amplitude, motor unit firing rate and counted number of motor units identified. Analysis was by univariate analysis of variance. Motor unit firing rate was not significantly greater (P greater than 0.05) in postpolio subjects than control subjects at all three levels of contraction. Thus, it is unlikely that an increased motor unit firing rate leads to the deficit in recovery of strength in postpolio subjects. 
Nutritional support in Crohn's disease: which route? Nutritional and clinical responses to three nutritional regimens were retrospectively evaluated in 81 Crohn's patients with active disease. Group 1 (n = 42) received a low residue oral diet, group 2 (n = 15) received chemically defined diets, and group 3 (n = 24), parenteral nutrition (PN). Weight gain was observed in a similar percentage of patients, whereas serum albumin increase was significant only in group 3: 3.15 +/- 0.66 versus 3.54 +/- 0.61 g/100 ml (p less than 0.05). Mean activity index decreased significantly in all groups (p less than 0.001), and length of stay in hospital was similar. Patients with intestinal obstruction had a better immediate response when submitted to PN: clinical remission was achieved in 75% of those in group 3, but in only 50% in groups 1 and 2 (p less than 0.05). Otherwise, short- and long-term outcome was similar. 
Multicenter evaluation of a new fixed-wire coronary angioplasty catheter system: clinical and angiographic characteristics and results. Coronary angioplasty is increasingly used as an attempt to revascularize patients with severe coronary artery disease. To determine the efficacy of such treatment, a new fixed wire angioplasty catheter was evaluated by a multicenter group in a non-randomized fashion in 50 patients, average 58 +/- 11 years (+/- 1 SD), 58% men. Forty-four percent had a prior revascularization procedure (28% angioplasty, 16% coronary bypass surgery), 38% had a prior Q-wave myocardial infarction, 43% had grade 4 angina, and 60% multiple vessel disease. Angioplasty was attempted in 63 lesions which were located in a mid to distal location in 69%, with a proximal tortuosity score of 1.8 (2 = 45-60 degrees entrance angle), and lesion angulation of 1.4 (1 = 45 degrees lesion bend). In 88%, the device was the primary catheter used and in 6%, it was chosen when another system failed. The balloon was able to successfully cross 94% of all lesions attempted. Six lesions were crossed and dilated but significant residual stenoses remained. There were no significant device malfunctions, or angiographic or clinical complications. This feasibility evaluation of this new fixed wire system yielded excellent angiographic results. Although not a comparative study, this analysis suggests that this new generation of angioplasty catheter may improve the safety and efficacy of complex coronary angioplasty. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of vertebrobasilar ectasia in tic convulsif. Case report. A patient with trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm was evaluated using multiplanar magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with gadolinium enhancement. Preoperative images demonstrated massively ectatic vertebral and basilar arteries and their distortion of the brain stem and the trigeminal and facial nerves. Surgical manipulation included selective trigeminal rhizotomy, cushioning of the residual nerve at the point of maximal distortion by the underlying basilar artery, and microvascular decompression of the seventh nerve from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery which was being pushed dorsomedially by the vertebral artery. Postoperatively, the patient had neither trigeminal neuralgia nor facial spasm. Gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging not only excludes other etiologies such as tumor or arteriovenous malformation, but also demonstrates cranial nerve compression by ectatic vertebral and basilar arteries. The choice of preoperative imaging modality is discussed and the literature concerning the etiology of tic convulsif is reviewed. 
Anatomic correction of transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect. Experience with 118 cases. One hundred eighteen patients, 100 with transposition of the great arteries plus ventricular septal defect and 18 with double-outlet right ventricle and subpulmonary ventricular septal defect have undergone arterial switch and patch closure of the ventricular septal defect since February 1983. In transposition of the great arteries the ventricular septal defect was perimembranous in 70 cases, trabecular in 28, and infundibular in 10. Eleven patients had multiple ventricular septal defects. In addition to 18 patients with double-outlet right ventricle, malalignment of the conal septum was present in 19 cases. Coronary type A distribution was recognized in 79 cases, type C in one, type D in 24, and type E in 14. Great arteries were side by side in 19% of cases. Aortic coarctation was present in 31 cases, and subaortic obstruction in 9. Age at operation ranged from 4 days to 4 years (mean, 3.5 +/- 8.3 months), and mean weight was 4.0 +/- 1.6 kg. Thirty-seven infants were younger than age 1 month. Thirty-six patients underwent previous operations: pulmonary artery banding alone (n = 13), pulmonary artery banding and coarctation repair (n = 13), and coarctation repair alone (n = 10). Mean time between the first procedure and the switch was 2.2 months. Six patients with aortic coarctation underwent one-stage repair, through median sternotomy, aortic reconstruction, closure of the ventricular septal defect, and arterial switch. Perioperative mortality was 13.5% (70% confidence limit 10% to 17.6%, n = 16). It was directly related to coronary artery kinking in 50% of deaths and to anatomy and size discrepancy of the great arteries in the remaining deaths. Univariate analysis could not find any significant risk factor of in-hospital mortality. Mean follow-up of 30.3 +/- 23.5 months was achieved in all but 2 survivors. There was one late death. Ten patients underwent 11 reoperations for recoarctation (n = 1), pulmonary stenosis (n = 7), residual ventricular septal defect (n = 2), and stenosis of superior vena cava (n = 1). Two patients needed a permanent pacemaker. Actuarial survival and freedom from reoperation at 5 years were 84.5% +/- 3.6% and 85.7% +/- 4.6%, respectively. We conclude that anatomic correction of complex transposition is a safe method that offers good early and midterm results. 
Progressive deterioration of auditory evoked potentials after excision of an acoustic neurinoma: case report. The authors report the case of a 17-year-old girl who underwent excision of bilateral neurinomas of the cerebellopontine angle. Although her auditory evoked potentials were well maintained during the operation, they deteriorated gradually and progressively for the following 2 months. This seemed to reflect degeneration of the cochlear nerve fibers initiated by operative manipulation in the cerebellopontine angle in a patient who had no hearing when she awoke from surgery. 
von Hippel-Lindau disease: inadequacy of angiography for identification of renal cancers. Selective renal angiograms were retrospectively evaluated for the identification of renal cell cancers in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). Seven patients underwent angiography and surgery because of solid or complex renal masses identified at cross-sectional imaging. Nine kidneys underwent detailed examination by the surgeon and by a pathologist. There were 31 renal cancers. Angiography had enabled identification of only five cancers (16%), and six others (19%) had been suspected. Cancers detected angiographically were larger than those not detected (P less than .05). Solid tumors tended to appear less hypervascular than expected and occasionally had the angiographic appearance of atypical cysts. There were no false-positive angiograms. Angiography revealed only one cancer not previously suspected and changed the surgeon's approach for only one kidney (11%). The sensitivity and specificity of angiography were 35% and 100%, respectively. In these patients, selective renal angiography is not helpful for the detection or exclusion of cancer in a kidney. It does not have a limited role for vascular mapping prior to partial nephrectomy or tumor enucleation. 
Abnormal hormonal and renal responses to saline load in hypertensive patients with parental history of cardiovascular accidents. BACKGROUND. Acute cardiac and cerebrovascular accidents are more frequent in hypertensive subjects with a family history of acute vascular accidents. The mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to vascular disease in these subjects are unknown. We investigated whether a parental history of premature heart attack or stroke in hypertensive subjects is associated with abnormalities of sodium handling. METHODS AND RESULTS. Patients with mild, uncomplicated essential hypertension were divided into two subgroups according to family history: a subgroup with a parental history of premature heart attack or stroke (FV+, n = 18) and a subgroup with a family history completely negative for vascular accidents (FV-, n = 14). The two subgroups were comparable with respect to age, weight, sex distribution, blood pressure, duration of hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, renal function, and organ damage. Baseline plasma renin activity (PRA), concentrations of aldosterone (PA), atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and norepinephrine, and urinary electrolyte excretion were also comparable in the two subgroups. Despite these similarities, the responses to an acute saline load, measured under controlled metabolic and experimental conditions, were different in the two subgroups. In the FV+ subgroup at 60 minutes of saline load, PRA fell by 1.0 +/- 0.2 ng/ml/hr and PA concentration by 89.4 +/- 26 pg/ml and ANF concentration increased by 38 +/- 9 pg/ml, whereas in the FV- subgroup the corresponding responses were -2.3 +/- 0.3 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.005), -190 +/- 43 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), and 80 +/- 13 pg/ml (p less than 0.005), respectively. Urinary sodium excretion was delayed in the FV+ subgroup (270 +/- 67 mu eq/min at 60 minutes) compared with the FV- subgroup (555 +/- 157 mu eq/min at 60 minutes, p less than 0.05). At 120 minutes of saline load, significant (p less than 0.005) differences in PRA and ANF concentration were still observed. In a control group of eight normal subjects the responses to a saline load were comparable to those in the FV- subgroup but greater than those in the FV+ subgroup at 60 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. These results provide evidence that the hormonal and renal adjustments to an acute salt load are impaired in hypertensive patients with a parental history of vascular accidents. We speculate that abnormalities of sodium handling may represent markers of a more rapid development of vascular injury in human hypertension. 
Rare intrathoracic complications in acute pancreatitis. Ascites and pleural effusions may complicate pancreatitis but pericarditis with pericardial effusion and tamponade is rare and necrosis of mediastinal fat has not been described before. All these complications occurred in the case reported here. 
Gentamicin and vancomycin removal by continuous venovenous hemofiltration. The dispositions and dose requirements for vancomycin and gentamicin were investigated in a 58-year-old man who was receiving long-term continuous venovenous hemofiltration. Estimates of clearance were obtained using a Bayesian parameter estimation program and stayed remarkably consistent throughout the therapy. Single daily doses of both vancomycin and gentamicin generally maintained the profiles for both drugs around the target ranges of peak 5-10 mg/L (gentamicin) and 25-40 mg/L (vancomycin) and trough less than 2 mg/L (gentamicin) and less than 10 mg/L (vancomycin). 
Spinal cord herniation associated with an intradural spinal arachnoid cyst diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. Two rare cases of spinal cord herniation associated with intradural spinal arachnoid cyst are reported. A preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated the presence of spinal cord herniation, identified as a protrusion continuous with the spinal cord. Surgery upon the intradural spinal arachnoid cyst improved progressive neurological dysfunction. The authors postulate that spinal cord herniation occurred for the following reason: The pressure of the intradural arachnoid cyst on the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord caused thinning of the dura, leading to a tear and, thus, the development of an extradural arachnoid cyst. Along with the enlargement of intradural arachnoid cyst, the spinal cord herniated through the tear in the dura into the extradural arachnoid cyst. 
Spinal cord schistosomiasis: a pediatric case mimicking intrinsic cord neoplasm. We present the clinical, myelographic, MRI, and histologic data on a 7-year-old girl with confirmed Schistosoma mansoni infection of the spinal cord. MRI of the granulomatous spinal lesion revealed extensive enlargement of the cord in the T11-12 area, with some intramedullary swelling extending to T-5 through T-7. The clinical manifestations of spinal schistosomiasis can be diverse, and there should be a high index of suspicion for all patients from endemic areas. 
Collagen stability and collagenolytic activity in the normal and aneurysmal human abdominal aorta. Two issues were addressed in this study. The first was whether a bona fide collagenase exists within the wall of the aorta. The second was whether the activity of this putative collagenase is greater in aneurysmal tissue. No collagenase could be extracted from the wall of the aorta under nondenaturing conditions. However, hydroxyproline was liberated from tissue samples allowed to autolyze at neutral pH under reaction conditions favoring the activity of collagenase. Such an activity was probably enzymic as it occurred in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion and was suppressed by chelators. In normal and stenotic tissue, activity was increased by adding aminophenylmercuric acetate, an activator of latent collagenase. Examination of the blanks revealed that the collagen of aneurysmal aorta was more soluble than normal. Furthermore, its digestion kinetics differed in a way that suggested that aneurysmal aorta possessed a labile component that was absent from normal tissue. Although the activity of the putative aortic collagenase was higher than normal in the aneurysmal tissue, our assays do not distinguish between changes in the amount or activity of the enzyme and alterations in the collagen. 
Late follow-up after repair of left ventricular aneurysm and (usually) associated coronary bypass grafting. This study assesses clinical and operative data (LV) aneurysm was repaired to determine factors that might predict in-hospital and long-term outcome. Long-term follow-up study was obtained in 296 of 298 patients undergoing LV aneurysm repair with or without coronary artery bypass grafting between 1974 and 1986. No patient had sustained a myocardial infarction within 2 weeks of surgery or was undergoing other concurrent cardiac surgery. The average age of the study patients was 57 +/- 9 years and the average ejection fraction was 35 +/- 13%. Ninety percent of the patients underwent concurrent bypass grafting, with an average of 2.2 +/- 1.3 grafts placed. Fourteen (5%) patients died in the hospital, with most deaths attributable to LV dysfunction. Advanced age and less extensive revascularization were correlates of in-hospital mortality. The 10-year survival was 57%, myocardial infarction-free survival 43%, and freedom from death, myocardial infarction and reoperative coronary surgery 41%. Advanced age, systemic hypertension, significant left main coronary artery narrowing and emergent operative status were multivariate correlates of long-term mortality. A low-risk population was defined by the absence of these risk factors, and high-risk by the presence of greater than or equal to 1 risk factors. The 10-year survival was 71% in the low-risk and 41% in the high-risk groups (p = .0006). The 10-year myocardial infarction free survival was 55% in the low-risk and 31% in the high-risk groups (p = 0.0017). LV aneurysm repair may be performed with acceptable in-hospital mortality, and the long-term risk may be stratified. 
Insulin resistance after surgery: normalization by insulin treatment. 1. Injury is known to be associated with variable degrees of tissue insensitivity to insulin. We measured insulin resistance in a group of non-obese, glucose-tolerant patients undergoing major elective surgery with an uncomplicated post-operative course. 2. Shortly after surgery, hyperglycaemia (7.3 +/- 0.6 versus 4.2 +/- 0.3 mmol/l glucose pre-surgery, mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01) with normal insulin concentrations (73 +/- 15 versus 64 +/- 18 pmol/l) suggested the presence of insulin resistance. Counter-regulatory hormones were raised, whole-body protein oxidation was doubled (P less than 0.01) and energy expenditure was up by 18% (P less than 0.01). 3. Insulin sensitivity was quantified by clamping plasma glucose concentrations at 5.6 mmol/l during 24 h of total parenteral nutrition (15% protein, 55% glucose and 30% fat, supplying 1.25 times the measured resting energy expenditure) with a variable infusion of exogenous insulin. After surgery, eight times more insulin was needed than before surgery (14.14 +/- 1.15 versus 1.78 +/- 0.29 pmol min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.001) to maintain euglycemia. 4. After surgery, stimulation of net carbohydrate oxidation (18.8 +/- 1.4 versus 17.2 +/- 1.8 mumol min-1 kg-1 preoperatively, not significant), suppression of lipolysis and lipid oxidation and inhibition of ketogenesis occurred to the same extent as before surgery. Of the infused nutrients, the glucose was all oxidized, amino acids replaced endogenous protein losses (= neutral nitrogen balance) and lipids were stored. Insulin administration caused no further increment in oxygen consumption or energy expenditure. 
Renal effects of ANF (95-126), a new atrial peptide analogue, in dogs with experimental heart failure. Atrial natriuretic factor 95-126 [ANF (95-126)] is a novel 32 amino acid peptide which is thought to originate from the kidney. The systemic hemodynamic and renal effects of equimolar doses of intravenous synthetic ANF (95-126) and synthetic alpha ANF (99-126) were examined in normal dogs (n = 6) and in dogs with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and chronic compensated high-output heart failure (n = 5). ANF (95-126) and alpha ANF (99-126) were infused at 5 and 10 pmol/kg/min for 75-min periods each. In the normal and AV fistula dogs the two peptides similarly decreased mean arterial pressures and right atrial pressures (P less than .05). Creatinine clearance and urinary volume excretion increased (P less than .05) in the normal dogs with both peptides, but only ANF (95-126) produced significant elevations (P less than .05) of these two parameters in the AV fistula animals. With the highest infusion dose, ANF (95-126) increased urinary sodium excretion to at least twice the levels observed with alpha ANF (99-126) in both groups of dogs (P less than .05). The decreases in plasma renin and aldosterone were comparable for the two peptides in both groups of animals. These results indicate that ANF (95-126) is more potent than alpha ANF (99-126) for the promotion of a natriuresis, particularly in AV fistula dogs with compensated high-output heart failure, in which the sodium excretory actions of alpha ANF (99-126) were attenuated markedly. 
Percutaneous biopsy of left adrenal masses: prevalence of pancreatitis after anterior approach. Acute pancreatitis is an unusual but recognized complication of percutaneous aspiration biopsy of the pancreas. As the pancreatic tail is located anterior to the left adrenal gland, percutaneous biopsy of a left adrenal mass via the anterior approach may result in needle passage through the tail of the pancreas with subsequent potential development of pancreatitis. To evaluate this risk, we retrospectively reviewed 48 CT-directed percutaneous aspiration biopsies of left adrenal masses done between 1984 and 1989 at two institutions. Positioning of the patient, the course of the needle, the number of needle passes, and the size of the needle were analyzed. Thirty-three (69%) of 48 biopsies of a left adrenal mass were performed by using the anterior approach. The pancreas was traversed by one or more needles in 32 of 33 cases. Biopsies were performed with 20- to 22-gauge needles, and the number of needle passes varied widely. The medical records of the 33 patients in whom the anterior approach was used also were reviewed for complications. Acute pancreatitis, which required 11-13 days of hospitalization, developed in two patients (6%). None of the other 31 patients suffered a complication. We conclude that the pancreatic tail is routinely traversed by the biopsy needle when biopsy of a left adrenal mass is done via the anterior approach and that severe acute pancreatitis can occur as a result. 
Changes of DNA methylation and chromatin structure in the human myeloperoxidase gene during myeloid differentiation. Expression of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene is tightly regulated in a tissue- and development-specific manner. Accumulation of MPO messenger RNA (mRNA) occurs only at the late myeloblastic and promyelocytic stages of myeloid differentiation and is negligible at other stages of myeloid development and in other tissues. The goal of our studies was to begin to understand the events that occur to control MPO gene expression during normal granulocytopoiesis. Chromatin structure of the MPO gene was evaluated by DNase I treatment of isolated nuclei and Southern blot analysis. No detectable DNase I hypersensitive sites were found in the region of the MPO gene in non-myeloid cells. One site was present in the 5' upstream region in myeloid cells that are developmentally too immature to transcribe MPO. Three sites of hypersensitivity in the regions of the putative MPO promoter and upstream region occurred in MPO-expressing promyelocytes. These sites were markedly reduced in terminally differentiated, non-expressing myeloid cells. Analysis of DNA methylation of the MPO gene using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes showed that the gene was highly methylated in non-myeloid cells. Stepwise demethylation occurred in myeloid cells developmentally too immature to transcribe MPO. Maximal demethylation in the 5' gene region occurred in MPO-expressing promyelocytes. This methylation pattern did not change in terminally differentiated, MPO non-expressing myeloid cells. A somatic hybrid cell formed by fusion of HL-60 (MPO-expressing cells) and PUT (MPO non-expressing lymphoid cells) extinguished expression of MPO and showed a chimeric pattern of MPO gene methylation, suggesting that demethylation is necessary but not sufficient for expression of the MPO gene. Our studies show that demethylation and DNase I hypersensitivity of the MPO gene were associated with a tissue-dependent potential for MPO gene expression that preceded the developmental ability to express MPO mRNA. 
Genetic susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. Genetic factors clearly cause Lewy-body Parkinson's disease (PD) in a subset of autosomal-dominant families. However, most cases of PD are sporadic. The two most likely models of four discussed for sporadic PD are the reduced penetrance model and the multifactorial model. Sporadic PD is likely to be caused by the combined effect of environmental precipitating factors and genetic susceptibility factors. Because the number of major genetic factors is likely to be small, these hypotheses can be tested and genetic factors located using linkage mapping techniques. The affected pair analysis methods are especially suited to PD. Finding the genetic susceptibility factors for PD is important because this may be the fastest way to identify the environmental precipitating factors and because it may lead to prevention of PD. Because of the usefulness of identifying genetic susceptibility factors for PD, we are carrying out linkage studies in a group of 16 large autosomal-dominant families with PD and more than 300 living affected PD pairs. 
Tardive dyskinesia and chronic pain. Psychotropic drugs are frequently used to treat chronic pain. Tardive dyskinesia is a serious complication of such therapy, but is not mentioned in the pain literature. Two cases are reported and the implications discussed. 
Fracture line in post head injury optic nerve damage. Diminution of vision following head injuries involving the optic canal is not uncommon. In order to find out how a blunt trauma to the frontotemporal region produced damage to the optic nerve in its canalicular portion, this study was conducted on cadaveric skulls and its results are described. 
Auscultation with an esophageal stethoscope. A new test for pneumoperitoneum. Auscultation for the tympanic sound characteristic of developing pneumoperitoneum during insufflation of the abdomen at laparoscopy was performed with an esophageal stethoscope. Such auscultation detected pneumoperitoneum as soon as or sooner than did the other, standard methods to which it was compared. This test requires no additional maneuvers beyond those routine in standard laparoscopic and anesthetic procedures, providing a useful adjunctive test for pneumoperitoneum acquisition. 
Benign arterial dissections of the posterior circulation. Four young adults with spontaneous dissection of the vertebrobasilar system are reported. Clinically, two patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and two with brain-stem ischemia. In two cases of ruptured arterial dissection of the posterior cerebral artery, angiography demonstrated fusiform and "sausage-like" dilatation of the involved vessel. In two cases of occlusive dissection of the basilar artery, angiography revealed the typical "string sign." All four patients were treated conservatively: three survive in good clinical condition and one remains disabled. Follow-up angiograms showed spontaneous healing of the lesion with return to an almost normal arterial configuration in two cases; residual narrowing corresponding to the dissection was the most notable finding in the other two. It is recommended that, in a subset of neurologically stable patients, angiographic monitoring is undertaken to assess the tendency for spontaneous repair before surgical intervention is planned. 
Presence of PAF-acether in stool of patients with pouch ileoanal anastomosis and pouchitis. Platelet-activating factor is an endogenous phospholipid produced by a wide variety of inflammatory cells. Platelet-activating factor induces severe pathological changes in various organs and, among numerous potent effects, causes bowel necrosis. Pouchitis is a poorly understood complication of ileoanal pouch anastomosis which occurs in patients who undergo surgery for ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to measure ileal or fecal platelet-activating factor and lyso platelet-activating factor contents in normal volunteers (n = 12), in patients with terminal ileostomy (n = 7), and in patients with ileoanal anastomosis (n = 15) (8 patients have pouchitis defined by the presence of ulcerations on the reservoir). Fecal samples were processed and assessed for platelet-activating factor by platelet aggregation assay. The aggregating material was further characterized as platelet-activating factor by the following: inhibition of the platelet aggregation it induced by specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist (BN 52021; IHB, Le Plessis Robinson, France); abolition of platelet aggregation after incubation with phospholipase A2 but not with lipase A1; and retention time on high-performance liquid chromatography. Stool platelet-activating factor content (in nanograms per gram of stool, mean +/- 1SD) was significantly increased in patients with pouchitis (22.2 +/- 16 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (1.59 +/- 0.63 ng/g, P less than 0.01), terminal ileostomy (0.59 +/- 0.43 ng/g, P less than 0.01), and healthy controls (0 +/- 0 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.001). Lyso platelet-activating factor (nanograms per gram of stool) was increased in patients with pouchitis (10,704 +/- 5499 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (4721 +/- 4549 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.05), terminal ileostomy (3042 +/- 4019 ng/g, P less than 0.02), and healthy volunteers (128 +/- 107 ng/g, P less than 0.001). In patients with ileoanal anastomosis and pouchitis, increased platelet-activating factor production could be implicated in the inflammation and ulcerations observed in the reservoir. 
Quinine-induced immune thrombocytopenia associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome: a new clinical entity. Three patients are described who developed severe thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute renal failure after ingestion of quinine. In one patient, the same clinical findings recurred several months later after another exposure to quinine. Serum from one patient contained quinine-dependent IgG antibodies reactive with the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX complex. In the second and third cases, serum contained IgG and IgM antibodies reactive with both the GP Ib/IX and IIb/IIIa complexes in the presence of quinine. Quinine appears to have induced both immune thrombocytopenia and the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in these individuals. Findings made in these cases may have implications for the pathogenesis of some forms of HUS. 
Managing the care of patients with dementia. How to maximize level of functioning and minimize behavior problems. Effective treatment of patients with dementia involves supporting and educating the primary caregiver, uncovering and correcting the underlying cause of any decompensation that may occur, and deciding when drug therapy is appropriate. Caregivers must be taught how to cope with the patient's denial and how to modify the patient's environment so that it is safe and easy to understand. Pharmacologic therapy for depression accompanying dementia can improve a patient's quality of life and independence considerably; drugs may also be of help in dealing with patients who resist care. Psychotic symptoms usually do not require pharmacologic treatment, and hypnotics should, if possible, be avoided as a solution to sleep problems. 
Revision osteoarticular allograft transplantation in weight-bearing joints. A clinical review. The early results of revision osteoarticular allografts in weight-bearing joints are reported. Sixteen consecutive patients underwent surgery over a six-year period between 1982 and 1988. At the time of review eight patients (50%) had surviving second allografts with an average follow-up time of 48 months (range 12 to 87). Five patients were graded excellent according to the Mankin scale, one good and two fair. Eight patients (50%) required further surgery, but only two patients came to amputation. 
Inorganic mercury transport in the proximal tubule of the rabbit. Inorganic mercury transport was studied in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of the isolated perfused proximal tubule of the rabbit. The concentration of mercury in the perfusate was 18.4 microM. At this concentration all three segments of the proximal tubule underwent degenerative changes that proceeded to cellular necrosis at the end of the tubule which was attached to the perfusion pipet. This pathological process progressed along the tubule for approximately 200 microns. The remainder of the tubule, to the collection pipette, remained intact and free of any pathological changes. In examining the transport of mercury under these condition, it was found that, on average, the S1, S2, and S3 segments all removed inorganic mercury from the luminal fluid at approximately 140 fmol min-1 mm-1. The transport of mercury, as measured by the appearance of 203Hg in the bathing solution, was 80% lower than the removal of 203Hg from the luminal fluid. The mercury appearing in the bath could be accounted for by passive leakage through the necrotic portion of the tubule in the S1 and S2 segments, but not in the S3 segment. Leakage could account for only 16.2% of the transepithelial movement of inorganic mercury in the S3 segment. Inorganic mercury taken up by the tubule (92%) was primarily associated with the structural proteins of the tubular epithelial cells, while very little (8%) was found in the tubular extract. The toxicity of inorganic mercury was determined by titration. Perfusion with 1 microM inorganic mercury produced necrosis. The pathological features appeared to be the same as those resulting with 18.5 microM inorganic mercury. 
Colorectal ornithine decarboxylase activity in human mucosa and tumors: elevation of enzymatic activity in distal mucosa. To examine the value of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) assay as a biological marker of potential malignancy in large bowel, we harvested 43 colorectal carcinoma, 7 adenoma, 6 polyps, and 77 normal-appearing mucosa at surgery from patients with colorectal carcinoma. In addition, 13 normal rectal mucosa were obtained at biopsy from patients with benign diseases or diseases unrelated to colorectal carcinoma as normal control. ODC activity was significantly higher in polyps and adenocarcinomas than in normal-appearing mucosa from patients with colorectal carcinoma. ODC activity in normal-appearing mucosa varied throughout the large intestine, with significantly higher activities in the distal segment of the large bowel. The higher ODC activity detected in the sigmoid colon and rectum correlates with the larger incidence of tumor development in this region of the large bowel. This observation needs to be taken into consideration when ODC activities of the colorectal mucosa are measured as biological markers of potential malignancies. 
Pheochromocytoma of the urinary bladder. A case of pheochromocytoma of the bladder involving a ureteral orifice is presented, with a review of the literature. We discuss general management principles of bladder pheochromocytoma and factors specific to the management of our case, which allowed complete removal of the benign tumor while preserving bladder and ureteral function. Imaging modalities for localizing extraadrenal pheochromocytomas are reviewed. 
The concept of uterine preservation with ovarian malignancies. A 30-year-old woman with bilateral, recurrent, borderline papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary was treated with bilateral oophorocystectomy and omentectomy with uterine preservation. Ten years later, through induction of an artificial endometrial cycle and ovum donation, she conceived twins and delivered two healthy infants. Staging exploratory laparotomy at the time of cesarean delivery was negative for malignancy. This case illustrates the value of uterine preservation for cases in which classical teaching has indicated hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoophorectomy. 
Comparison of the effects of atenolol and nifedipine on glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism in patients with hypertension. Various aspects of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism have been studied in two groups of patients with mild hypertension before and after four months of treatment with either nifedipine (n = 12) or atenolol (n = 12). Mean (+/- SEM) blood pressure fell to the same degree following treatment with either nifedipine (147 +/- 3/98 +/- 2 to 134 +/- 2/85 +/- 2 mm Hg) or atenolol (149 +/- 3/99 +/- 2 to 135 +/- 2/86 +/- 3 mm Hg). Circulating plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations were measured at hourly intervals from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, before and after breakfast (8:00 AM), and at lunch time (noon). The response to treatment was different in the two groups. Specifically, plasma glucose concentration were unchanged and insulin concentrations were higher in association with atenolol treatment. In contrast, nifedipine-treated patients had similar plasma insulin, but lower plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations after four months of therapy. The changes in day-long plasma glucose and insulin responses suggested that resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake had increased in association with atenolol treatment and decreased following nifedipine. This conclusion was supported in that measurement of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal showed a decrease in atenolol-treated patients and an increase in nifedipine-treated patients. Finally, plasma lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations did not change following atenolol therapy, whereas plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in association with nifedipine administration. These data show that changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism observed with treatment of mild hypertension can vary significantly as a function of the drug used, despite similar beneficial effects on blood pressure. 
Toxicity and immunomodulatory effects of interleukin-2 after autologous bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies. Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for advanced hematologic malignancies is associated with high relapse rates. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells represent a potentially non-cross-resistant therapeutic modality that might prevent or delay relapses if used early after ABMT at a time when the tumor burden is minimal. However, high-dose chemoradiotherapy and ABMT might increase patients' susceptibility to IL-2 toxicity, and might interfere with immunologic responses to IL-2 in vivo. Therefore, to determine safety, tolerance, and immunomodulatory effects of IL-2 therapy early after ABMT, IL-2 was administered by continuous intravenous infusion to 16 patients 14 to 91 days (median, 33) after ABMT for acute leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. Patients were sequentially assigned to escalating IL-2 "induction" doses (0.3 to 4.5 x 10(6) U/m2/d, days 1 to 5), and all patients received a nonescalating IL-2 "maintenance" dose (0.3 x 10(6) U/m2/d, days 12 to 21). Most patients exhibited mild to moderate fever, nausea, diarrhea, and/or skin rash with IL-2 infusions. The maximum tolerated "induction" dose was 3.0 x 10(6) U/m2/d; dose-limiting toxicities were hypotension and thrombocytopenia. All toxicities reversed on stopping the IL-2 infusions, and all patients completed "maintenance." Postinfusion lymphocytosis was exhibited by patients at all IL-2 dose levels. With the higher IL-2 doses, increased percentages of patients' PBMC expressed CD16 and CD56, with augmented lysis of K562 and Daudi, reflecting the induction of natural killer and circulating LAK effector activities. Increased LAK precursor activity was exhibited by patients at all IL-2 dose levels. Thus, the IL-2 therapy regimen was safely tolerated after ABMT, and pronounced immunomodulatory effects were observed with the higher IL-2 doses. These studies support the planned use of IL-2 and LAK cells after ABMT in an attempt to reduce relapses of advanced hematologic malignancies. 
Evaluation of indium-111-labeled antifibrin monoclonal antibody for the diagnosis of venous thrombotic disease The potential advantage of using 111In-antifibrin (111In-AF) monoclonal antibody for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was studied in 44 patients with suspected DVT (27 underwent heparin therapy before 111In-AF injection). All patients had contrast venography (considered as the gold standard) and 111In-AF scintigraphy within 24 hr. Two to 3 mCi of 111In-AF were injected intravenously, and planar scintigraphy of the limbs was recorded within 10 min (17 times), 3 hr (44 times), and 18 hr (39 times). Indium-111-AF images were then interpreted without knowledge of the results of the other examinations. The DVT diagnostic accuracy of 111In-AF was greater when interpretation was based on images recorded at different time periods after injection. Indium-111-AF sensitivity for diagnosis of DVT was 85% (29/34) and was not apparently decreased by heparin therapy. None of the 10 patients with negative contrast venography had a positive 111In-AF scan. The results demonstrate the importance of recording serial images and the excellent accuracy of 111In-AF for diagnosing DVT. 
The stomach in liver cirrhosis. Endoscopic, morphological, and clinical correlations. The stomachs of cirrhotic patients are frequently subject to a number of alterations, detectable by endoscopy, the presence of which indicates a disturbance in the mucosa. Several investigators believe that portal hypertension plays an etiopathogenetic role. Three groups of subjects were studied prospectively: 83 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension, 53 cirrhotic patients without portal hypertension, and 135 control subjects. Snake skin, scarlatina rash, and petechia were the most frequent endoscopic findings in the cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension (P less than 0.001); these findings were also most frequently present in association with each other in this group. There was no correlation between the endoscopic findings, the clinical gravity of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade), and the gravity of esophageal varices (Beppu score). There were no characteristic inflammatory findings in the gastric mucosa. Hypergastrinemia was often observed in cirrhotic patients with and without angiodysplasias. 
Different lectin-binding patterns in primary breast cancers and their metastases. The expression of glycoconjugates in primary tumors and their metastases in 18 consecutive cases of metastasized breast cancer was studied by use of lectin histochemistry. Paraffin sections were stained with a panel of seven fluorochrome-labeled lectins with defined sugar specificities. The study revealed variation in the lectin binding patterns of individual cancers. In the primary tumors the lectin reactivity was diversified, whereas in their respective metastases it was rather homogeneous. This finding indicates that there is intratumoral heterogeneity in the primary cancers, whereas the selected subclones of malignant cells with restricted glycoconjugate expression seem to give rise to metastases. 
Pyridostigmine used as a nerve agent pretreatment under wartime conditions. OBJECTIVE. To determine the adverse effects of pretreatment with pyridostigmine bromide for nerve agent exposure during wartime. DESIGN. A retrospective study. SETTING. Southwest Asia. PARTICIPANTS. Personnel who provided medical support to the XVIII Airborne Corps. These medical officers supplied information pertaining to symptoms and disposition of 41,650 soldiers who received pyridostigmine at the onset of hostilities of Operation Desert Storm. INTERVENTION. Pyridostigmine bromide, 30 mg orally, was self-administered every 8 hours while under the threat of nerve agent attack (for 1 to 7 days). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. Physiologic changes attributable to pyridostigmine that resulted in need for medical attention, discontinuation of the drug, hospitalization, and/or evacuation from Southwest Asia. RESULTS. About half of the population noted physiologic changes that were not incapacitating, such as increased flatus, abdominal cramps, soft stools, and urinary urgency. Approximately 1% of the soldiers believed they had effects that warranted medical attention, but fewer than 0.1% had effects sufficient to discontinue the drug. Nonincapacitating symptoms often occurred; however, military mission performance was not impaired. CONCLUSION. While under the threat of nerve agent attack, pyridostigmine can be administered to virtually all soldiers. 
Phase I/II trial of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Forty-seven patients with hematologic neoplasia received recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) by daily 2-hour infusion following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from HLA-identical sibling donors in a phase I-II dose-escalation trial. Dose levels ranged from 30 to 500 micrograms/m2/d. At doses at or below 250 micrograms/m2/d, toxicity felt to be caused by rhGM-CSF was negligible. However, three of five patients treated with 500 micrograms/m2/d had unacceptable side effects caused by rhGM-CSF. Two different graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylactic regimens were administered. Twenty-seven evaluable patients were administered regimens that did not contain methotrexate (MTX) (Group I) and reached an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000/microL by a median of day 14. In contrast, 18 patients who received GVHD prophylactic regimens containing MTX (Group II) reached an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000/microL on a median of day 20. Patients in Group I had fewer febrile days and, of those discharged, had shorter initial hospitalizations than patients in Group II. The overall incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade 2 or greater) in the rhGM-CSF-treated patients was 28% and was similar to that in historical "good risk" patients who did not receive rhGM-CSF. These preliminary data suggest rhGM-CSF is unlikely to exacerbate GVHD in HLA-identical sibling donor transplants and indicate the need for randomized trials of rhGM-CSF in allogeneic marrow transplant patients. 
Diffusion-weighted MR imaging of the brain: value of differentiating between extraaxial cysts and epidermoid tumors. This study demonstrates the use of diffusion-weighted MR imaging in improving the specificity of the diagnosis of extraaxial brain tumors. Three surgically proved lesions (one arachnoid cyst and two epidermoid tumors) and two nonsurgically proved lesions (arachnoid and ependymal cysts) were evaluated with T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo studies followed by intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MR imaging. The IVIM images of the lesions were displayed as an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) image obtained at 0.65 G/cm (maximum gradient b value = 100 sec/mm2) and compared with external oil and water phantoms. The ADC of arachnoid cysts was similar to stationary water whereas the ADC of epidermoid tumors was similar to brain parenchyma, indicating the solid nature and the slower diffusion rate of the epidermoid tumors. Cisternal CSF demonstrated uniformly high ADC, primarily because of bulk flow, which enhanced image contrast. Improved delineation of postsurgical changes was also possible. Our preliminary results show that diffusion-weighted MR imaging can be useful in distinguishing between arachnoid cysts and epidermoid tumors. 
Invasive Chrysosporium infection of the nose and paranasal sinuses in an immunocompromised host. Aggressive fungal rhinosinusitis with Chrysosporium sp. occurred in a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia. The infecting organism is an exceedingly rare human pathogen. Usually, human chrysosporial infections are mild and unmarked by symptoms. Most case reports appear in the pathology literature and describe the incidental finding of adiaspores in the pulmonary parenchyma at autopsy. Clinical disease from active growth of chrysosporial mycelia in human tissues has been noted on a porcine aortic valve prosthesis and in a tibial abscess. Hyphal elements were not recovered from any other body parts of these patients. Histopathologic and microbiologic studies permitted the identification of this rarely encountered organism. Our patient experienced systemic spread of Chrysosporium organisms. Treatment of this pathogen is the same as for other opportunistic fungal infections. 
Conventional versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the randomized controlled trial. Cholecystectomy Study Group We considered using a randomized trial to assess the value of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. The pros and cons for the timing of such a trial were in favour of not beginning the trial until surgeons learned to use the new procedure safely and effectively, and until key endpoints and outcome indices could be identified and assessed using valid measures. Instead an observational study was implemented to monitor the learning curve of surgeons as they mastered the laparoscopic equipment and procedures, and to assess the responses of the patients to the procedure. In the first 100 patients, the procedure proved to be as safe and feasible to use as conventional surgery, and there were strong benefits in terms of quicker recovery of the patients with less pain, discomfort, and a reduced length of hospital stay. The responses of the surgeons and the patients to the new procedure now place ethical constraints on the planning of a randomized controlled trial. Currently, comprehensive surveillance and monitoring of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the only realistic method with which to assess the impact of this new technology in our clinic. 
The radiology of headache. The patient who presents with a severe and acute headache should be evaluated radiographically with CT. The key diagnosis to make in this situation is hemorrhage, either subarachnoid or intraparenchymal. Computed tomography is more sensitive to acute hemorrhage than is MRI. When the patient is stable, MRI frequently contributes information to narrow the diagnostic possibilities, because vascular malformations and certain parenchymal lesions have a characteristic appearance on MRI. Hydrocephalus may also present acutely and is easily seen on CT or MRI. In a patient may show WMF and atrophy. The patient with trigeminal neuropathy may demonstrate central or peripheral lesions. In temporomandibular joint dysfunction, conventional tomography and MRI are frequently used. Magnetic resonance imaging shows excellent detail of the disk and surrounding soft tissues, whereas tomography better demonstrates bony changes. When a history of trauma is present, MRI may show a subacute subdural hematoma. These collections are easily seen on MRI, even when isodense on CT. Evidence of old shear injury is also well seen on MRI. Finally, neoplastic, inflammatory, congenital, and idiopathic sources of headache may be demonstrated by either MRI or CT, depending on presentation. MRI will generally show superior characterization. 
Successful removal of massive intragastric gallstones by endoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy and mechanical lithotripsy. We describe a case of massive gallstones discharged into the stomach through a cholecystoduodenal fistula and the successful removal of these stones by endoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EEHL) and endoscopic mechanical lithotripsy (EML) for the prevention of gallstone ileus. A 60-yr-old woman was admitted with epigastric pain and nausea. Upper gastrointestinal tract examination demonstrated backflow of contrast medium from the duodenal bulb into the gallbladder. Endoscopic examination revealed a large fistula on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb, and two brown stones (about 3 cm in diameter) were found in the stomach. To prevent gallstone ileus, removal of these stones was attempted. They were broken into pieces by EEHL, then crushed into smaller pieces by EML and removed orally. Chemical analysis showed the composition of the gallstones to be at least 98% cholesterol. The patient was discharged one month after removal of the gallstones and has remained asymptomatic. 
Reactive arthritis due to hidradenitis suppurativa mimicking osteomyelitis. We have reported a case of erosive arthritis of the hand preceding the appearance of hidradenitis suppurativa in the ipsilateral axilla, which was mistaken for osteomyelitis. Recognition of this presentation is important to avoid unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures and to initiate prompt treatment directed at the underlying cause. 
Ovarian cancer screening. For populations in which preventive measures have been applied for the more common causes of death, the early detection of ovarian cancer becomes the next focus of efforts to reduce premature death among women. Data regarding the effectiveness of ultrasonography in detecting early-stage ovarian cancer are reviewed. Ultrasonography is more sensitive than pelvic examination in detecting ovarian abnormalities but lacks specificity in distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian lesions. Combined with serum CA 125 levels, ultrasonography may provide an effective screening tool, although cost-effectiveness has not been demonstrated and its effectiveness in reducing mortality from ovarian cancer has not been completely evaluated. Guidelines are presented for the use of ultrasonography in evaluating the postmenopausal ovary. 
Histiocytes in Sweet's syndrome. The histological features of biopsies from 18 previously unreported cases of Sweet's syndrome are reported. The dermal infiltrate in the majority of the cases contained numerous histiocytes that at first sight appeared to mimic neutrophils. The immunophenotype of these histiocytes was consistent with monocytes that have freshly infiltrated into the lesions. Only two of the cases in this series, associated with leukaemia, displayed the histological features of Sweet's syndrome with a predominant neutrophilic infiltration. We suggest that the initiating mechanisms in Sweet's syndrome are that monocyte/histiocyte-derived cytokines such as the interleukins IL-1 and IL-8, secreted either by infiltrating histiocytes in the non-leukaemia-associated cases of Sweet's syndrome or by tumoural myelomonocytic cells in those associated with leukaemia, are responsible for the systemic manifestations and the infiltration with neutrophils in the skin lesions. 
Elevated circulating interleukin-6 is associated with an acute-phase response but reduced fixed hepatic protein synthesis in patients with cancer. It has been suggested that, as part of the inflammatory response to the presence of a tumor, various cytokines are produced and these induce hepatic synthesis of acute-phase proteins (APP). Under these circumstances it is not known what changes occur in the fixed component of hepatic protein synthesis. The aim of this study was to compare circulating interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) concentrations and fixed hepatic protein synthesis rates in a group of healthy controls (n = 6) with a group of patients with an established APP response secondary to hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer (n = 6). Fixed hepatic protein synthesis rates were measured following a primed, constant 20-hour infusion of 15N-glycine. The liver was biopsied at laparotomy. The APP response was assessed by serum C-reactive protein concentration and cytokines were assayed by a combination of immunoassay and bioassay. The patients with advanced cancer and an on-going APP response had elevated circulating IL-6 concentrations (p less than 0.01). Rates of fixed hepatic protein synthesis were 30% lower than those observed in controls (p less than 0.01). These findings demonstrate that in patients with hepatic metastasis, although the synthesis of certain acute-phase export proteins can be increased, fixed protein synthesis is reduced. Whether these changes in the distribution of hepatic protein synthesis are mediated by IL-6 will require further investigation. 
Experience with a third-generation implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. A Medtronic 7216A pacemaker cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted in 16 patients (mean age 56 years) with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) and organic heart disease with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 33%. Endocardial and epicardial defibrillation shock efficacy was evaluated before or at implant using 1 to 3 shock patterns, i.e., monophasic single, sequential or simultaneous shocks with dual and triple electrode configurations. Endocardial leads used a common right ventricular cathode and dual anodes, whereas epicardial leads used 2 or 3 helical coil patches. VT termination was evaluated using pacing or shock therapy, or both, whereas only shocks were used in VF. Programmable bradycardia pacing, individual zones for VT and VF detection and individualized pacing and shock therapy for VT and VF were used. Monophasic shocks had epicardial defibrillation thresholds ranging from 3 to 18 (mean 10) J and were comparable for sequential and simultaneous shocks (p greater than 0.2). VT detection rates ranged from 340 to 470 ms and VF detection rates from 270 to 330 ms. VT or VF induction, or both, was performed noninvasively in 13 patients after implant and was reproducibly terminated by rapid pacing alone (5 patients), low-energy shocks (2 patients), high-energy shocks (3 patients) and combined therapy (3 patients). Intermediate or high-energy shocks terminated all induced VF episodes. During follow-up (2 to 12 months), there have been 2 noncardiac deaths. Electrical therapy was delivered in 7 patients, for VT (3 patients), VT and VF (3 patients) and indeterminate tachyarrhythmia (1 patient). All VT/VF episodes were successfully terminated, with 78 of 96 (81%) spontaneous VT episodes terminated by pacing. Follow-up reprogramming was required in 5 patients. It is concluded that successful application of individualized electrical therapy prescriptions in patients with VT/VF is feasible. Pacing therapies, which are effective for induced VT, can be reliably used for effective long-term spontaneous VT termination in conjunction with shock therapy and can permit reduced patient exposure to shock therapy. Thus, a programmable hybrid pacemaker cardioverter-defibrillator system provides nonthoracotomy implantation, effective VT/VF termination, demand ventricular pacing and noninvasive modes for arrhythmia induction, event monitoring and clinical trouble-shooting. 
Laparoscopic treatment of painful perihepatic adhesions in Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome. This report illustrates a case of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome associated with pelvic inflammatory disease in which the clinical symptom of right upper quadrant pain was severe and persistent despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Because of the atypical course, an extensive work-up was performed to rule out other possible etiologies for the pain. In this context, a laparoscopy was performed and identified dense adhesions between the liver and the anterior abdominal wall. These adhesions were safely and successfully lysed using a KTP/532 laser through a second puncture site. After surgery the pain was completely resolved, with no further recurrence after 6 months of follow-up. 
Severely injured geriatric patients return to independent living: a study of factors influencing function and independence. Our previous work demonstrated that geriatric trauma patients (age greater than 65 years) consume disproportionate amounts of health care resources. In the past we hypothesized that late mortality is high, long-term outcome is poor, and return to independence is low in a severely injured geriatric population. Of 6,480 trauma admissions over 5 years, geriatric patients (n = 495) with blunt trauma injury (n = 421) and an ISS greater than 16 (n = 105) who survived until discharge (n = 61) underwent long-term follow-up (mean = 2.82 years). We surveyed 20 measures of functional ability; 10 measures of independence; availability and use of rehabilitation resources; employment history; alcohol use; support systems; and nursing home requirements. Of the 105 patients, 7 were subsequently lost to follow-up. Among the remaining 98, 44 (44.9%) died in hospital and 54 (55.1%) were discharged and interviewed. The mean age of the contacted patients was 72.6; their mean ISS was 23.3. Forty eight of 54 (88.9%) were alive at the time of interview, while 6/54 (11.1%) had died. Although only 8/48 patients regained their preinjury level of function, 32/48 (67%) returned to independent living. The 32 independent patients, those with "acceptable" outcome, were compared with an "unacceptable" outcome group composed of the 44 in-hospital deaths, the 6 late deaths, and the 16 dependent patients. Factors associated with poor outcome include a GCS score less than or equal to (p = 0.001), age greater than or equal to 75 (p = 0.004), shock upon admission (p = 0.014), presence of head injury (p = 0.03), and sepsis (p = 0.03). 
Coronary bypass surgery improves global and regional left ventricular function following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. TAMI Study Group. Coronary bypass surgery was performed prior to hospital discharge in 303 (22%) of 1387 consecutive patients enrolled in the TAMI 1 to 3 and 5 trials of intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Bypass surgery was of emergency nature (less than 24 hours from treatment with intravenous thrombolytic therapy) in 36 (2.6%) and was deferred (greater than 24 hours) in 267 (19.3%) patients. The indications for bypass surgery included failed angioplasty (12%); left main or equivalent coronary disease (9%); complex or multivessel coronary disease (62%); recurrent postinfarction angina (13%); and refractory pump dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal rupture or abnormal predischarge functional test (1% each). Although patients having bypass surgery were older (59.5 +/- 9.8 versus 56.0 +/- 10.2 years, (p less than 0.0001), had more extensive coronary artery disease (46% with three-vessel disease versus 11%, (p less than 0.0001), had more frequent diabetes mellitus (19% versus 15%, (p = 0.048), had more prior infarctions (p less than 0.0001), had more severe initial depression in global left ventricular ejection fraction (48.0 +/- 11.9% versus 51.8 +/- 11.9%, p = 0.0002), and regional infarct zone (-2.7 +/- 0.94 versus -2.5 +/- 1.1 SD/chord, p = 0.02) and noninfarct zone function (-0.36 +/- 1.8 versus 0.43 +/- 1.6 SD/chord, p less than 0.0001) than patients not having coronary bypass surgery, no difference in the incidence of death in hospital (7% surgical versus 6% nonsurgical) or death at long-term follow-up of hospital survivors (7% surgical versus 6% nonsurgical) was noted between groups. Surgical patients demonstrated a greater degree of recovery in left ventricular ejection fraction (3.4 +/- 9.8% versus 0.16 +/- 8.5%, p = 0.036) and infarct zone regional function (0.71 +/- 1.1 versus 0.34 +/- 0.99 SD/chord, p = 0.001) when immediate (90 minutes following initiation of thrombolytic therapy) and predischarge (7 to 14 days after treatment) contrast left ventriculograms were compared than did patients who received only intravenous thrombolytic therapy with or without coronary angioplasty. These data suggest a beneficial influence of coronary bypass surgery on left ventricular function and possibly on the clinical outcome of patients initially treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. 
Mechanism of inhibitory action of prostaglandins on the growth of human gastric carcinoma cell line KATO III. Prostaglandins (PGs) play important roles in the regulation of various gastric functions. In this study, the effects of various PGs on the growth of the human gastric carcinoma cell line KATO III were investigated. All the PGs tested inhibited KATO III cell growth with a relative potency order of PGE2 greater than PGE1 greater than 17S,20-dimethyl-6-oxo PGE1-methyl ester (ornoprostil) greater than PGF2 alpha. This inhibition was accompanied by an increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate production. Furthermore, in the presence of guanosine triphosphate, these PGs stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the plasma membrane of KATO III cells, followed by enhancement of membrane guanosine triphosphatase activity. The relative potencies of these PGs for increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, activating adenylate cyclase, and enhancing guanosine triphosphatase activity were all comparable to those for inhibiting cell growth. On the other hand, the proliferation of KATO III cells was also inhibited by forskolin as well as dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate, whereas none of the agents that did not increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels had any effect. These results suggest that PGs inhibit KATO III cell growth by stimulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate production via a guanosine triphosphate-dependent process, suggesting the involvement of guanosine triphosphate-binding stimulatory protein, probably coupled to PGE2 receptors, in the action of PGs. 
Successful percutaneous closure of a complex coronary-to-pulmonary artery fistula using a detachable balloon: benefits of intra-procedural physiologic and angiographic assessment. A 48-yr-old woman presented with a loud continuous precordial murmur and symptoms of fatigue. Color-flow doppler imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging failed to show the cause of the murmur. Diagnostic catheterization showed a large left anterior descending coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula with impaired left ventricular wall motion. Two detachable balloons were deployed in the fistula with complete abolition of flow in the main fistula channel. A small parallel channel of the fistula, previously not appreciated due to vessel overlap, remained patent but had trivial flow as assessed by green-dye and oximetric techniques. The patient had immediate resolution of her symptoms and return of normal ventricular wall motion. 
Bilateral gluteus maximus transposition for anal incontinence. Seven patients (five men and two women) ranging in age from 26 to 65 years (means = 44) underwent bilateral gluteus maximus transposition for complete anal incontinence. The indications for operation were sphincter destruction secondary to multiple fistulotomies (n = 4), bilateral pudendal nerve damage (n = 2), and high imperforate anus (n = 1). The procedure is performed without the use of a diverting colostomy. The inferior portion of the origin of each gluteus maximus is detached from the sacrum and coccyx, bifurcated, and tunneled subcutaneously to encircle the anus. The ends are then sutured together to form two opposing slings of voluntary muscle. Postoperatively, six patients regained continence to solid stool, two to liquid stool as well, and only one patient in this group was able to control flatus. Although resting pressures remained unchanged, voluntary squeeze pressures were restored by this operation. In addition, rectal sensation was markedly improved, which helps make this a worthwhile procedure for properly selected patients. 
Effects of hemoperfusion during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty on left ventricular function. The effect of autologous blood perfusion, delivered through an angiographic power injector, on alleviating left ventricular (LV) hemodynamic deterioration during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was examined. LV systolic and diastolic pressures, LV peak positive and peak negative first derivative of LV pressure (dP/dt), and ST-segment shift were recorded in 9 patients with and without hemoperfusion. Hemoperfusion resulted in an improved LV hemodynamic profile during balloon occlusion, as reflected in LV systolic pressure (127 +/- 14 vs 120 +/- 15 mm Hg, p = 0.01), LV end-diastolic pressure (17 +/- 14 vs 25 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), peak positive (1,237 +/- 240 vs 1,149 +/- 225 mm Hg/s, p less than 0.05) and peak negative (1,666 +/- 357 vs 1,485 +/- 385 mm Hg/s, p = 0.003) dP/dt. Hemoperfusion provides substantial protection for significant LV dysfunction induced by conventional PTCA in 1-vessel angioplasty and is a feasible option to protect against potential cardiovascular collapse in high-risk PTCA. 
Cisplatin and fluorouracil chemotherapy does not yield long-term benefit in locally advanced head and neck cancer: results from a single institution. Fifty-one patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were treated with three cycles of cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-day continuous infusion fluorouracil (5-FU) at 1,000 mg/m2/d as induction chemotherapy. Subsequent local therapy consisted of surgery for patients with resectable disease and/or radiotherapy. Three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to patients with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to induction chemotherapy. Twenty-two patients (43%) had a clinical CR that was pathologically confirmed in 12 patients (24%), and 24 patients (47%) had a PR for an overall response rate of 90%. Local therapy included surgery in 24 patients (47%) and radiotherapy alone in 22 patients (43%). Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 32 patients (63%) frequently at great dose reduction. At a median follow-up of 90 months, the median survival is 22 months (95% confidence interval, 15 to 36 months), and the 5-year survival is 25%, with only five patients known to be alive and disease-free at this time. The median time to progression is 14 months, with 29 patients (57%) having documented progression of their head and neck cancer and eight (16%) having progression of a second neoplasm. Seven patients died of intervening medical events. This high incidence of second malignancies supports the continued investigation of chemoprevention for patients in CR. Despite the known high response rates achieved with cisplatin and 5-FU induction chemotherapy, the overall poor survival data reported here should lead to a thorough reexamination of the frequent administration of this regimen in the community. 
Periorbital necrobiotic xanthogranuloma and stage I multiple myeloma. Ultrastructure and response to pulsed dexamethasone documented by magnetic resonance imaging. We observed a 40-year-old woman with necrobiotic xanthogranuloma from the inception of indurated eyelid and periorbital infiltrates and concurrent stage I multiple myeloma to resolution of infiltrates in skin and bone marrow after pulsed high-dose oral dexamethasone therapy. Ultrastructural studies revealed lipid vacuoles in epidermal keratinocytes, in dermal histiocytic macrophages, and in vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells. The presence of lipid vacuoles in epidermal keratinocytes has not been reported previously in xanthogranuloma. 
Basal and maximum acid output after continuous overnight gastric aspiration. Basal and maximum acid outputs were measured on two occasions in a group of 15 duodenal ulcer (DU) patients in remission. The initial study was carried out after a nocturnal acid collection, whereas the second was carried out in the conventional manner without preceding nocturnal aspiration. No difference in the basal acid output, concentration, or volume of secretion was found between the two study days. Maximum acid output on the other hand, was significantly (p less than 0.02) reduced from 30.9 (14.2-41.2) mmol/h, median (+range), to 23.7 (8.1-33.7) mmol/h after overnight aspiration. The reduction in maximum acid output was attributable to a fall in the volume of gastric secretion from 280 (170-371) ml to 230 (142-280) ml. No fall in acid concentration was seen. We conclude that overnight gastric aspiration does not affect basal gastric secretion, but reduces the maximum acid output as a result of a reduced secretory volume. 
Helicobacter pylori infection and the risk of gastric carcinoma BACKGROUND. Infection with Helicobacter pylori has been linked with chronic atrophic gastritis, an inflammatory precursor of gastric adenocarcinoma. In a nested case-control study, we explored whether H. pylori infection increases the risk of gastric carcinoma. METHODS. From a cohort of 128,992 persons followed since the mid-1960s at a health maintenance organization, 186 patients with gastric carcinoma were selected as case patients and were matched according to age, sex, and race with 186 control subjects without gastric carcinoma. Stored serum samples collected during the 1960s were tested for IgG antibodies to H. pylori by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data on cigarette use, blood group, ulcer disease, and gastric surgery were obtained from questionnaires administered at enrollment. Tissue sections and pathology reports were reviewed to confirm the histologic results. RESULTS. The mean time between serum collection and the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma was 14.2 years. Of the 109 patients with confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma (excluding tumors of the gastroesophageal junction), 84 percent had been infected previously with H. pylori, as compared with 61 percent of the matched control subjects (odds ratio, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 7.3). Tumors of the gastroesophageal junction were not linked to H. pylori infection, nor were tumors in the gastric cardia. H. pylori was a particularly strong risk factor for stomach cancer in women (odds ratio, 18) and blacks (odds ratio, 9). A history of gastric surgery was independently associated with the development of cancer (odds ratio, 17; P = 0.03), but a history of peptic ulcer disease was negatively associated with subsequent gastric carcinoma (odds ratio, 0.2; P = 0.02). Neither blood group nor smoking history affected risk. CONCLUSIONS. Infection with H. pylori is associated with an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and may be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of this malignant condition. 
The noncemented porous-coated hip prosthesis. A three-year clinical follow-up study and roentgenographic analysis. This was a retrospective study reviewing 68 hip arthroplasties performed with noncemented, porous-coated components at three institutions in the period between December 1983 and June 1987. Fifty of these were available for follow-up study. The mean follow-up period was three years (range, 18-56 months). Thirty-seven patients were treated by total hip arthroplasty (THA) with porous-coated components, and thirteen were implanted with porous-coated femoral stems with bipolar endoprostheses using a porous-coated femoral stem and a universal head. The mean Harris hip score at follow-up evaluation for the entire group was 85.7 points. Eighty percent of the patients had either a good or excellent result. Those patients implanted with a porous femoral stem with bipolar acetabular components had only 54% good or excellent results compared with 90% good or excellent results for those having THA. Roentgenographic findings included a 59% rate of femoral neck cortex osteopenia, an 80% rate of medial or lateral distal cortical hypertrophy, and an 80% rate of distal bone bridging. All of these roentgenographic changes were secondary to changes in stress transference to the proximal femur. There was no correlation between thigh pain or the degree of bone-prosthesis radiolucencies and the fit of the femoral stem. 
Rupture of low transverse cesarean scars during trial of labor We report eight cases of rupture of low transverse cesarean scars occurring during trials of labor. The cases occurred in five hospitals in the Denver metropolitan area during a 13-month period. The estimated incidence was 0.7% of planned trials of labor. Complications of rupture included one neonatal death, two cases of severe neonatal asphyxia, three maternal bladder lacerations, and one hysterectomy. 
The influence of diazepam or lorazepam on the frequency of endotracheal intubation in childhood status epilepticus. Anticonvulsant management of status epilepticus (SE) may result in respiratory depression, often requiring endotracheal intubation (ETI). By examining rates of ETI in childhood SE after intravenous diazepam or lorazepam, when administered alone or in combination with phenytoin, the influence of anticonvulsants on the frequency of ETI during SE was determined. The medical records of 142 consecutive children younger than 16 years of age admitted from a university hospital ED with seizures during a 28-month period were retrospectively reviewed. SE was identified in 38 (27%) of cases. Records of children with SE were reviewed for demographic, seizure severity, and management variables. Twelve patients were excluded, ten of whom received concomitant phenobarbital. Patients receiving lorazepam had ETI rate of 27% (4/15), compared to 73% (8/11) in the diazepam group (P = 0.026, Fisher's exact). The groups were not significantly different in age, weight, sex, seizure type, seizure duration, and appropriate anticonvulsant dosage. A prospective, randomized trial comparing lorazepam and diazepam is warranted to confirm the apparent advantage of lorazepam in reducing respiratory depression. 
Opercular cheiro-oral syndrome. Perioral and distal upper limb sensory dysfunction (cheiro-oral syndrome) has classically been attributed to cortical involvement. In previously reported cases of the syndrome, caused by stroke, however, the thalamus or brain stem has been the actual site of the lesion. We have studied two patients with infarct in the superficial middle cerebral artery territory involving the parietal operculum. Sensory involvement was purely subjective in the face, but severe hypoesthesia was present in the distal upper limb, involving mainly position sense, stereognosis, and graphesthesia. Temperature and pain sensation were involved in one patient. These findings correlated with involvement of the lower part of the postcentral gyrus, more caudal parts of the parietal operculum, and underlying white matter. This opercular cheiro-oral syndrome seems more uncommon than faciobrachiocrural hemihypesthesia associated with anterior parietal artery territory infarct. A double supply to the parietal opercular region through branches of the temporal arteries and anterior parietal artery may explain the rarity of cheiro-oral syndrome resulting from hemisphere stroke, because simultaneous and partial compromise to two different pial artery networks is uncommon. 
Prevalence of simple adnexal cysts in postmenopausal women. This prospective study was performed with ultrasound (US) to determine the prevalence of unilocular, nonseptated adnexal cysts ("simple cysts") in healthy postmenopausal women and the relationship between cyst occurrence and both hormone replacement and length of time since onset of menopause. Transabdominal and transvaginal US were performed on 149 volunteers aged 50 years or older. Patients were classified according to hormone regimens (no hormones, unopposed estrogen, continuous daily estrogen and progesterone, and sequential estrogen and progesterone) and time since onset of menopause (less than 5 years, 5-10 years, and greater than 10 years). Simple adnexal cysts were found in 22 women with the aid of transvaginal and/or transabdominal US, yielding a relative frequency of 14.8% +/- 5.7% and a prevalence of 14,800 patients with cysts per 100,000 patients. No statistical relationship was found between cyst frequency and type of hormone replacement or length of time since onset of menopause. 
Rare presentation of a parapharyngeal schwannoma. Schwannoma, or neurilemmoma, is included in the differential diagnosis of masses in the parapharyngeal space. Schwannomata do not usually cause acute inflammation, and therefore do not tend to present as emergencies as in this case, in which there was acute respiratory embarrassment. 
Ventricular fibrillation complicating endomyocardial biopsy of a cardiac allograft. Transvenous endomyocardial biopsy remains the most useful diagnostic aid in assessing rejection in the transplanted heart. Although invasive, the complications associated with endomyocardial biopsy are few, and the procedure is generally regarded as safe. We report a case of apparent ventricular fibrillation complicating transvenous endomyocardial biopsy. Histologic section revealed evidence of moderate acute rejection. This case represents the first report of a life threatening ventricular dysrhythmia following routine endomyocardial biopsy in a cardiac transplant recipient. 
Fetal choroid plexus cysts in the second trimester of pregnancy: a cause for concern. Controversy surrounds the issue of recommending cytogenetic studies in second-trimester fetuses with fetal choroid plexus cysts. To assist in clarifying this issue, a prospective study was designed to describe the association between fetal choroid plexus cysts and aneuploidy in a large population. During a 3-year period 7350 women at 15 to 22 weeks' gestation underwent an ultrasonographic evaluation. Fetal choroid plexus cysts were diagnosed in 71 (0.96%) of these pregnancies. Sixty-two of the 71 patients elected to undergo amniocentesis. An abnormal karyotype was identified in four (6.4%) of these fetuses. One fetus had trisomy 21, and three fetuses were diagnosed with trisomy 18. These data indicate that it is reasonable to offer genetic counseling and cytogenetic studies in those patients identified as having a fetal choroid plexus cyst. 
Head-up tilt for the evaluation of syncope of unknown origin in children. Fifteen patients aged 10 to 18 years with syncope of unknown origin, and 10 healthy control children aged 11 to 18 years, were evaluated by head-up tilt to 60 degrees for 60 minutes. Six patients (43%) reproduced symptoms of syncope during the examination. Four had a typical vasovagal reaction; two had marked hyperventilation. None of the children in the control group had syncope. The head-up tilt test offers a simple, noninvasive, high-yielding diagnostic tool for evaluation of syncope in children. 
Endoscopic therapy for gastric cancer in patients more than 80 years old. We prospectively studied 17 gastric cancer patients who were more than 80 yr old, in whom endoscopic therapy was performed. The patients were divided into two groups: the first group included 13 patients in whom curative treatment was attempted, and in 11 (85%) a curative response was achieved. Two patients in this group showed a positive gastric biopsy after 1 and 2 yr, respectively, of therapy: one patient is under current treatment with laser therapy, and the other patient underwent surgery with resection of the stomach. The second group included four patients in whom treatment was aimed at prolonging survival or palliation, and in all four patients, a successful response was obtained. Therefore, our results demonstrate that endoscopic therapy is effective for the treatment of gastric cancer patients over 80 yr old. 
Expression and amplification of the HER-2/neu (c-erbB-2) protooncogene in epithelial ovarian tumors and cell lines. Amplification of the c-erbB-2 protooncogene has been associated with a poor prognosis in human breast and ovarian cancers. Our study was undertaken to examine whether amplification, rearrangement, or overexpression of c-erbB-2 and other protooncogenes was frequently observed in epithelial ovarian cancers. c-erbB-2 was expressed in 87% of 22 ovarian cancers analyzed, but expression was significantly increased in only one of the 22 tumor specimens. In this case elevated c-erbB-2 expression was associated with dramatic amplification of the gene. In another tumor a 3.8 kb EcoRI fragment was found, in addition to the usual 4.4 and 6.0 kb fragments; this is consistent with a possible gene rearrangement or a restriction fragment length polymorphism. To place these results in perspective, expression of several other protooncogenes has been examined in ovarian carcinomas. The c-fos, c-myc, n-myc, c-fms, and c-Ha-ras protooncogenes were expressed in different fractions of tumors, but expression of l-myc, c-erbB, c-myb, c-sis, and c-mos was not detectable. Aside from c-erbB-2, neither amplification nor rearrangement was observed among the other protooncogenes studied. Expression of c-erbB-2, c-fms, c-myc, n-myc, c-fos, and c-Ha-ras deserves further evaluation as a prognostic factor in ovarian cancer. 
Serum pepsinogen I concentrations in peptic ulcer patients in relation to ulcer location and stage. To investigate the relation of the serum group I pepsinogen (PG I) concentration to the location of gastric ulcers and chronicity of peptic ulcers, ulcer patients (n = 322) were compared with endoscopically normal subjects (n = 174). The mean PG I concentration was significantly higher in male control subjects (n = 90) than in female control subjects (n = 84). In male patients with ulcers in the duodenum (n = 69), antrum (n = 34), or angulus portion (the lower third of the body; n = 83), the mean serum PG I concentration was significantly higher than in the control subjects but in patients with an ulcer in the upper body (n = 49) it was similar to control values. Men with active or healing ulcers (n = 149) showed a significantly higher serum PG I concentration than those with scarred lesions (n = 86) when the abnormality was located in either the upper body or in the angulus portion. For female patients (n = 87), the results were similar. These results suggest that serum PG I concentrations reflect the stages of activity of peptic ulcer. 
Abnormal perception of visceral pain in response to gastric distension in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia. The irritable stomach syndrome. Sensory and pressure responses to gastric distension were evaluated in 24 consecutive patients suffering from chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and 20 healthy subjects. A latex balloon was placed in the proximal stomach and inflated by increments of 100 ml of air up to a maximal volume of 800 ml. Symptom response and intragastric pressure-volume curve were recorded during the gradual balloon distension. Thirteen of the 24 patients experienced pain at a distension volume less than or equal to 400 ml of air, but only one of the 20 controls (P less than 0.001). Intragastric pressure-volume curves were similar in patients and controls, and in patients with and without abnormal pain threshold, suggesting that a compliance defect was not the cause of the sensory anomaly. Gastric emptying of solids and liquids was measured in 20 of the 24 patients using a dual isotopic technique; psychological status was also evaluated in 18 patients using the Mini-Mult test. The frequency of the sensory anomaly was not different in patients with (7/14) or without (4/6) gastric stasis, but was lower in patients with (5/13) than in those without psychological disturbances (5/5, P less than 0.01). Thus, a primary visceral sensory anomaly, either alone or in conjunction with motility disturbances, can play an important role in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and must be taken in account for further therapeutic research. 
Association of nm23-H1 allelic deletions with distant metastases in colorectal carcinoma. A prospective study analysed the prognostic value of nm23-H1 allelic deletions in colorectal cancer. Of 21 patients with no evidence of distant metastases at initial operation, 11 showed nm23-H1 allelic deletions (including 1 homozygous deletion); 10 had no nm23-H1 deletions. After median follow-up of 25 months, distant metastases had developed in 8 of 11 (73%) patients with nm23-H1 deletions but in only 2 of 10 (20%) without nm23-H1 deletions (p less than 0.03). Tests with probe YNZ 22.1, near p53, showed no significant association with distant metastases. nm23-H1 may be, or may be located near, a late-acting suppressor gene in colorectal carcinoma, in which deletions may have prognostic value. 
Blood and liver-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary biliary cirrhosis: increase in activated T and natural killer cells and recruitment of primed memory T cells. We used two-color and three-color flow cytometric analysis to study phenotypical activation and functional subsets of T and natural killer cells in the blood and liver tissue of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, other chronic liver diseases and the blood of healthy subjects. The changes in blood lymphocyte phenotype in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases were similar and comprised elevated relative or absolute numbers of activated human leukocyte antigen-DR + T subset (CD4+ and CD8+) cells and DR+ natural killer-like (CD16+) cells. B cell (CD19+) numbers were normal. In primary biliary cirrhosis a selective reduction in T cells of suppressor-inducer (CD45RA + CD4 + ) type was registered. The human leukocyte antigen-DR expression among CD4+ T cell subsets was investigated further in primary biliary cirrhosis and healthy controls using triple antibody flow cytometric analysis. Phenotypical cell activation was confined to helper T cells of the primed, memory (CD45RO + CD4+) type. The decrease in suppressor-inducer T cells in primary biliary cirrhosis was paralleled by a reciprocal increase in primed memory T cells. Several significant differences were observed when blood and liver-infiltrating cells from primary biliary cirrhosis patients were compared. In the liver tissue, the CD4/CD8 ratio was decreased, the relative activation of T-subset cells and NK cells was further increased, the suppressor-inducer T subset was further depressed and the primed memory T subset was increased. The cytotoxic T-cell subset (CD11b-) dominated within the CD8+ population. In liver tissue from other chronic liver disease subjects, a lower CD4/CD8 ratio was found compared with primary biliary cirrhosis. 
Familial amyloid polyneuropathy: alanine-for-threonine substitution in the transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule. A previously reported family with amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) was reinvestigated to determine the type of mutation in the transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule. Transthyretin was isolated from amyloid-laden myocardium and serum, and tryptic peptides were resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid sequencing of an anomalous peptide revealed an alanine-for-threonine substitution corresponding to position No. 60 of the transthyretin monomer. Detection of the FAP gene in asymptomatic carriers was accomplished by hybrid isoelectric focusing of transthyretin in the presence of dithiothreitol and high concentrations of urea, and by Southern blotting of Pvull-digested leukocyte deoxyribonucleic acid. This type of FAP was found to be identical to the previously described Appalachian amyloid. Patients with FAP and their asymptomatic gene-carrying offspring had significantly reduced levels of serum transthyretin and retinol-binding protein. 
MRI of the facial nerve during paralysis. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI was used to evaluate 10 patients with Bell's palsy and one patient with facial paralysis secondary to Lyme disease. Nine of the eleven patients showed increased signal intensity of their facial nerve with gadolinium-enhanced MRI. In all nine patients, the facial nerve was involved at the labyrinthine, geniculate ganglion and proximal tympanic portions of the facial nerve, while two of the nine patients also had involvement of the mastoid segment of the facial nerve. Patients whose facial nerve enhancement was limited to the labyrinthine, geniculate ganglion and proximal tympanic facial nerve ultimately had complete return of facial function. Patients whose facial nerve enhanced in the mastoid segment experienced incomplete return of facial function. Gadolinium is effective in localizing the site of inflammation during facial paralysis. Those patients with enhancement localized to the labyrinthine, geniculate ganglion and proximal tympanic segments were more likely to regain complete facial function. In contrast, patients who had enhancement of the mastoid segment of the facial nerve had poorer prognoses for complete return of facial function. 
Necrotizing fasciitis: 10 years' experience in a district general hospital. Of 14 patients with necrotizing fasciitis who presented between 1979 and 1988, six (43 per cent) died. The deaths were associated with delays in diagnosis, poor surgical technique and diabetes. Prompt diagnosis, resuscitation and early radical surgery are essential to the successful management of necrotizing fasciitis. 
Primary intracerebral osteosarcoma. A 64-year-old man was admitted because of a rapidly progressive left side hemiparesis. A computed tomography scan showed a right side intrathalamic mass, partially calcified. Surgical specimen proved to be an osteosarcoma. The patient died 3 days later from an acute myocardial infarct. Autopsy failed to discover any other significant lesion. A review of the literature disclosed that this case might be the second published primary intracerebral osteosarcoma and the first with immunocytochemical analysis. 
Morphological changes of hepatic microcirculation in experimental rat cirrhosis: a scanning electron microscopic study. Morphological changes of hepatic microcirculation, especially peribiliary plexus, in experimental rat cirrhosis that resulted from the repeated intraperitoneal injections of N-diethylnitrosamine, 100 mg/kg body weight/one shot/week, were examined by scanning electron microscope. Control rats were treated with saline. Whole blood vessels of the rats were perfused by saline and stuffed with methylmethacrylated resin. Multiple nodular changes were seen in the livers after the five injections (5 wk) of N-diethylnitrosamine, and diffuse nodular transformations mimicking human cirrhosis after six injections (6 wk) were also seen. Overall changes in experimental rats were numerous vascular channels mainly composed of venous branches around the parenchymal nodules, increased arterioportal anastomoses and flattening of veins, especially hepatic vein branches. Peribiliary plexuses of the experimental rats were much richer in the vessels than those of the controls, and many dilated veins, ramified from portal vein branches, were present in the former. Direct connections between peribiliary plexuses and sinusoids or between peribiliary plexuses and portal veins increased in the experimental rats. Studies concerning microcirculatory changes of peribiliary plexuses in experimental rat cirrhosis are rare. It was concluded that the abnormal peribiliary plexuses in this experimental series might participate in a collateral circulation under a state of portal hypertension. 
Prognostic value of lymphocyte surface markers in acute myeloid leukemia. We studied the expression of cell surface antigens associated with myeloid and lymphoid leukemias on bone marrow-derived blast cells from 339 patients with newly diagnosed de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) enrolled on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) chemotherapy protocols. Surprisingly, of 211 cases studied for the expression of CD2 (T-cell marker, sheep erythrocyte binding receptor for T lymphocytes) 45 were positive (21%). In addition, of 298 patients studied for CD19 (B-lymphocyte marker), 41 were positive (14%). Overall, of 170 patients studied for both CD2 and CD19, 56 (33%) were positive. Interestingly, central review of the French-American-British (FAB) morphology of the CD2- and CD19-positive cases showed that FAB M3 was twice as frequent, and M4E eight times as frequent compared with the CD2- and CD19-negative cases. Of 22 lymphocyte antigen-positive cases in which cells were available for studies of Ig or T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, 20 were germline, one had a rearranged Ig heavy chain gene, and one had rearranged TCR beta and Ig heavy chain genes. The presence of messenger RNA for CD2 was demonstrated in four CD2 surface antigen-positive cases, thus validating the cell surface data. Lymphocyte antigen-positive cases had karyotypes commonly seen in AML; 71% of cases with an abnormal clone had t(8;21)(q22;q22), inversion 16(p13q22), t(15;17)(q22;q12), or t(9;11)(p22;q23). The patients with lymphocyte markers had a significantly higher incidence of these karyotypic abnormalities compared with patients with lymphocyte antigen-negative AML (34% v 15%, P less than .02). When the outcome to therapy of the lymphocyte antigen-positive cases was compared with that for the CD2, CD19-negative cases, we found that the CD2, CD19-positive cases actually had higher complete remission rates (75% v 59%, P = .04), and significantly longer time to failure (P = .02; 32.4% +/- 6.0% v 18.0% +/- 4.1% at 2 years) and overall survival (P = .02; 43.5% +/- 6.3% v 26.0% +/- 4.5% at 2 years). CD2 antigen-positive cases also had a significantly superior survival (P = .02; 43.8% +/- 7.9% v 29.8% +/- 3.8% at 2 years). There were no significant differences (P less than or equal to .05) between the two groups in age, leukocyte count at diagnosis, incidence of extramedullary disease, or FAB classification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Bleeding peptic ulcer after abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. A retrospective study of 112 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and 232 with arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) demonstrated that 16.7% of those with AAA and 1.6% of those with ASO had a history of gastroduodenal ulcer; 83% of these lesions with AAA were gastric ulcers. Ulcer bleeding after vascular reconstruction developed in seven patients with AAA and one with ASO. Serum fibrinogen levels and platelet counts were significantly lower in patients with AAA than in those with ASO or controls. A prospective study showed that 25 (52.1%) of 48 patients with AAA and six (20.0%) of 30 patients with ASO had endoscopically proved gastroduodenal lesions before vascular reconstruction. None of them developed postoperative bleeding after treatment of both their gastroduodenal lesions and coagulopathy. Furthermore, the significant decrease in blood flow and prostaglandin content of gastric mucosa was demonstrated in patients with AAA. 
Severity of obstructive sleep apnea. A four-level severity scale for obstructive sleep apnea is offered using four criteria: maximum oxygen desaturation, apnea/hyponea index, symptoms of excessive day-time sleepiness, and symptoms of related cardiac disease. Oxygen desaturation and the apnea/hyponea index for 175 patients, all having had uvulopalatopharyngoplasty surgery, showed 19% mild, 33% moderate, 17% moderately severe, and 31% severe obstructive sleep apnea. There was a very poor correlation between oxygen desaturations and number of obstructive events, which demands that both be used in any estimation of disease severity. 
Bilateral symmetrical striopallidodentate calcification associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism demonstrated in a patient with cerebellar astrocytoma. A case of calcification in the striopallidodentate system associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism, clinically manifested after operation for a cystic astrocytoma of the cerebellar vermis, is reported. Bilateral symmetrical striopallidodentate calcification accompanying a disturbance in calcium metabolism is rare. Only a few cases have been described previously in the literature, of which only six were accompanied by pseudohypoparathyroidism. The importance of identifying hypoparathyroidism, especially pseudohypoparathyroidism, early in the course of investigation is discussed. 
Washed human platelets prevent ischemia-reperfusion edema in isolated rabbit lungs. Washed human platelets prevent edema formation in isolated rabbit lungs infused with xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that injures endothelial membranes by generating extracellular oxidants. We hypothesized that platelets would similarly preserve membrane permeability in isolated lungs exposed to ischemia-reperfusion injury, a model that perturbs endothelial cells by the generation of intracellular oxidants. Isolated perfused rabbit lungs (IPL) were exposed to warm ischemia-reperfusion to cause lung edema. The infusion of washed human platelets (1.05 +/- 0.02 x 10(10) cells) prevented edema formation as measured by lung weight gain, wet-to-dry lung weight ratios, histological edema, and preservation of paraendothelial cell tight junctions. Inhibition of the platelet glutathione redox cycle with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, dehydroepiandrosterone, or 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene interfered with platelet protective effects. In contrast, inhibition of platelet catalase with aminotriazole and H2O2 had no effect on platelet protection. Lung tissue malonyldialdehyde concentrations were similar in isolated lungs exposed to ischemia-reperfusion with or without the infusion of platelets. These results indicate that platelet attenuation of ischemia-reperfusion lung edema depends on platelet glutathione redox cycle antioxidants but not platelet catalase. 
Hypermetabolism in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Two patients who developed hypermetabolic reactions during anaesthesia and surgery and who were suffering from arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are reported and it is proposed that the reaction is distinct from malignant hyperthermia and independent of the anaesthetic agents used. The implications for anaesthetists involved in the management of patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are discussed. 
Nonaspiration fine-needle cytology of the liver: a new technique for obtaining diagnostic samples. We studied a new method of obtaining diagnostic cytology samples from the liver that differs from fine-needle aspiration cytology in that no suction is used to obtain the sample. This method is simpler to perform than traditional aspiration biopsy and yields concentrated cell smears that are easier to interpret. The sample enters the needle because of capillary action, a physical property of fluid that causes it to flow into the lumen of a narrow channel. This nonaspiration technique was used in 40 consecutive patients undergoing fine-needle biopsy of mass lesions of the liver. A 22-gauge spinal needle was used in all procedures. The cytology smears obtained were prepared, stained, and interpreted by the same methods used for conventional fine-needle cytology specimens. Specific diagnoses were rendered in 36 patients (90%) and in 32 (94%) of those patients with malignant tumors. An average of 1.7 needle passes (range, 1-4) was needed per patient. We conclude that the results from nonaspiration fine-needle cytology of the liver are as good as those from conventional aspiration technique, and the nonaspiration technique is easier to perform and results in smears that are easier to interpret. 
Public Health Service inter-agency guidelines for screening donors of blood, plasma, organs, tissues, and semen for evidence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Several infectious agents transmit through infected blood and blood products. To decrease the potential for disease transmission, donors are screened for risk factors by medical history and for evidence of infection by specific testing. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently requires that all donations of whole blood and transfusable components as well as plasma for fractionation into injectable derivatives be subjected to a serologic test for syphilis, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV). The FDA also currently recommends testing donations of whole blood and components for transfusion for antibody to human T lymphotropic virus type I (anti-HTLV-I) and antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), and is considering recommending testing for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Blood banks in the United States voluntarily began testing donations for anti-HBc and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 1986 and 1987 and for anti-HCV in 1990. 
Pharmacokinetics, neuromuscular effects, and biodisposition of 3-desacetylvecuronium (Org 7268) in cats. The pharmacokinetics, biodisposition, and neuromuscular blocking properties of 3-desacetylvecuronium were studied in 17 adult cats. Animals were divided into three groups: five cats with kidney failure induced by bilateral ligation of the renal pedicles, six cats with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatitis, and six control cats. An intravenous bolus of 300 micrograms.kg-1 of 3-desacetylvecuronium was rapidly injected into the jugular vein. Arterial blood, urine, and bile samples were collected at regular intervals for 6 h in control cats and for 8 h in cats with kidney or liver failure. The liver was excised for analysis at the end of the experiment. In cats with renal failure, 3-desacetylvecuronium pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables did not differ from those in control cats. In cats with liver failure, plasma clearance was significantly less and mean residence time greater than in control cats (2.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 14.1 +/- 6.5 ml.kg-1.min-1 and 334 +/- 225 vs. 49 +/- 29 min, mean +/- SD, respectively). Volume of distribution at steady state in cats with liver failure and in control cats was not different. Also, in cats with liver failure, the duration of action and recovery index of 3-desacetylvecuronium was significantly greater than in control cats (168 +/- 62 vs. 82 +/- 32 min, and 39 +/- 19 vs. 10 +/- 4 min, respectively). Onset time of neuromuscular blockade was similar in all three groups. Total recovery of 3-desacetylvecuronium, for all three groups, in urine, bile, and liver was 90 +/- 11% (mean +/- SD). In control cats, 70 +/- 18% of 3-desacetylvecuronium was recovered in bile and liver and 19 +/- 14% in urine. No 3,17-bidesacetylvecuronium (a putative 3-desacetylvecuronium metabolite) was detected. 
Increased thrombin levels during thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. Relevance for the success of therapy. BACKGROUND. It has been suggested that thrombolysis in a feedback reaction may generate pro-coagulant activities. METHODS AND RESULTS. Fifty-five patients were treated with urokinase-preactivated prourokinase (n = 35) or tissue-type plasminogen activator (n = 20) for acute myocardial infarction and underwent coronary angiography at 90 minutes and at 24-36 hours into thrombolysis, and fibrinogen (Ratnoff-Menzie), D-dimer (ELISA) and thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels (ELISA) were measured. Primary patency was achieved in 39 patients (70.9%), 13 of whom (33.3%) suffered early reocclusion. Nonsignificant decreases in fibrinogen levels were observed while D-dimer levels increased +3,008 +/- 4,047 micrograms/l (p less than 0.01), differences not being significant in respect to the thrombolytic agents or to the clinical course. In contrast, while thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels decreased -4.4 +/- 13.0 micrograms/l in patients with persistent patency, they increased +7.5 +/- 13.6 micrograms/l in case of nonsuccessful thrombolysis (p less than 0.02) and +11.9 +/- 23.8 micrograms/l in case of early reocclusion (p less than 0.001). For patients with thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels greater than 6 ng/l 120 minutes into thrombolysis, the unfavorable clinical course was predicted with 96.2% sensitivity and 93.1% specificity. CONCLUSION. Generation of thrombin, occurring during thrombolysis, is a major determinant for the success of therapy and thrombin-antithrombin III levels may serve as predictors for the short-term prognosis. 
Vulnerability of nerve fibres to ischaemia. A quantitative light and electron microscope study. In order to learn more about the vulnerability of nerve fibres to ischemia, a quantitative study of nerve fibre abnormalities was performed on biopsy specimens of the superficial branch of the peroneal nerve from 26 patients with vasculitic neuropathy: 20 had necrotizing arteritis, 5 a lymphocytic, and 1 a leucocytoclastic vasculitis on nerve and/or muscle biopsy. The density of myelinated fibres ranged from 25 to 7880 per mm2 (n = 8470 +/- 706 (SD]. There was a marked inequality in the density of nerve fibres between the fascicles of individual nerves with a mean coefficient of variation of 41 +/- 37 (SD) % versus 7.4 +/- 3.0% in controls. Loss of myelinated fibres, which was greater for fibres larger than 7 microns in diameter, was more severe than that for unmyelinated axons. Regeneration, which was assessed by the number of clustered axons, decreased when the density of myelinated fibres decreased, suggesting that severe nerve ischaemia precludes axonal regeneration. Wallerian degeneration affected on average 58% (range 5-100%) and segmental demyelination, mainly of the secondary type, on average 1.94% (range 1-10%) of teased fibres. It was concluded that (1) myelinated fibres are more vulnerable to ischaemia than unmyelinated axons; (2) large myelinated fibres are affected before the smaller ones; (3) segmental demyelination is uncommon in this context; (4) severe nerve ischaemia precludes axonal regeneration. 
Five-year results of the first 159 consecutive phakic chronic open-angle glaucomas treated by argon laser trabeculoplasty. 159 phakic eyes with chronic open-angle glaucoma were treated by argon laser trabeculoplasty and followed for 5 years. According to our criteria of failure, 31 eyes were failures at 1 year (19%), 47 eyes at 2 years (30%), 66 eyes at 3 years (41%), 77 eyes at 4 years (48%) and 82 eyes at 5 years (52%). In the 77 eyes still controlled at 5 years, the intraocular pressure drop was 6.57 mm Hg and the initial medical treatment could be tapered or stopped in only 33 of the cases (43%). In the 82 failures, there was a greater percentage requiring surgery for pressure control during the first year after laser treatment: 16 trabeculectomies in 31 failures (52%). The initial mean intraocular pressures of 7 failures needing surgery during the first 2 months (27.22 mm Hg) and of the 27 failures needing surgery during the 5 year follow-up (24.41 mm Hg) were higher than the initial mean intraocular pressure of the 77 successful cases (22.67 mm Hg). In the 159 eyes followed for 5 years, 19% (31 eyes) to 6% (5 eyes) new failure cases per year were encountered and the initial good results obtained by argon laser trabeculoplasty persisted for about 5 years in half of the cases. 
Long-term response of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis to treatment with lymphoblastoid interferon alfa-N1. Papilloma Study Group. BACKGROUND. We earlier reported that patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis responded to six months of treatment with lymphoblastoid interferon alfa-n1. Because another study of patients treated for one year with leukocyte interferon alfa-n3 found that the growth rate of papillomas was slowed in the first six months but returned to base line during months 7 through 12 despite persistent interferon treatment, we now report the long-term results in our original study patients who were followed for a median of four years after the original one-year crossover study. METHODS. After the patients in our study had completed the first study year, their physicians could continue or recommence treatment with lymphoblastoid interferon alfa-n1 in a dose of either 2 MU per square meter of body-surface area per day or 4 MU per square meter every other day. The extent of disease was measured by endoscopy when clinically indicated. RESULTS. Data on late-follow-up were obtained for 60 of the 66 patients. There were 22 complete remissions and 25 partial remissions; 13 patients had no response. The median duration of the complete remissions was 550 days, and 15 patients continued to be in complete remission. The median duration of partial remissions was 400 days and seven patients were still in partial remission. Thirteen of 28 patients responded to a second course of interferon after an interruption in treatment of at least one month. The rate of response in the 11 of 53 patients who had neutralizing antibody to interferon was the same as in the patients without the antibody. CONCLUSIONS. Patients with severe recurrent respiratory papillomatosis may have a sustained or repeated response to treatment with lymphoblastoid interferon alfa-n1. We recommend that patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis who require surgery every two to three months be given a six-month trial of interferon alfa-n1. 
Left anterior fascicular block: an ischaemic response during treadmill testing. A patient in whom exercise induced reversible ischaemic left anterior fascicular block is reported. Glyceryl trinitrate relieved the fascicular block. Coronary angiography showed a 90% obstruction of the left anterior descending artery. The left anterior fascicular block induced by exercise disappeared after a successful coronary angioplasty. 
Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. Ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and DNA cytofluorometric study of a case. A case of right frontal pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma that occurred in a 7-year-old boy is reported clinicopathologically. The patient underwent surgery on September 29, 1988. Histologic diagnosis of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma was made because, in addition to the unique pleomorphic histologic features, positive glial fibrillary acidic protein in immunohistochemical staining and characteristic ultrastructural features, i.e., cytoplasmic intermediate fibrils and lipid vacuoles, basal lamina, and abundant reticulin networks were demonstrated. The DNA cytofluorometric analysis of the nuclei of the tumor cells disclosed the main mode to be diploid with polyploid classes (4, 8, 16, and 32C) without any aneuploidy. Despite the presence of many pleomorphic nuclei, DNA histogram of the tumor disclosed very few DNA synthetic cells indicating a biologically inactive nature of the tumor. The patient is still alive and totally asymptomatic 20 months postoperatively. 
Osteomyelitis in children with sickle cell disease: early diagnosis with contrast-enhanced CT. Two children with sickle cell disease and osteomyelitis were treated. In one child, definitive treatment was delayed until computed tomography (CT) revealed a subperiosteal abscess. Early performance of CT in the other child resulted in prompt diagnosis and treatment. Before the appearance of the characteristic plain radiographic findings, diagnosis of osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease can be difficult because the clinical manifestations of infarction and osteomyelitis can be similar. Radionuclide scans have yielded mixed results. In equivocal cases, early performance of CT can help establish the diagnosis of osteomyelitis to avoid significant morbidity. 
Cyclosporin A modulates the course of woodchuck hepatitis virus infection and induces chronicity. Immunosuppression is known to influence the state of chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and is thought to increase the risk of developing chronic infection in newly exposed individuals. Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive agent that inhibits Th cell function, was administered to woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), and resulted in a decreased severity of chronic hepatitis and an increased viremia during the treatment. Adult woodchucks inoculated with WHV and given CsA for 14 wk had increased viremias, decreased acute phase liver injury, and developed chronic infections at a higher rate compared with immunocompetent woodchucks given virus alone (chronicity in seven of seven WHV + CsA + vs zero of nine WHV + CsA-; p less than 0.001). These results in a relevant animal model of hepatitis B virus infection indicate: 1) that liver injury in acute hepadnavirus infections is immune-mediated and not a direct cytopathic effect of virus replication; 2) that Th cells function in the inflammatory response and in the immunologic control of hepadnavirus infection; and 3) that suppression of Th cell function in acute hepadnavirus infection decreases liver injury but alters the outcome of infection in favor of chronicity. These results also suggest continued challenges in the application of CsA in liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus-induced diseases. 
Occurrence of resting tremor in Parkinson's disease. Several previous studies have noted that resting tremor (RT) is absent in 10% to 30% of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients. We report our 22-year observations in 47 pathologically verified parkinsonian patients. In all the IPD cases with median follow-up of 3.7 years, RT was noted on at least one evaluation. Among other parkinsonian syndrome variants characterized by widespread subcortical pathology with median follow-up of 2.86 years, RT was seen in 31% of the cases. Our data indicate that the sites typically involved in IPD are sufficient to produce RT. 
The spectrum of molecular alterations in the evolution of chronic myelocytic leukemia. DNA from 135 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) at various clinical stages and Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia was investigated for alterations in a variety of proto-oncogenes which have been implicated in the evolution of CML from its chronic phase to blast crisis. The most common genetic change found in the evolution of typical Ph1 chromosome positive CML to blast crisis was an alteration of the p53 gene involving either a rearrangement, a deletion, or a point mutation in the coding sequence of the gene. Alterations of the p53 gene were found in the myeloid and the rare megakaryocytic variant of blast crisis but were absent in the lymphoid leukemic transformants. Gross structural alterations were seen in 11 of 54 (20%) of myeloid or unknown phenotypes of blast crisis and in only 1 of 44 chronic phase cases. Eight examples of mutations in the open reading frame of the p53 gene at codons 49, 53, 60, 140, 202, 204, 238, and 239 were observed in blast crisis patients. Mutations in the N-RAS gene were rare in typical blast crisis (2 of 27 cases) but were found in megakaryocytic and Ph1 negative myeloid blast crisis. We concluded that heterogeneous alterations in the p53 gene and occasionally in the N-RAS genes accompany the evolution of chronic phase CML to blast crisis. 
Effect of peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass on left ventricular size, afterload and myocardial function during elective supported coronary angioplasty. Although cardiopulmonary bypass support has been increasingly used for high risk coronary angioplasty, few data exist regarding its effects on left ventricular function. Accordingly, in 20 patients changes in left ventricular size, afterload and myocardial function were assessed by continuous hemodynamic monitoring and simultaneous two-dimensional echocardiography during cardiopulmonary bypass-supported high risk angioplasty. The cross-sectional left ventricular area during bypass support remained unchanged during diastole, whereas during systole it decreased (from 29.6 +/- 11.4 to 27.6 +/- 10.4 cm2, p less than 0.05). Global left ventricular function expressed as fractional area change remained unchanged from baseline to bypass support but decreased during balloon inflation (from 0.27 +/- 0.11 to 0.17 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.001). The end-systolic meridional wall stress decreased during bypass support (from 141 +/- 75 to 110 +/- 58 x 10(3) dynes/cm2, p less than 0.02). Regional myocardial function was assessed by a wall motion score (0 = normal, 1 = hypokinesia, 2 = akinesia and 3 = dyskinesia). Regions supplied by a stenotic (greater than or equal to 50% diameter) vessel deteriorated during bypass support (score from 0.9 +/- 0.8 to 1.06 +/- 0.8, p less than 0.01), whereas regions supplied by a nonstenotic vessel did not. Regions supplied by the target vessel deteriorated further during balloon inflation (score from 0.7 +/- 0.6 to 1.7 +/- 0.75, p less than 0.001). Thus, although left ventricular size and global function remain unchanged and afterload decreases during bypass support, myocardial dysfunction in regions supplied by a stenotic vessel may occur. Furthermore, regional and global left ventricular dysfunction still occur with angioplasty balloon inflation during cardiopulmonary bypass support. 
Clinical evaluation of circulating serum sialyl Tn antigen levels in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Sialyl Tn antigen (NeuAc alpha 2----6GalNac alpha 1----0-Ser/Thr [STN]) with antigenic specificity in the core structure of mucin-type carbohydrate chains has been determined. In the present study, we evaluated the clinical significance of this new carbohydrate antigen, STN, in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. With the use of a radioimmunoassay developed to detect STN antigen in serum, elevated (greater than or equal to 32.6 U/mL) antigen levels were observed in 50.0% of patients with ovarian cancer. In contrast, 3.8% of healthy individuals had STN antigen levels greater than or equal to 32.6 U/mL. In 9.6% of patients with benign gynecologic diseases and 0% of pregnant women, there were elevated levels of STN antigen. There was a significant difference (P less than .001) in STN antigen levels between patients with ovarian cancer and patients with benign gynecologic diseases, pregnant women, or the controls. The mean +/- SD for all evaluated samples of ovarian cancer was 109.2 +/- 146.8 U/mL. Both the mean values and the positive rate increased as the stage advanced. Classified according to the histologic type, the highest positive rate (61.0%) was observed in mucinous adenocarcinoma. The usefulness of STN antigen as a circulating tumor marker in ovarian cancer was estimated as follows: sensitivity 50.0%, specificity 93.5%, positive predictive value 72.2%, negative predictive value 84.7%, and diagnostic value 46.8%. Serum STN antigen levels were elevated in 12 of 33 patients with ovarian cancer who had serum CA 125 antigen levels less than 35 U/mL. While CA 125 antigen levels were elevated in 74.6% and STN antigen levels were elevated in 50.0% of the same population, the use of both assays indicated the sensitivity of detection of 83.8% in the population studied. 
Acid peptic disease in adolescents. How to avoid misdiagnosis and undertreatment. Acid peptic disease in adolescents may be more common than previously recognized. However, appropriate medical attention is often delayed because of misdiagnosis and undertreatment. Thorough questioning of adolescent patients is important to elicit a complete description of symptoms. Endoscopy or intraluminal pH monitoring may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic ulcer. Therapy with histamine receptor antagonists, especially ranitidine (Zantac), is recommended. Antireflux surgery may be needed to prevent potential long-term gastrointestinal damage. Patients with duodenal ulcer should also be advised to make life-style changes to avoid recurrence of disease later in life. 
In-flight esophageal variceal bleeding en route for liver transplantation: a case report and review of the literature. Esophageal variceal bleeding owing to portal hypertension is a potential threat in pediatric patients awaiting liver transplantation. We report a case of a three-year-old boy with severe congenital hepatic fibrosis, Caroli's disease, and portal hypertension who developed a life-threatening variceal hemorrhage for the first time in his life during commercial air transport to a liver transplantation center. Factors precipitating variceal bleeding are discussed, particularly those resulting from changes in altitude. It is recommended that prophylactic treatment for variceal bleeding be at least considered in children awaiting liver transplantation prior to prolonged air transportation. Because of differences in capabilities of treatment providers in various locales, and because there are as yet no conclusive data, the treatment of choice must be decided on an individual basis. Equipment for treating in-flight hemorrhage should be available. 
Increased calcium influx in caudal artery of rats made hypertensive with pyridoxine deficiency. Moderate pyridoxine deficiency in rats has been shown to induce hypertension, which can be corrected by pyridoxine supplementation. In this study, calcium handling by isolated caudal arteries from pyridoxine-deficient and age-matched control rats was evaluated. We found 45Ca influx into the intracellular compartment to be significantly elevated in deficient rats. This increased influx could be attenuated with nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting alterations in the calcium channels that would make them leaky. The pyridoxine-deficient arterial segments maintained a higher resting tone; removal of extracellular calcium by EGTA or entry blockade by nifedipine decreased the tone significantly in the deficient arteries, compared with little or no effect in controls. 
Quantitative testicular biopsy in spinal cord injured men: comparison to fertile controls. Spermatogenic abnormalities have been reported in the majority of spinal cord injured men on routine testicular biopsy. However, given the interim advances in their urological and rehabilitative care, a quantitative assessment of the germinal epithelium after spinal cord injury and comparison of these parameters to normal controls are warranted. Incisional testicular biopsy was performed in 14 spinal cord injured men. Quantitative micrometric techniques were applied to assess spermatogenesis and the results were compared to a normative data base of testicular biopsies previously obtained from a group of 15 fertile volunteers. From a minimum of 10 randomly selected round seminiferous tubules per subject the mean number of Sertoli cells, mature spermatids, tubular diameter and tubular wall thickness were determined in both groups and statistically analyzed. In the spinal cord injury group the mean number of spermatids per tubule was significantly lower and the mean number of Sertoli cells per tubule was significantly higher than in fertile controls (p less than 0.05). Moreover, the mean Sertoli cell-to-spermatid ratio per seminiferous tubule was significantly higher in the spinal cord injury group and discriminated between spinal cord injured men and controls, with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100% (p less than 0.0001). Half of the spinal cord injury group showed a mean tubular spermatid density of less than 10. Compared to the fertile population, spinal cord injured men show significant differences in quantitative parameters of the germinal epithelium that may contribute to the reproductive dysfunction. 
Mesalamine in ulcerative colitis. Sulfasalazine has been used for many years in the management of ulcerative colitis. As many as 20 percent of patients treated with it experience intolerable adverse effects usually attributed to its sulfapyridine component. The other active component is 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA); the only 5-ASA enema preparation currently available in the U.S. is mesalamine (Rowasa, Reid-Rowell) containing 5-ASA 4 g in 60 mL. In clinical trials, mesalamine has proved efficacious in treating refractory cases of distal ulcerative colitis, proctitis, and proctosigmoiditis. Because of its high cost compared with more conventional treatment modalities, it should be reserved for cases that are either refractory or intolerant to conventional treatment. 
Intractable heart failure despite angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics: long-term effectiveness of add-on therapy with pimobendan. In 25 patients whose chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) had recently worsened to New York Heart Association class IV, pimobendan (5 to 20 mg/day) was added to maximum conventional therapy consisting of digoxin, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, coumadin derivatives to prevent thromboembolic complications, and amiodarone to suppress serious ventricular rhythm disturbances. CHF was fatal in less than 1 month in five patients (two had shown some initial improvement). The other 20 had sustained improvement by at least one functional class, interrupted by episodes of CHF that usually responded to intravenous therapy. Median survival was 12 months (range 10 days to greater than 3 years); five patients died suddenly, 12 died of intractable CHF, and two died of other causes. Six patients were alive 3 years after the onset of treatment with pimobendan. Add-on therapy with pimobendan produced a sustained improvement in many patients with severe CHF that was no longer responding to a combination of digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. 
Anatomy of the tricuspid annulus. Circumferential myofibers as the structural basis for atrial flutter in a canine model. BACKGROUND. Little anatomic information is available on the annular myocardium. This study was conducted to determine the anatomic substrate for atrial flutter due to circus movement around the tricuspid annulus in the Y-shaped incision canine model of atrial flutter. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied photographs of the annular myocardium serial histological sections, made in either of three different planes, and compared these with photographs of the intact and blocked gross heart specimens. We found that the annulus is the most caudal region of the atrial wall. The epicardial aspect of the annulus abuts the ventricular septum or the aortic root in the medial region; in other regions, it is covered by the fat of the coronary sulcus. Its endocardial aspect is delimited by the tricuspid leaflets inferiorly and by the pectinate muscle bundles superiorly, except in the medial region where the pectinate muscle bundles are absent. The annular myocardium is bilaminated. A continuous subepicardial circumferential lamina is the most prominent and is robust in the anterior, lateral, and posterior regions, but it attenuates to a fine muscular connection in the medial region. Myofibers of its superior border merge with the pectinate muscle bundles or are admixed in the medial region with myocardium at the base of the medial atrial wall. Its inferior border makes little contact with the annulus fibrosus about the ring; however, in the medial region, these myofibers insert into fibrous tissue superior to the septal leaflet. A discontinuous, subendocardial perpendicular lamina contains myofibers that descend from the atrium; most of these myofibers insert into the annulus fibrosus about the ring, but the lamina is absent in the anteromedial region. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the continuous circumferential lamina provides the anatomic substrate for circus movement of excitation in this model. 
Correlation of circulating von Willebrand factor levels with cardiovascular hemodynamics. BACKGROUND. Valvular heart disease is associated with a decreased platelet circulating time and a thrombotic tendency. The possibility that these events are related to changes in von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric glycoprotein released from endothelial cells and platelets that mediates platelet adhesion to the vascular subendothelium, has not been examined. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured the vWF antigen (vWF:Ag) concentration in 43 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of mitral (n = 17) or aortic (n = 10) stenosis or nonvalvular heart disease (n = 16). Mean vWF:Ag concentration was significantly higher in patients with mitral stenosis than in those without (212 +/- 84 versus 150 +/- 79 units/dl, p less than 0.02); this elevation was associated with a significant elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in the patients with mitral stenosis (186 +/- 49 versus 133 +/- 81 dynes-sec-cm-5, p less than 0.02). The vWF:Ag levels in the entire group of patients (regardless of the presence or type of valvular disease) varied directly with PVR (r = 0.72, p less than 0.0001) and with pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.60, p less than 0.0001) and inversely with cardiac output (r = 0.64, p less than 0.0001). Changes in PVR, pulmonary artery pressure, or cardiac output could not be correlated with circulating levels of fibrinogen or beta-thromboglobulin, which may be released from activated platelets, nor with the endothelial cell product tissue plasminogen activator. CONCLUSIONS. The association of high vWF:Ag levels with increased PVR and decreased cardiac output in patients both with and without mitral stenosis suggests a hemodynamically induced increase in the endothelial release of vWF, which might contribute to a thrombotic tendency in these patients. 
Fifteen-year results of ambulatory compression therapy for chronic venous ulcers. A nonoperative approach to venous stasis ulceration of the lower extremity, consisting of initial bedrest, ulcer cleansing, dressing changes, and ambulatory elastic compression stocking therapy, has been maintained for over 15 years. All patients had class III, severe chronic venous insufficiency. One hundred five of 113 patients (93%) experienced complete ulcer healing in a mean of 5.3 months. One hundred two patients were compliant with elastic compression stockings, and 11 patients were noncompliant. Complete ulcer healing occurred in 99 of 102 patients (97%) who were compliant versus six of 11 patients (55%) who were noncompliant (p less than 0.0001). The influence of noncompliance, previous venous ulceration, previous venous surgery, previous known deep venous thrombosis, peripheral arterial insufficiency (ankle brachial systolic blood pressure index less than or equal to 0.60), pretreatment ulcer duration, ulcer size, age, sex, diabetes, smoking, and photoplethysmography venous refill time on ulcer healing was determined by logistic regression analysis. Only noncompliance with elastic compression stockings (p less than 0.0001) and a pretreatment ulcer duration of more than 9 months (p = 0.02) significantly decreased initial ulcer healing. Posthealing follow-up was available in 73 patients for a mean of 30 months. Fifty-eight patients (79%) continued to be compliant with stockings; 15 patients were noncompliant. Total ulcer recurrence in patients who were compliant was 16%. Five-year lifetable recurrence was 29%. All patients who were noncompliant had recurrent ulceration by 36 months. Previous ulceration, previous venous surgery, and peripheral arterial insufficiency had no effect on ulcer recurrence (p greater than 0.05). 
Endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial monocyte macrophages in hypertension. Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Hypertension is associated with an impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and cilazapril can prevent this endothelial dysfunction. We recently observed that long-term treatment with cilazapril could also prevent subendothelial infiltration by mononuclear cells in spontaneously hypertensive rats. This prompted us to examine whether, in spontaneously hypertensive rats, endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial infiltration by mononuclear cells are associated. These cells were characterized as monocyte macrophages. Infiltration by monocyte macrophages was quantified by morphometry. Endothelial function was estimated by calculating serotonin ratio (maximal contraction to serotonin on isolated arterial rings with endothelium over maximal contraction on paired rings without endothelium). The regional distribution of endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial monocyte macrophages was similar. Both were maximal in the carotid artery, less in the aorta, and nonexistent in the renal artery. A 2-week treatment with cilazapril decreased both endothelial dysfunction (serotonin ratio decreased by 32%) and the number of subendothelial monocyte macrophages in the aorta, which decreased by 38%. We conclude that in spontaneously hypertensive rats, endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial monocyte macrophage infiltration are associated and that cilazapril can decrease both. The observation that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors affect subendothelial accumulation of monocyte macrophage may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of action of this class of drugs. 
Comparison of four subarachnoid solutions in a needle-through-needle technique for elective caesarean section. We have used both spinal and extradural anaesthesia with a 26-gauge, long spinal needle through a 16-gauge Tuohy needle for elective Caesarean section. Four different subarachnoid solutions of bupivacaine were compared: 0.5% heavy bupivacaine alone, or with adrenaline, fentanyl or adrenaline and fentanyl. The incidence of complications and time of regression of the sensory block were analysed. The technique is recommended because it allows rapid onset of anaesthesia and the advantages of an extradural catheter. The subarachnoid solution of choice was 0.5% heavy bupivacaine 12.5 mg with fentanyl 10 micrograms. 
Severe congestive heart failure. How successful are drug and transplant therapies? Severe congestive heart failure is a fatal illness. Aggressive use of proven medical regimens, including vasodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may prolong survival time for some patients. Those with refractory symptoms and seriously reduced left ventricular function, impaired exercise capacity, and complex or frequent ventricular arrhythmias should be considered for cardiac transplantation. Candidacy for transplantation is based on the absence of other illnesses that would limit survival or diminish the likelihood of success of the transplant. With the introduction of potent immunosuppressive agents, particularly cyclosporine (Sandimmune), survival rates after transplantation have improved to 90% at 1 year. Major problems include organ rejection, serious infection, development of coronary artery disease in the transplanted heart, and the limited donor organ supply. 
Enhancement of ischaemic rabbit skin flap survival with the antioxidant and free-radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine. 1. The burst of damaging oxygen free-radicals at the time of reperfusion is one of the crucial factors affecting skin flap survival after an ischaemic interval. In these experiments the efficacy of the antioxidant and free-radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine in improving the survival of ischaemic rabbit epigastric skin flaps was tested. 2. At the time of reperfusion flaps were given: (1) balanced salt solution by intravenous whole-body administration, (2) N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) by intravenous whole-body administration, (3) balanced salt solution by intra-arterial infusion into the flap, (4) N-acetylcysteine (20 mg/kg) by intra-arterial infusion into the flap, or (5) N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) by intra-arterial infusion into the flap. Flap survival at 1 week, and tissue levels of parameters related to free-radical production, blood levels of thromboxane B2 and peripheral resistance during reperfusion were determined. 3. Compared with controls (groups 1 and 3) which had flap survival rates (expressed as percentage surface area surviving) of 27.1% and 31.6%, respectively. N-acetylcysteine treatment in group 2 (55.2%) and group 4 (51.9%) resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) improvements in flap survival. The survival rate in group 5 (37.7%) was not significantly better than that of the controls. 4. N-Acetylcysteine significantly reduced parameters related to free-radical production in the skin flap after 30 min of reperfusion, determined as tissue levels of malonyldialdehyde and protein oxidation products. There was also a significant decrease in peripheral resistance when low-dose N-acetylcysteine (group 4) was infused intra-arterially into the flap. 
Interference between gastroesophageal reflux and sleep in near miss SIDS. GER may be considered as one of the triggering factors in some apparently life-threatening events or even SIDS. Also at the present time, many teams perform 24-h pH monitoring in at-risk infants and treat those with abnormal scores. However, further investigations are needed to answer the question: Which unknown additional factor(s) is present when a specific episode of GER causes apnea and/or bradycardia either during sleep or wakefulness?. 
Evaluation and treatment of aneurysms of the vertebral artery: different strategies for different lesions. Aneurysms of the vertebral artery and its branches are relatively uncommon lesions. Their anatomy and presentation can be quite variable. A spectrum of aneurysms of the vertebral artery is presented to illustrate the neuroradiological evaluation, surgical treatment, and perioperative management of these complex lesions. 
Bladder compliance in myelodysplastic children: effect of anti-reflux surgery and conservative treatment. Paediatric urology. Little is known about changes in bladder compliance and bladder capacity in myelodysplastic patients following anti-reflux surgery. A study group of 70 patients was divided as follows: group A included 20 myelodysplastic patients who had been operated on for reflux and whose subsequent treatment was conservative. Group B comprised 31 myelodysplastic patients who had been treated conservatively; a third group of 19 non-myelodysplastic patients, treated by anti-reflux surgery because of primary reflux, formed the control group. The follow-up period for group A averaged 61 months (extending from a urodynamic study 3 months after surgery to the most recent test). In group B the mean follow-up period between the initial test and the latest test was 86 months. Bladder compliance in group A patients did not increase significantly (from 5.5 to 6.9), but patients in group B did show a significant increase (from 5.9 to 10.7). Compliance in the 19 non-myelodysplastic patients decreased only marginally 6 months after surgery (from 29.6 to 26.3). Changes in bladder capacity showed a similar trend. In their most recent test, however, the bladder capacity of group A patients increased to the same volume as that of group B. A high correlation between radiological bladder deformity and bladder compliance was found. We propose a bladder compliance of 10.0 as the lower limit for myelodysplastic patients' preferred range. It was concluded that anti-reflux operations prevent any improvement in bladder compliance (but not in bladder capacity) compared with conservative treatment. 
The opacity of portal hypertension-related ascites correlates with the fluid's triglyceride concentration. To determine if an elevated triglyceride concentration can explain the opacity of some cirrhotic ascites specimens, the authors measured triglyceride concentration by Coulter DACOS (Hialeah, FL) on 133 paired serum and ascitic fluid specimens. The specimens were categorized as clear or cloudy by coded visual inspection. In addition, the ascitic fluid specimens were inspected for a lipid supernatant after 48 hours of refrigeration at 4 degrees C. The ascitic fluid triglyceride concentration of the 87 clear specimens was 1.9 +/- 1.0 mmol/L compared with 7.0 +/- 4.6 mmol/L for the opalescent specimens (P less than 0.001). Only 17% of the clear specimens demonstrated any lipid layer after refrigeration, compared with 94% of opalescent specimens (P less than 0.001). The triglyceride concentrations were not significantly different between the serum samples obtained from patients with clear compared with opalescent ascites. The opacity of portal hypertension-related ascites appears to be related to the triglyceride concentration of the fluid. 
Spinal cord pial metastases: MR imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine. The purpose of this investigation was to describe gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced MR findings in metastatic disease to the pial lining of the spinal cord. Correlation was made with clinical data, other radiologic studies, and pathologic findings. Eighty-six patients with a known malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms were studied with pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images. In seven of these patients, abnormal enhancement of the pial lining of the cord was seen on the sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted images. This appeared as a thin rim of enhancement along the surface of the cord in six patients and as a focal, thick rim of enhancement in addition to the thin rim of enhancement in the seventh patient. Axial images confirmed the location along the pial lining in each case. Precontrast T1-weighted images in all seven cases and precontrast T2-weighted images in five cases failed to detect any focal abnormalities of the pial lining of the cord. Pathologic confirmation was available in five of the seven patients. Primary malignancies in these patients included breast carcinomas (two), lymphoma (one), leukemia (one), adenocarcinoma of the lung (one), prostate carcinoma (one), and malignant melanoma (one). Three of seven patients had metastatic disease evident only within the CNS, while four patients had widespread disease outside the CNS. We conclude that contrast-enhanced MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis of pial spread of metastatic disease in patients with a known primary malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms. 
Facial nerve monitoring in acoustic tumor surgery. Anatomic and functional preservation of the facial nerve during acoustic tumor surgery remains a primary goal. Intraoperative electromyographic facial nerve monitoring with auditory feedback has enabled the surgeon to more readily achieve this goal. We compared a group of monitored translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removals (N = 89) to a similar unmonitored group (N = 155) in regard to facial nerve function. Function was assessed immediately postoperatively, at time of discharge, and at 1 year postoperatively using the House six-point scale. Results were grouped as satisfactory, intermediate, or poor and were analyzed by tumor size. Facial nerve results were better at all time intervals in the monitored groups, although the difference was not statistically significant at the 1-year interval. There was no difference between monitored and unmonitored patients in the subgroups with tumors smaller than 2.5 cm in diameter. This study supports the usefulness of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring in improving facial nerve results, particularly in larger tumors. 
Fatal persistent pulmonary hypertension presenting late in the neonatal period. Two cases of fatal idiopathic persistent pulmonary hypertension presented late in the neonatal period. Lungs were examined histologically by light and electron microscopy, and immunocytochemical studies were used to identify nerves. There was extension of medial smooth muscle distally along the arterial pathway so that most precapillary arteries had completely muscular walls, which in some cases completely obliterated the vessel lumen. Enlarged endothelial cells also contributed to the reduction in the size of the lumen. Nerve fibres accompanying muscular arteries were found in the alveolar region, more distal than is normal. The predominant neuropeptide was the vasoconstrictor tyrosine. Possible aetiological factors in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn are increased muscularity of the peripheral pulmonary arteries antenatally, an increase in the number of vasoconstrictor nerves, or an imbalance in the production of leukotrienes and prostacyclins in the perinatal period. 
False aneurysm of the right internal mammary artery. False aneurysm of the internal mammary artery is an uncommon complication of median sternotomy. Clinical and radiological findings of 2 such cases are presented. At operative exploration neither was directly related to the presence of a sternal wire. 
Continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve block after pleurectomy. A randomised, double blind trial was carried out in 16 patients undergoing pleurectomy to assess the effect of continuous extrapleural intercostal block on postoperative pain and pulmonary function. Subjective pain relief was assessed on a linear visual analogue scale. Pulmonary function was measured on the day before operation and daily for five days after surgery. Eight patients received bupivacaine and eight placebo (saline). The mean pain scores at 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours were 13.3, 8.5, 6.1, and 10 mm respectively in the bupivacaine group compared with 56.3, 41, 46.7, and 35 in the control group; in addition, the bupivacaine group required less papaveretum. Twenty four hours after surgery mean values of peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced vital capacity were reduced to 82%, 76%, and 76% of preoperative control values in the bupivacaine group, and to 39%, 32%, and 36% in the control group. The speed of recovery of pulmonary function was superior in the bupivacaine group. There were no complications related to the infusion. Continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve blockade with bupivacaine provides safe and effective postoperative analgesia and improves respiratory mechanics after pleurectomy. 
Oral contraceptive-associated liver cell adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Cytomorphology and mechanism of malignant transformation. From January 1976 to May 1990, 1673 patients with a liver mass or masses detected by imaging techniques underwent percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the liver. Of these, 99 were diagnosed cytologically as "hepatocellular carcinoma" and 9 as "consistent with liver cell adenoma." The cytologic diagnoses were confirmed in the follow-up of all cases. Among the 99 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 3 had taken oral contraceptives for a period of 10, 11, and 12 years, respectively. The nine patients with liver cell adenoma were all users of oral contraceptives over a period ranging from 5 to 10 years. Of these, two who had taken oral contraceptives for a period of 8 and 10 years, respectively, had foci or areas of liver cell dysplasia within the adenomas. The cytologic criteria for the diagnosis of liver cell dysplasia included cytoplasmic and nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism together with prominent nucleoli, hyperchromasia and multinucleation. The cytologic features of liver cell dysplasia strikingly mimic hepatocellular carcinoma. From this study, the foci or areas of liver cell dysplasia arising within the liver cell adenomas appear to be the missing link responsible for the transformation of liver cell adenoma to carcinoma. It is believed that liver cell adenomas are not premalignant and may undergo reversible change after withdrawal of causative agents, whereas liver cell dysplasia is an irreversible, premalignant change and will eventually progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Turbinate hypertrophy in habitual snorers and patients with obstructive sleep apnea: findings of acoustic rhinometry. Forty-five habitual snorers (mean respiratory disturbance index = 6) and 22 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (mean respiratory disturbance index = 36) were examined by polysomnography, radiocephalometry, rhinomanometry, nasopharyngeal videoendoscopy, and acoustic rhinometry. In 97% of these patients, hypertrophy of the inferior nasal turbinates was found by acoustic rhinometry, while increased nasal resistance of various degrees was measured in 93% of all patients by active anterior rhinomanometry. Acoustic rhinometry demonstrated that the most resistive segment was located in the anterior parts of the nasal cavity and was built up by two compartments: the region of the isthmus nasi and the region of the head of the inferior turbinate. In our snoring patients, the cross-sectional areas at the head of the inferior turbinate were always smaller than the cross-sectional areas in the isthmus nasi, which in normal controls presented the minimal cross-sectional values of the whole nasal cavity. While rhino-manometry can only measure the amount of nasal resistance, acoustic rhinometry can clearly determine the exact size and location of the different stenoses in the nasal cavity that contribute to the increased nasal resistance. 
The human hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen (CD34) in vascular neoplasia. The human hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen CD34 is synthesized and expressed by early normal hematopoietic progenitor cells and by many acute leukemias. Anti-CD34 antibodies also have been reported to stain blood vessels in tissue sections, and, more recently, CD34 mRNA has been detected in vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, the authors studied the diagnostic utility of immunohistochemical CD34 antigen detection in tumors of endothelial cell derivation and compared the results with stains for von Willebrand (vW) factor. A wide variety of epithelial and mesenchymal neoplasms also were examined to assess the specificity of CD34 for vascular neoplasia. Seven cases of angiosarcoma (seven of seven), five cases of Kaposi's sarcoma (five of five), and eight cases of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (eight of eight) were moderately to strongly positive for CD34. This reactivity was equally intense in frozen sections, alcohol-fixed tissue, and formalin-fixed specimens. In many cases, the malignant endothelial cells stained more strongly than adjacent benign endothelium. Moreover, in most cases CD34 positivity was quantitatively and qualitatively stronger than staining for vW factor. Two cases of hemangiopericytoma (two of two) were CD34 positive but stained less intensely than the angiosarcomas, Kaposi's sarcomas, or hemangioendotheliomas. Five of six cases of hemangioma also stained positively for CD34; the nonreactive tumor in this group was the only one among 28 vascular neoplasms studied that was not reactive for CD34. In comparison, 9 of the 28 vascular tumors did not stain for vW factor. Three hundred fifty-seven tumors of nonvascular derivation also were examined for CD34 antigen expression. Focal light staining was seen in one pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma; moderate to intense staining was observed in half of the epithelioid sarcomas studied (8 of 16) and in a minority of leiomyosarcomas (3 of 22). These findings indicate that CD34 is a sensitive and relatively specific marker for neoplasms of vascular origin. 
A case of vesical paraganglioma behind the symphysis pubis. We report on a 15-year-old boy with a vesical paraganglioma behind the symphysis pubis. Magnetic resonance imaging and transurethral intravesical ultrasonography were helpful in the preoperative localization of the lesion. 
Non-specific aorto-arteritis (Takayasu's disease) in children. Digital subtraction panaorto-arteriography was performed in 32 consecutive children (21 females, mean age 10.8 years) with non-specific aorto-arteritis to assess digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in imaging these children and to study the patterns of involvement in the Indian sub-continent. Diagnostic quality DSA images were obtained in 21 out of 27 intravenous and nine out of 11 intra-arterial studies. Obstructive lesions were present in all the patients and commonly involved the abdominal aorta (24 patients) and renal arteries (20 patients). Aneurysms were seen in five patients and predominantly involved the descending thoracic aorta. Pulmonary artery involvement was uncommon (five out of 20 patients) and clinically silent. Based on clinical and angiographic features, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed for the management of uncontrolled hypertension in eight patients (10 lesions). Initial success was obtained in eight procedures (80%). Re-stenosis occurred after 5.5 months in one patient, but was successfully re-dilated. The follow-up period ranged between 5 and 16 months (mean 9 months). Long-term efficacy of transluminal angioplasty in the management of these children is awaited. 
Compulsive overeating. Compulsive overeating is a behavior used in an attempt to numb or nurture feelings that are threatening to the person. Emotional states are soothed by use of food. Treatment is designed to respond to internal, biologic causes of hunger and satiety while simultaneously allowing feelings to surface and be dealt with. Work on the inner child enables the person to identify and deal with unmet needs and correct distortions from childhood. The secondary gain realized from the extra weight is examined, and direct means of dealing with these needs explored. The focus of recovery is on learning to nurture the self, physically and emotionally. 
Intralesional interferon alfa-2b in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical study on cellular immune reaction leading to tumor regression. Four patients with basal cell carcinomas were treated with intralesional injections of interferon alfa-2b (1.5 million IU per injection) three times a week for 2 weeks. Histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens of the lesions confirmed the absence of basal cell carcinoma in all cases 4 weeks after completion of therapy. A dense mononuclear cell infiltrate and numerous ectatic blood vessels were present in the dermis at the sites of previous basal cell carcinoma. Immunohistologic analysis of the dermal infiltrate revealed a marked increase of Leu-4+ T cells with a slight predominance of Leu-3+ helper/inducer T cells over Leu-2+ suppressor/cytotoxic T cells. Most of the dermal infiltrate expressed HLA-DR antigen. In addition, Leu-11+ natural killer cells were observed in the dermal infiltrate. Immunohistologic changes in the skin lesions at the sites of previous basal cell carcinoma suggest that intralesional interferon alfa-2b acts on tumor cells by enhancement of local T-cell-mediated immune responses. 
Recurrent pericarditis and cardiac tamponade in a patient with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome. We describe a patient with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome complicated by recurrent pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. The episodes of pericarditis were associated with urticarial vasculitis, hypocomplementemia, and circulating IgG antibodies to the collagen-like region of Clq. Histopathologic examination of the skin and pericardium demonstrated vasculitis associated with immunoglobulin and complement deposition suggesting an immune complex mediated etiology. Recurrent pericarditis should be included in the clinical spectrum of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome. 
Gonococcal endocarditis complicating pregnancy: a case report and literature review. The incidence of gonorrhea has decreased substantially in the past decade. Disseminated gonorrhea is more common in women than in men, although gonococcal endocarditis is more common in men. Disseminated gonorrhea is most commonly described in women during menses or pregnancy. Only two cases of gonococcal endocarditis during pregnancy have been reported in the literature since 1942. We report a patient who experienced sudden hemodynamic decompensation at 30 weeks' gestation, resulting in fetal death. Aortic valve replacement was performed, but extensive involvement of the aortic root made complete eradication of infection impossible and eventually resulted in maternal death. 
Survival and management considerations in postirradiation osteosarcoma and Paget's osteosarcoma. Postirradiation and Paget's osteosarcomas are high-grade malignancies. The five-year survival was only 10% in recent experience at the author's institution. Progressive pain is an important clinical feature in both conditions. Careful roentgenographic studies demonstrate cortical destruction and a soft-tissue mass in virtually all patients. Metastasis was present in 25% of both groups of patients at presentation. In contrast to previous series, more than 80% of the patients with postirradiation osteosarcoma had had irradiation for malignant entities and more than 70% had been treated with modern radiotherapy regimens (cobalt-60 or linear accelerator). Twice as many patients with postirradiation osteosarcoma were evaluated and treated in the 1980s than in the previous decade. The initial indication for irradiation often was carcinoma of the breast, uterus, or cervix, or lymphoma. Two-thirds of the patients had progressive disease that was not controllable within six months after diagnosis. Early detection may be the only effective means of improving survival with postirradiation or Paget's osteosarcoma. These patients require lifelong follow-up evaluations. 
Routine computed tomographic scans, selective mediastinoscopy, and other factors in evaluation of lung cancer. Routine computed tomographic scan is advocated as the best noninvasive method of evaluating mediastinal nodes for cancer spread. Positive studies should be confirmed histologically. Large size, central location, unfavorable cell type, poor cellular differentiation of the primary cancer, and weight loss also correlate with increased likelihood of mediastinal involvement. 
Toxic shock syndrome after pilonidal cystectomy. Report of a case. Toxic shock syndrome is an uncommon disease associated with staphylococcal infections. Although most frequently reported in menstruating women and associated with tampon use, toxic shock syndrome has been described following many types of surgical procedures. In this report we describe a case of toxic shock syndrome occurring in a previously healthy young man after elective surgery for a pilonidal cyst. 
Recovery after intense chronic stimulation: a physiological study of cat's fast muscle. Adult cats were used to study the recovery of muscles that had become altered by long-term electrical stimulation. Chronic activation was delivered to the deafferented common peroneal nerve (no pain, no reflexes), and contractile properties were measured for peroneus longus muscle. After 4 wk of great daily amounts of treatment at moderately high pulse rates (30-40 Hz delivered during 50% of daily time), the peroneus longus became considerably weaker, demonstrated a longer time course of twitches and a slower rate of rise of tetanic force, and became less fatigable. Furthermore, its twitch-to-tetanus ratio decreased, and there was no longer any depression of electromyogram (EMG) amplitude during fatigue tests. After 4 wk of subsequent rest it was found that 1) twitch speed and maximum tetanic force had returned to nearly normal values, 2) fatigue resistance showed some return toward normal but was still significantly enhanced, and 3) no significant recovery had yet occurred of the altered twitch-to-tetanus ratio, the abolished EMG depression, or the slowed rate of rise of tetanic tension. During the poststimulation recovery period, the progressive increase of isometric twitch speed was not promoted by the administration of small daily amounts of high-rate stimulation (100-Hz bursts). The results support the conclusions that 1) the time course of recovery differs among physiological properties, 2) the EMG and force reactions that occur during a fatigue test are not strongly coupled, as demonstrated by the alterations of their relationship during poststimulation recovery, and 3) in cat's fast muscles, there is still no evidence for rate-specific effects of chronic stimulation on isometric twitch speed. 
POEMS syndrome with idiopathic flushing mimicking carcinoid syndrome. POEMS syndrome, a rare multisystem disease, is a variant of osteosclerotic myeloma and is characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal proteins, and skin changes. Presented herein is a case of POEMS syndrome with flushing. The flushing was intermittent, involving the face and upper third of the trunk, and was associated with hypotension and bronchospasm. Final diagnosis was made by biopsy examination of an axillary lymph node, which showed angiofollicular hyperplasia that stained strongly and selectively for lambda light chains. The patient had most of the typical features of POEMS syndrome but was unique in that her most striking finding was carcinoid-like flushing. The flushing improved with steroid therapy, as did some of the other clinical features of her disease. This case suggests that idiopathic flushing can be added to the skin changes observed in POEMS syndrome. 
Magnetic resonance imaging shows specific abnormalities in the MELAS syndrome. The MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) can be difficult to identify. We report MRI abnormalities that we believe are specific to this disorder in three patients with complete or partial MELAS syndrome. The patients all showed an unusual pattern on T2-weighted MRI with multifocal areas of hyperintense signal confined to the cortex of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and adjacent white matter. Some images suggested selective cortical involvement of deeper layers only. Deep white matter was relatively spared, distinguishing this from usual cerebrovascular disease or the edema after status epilepticus. Specificity of these findings is further suggested by a good correlation of these findings with the previously described unique postmortem brain pathology of MELAS. 
Examination of cardiorespiratory changes during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Comparison of monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation, arterial pressure and the electrocardiogram. Critical events including hypoxaemia, arrhythmias and myocardial ischaemia may occur more frequently during endoscopic procedures than during anaesthesia. A study was undertaken to assess the cardiovascular changes and to evaluate suitable monitoring techniques to detect critical events during sedation and endoscopy. Twenty patients scheduled to undergo a prolonged endoscopic procedure which required deep sedation were studied. Continuous recordings of electrocardiogram, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were made and arterial pressure was recorded at one-minute intervals. The study commenced immediately before administration of sedatives, continued for the duration of the examination and for one hour following the examination. Oxygen saturation decreased in all patients during the examination to a mean of 82.9% (SD 11.9), and remained below baseline for the duration of the examination and into the recovery period. Statistically significant increases and reductions of systolic arterial pressure and rate-pressure product were found during the procedures compared with baseline values recorded before administration of sedatives. Sixteen of the 20 patients developed tachycardia during the examination. Ten patients developed ectopic foci which were supraventricular, ventricular or both in origin. Electrocardiogram changes resolved during the recovery period. Myocardial ischaemia was assessed by S-T segment depression and a significant correlation was found between S-T segment depression and hypoxaemia, although the magnitude of the S-T depression was small and may not have been detected clinically. No correlation was found between S-T segment depression and arterial pressure, heart rate or rate-pressure product. 
Childhood epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Report of three cases and review of literature. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is an acquired subepidermal blistering disease with variable clinical, pathologic, and immunologic features. The disease has been reported infrequently in adults and only rarely in children. We describe three new cases of childhood epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, review three previously reported cases, and contrast the features of the disease in children with those in adults. The results suggest that both children and adults with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita have variable clinical and pathologic features that may mimic other bullous diseases. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is characterized by a chronic course, poor response to therapy, and occasional clinical remissions. 
Digitalis and beta-blocking agents: effects on depression following myocardial infarction. Depression is frequently seen in patients following myocardial infarction (MI), many of whom are receiving digitalis glycosides, beta-blockers, or other agents that may exert central nervous system (CNS) effects. In a prospective study of the clinical significance of post-MI depression, 335 patients were assessed using a standardized diagnostic interview for depression at 8 to 10 days, and 190 were reinterviewed at 3 to 4 months. Patients prescribed digitalis, beta-blockers, or other cardioactive medications at hospital discharge were identified. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the contribution of these agents to depression at 3 to 4 months, controlling for medical and sociodemographic factors as well as for baseline depression. Treatment with digitalis predicted depression at 3 to 4 months (p less than 0.05); no other medications, including beta-blockers, predicted depression (p greater than 0.10). Digitalis may have CNS effects that contribute to depression post-MI and this finding should be considered in the differential diagnosis of depression in cardiac patients. 
Older age and elevated blood pressure are risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombolysis. Intracerebral hemorrhage is an important concern after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, but risk factors are controversial. Accordingly, we assessed risk factors in 107 treated patients of whom 4 had intracerebral hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage occurred at a mean of 25 hours (range 3.5 to 48) after therapy and was fatal in 2 patients. Significant differences were found between patients with and without intracerebral hemorrhage for age (77 +/- 7 vs 62 +/- 11 years, p less than or equal to 0.01), and initial (161 +/- 23 vs 135 +/- 23 mm Hg, p less than or equal to 0.03) and maximal (171 +/- 30 vs 146 +/- 20, p less than or equal to 0.02) systolic blood pressures. Initial and maximal diastolic blood pressures also tended to be higher (101 +/- 25 vs 86 +/- 16, p less than or equal to 0.07; 104 +/- 24 vs 90 +/- 13, p less than or equal to 0.06). Differences did not achieve significance for comparisons of gender, height, weight, site of infarction, time to therapy, specific thrombolytic agent used, concomitant therapy, interventions and partial thromboplastin time. It is concluded that age (greater than or equal to 70 years) and elevated blood pressure (greater than or equal to 150/95 mm Hg) are important risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage. The overall balance of benefit and risk of thrombolysis should continue to be assessed by large mortality trials. 
Extended aortic root replacement with cryopreserved allografts: do they hold up? The extended aortic root replacement technique is used for the surgical repair of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction complicated by concurrent hypoplastic aortic annulus, multiple levels of obstruction, or aortic insufficiency. Extended aortic root replacement incorporates the concepts of aortic root replacement and aortoventriculoplasty to create a comparatively simple procedure. Unique features of the technique include the implantation of an allograft, which makes the need for anticoagulation obsolete, and use of the donor mitral leaflet to enlarge the outflow tract. Since 1985, 32 patients in Denver have undergone placement of a cryopreserved aortic valve allograft as part of extended aortic root replacement. There were four hospital deaths (13%), and 1 child underwent cardiac transplantation 30 hours after operation. In 6 months to 4.8 years of follow-up, a 14-year-old boy with familial hyperlipidemia required coronary artery bypass grafting, and 3 children experienced allograft calcification with progressive insufficiency, which prompted allograft replacement. The other 23 patients are clinically well. 
Non-antireflux versus antireflux ureteroneocystostomy in adults. A retrospective analysis of ureteric reimplantation in adults showed that a high proportion (71%) had been treated by non-antireflux procedures. Analysis of the ureteroneocystostomy success rate in aetiological groups where either antireflux or non-antireflux techniques were used indicated the superiority of antireflux surgery in the prevention of reflux. The risk of stenosis at the site of anastomosis was equal in both groups. No significant difference in the preservation of renal function was detected in the 2 groups. It was concluded that antireflux procedures offered no advantage over non-antireflux ureteric reimplantation in adults. 
Acute cor pulmonale secondary to metastatic tumor to the heart: a case report and literature review. Metastatic tumors to the heart are becoming more common due to improved survival afforded by advanced treatment of malignancies. Their presence should be sought in a cancer patient who develops new primary cardiac symptoms. We present a case of a 50-year-old woman who succumbed to acute cor pulmonale secondary to metastatic laryngeal carcinoma to the right ventricle with subsequent tumor emboli to the pulmonary vasculature. 
Tentorial subdural hemorrhage in term newborns: ultrasonographic diagnosis and clinical correlates. Tentorial subdural hemorrhage with its supratentorial and infratentorial extensions were diagnosed by cranial ultrasonography and computed tomography in 9 term newborns. Vacuum extraction or forceps delivery was used in 6 patients. Abnormal neurologic manifestations developed after a period of normality in 8 patients. Increased intracranial pressure was the most common presentation. All patients had hemorrhage at the falcotentorial junction near the incisura; 5 also had hemorrhage around the tentorial leaflet. Posterior fossa retrocerebellar subdural hemorrhage developed in 5 patients and posterior interhemispheric subdural hemorrhage developed in 4. All 6 patients who received conservative treatment had normal neurodevelopmental outcomes. Of the other 3 patients upon whom suboccipital craniotomies were performed, only 1 had a normal outcome. Although it localized the tentorial subdural hemorrhage either at the incisura area or at the tentorial leaflet, ultrasonography failed to identify all patients with retrocerebellar or posterior interhemispheric subdural hemorrhage. Parturitional tentorial subdural hemorrhage may not be uncommon. Ultrasonography and computed tomography are complementary in the diagnosis. Surgical decompression of the posterior fossa subdural hematoma is necessary only in the presence of acute hydrocephalus or signs of brainstem compression. 
Efficacy of a postoperative regimen of enoxaparin in deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Venous thromboembolism is a common complication in patients undergoing elective hip replacement, in whom the incidence of calf vein thrombosis is 40% to 60%; proximal vein thrombosis, 20%; and fatal pulmonary embolism, 1% to 2% when prophylaxis is not used. A double-blind, randomized trial comparing low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) with placebo for the prevention of venous thrombosis in patients undergoing elective hip surgery was carried out. Prophylactic treatment with a fixed dose was begun postoperatively and continued for 14 days. Fifty patients in each treatment group underwent surveillance with 125I-fibrinogen leg scanning and impedance plethysmography. In the first 24 patients, venography was performed only if their surveillance test was positive. Venography was requested in the remaining 76 patients even if the screening tests were negative; in this latter group, venous thrombosis occurred in 4 patients (10.8%) given enoxaparin and 20 patients (51.3%) given placebo (p = 0.0002). The corresponding rates for proximal vein thrombosis were 5.4% and 23.1%, respectively (p = 0.029). In the entire group of 100 patients, venous thrombosis occurred in 12% of those given enoxaparin and 42% of those given placebo (p = 0.0007). The corresponding rates for proximal vein thrombi were 4% and 20%, respectively (p = 0.014). The observed hemorrhagic rate was 5% in each treatment group. The results of this study show that prophylaxis with fixed-dose enoxaparin is effective and safe for patients undergoing elective hip replacement. 
Liposarcoma of the esophagus. Liposarcoma is one of the most common soft tissue sarcomas found in adults, yet it rarely develops in the alimentary tract. This report describes the pathological features and management of a liposarcoma of the esophagus. 
Testing for association between disease and linked marker loci: a log-linear-model analysis. One approach frequently used for identifying genetic factors involved in the process of a complex disease is the comparison of patients and controls for a number of genetic markers near a candidate gene. The analysis of such association studies raises some specific problems because of the fact that genotypic and not gametic data are generally available. We present a log-linear-model analysis providing a valid method for analyzing such studies. When studying the association of disease with one marker locus, the log-linear model allows one to test for the difference between allelic frequencies among affected and unaffected individuals, Hardy-Weinberg (H-W) equilibrium in both groups, and interaction between the association of alleles at the marker locus and disease. This interaction provides information about the dominance of the disease susceptibility locus, with dominance defined using the epidemiological notion of odds ratio. The degree of dominance measured at the marker locus depends on the strength of linkage disequilibrium between the marker locus and the disease locus. When studying the association of disease with several linked markers, the model becomes rapidly complex and uninterpretable unless it is assumed that affected and unaffected populations are in H-W equilibrium at each locus. This hypothesis must be tested before going ahead in the analysis. If it is not rejected, the log-linear model offers a stepwise method of identification of the parameters causing the difference between populations. This model can be extended to any number of loci, alleles, or populations. 
Comparison of image analysis and flow cytometric determination of cellular DNA content. A good correlation (r = 0.94) was obtained between the DNA indices (DI) using flow cytometry and image analysis of nuclei cytospins extracted from paraffin wax embedded tumour sections. Some of the limitations and problems associated with image analysis which came to light included an unacceptably high coefficient of variation (CV) and a "left-shift" in the DI in most DNA histograms obtained when using image analysis of 5 microns sections. In contrast, the DNA histograms generated using image analysis of cytospun nuclei from paraffin wax blocks were of good quality and similar to those obtained using flow cytometry. Variability in Feulgen staining was common and an important source of error despite rigorous control of the staining technique. This could be overcome by using internal controls such as fibroblasts rather than external controls (rat hepatocytes) to determine the diploid DI with image analysis. A thorough understanding and appreciation of the methodological problems associated with image analysis and flow cytometric determination of DNA content is required before these methods find widespread clinical application. 
Exercise radionuclide angiocardiography predicts cardiac death in patients with coronary artery disease. The purpose of this investigation was to document the relative importance of three clinical and three radionuclide variables for prediction of cardiac death in a consecutive group of patients evaluated for coronary artery disease. During a 6 1/2-year period, beginning in January 1978, 2,042 consecutive patients underwent radionuclide angiocardiography, with a clinical diagnosis of coronary artery disease, at Duke University Medical Center. A subgroup of 318 patients who underwent surgical myocardial revascularization near the time of initial study were excluded from later analysis. Clinical follow-up information was complete in a group of 1,663 patients who did not undergo interventional therapy. The 141 cardiac deaths in these 1,663 patients were the study end point. Cox proportional hazards models analyzed the prognostic information contained in three clinical variables (pain type, age, and sex) and three radionuclide angiocardiogram variables (exercise ejection fraction, resting end-diastolic volume, and change in heart rate with exercise). One-variable models confirmed the prognostic importance of each of these six variables. A multivariable model in which all six variables were used showed clinical variables to contain only 5% and the radionuclide variables 95% of the prognostic information. The exercise ejection fraction was the single most important variable, which alone contained 85% of the total information in the model. Curves relating probability of no cardiac death to the exercise ejection fraction identified a value of 0.50 as an inflection point. Patients with exercise ejection fractions below 0.50 demonstrate a probability of cardiac death that increases as the ejection fraction decreases. 
Interferon therapy for acute posttransfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis: response with respect to anti-hepatitis C virus antibody status. To assess the effect of interferon therapy on posttransfusion non-A, non-B acute hepatitis, we examined the appearance of serum hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) and abnormal serum aminotransferase levels after the onset of hepatitis in 12 patients treated with interferon and in 46 patients treated conservatively. Eleven patients were given 3 million units of human fibroblast beta-interferon three times weekly for 4 wk and 1 was given one million units of human lymphoblastoid alpha-interferon daily for 3 months. In the interferon-treated patients, the effect of therapy on hepatic histology was also assessed. Detection of anti-HCV within 6 and 12 months after the onset of hepatitis was less common in interferon-treated patients than in control patients (6/12 vs 35/46 and 5/12 vs 35/46, both p = NS). At 24 months after the onset of hepatitis, anti-HCV levels were significantly lower in interferon-treated patients (0/10, p less than 0.05), but had not changed significantly in control patients (34/46). Abnormal serum aminotransferase levels at 6, 12, and 24 months after the onset of hepatitis were significantly less common in interferon-treated patients than in controls (25% vs 78.3%, p less than 0.005; 25% vs 71.7%, p less than 0.01; and 0% vs 67.4%, p less than 0.001). The percentage of abnormal serum aminotransferase levels at 6, 12, and 24 months after onset of hepatitis was also less in interferon-treated patients than in control patients, both among anti-HCV-positive patients (50% vs 85.7%, p = NS; 50% vs 80%, p = NS; and 0% vs 77.1%, p less than 0.01) and among anti-HCV-negative patients (0% vs 54.5%, p = NS; 0% vs 45.5%, p = NS; and 0% vs 27.3%, p = NS). Immediately after interferon therapy, the histological activity index dropped from 6.0 +/- 4.2 to 4.8 +/- 2.5 in anti-HCV-positive patients (p = NS) and from 4.2 +/- 4.3 to 2.6 +/- 1.7 in anti-HCV-negative patients (p = NS). Biopsy specimens obtained from four patients 12-23 months after interferon therapy revealed normal histology in one anti-HCV-positive patient and two anti-HCV-negative patients, and marked improvement in the other anti-HCV-positive patient. These results indicate that short-term, low-dose interferon therapy may be effective for posttransfusion non-A, non-B acute hepatitis (both anti-HCV-positive and anti-HCV-negative). 
Diagnosis and treatment of oral candidosis. Oral candidosis is a common opportunistic infection that manifests in a variety of forms. It is also recognized as one of the earliest manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although a number of antifungal agents are available for the treatment of this condition, a newly introduced triazole group of drugs appears to be highly effective in treating oral candidosis. This article reviews the clinical presentation and management of oral candidosis, particularly with reference to the latter group of drugs and HIV-induced disease. 
Experimental cardiac tamponade: a hemodynamic and Doppler echocardiographic reexamination of the relation of right and left heart ejection dynamics to the phase of respiration. A hallmark of cardiac tamponade is pulsus paradoxus. However, the exact mechanism of pulsus paradoxus and the relation of left and right ventricular ejection dynamics remain controversial, with some studies suggesting an inverse relation in ventricular filling and ejection and others citing a more important role for the effects of right heart ejection dynamics delayed by transit through the pulmonary artery bed. To specifically reexamine this issue, six sedated but spontaneously breathing dogs were studied during experimental cardiac tamponade with use of extensive hemodynamic instrumentation and Doppler methods. During cardiac tamponade, left ventricular systolic pressure decreased from 125.8 +/- 12.1 to 81.7 +/- 26.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and cardiac output from 5.86 +/- 1.48 to 2.34 +/- 0.98 liters/min (p less than 0.001); mean pericardial pressure increased from -1.2 +/- 0.8 to 10.5 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and pulsus paradoxus from 4.3 +/- 1.6 to 10.7 +/- 1.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) compared with baseline values. An inverse relation in left and right ventricular ejection dynamics that was very close to 180 degrees out of phase was seen throughout the respiratory cycle in multiple hemodynamic and Doppler variables including peak systolic pressures, aortic and pulmonary flow velocities and ventricular ejection times. Simultaneous recording of the transmitral pressure gradient provided indirect evidence that the ventricular ejection dynamics were directly related to changes in ventricular filling. However, the magnitude of ventricular pressure or output flow velocity for each respiratory cycle was variable, depending on the exact timing of filling and ejection in relation to the phase of respiration. Variation in left ventricular output due to changes in right ventricular output delayed by transit through the pulmonary vasculature was not recognized in any animal. It is concluded that in spontaneously breathing dogs with acute cardiac tamponade, peak ventricular pressures, ventricular ejection times and pulmonary and aortic flow velocities have an inverse relation that is very close to 180 degrees out of phase. 
Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis with paralysis. Prognosis and treatment. In the interval between 1983 and 1988, 14 patients were treated for pyogenic spondylitis complicated by neurologic compromise. There were nine males and five females aged 39-80 years. The average time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 2.8 months. Predisposing factors were diabetes mellitus in four patients and urinary tract infections in five patients. The infection was blood borne in all 14 patients. In two patients, the infection was superimposed on a recent vertebral fracture. The cervical spine was involved in one patient; the thoracic spine in seven; and the lumbar spine in six patients. Six patients presented with a Frankel B paralysis, six with a Frankel C paralysis, and two with grade D paralysis. The neurologic symptoms lasted between one day and six weeks before surgery. Twelve patients had anterolateral decompression. Two of the 12 patients had a second stage posterior stabilization. Two patients were deemed inoperable. All surviving patients were managed by parenteral antibiotics for three to six weeks followed by enteral route for a total of three to six months. All 12 operated patients had a significant neurologic improvement (one grade or more on the Frankel scale) with solid interbody fusion. 
Cell kinetics of gastrointestinal tumors after different nutritional regimens. A preliminary report. Forty-four cases of different untreated gastrointestinal tumors were studied with regard to cell kinetic activity. As a pilot experiment, we also determined the 3H-TdR Labeling Index (LI) in 28 patients in basal conditions and after 15 days of nutritional manipulation with prevalently lipid-based or glucose-based feeding to ascertain whether selective nutritional regimens could affect tumor proliferation. Preliminary results from this study indicate that a kinetic perturbation is induced in tumor cells by nutritional manipulation. Lipid-based feeding seems to produce effects similar to those of chemical or physical anticancer agents, thus suggesting a possible supporting role of nutritional manipulation in cancer treatment strategy. 
Direct correlation of cytogenetic findings with cell morphology using in situ hybridization: an analysis of suspicious cells in bone marrow specimens of two patients completing therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Bone marrow cells from two pediatric patients completing therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia were studied using in situ hybridization with an alpha-satellite DNA probe specific for chromosome 17. Morphologic analysis of the end-therapy specimens from each patient had shown small numbers (7.5%, 8.5%) of cells that were suspicious for residual or recurrent disease. These cells could not be morphologically or immunophenotypically distinguished with certainty from immature lymphoid cells (hematogones), which may be present normally, sometimes in increased numbers, in the bone marrow specimens of children. In situ hybridization with a probe to chromosome 17 was used because the leukemic cells from each patient had originally been shown to have an extra copy of this chromosome. In one patient, in situ studies showed a population of cells (106 of 1,000 cells) with three hybridization signals indicating trisomy 17, and thus residual/recurrent leukemia. In the other patient trisomy 17 could not be detected. Additional hybridizations to previously stained bone marrow aspirate smears permitted a direct correlation of the cytogenetic findings with the suspicious cells on a cell-to-cell basis. The questionable cells were identified, photographed, and then re-examined after hybridization. In one patient, 13 of 18 (72%) of the suspicious cells were found to have trisomy 17, whereas in the other patient 0 of 24 (0%) demonstrated an extra copy of this chromosome. These cases illustrate a clinical application of interphase cytogenetic analysis and demonstrate how this technology can be used for direct correlation of cytogenetic findings with cell morphology. This technique should prove useful for the detection of minimal residual disease and for lineage studies in leukemia and myelodysplasia. 
Genesis of arrhythmias in the failing heart and therapeutic implications. Between 50 and 70% of patients with heart failure die suddenly and unexpectedly before they have deteriorated to New York Heart Association class IV symptoms. It has long been known that ventricular ectopy predicts sudden cardiac death in coronary heart disease, and this has also been shown in dilated cardiomyopathy. It is less certain whether antiarrhythmic drugs reduce this risk and improve prognosis. Supraventricular arrhythmias frequently develop in heart failure of all causes. They nearly always cause symptoms, and the establishment of atrial fibrillation may mark a permanent deterioration. Except for sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias are often occult. Hypokalemia and digitalis toxicity may have been precipitated by diuretics or interaction with antiarrhythmic drugs. In coronary heart failure, arrhythmias may be related to scar tissue or ischemia, which may also be responsible in dilated cardiomyopathy. Use of inotropes and inodilators may precipitate arrhythmias, whereas drugs that conserve energy or potassium, such as beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may prevent them. Since suppression of ventricular arrhythmias has not been shown to prevent sudden death or prolong life in patients with heart failure, it may be that such arrhythmias do not directly presage ventricular fibrillation except in so far as they are markers of a poor prognosis with a risk of sudden death. If so, such arrhythmias are most likely to be suppressed by agents that result in improvement of left ventricular function and, through that, prolongation of life. 
Nutritional supplementation, psychosocial stimulation, and mental development of stunted children: the Jamaican Study. There is little unequivocal evidence that nutritional supplementation of undernourished children has a beneficial effect on their mental development. The effects of nutritional supplementation, with or without psychosocial stimulation, of growth-retarded (stunted) children aged 9-24 months were assessed in a study in Kingston, Jamaica. 129 children from poor neighbourhoods were randomly assigned to four groups--control, supplemented only, stimulated only, and supplemented plus stimulated. A group of matched non-stunted children (n = 32) was also included. The supplement comprised 1 kg milk-based formula per week for 2 years, and the stimulation weekly play sessions at home with a community health aide. The children's development (DQ) was assessed on the Griffiths mental development scales. Initially the stunted groups' DQs were lower than those of the non-stunted group, and those of the control group declined during the study, increasing their deficit. Stimulation and supplementation had significant independent beneficial effects on the children's development. Estimates of the supplementation effect ranged from 2.2 (95% confidence limits-1.4, 5.7) for the hand and eye subscale to 12.4 (5.4, 19.5) for the locomotor subscale and those for the stimulation effect from 6.4 (2.8, 10.0) for hand and eye to 10.3 (3.3, 17.3) for locomotor. The treatment effects were additive, and combined interventions were significantly more effective than either alone. These findings suggest that poor mental development in stunted children is at least partly attributable to undernutrition. 
Limitations of the electrocardiogram in estimating infarction size after acute reperfusion therapy for myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of the 12-lead electrocardiogram to estimate infarction size after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN: The presence or absence of Q waves and the Selvester QRS score obtained before and after hospital discharge were compared with radionuclide estimates of infarction size and ejection fraction at discharge and 6 weeks later, regional wall motion at discharge and 6 weeks later, and myocardial perfusion defect size quantitated with Tc-99m-sestamibi at discharge. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A consecutive series of 43 patients with acute myocardial infarction who received acute reperfusion therapy and were assessed using 12-lead electrocardiography, radionuclide angiography, and Tc-99m-sestamibi tomographic imaging before discharge. INTERVENTIONS: All 43 patients received acute reperfusion therapy: 21 patients received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, and 22 patients underwent primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The correlation of QRS score and Q waves with three radionuclide estimates of infarction size. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between myocardial perfusion defect size at discharge and both left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion at discharge and 6 weeks later (r = -0.71 to -0.81; all comparisons, P less than 0.001). Little correlation was found between electrocardiographic findings and radionuclide measurements of left ventricular function and perfusion. Presence or absence of Q waves at discharge was not associated with any difference in ejection fraction, regional wall motion, or perfusion defect at discharge. No correlation was found between QRS score and ejection fraction or myocardial perfusion defect size at discharge. The QRS score at discharge correlated only weakly with regional wall motion at discharge and 6 weeks later. This lack of correlation was unchanged when electrocardiograms obtained after hospital discharge were analyzed. CONCLUSION: Although inexpensive and readily available, the 12-lead electrocardiogram does not appear to provide a reliable estimate of infarction size after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. 
Beneficial effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity on myocardial stunning in dogs. This study was undertaken to elucidate whether alpha-1 adrenoceptor activity is beneficial to contractile dysfunction during reperfusion after a brief period of ischemia (stunned myocardium) in 54 open-chest dogs. Contractile dysfunction assessed by fractional shortening (FS) was observed 3 hours after the onset of reperfusion following 15 minutes of complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Pretreatment with prazosin (4 micrograms/kg/min i.c.) further deteriorated contractile dysfunction compared with the untreated condition (12.7 +/- 0.6% versus 6.9 +/- 0.4% with prazosin treatment, p less than 0.001). Conversely, alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists, methoxamine (1.0 microgram/kg/min i.c.) and norepinephrine (0.24 microgram/kg/min i.c.) with rauwolscine and propranolol, significantly attenuated contractile dysfunction (FS in the methoxamine-treated group, 17.3 +/- 0.3%, p less than 0.001 versus the untreated group; FS in the norepinephrine-treated group, 18.0 +/- 0.9%, p less than 0.05 versus 13.6 +/- 1.1% in the propranolol group). Both adenosine release and hyperemic coronary flow response during the early reperfusion period were significantly attenuated in the prazosin-treated group, and both were enhanced in the alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation groups. These results suggest that beneficial effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity may be due to the enhanced release of adenosine. To test the cause-effect relation between the extent of adenosine release and contractile dysfunction during reperfusion, 8-phenyltheophylline was infused to block adenosine receptors in the methoxamine-treated group. The treatment with 8-phenyltheophylline completely abolished (FS, 7.4 +/- 0.3%) the beneficial effect of the enhanced adenosine release by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation. Furthermore, in the prazosin-treated group, adenosine (9 micrograms/kg/min) was additionally infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery 5 minutes before and 2 hours after the onset of reperfusion. Both hyperemic coronary flow and contractile dysfunction (FS, 17.3 +/- 0.3%) recovered to the levels of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation groups. However, treatment with papaverine could not prevent deleterious effects of prazosin despite the fact that comparable hyperemic flow was obtained. Instead, lactate production up to 10 minutes after the onset of reperfusion was significantly larger (p less than 0.01) despite augmented contractile function in the prazosin-treated and the 8-phenyltheophylline with methoxamine-treated groups compared with the untreated group. The electron microscopic examination revealed no irreversible myocardial injury with and without pharmacological interventions. Thus, we conclude that alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity can reduce the magnitude of myocardial stunning and that its cellular mechanism is due to enhanced adenosine release by alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Grafting of perfused adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease. Clinica Puerta de Hierro Neural Transplantation Group. The authors report results obtained in 20 severely affected patients with Parkinson's disease (Grade IV or V) who received an autotransplant of perfused adrenal medullary tissue. This study seems to indicate that these autoimplants can improve the parkinsonian symptomatology and induce amelioration in the patients' performance of routine activities. All the symptoms analyzed showed improvement, although it differed in intensity and time of onset. Moreover, this improvement was accompanied by a reduction in the daily intake of L-dopa, with discontinuance of dopamine agonists and amantadine. A number of medical complications were encountered, including three deaths, probably related to performing abdominal surgery in seriously affected parkinsonian patients who were unable to tolerate the discontinuance of their medication. The transient psychiatric disorders observed appeared to be related to the postoperative dose of L-dopa and/or anticholinergic agents administered, and diminished or disappeared when the doses were reduced. The reasons for improvement, which was bilateral, remain unknown, although one cause may be the surgical trauma (minicaudotomy) together with the implantation of adrenal medullary tissue, which may promote the sprouting of surviving dopaminergic fibers. Moreover, in this series, perfusion of adrenal medulla increased the capacity for revascularization of the tissue and may have reduced the damaging effects of warm ischemia on the cells. This, together with the existence of fenestrated vessels, could hypothetically have served as an access point for drugs, and if the implanted cells were viable, they might have served to store and manufacture different factors and/or transmitters. These results as well as those of other groups justify the development of a controlled international clinical trial. 
Isradipine: overall clinical experience in hypertension in the United States. Isradipine is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist shown to be efficacious, safe, and well tolerated in the treatment of hypertension, regardless of patient age or race. There has been no evidence of negative inotropism, atrioventricular conduction delay, nor clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters associated with isradipine treatment. A total of 934 patients have been treated with isradipine in double-blind hypertension trials (involving 297 patients treated with placebo and 414 treated with active controls, such as hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril). Both the mean changes from baseline in diastolic and systolic blood pressures and the percentage of patients responding to treatment (blood pressure decrease of at least 10 mm Hg) were greater with isradipine than with placebo or active controls. Blood pressure response increases with increases in isradipine dose up to 10 to 15 mg daily; higher doses do not, on average, result in greater blood pressure reduction. The incidence of adverse reactions with isradipine is similar to that for active controls and slightly more than for placebo. There were fewer discontinuations with isradipine and, in addition, a decrease in the incidence of new adverse reactions with increasing duration of treatment, down to 1% at 24 months. 
Chronic neurologic manifestations of Lyme disease BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Lyme disease, caused by the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is associated with a wide variety of neurologic manifestations. To define further the chronic neurologic abnormalities of Lyme disease, we studied 27 patients (age range, 25 to 72 years) with previous signs of Lyme disease, current evidence of immunity to B. burgdorferi, and chronic neurologic symptoms with no other identifiable cause. Eight of the patients had been followed prospectively for 8 to 12 years after the onset of infection. RESULTS. Of the 27 patients, 24 (89 percent) had a mild encephalopathy that began 1 month to 14 years after the onset of the disease and was characterized by memory loss, mood changes, or sleep disturbance. Of the 24 patients, 14 had memory impairment on neuropsychological tests, and 18 had increased cerebrospinal fluid protein levels, evidence of intrathecal production of antibody to B. burgdorferi, or both. Nineteen of the 27 patients (70 percent) had polyneuropathy with radicular pain or distal paresthesias; all but two of these patients also had encephalopathy. In 16 patients electrophysiologic testing showed an axonal polyneuropathy. One patient had leukoencephalitis with asymmetric spastic diplegia, periventricular white-matter lesions, and intrathecal production of antibody to B. burgdorferi. Among the 27 patients, associated symptoms included fatigue (74 percent), headache (48 percent), arthritis (37 percent), and hearing loss (15 percent). At the time of examination, chronic neurologic abnormalities had been present from 3 months to 14 years, usually with little progression. Six months after a two-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g daily), 17 patients (63 percent) had improvement, 6 (22 percent) had improvement but then relapsed, and 4 (15 percent) had no change in their condition. CONCLUSIONS. Months to years after the initial infection with B. burgdorferi, patients with Lyme disease may have chronic encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, or less commonly, leukoencephalitis. These chronic neurologic abnormalities usually improve with antibiotic therapy. 
Menstrual cycle factors related to increased gastric contractile response to tube feeding. Evidence exists that the ovarian hormones have a modulating effect on gastrointestinal (GI) motility, yet details are sketchy and little attention has been paid to the effect that fluctuating hormone levels might have on women who are receiving enteral feedings. This study compared gastric motility indices in response to tube feedings at two points in the menstrual cycle, concurrently measured ovarian hormone levels, and described three potentially related factors (ie, GI symptoms, uterine cramping pain, reports of daily stressors). Intragastric motility responses to enteral feedings were obtained on 28 women (aged 19-37) during menses and midfollicular phases of two menstrual cycles. Intragastric pressure changes were monitored by an open-tipped cannula method at rest, during and after tube feeding (Ensure, 240 ml at 8 ml/min). Serum estradiol and progesterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Women completed a daily diary of symptoms and stressors throughout the two menstrual cycles. Results showed that intragastric pressure amplitudes and frequencies were higher at menses compared with midfollicular recordings. At menses, prefeeding and feeding gastric pressure amplitudes were positively correlated with uterine cramping pain and GI symptoms (ie, nausea). At menses, postfeeding contraction frequencies were also correlated with uterine cramping pain. At midfollicular phase, progesterone levels correlated with gastric motility indices; number of stressors indirectly correlated with gastric motility indices. These data suggest that gastric responses to enteral feeding are influenced by menstrual cycle phase. 
Nd:YAG laser-induced hyperthermia treatment of spontaneously occurring veterinary head and neck tumors. Conventional hyperthermia treatment of superficial tumors in the oral cavity is troublesome due to difficulty in accessing the lesion. A new hyperthermia technique employing near-infrared radiation delivered through a flexible silica optical fiber is described. The system consisted of an Nd:YAG laser for tissue heating, a He-Ne laser for aiming beam, a computer-controlled optical shutter, an interstitial thermometer, computer, and a printer. A 3-m-long 600-microns silica fiber delivered laser energy to the tumor via surface illumination. Using the aiming beam, the spot size was adjusted to include 5 mm of surrounding normal tissue. A thermocouple implanted in the tumor base provided temperature feedback to maintain desired hyperthermic temperature within the lesion. Three spontaneously occurring canine (two squamous cell carcinomas on the gum, one pigmented melanoma on the hard palate) and one feline tumor (squamous cell carcinoma on the nose) have been treated with Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia. Hyperthermia was delivered at 43.5 degrees C for 1 h. All animals received standard radiation treatment prior to hyperthermia. Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia allowed effective and efficient delivery of heat to veterinary nasal and oral lesions otherwise not treatable with conventional heating techniques. 
Pulmonary function tests in bronchopleural fistula. A 53-year-old white man underwent a left pneumonectomy for alveolar cell carcinoma. His postoperative course was complicated by pneumonia. At a follow-up clinic visit, the patient complained of a "roaring sound" during respiration. A follow-up PFT did not show the expected loss of volume (nitrogen washout) from a preoperative PFT, suggesting a bronchopleural fistula. A chest x-ray film and xenon lung scan confirmed the diagnosis. The fistula was surgically repaired. 
End-to-end repair of aortic coarctation using absorbable polydioxanone suture. Based on previous laboratory work, we have used polydioxanone absorbable suture in a variety of vascular and cardiac repairs in pediatric patients. However, some investigators have expressed concern about the potential for aneurysm formation at the anastomotic site. Between March 1983 and June 1989, 15 patients (7 male, 8 female) aged 2.5 months to 9.2 years (mean, 3.7 years) had resection of coarctation of the aorta and end-to-end anastomosis with polydioxanone absorbable suture. Thirteen patients have returned for routine postoperative evaluation, the follow-up time ranging from 11 to 49 months (mean, 23 months). Noninvasive two-dimensional, pulsed-wave Doppler and color echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated good anatomical repair and no anastomotic aneurysm formation or residual coarctation of the aorta in any patient after end-to-end anastomosis with polydioxanone. In summary, this intermediate follow-up study has revealed no vascular complications related to the repair of coarctation with absorbable polydioxanone suture. 
A life-threatening sexually transmitted Haemophilus influenzae in septic abortion: a case report. Haemophilus influenzae infections of the genitourinary tract are rare. A case of a life-threatening Haemophilus influenzae bacteremia associated with a septic abortion is presented. Sexual transmission of bacteria after orogenital contact is proposed as a possible source of this uncommon infection. 
Thoracic epidural analgesia in a patient with bilateral phaeochromocytoma undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A patient suffering from phaeochromocytoma and coronary artery stenoses needed coronary artery bypass grafting before adrenalectomy. High thoracic epidural analgesia (T1-T2) with bupivacaine and sufentanil in combination with general anaesthesia was used. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations decreased during the period before bypass grafting compared to the baseline value and no important haemodynamic changes were seen during this period. Thoracic epidural analgesia failed to suppress the release of catecholamine during the bypass period. After the operation, the plasma catecholamine concentrations returned to the baseline value. Excellent analgesia (visual analogue scale = 1-2) was achieved with a postoperative epidural, but the plasma catecholamine concentration increased considerably. 
Serum and tissue alpha-L-fucosidase activity in the pre-clinical and clinical stages of hepatocellular carcinoma. 1. To assess the value of serum alpha-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) as a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, the activity was measured in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and in control subjects. 2. Mean serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity was significantly greater in 35 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (225 +/- 69 nkat/l) than in 35 patients with cirrhosis and 20 normal subjects (134 +/- 30 and 93 +/- 28 nkat/l, respectively). The overlap between hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, however, was such as to severely limit any value of the enzyme as a diagnostic test. 3. In four cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, an increased enzyme activity was detectable in samples taken up to 66 months before the tumours were diagnosed clinically. 4. The serum activity of alpha-L-fucosidase fell to within the reference range after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma in three patients and in one of these a subsequent rise was associated with tumour recurrence which was diagnosed at 8 months after the rise in activity. Ineffective cytotoxic chemotherapy was also associated with a progressive rise in serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity. 5. alpha-L-fucosidase activity in tumour tissue was significantly lower than that seen in non-tumour tissue from cirrhotic patients. These reductions may represent increased transport from the tissue and may partly account for the increased serum activity found in some patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Generalized pustular psoriasis. A review of 63 cases. BACKGROUND--Sixty-three patients with generalized pustular psoriasis were hospitalized during a 29-year period. They were classified into four subgroups on the basis of onset and morphologic pattern of disease: acute (von Zumbusch), subacute annular, chronic (acral), and mixed. This division provides a better understanding of the variability of the disease and helps in choosing treatment. OBSERVATIONS--The average age at onset was 50 years; male and female patients were affected about equally. In 11 patients, flares were precipitated by localized infections. Approximately one fourth of the patients had complications; most were superinfections. The average stay in the hospital was 30 days; factors correlating with a long hospitalization were hypocalcemia, female sex, and a previous history of psoriasis vulgaris or pustular psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS--Whereas topical therapy was helpful, systemic medications were often needed. Coal tar, ultraviolet light, and psoralen-ultraviolet A may be effective; however, they must be used with caution, because they may exacerbate the disease. 
Cardiovascular reflexes and autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. Cardiovascular reflexes were analysed in a group of 20 patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and in 12 age-matched healthy subjects, in order to ascertain the incidence and degree of autonomic dysfunction. The following were measured: heart rate variation during normal breathing, postural change (30/15 ratio) and during the Valsalva manoeuvre: blood pressure variation after standing. These measurements were taken at least 12 h after therapy had been withdrawn and were repeated after therapy had been resumed. Significant changes in the different heart rate variation indices were found in the parkinsonian patients which correlated with the duration and severity of the extrapyramidal symptomatology. After standing the patients showed a significant drop in blood pressure, when compared respectively with their base values and with the response in controls. Anticholinergic drugs had no significant effect on the heart rate variation indices, whereas antiparkinsonian therapy seems to have contributed to the drop in blood pressure after standing. 
Transformation suppressor activity of a Jun transcription factor lacking its activation domain. The oncoprotein c-Jun is thought to be a mediator of ras transformation as both its synthesis and activity as a transcription factor are stimulated by ras expression. But c-Jun co-operates with ras in transformation assays, suggesting that they act along different pathways (reviewed in ref. 4). Here we show by means of a dominant-negative mutated transcription factor that c-Jun potentially in conjunction with other factors that interact with it is necessary for transformation by ras. The mutant Jun lacks an activation domain and blocks stimulation of transcription by several oncoproteins, including Ras, v-Src, polyoma middle T, c-Jun and c-Fos, as well as by the tumour promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The inhibition is specific for motifs that bind Jun: activation of an NF-kappa B/Rel motif is not affected. This Jun mutant acts as an anti-oncogene in ras-transformed cells, generating non-transformed revertants that have acquired anchorage and density-dependent growth, as well as reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. Mutants of other transcription factors designed to inhibit transformation will enable us to study their role in signal transduction. 
Plasticity of central motor pathways in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. To obtain neurophysiologic evidence for a reorganization of central motor pathways in children who had suffered a cerebral lesion at birth, we performed cross-correlation analyses of multiunit EMG recordings obtained from children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy and marked mirror movements. We found that the motoneuron pools of homologous left and right hand muscles received common synaptic input from abnormally branched presynaptic axons. The results of electromagnetic brain stimulation, cutaneomuscular, and tendon reflex testing suggested that these common inputs are provided by abnormally branched corticospinal tract fibers whose origin is the undamaged motor cortex. 
Complex segregation analysis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese families: interaction of inherited susceptibility and hepatitis B viral infection. Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) is extremely common in eastern China, where it is both associated with chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and often familial. Complex segregation analysis of 490 extended families was undertaken with liability classes defined by age, sex, and HBV infection status. The maximum-likelihood model suggests that a recessive allele with population frequency approximately .25 yields lifetime risk of PHC, in the presence of both HBV infection and genetic susceptibility, of .84 for males and .46 for females. The model further predicts that, in the absence of genetic susceptibility, lifetime risk of PHC is .09 for HBV-infected males and .01 for HBV-infected females and that, regardless of genotype, it is virtually zero for uninfected persons. Complex segregation analysis therefore provides evidence for the interaction of genotype, environmental exposure, sex and age in determining the occurrence of PHC in this population. 
Biomagnetic localization of ventricular arrhythmias. The magnetic fields caused by electrical activity of the human heart can be coherently measured with a highly sensitive, multichannel, superconducting quantum interference-device system and can enable noninvasive localization of the underlying electrical activity. The magnetocardiograms (MCGs) of 10 patients with spontaneous premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), three patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), and four healthy subjects with induced paced beats were recorded for 2-15 minutes. After correction for superimposed repolarization activity, the site of origin of the arrhythmias was localized from the magnetic field distribution at the onset of the ectopic beats. The localization results of paced beats showed an error of a few millimeters in relation to the position of the catheter tip. The results of spontaneous PVC and VT were confirmed with endocardial mapping or associated with ischemic lesions. The authors conclude that multichannel magnetocardiographic studies enable the completely noninvasive localization of ventricular arrhythmias. 
Intraperitoneal contrast material improves the CT detection of peritoneal metastases. The preoperative detection of peritoneal metastases from gynecologic malignancies is difficult; in particular, CT often fails to detect peritoneal implants. This study was designed to determine if the administration of intraperitoneal iodinated contrast media would increase the CT detection of such peritoneal metastases. Prospectively, both standard and intraperitoneal contrast-enhanced CT studies of the abdomen and pelvis were performed in 16 patients with suspected gynecologic tumors. All patients then underwent operative staging, with the location and number of metastases documented. The intraperitoneal enhanced CT studies were more sensitive in the detection of peritoneal metastases than standard CT examinations. Whereas routine CT detected peritoneal metastases in seven (64%) of 11 patients with surgically proved implants, the intraperitoneal enhanced CT studies detected peritoneal metastases in all 11 patients. Depending on the specific intraperitoneal compartments involved, the sensitivity of intraperitoneal enhanced CT in the detection of peritoneal metastases was two- to fourfold greater than that of standard CT examinations. Our results suggest that intraperitoneal enhanced CT is superior to standard CT in the detection of peritoneal metastases. 
Abscesses of the neck in infants and young children. A review of 112 cases. A review of 112 patients 5 years of age and younger with cervical abscesses is reported. Staphylococcus aureus and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus were cultured most often: in 39% and 17% of patients, respectively. Sixteen patients (14%) had unusual abscesses such as infected congenital cysts, cat-scratch disease, or myocobacterial abscesses. One patient had a necrotizing infection with group A streptococci and anaerobic streptococci. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was used in 104 patients, with 94% of these patients receiving a penicillin derivative, usually an antistaphylococcal penicillin. Ninety-six percent of the patients had incision and drainage of their abscesses; 8 patients required more than one incision and drainage. Two patients required airway intervention, 1 by intubation and 1 by trachetomy. Most pediatric cervical abscesses respond well to appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy and incision and drainage. 
Effects of EAP follow-up on prevention of relapse among substance abuse clients. Clients entering an employee assistance program (EAP) of a large manufacturing plant in 1985 who were assessed as having an alcohol or drug abuse problem (N = 325) were randomized into an experimental "special follow-up" group and a control "regular care" group. The regular care group received follow-up only as needed (following the usual practice of the EAP), while a follow-up counselor was hired to make routine contacts with the special follow-up group. Study intake continued through 1985, and follow-up continued through the end of 1986. Data collected on study subjects included EAP participation data, absenteeism, number of hospitalizations, health care claims paid and disability claims paid. The major study hypothesis was that EAP clients randomly allocated to special follow-up would show better results than regular care clients (i.e., would have fewer relapses, better job attendance and lower health benefit utilization during the follow-up year). The follow-up intervention was incompletely implemented due to a variety of organizational problems. Differences between the two groups on the six outcome measures were not statistically significant, although clients in the special follow-up group did show better results than clients in the regular care group on the three measures related to substance abuse. Differences on these three measures were marginally significant in regression analyses after controlling for the effects of number of follow-up visits, age, race and chronicity. 
Naloxone-sensitive, pregnancy-induced changes in behavioral responses to colorectal distention: pregnancy-induced analgesia to visceral stimulation. This study examined the feasibility of using colorectal distention as a noxious visceral stimulus in rat pregnancy-induced analgesia studies as well as the influence of naloxone on the pregnancy-induced changes in the behavioral response to a noxious visceral stimulus. In the first part of the study, we compared the effects of pregnancy on several forms of noxious stimulation (colorectal distention, hypertonic saline induced writhing, tail flick, and hot plate). After determination of prepregnant baseline values, one group of rats (n = 35) was mated and retested on days 7 and 21 of gestation and 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days after parturition. After baseline determinations on day 21 and postpartum day 1, the animals received a subcutaneous injection of naloxone 1.0 mg/kg and were retested. A nonpregnant control group of animals (n = 7) was tested in the same manner. On day 21 of gestation and postpartum days 1 and 3, significant changes (higher threshold or longer latency to response) were observed after all but the writhing test. High-dose naloxone (1.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced the increases observed on day 21 and post-partum day 1. Nonpregnant rats demonstrated no significant change on any test day. The second part of the study evaluated a possible influence of low-dose naloxone on pregnancy-induced analgesia to visceral stimulation (colorectal distention) in another group of pregnant rats (n = 44). The significant increase in threshold on day 21 of gestation was not changed by intravenous (i.v.) naloxone 1.0, 2.3, or 3.0 micrograms/kg, whereas 5.0 and 20.0 micrograms/kg naloxone significantly decreased the observed pregnancy-induced analgesia. 
Treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia in a renal allograft recipient: implications of cyclosporin immunosuppressive treatment. The clinical effects of cyclosporin were evaluated during cytotoxic treatment in a 61 year old man with acute myeloid leukaemia. He had required a renal transplant 18 months before presenting with acute myeloid leukaemia (FAB subtype M4). He had received cyclosporin 3.5-4.0 mg/kg daily to maintain a plasma cyclosporin concentration of 75-150 ng/ml. Cyclosporin was continued during induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin, cytarabine, and 6-thioguanine (DAT). He had fever and oropharyngeal candidiasis that was unresponsive to anti-bacterial drugs but responsive to systemic amphotericin. Bone marrow examination 14 days after chemotherapy showed complete haematological remission. Subsequently he tolerated consolidation treatment with DAT with no serious complications. Unfortunately he developed fatal septicaemia following a second consolidation with mitozantrone and cytarabine. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity by cyclosporin may not significantly increase the toxicity of aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens, and as benefit may be achieved by this approach further clinical evaluation is justified. 
Renal transplant arterial thrombosis: association with cyclosporine. Of 136 patients who received a renal transplant between January 1984 and August 1988, there were six cases (4.4%) of allograft arterial thrombosis (AAT) occurring a mean of 23 days after transplantation. All were maintained on cyclosporine A(CsA) in addition to prednisone and azathioprine. All transplants were performed by the same transplant surgeon. Five of the six episodes (83%) were in allografts that had multiple renal arteries (MRA), giving an incidence of AAT in that group of 36%. Only one of 122 (0.8%) allografts with a single renal artery experienced thrombosis. CsA was started a mean of 9 days after transplantation (range, 16 to 33 days). There was no correlation of AAT to CsA levels. AAT appears to be an early complication of allografts with MRA in patients maintained on CsA. 
Phase I-II study of advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with recombinant human interferon gamma. The association of immunodeficiency with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has generated the concept of supplying immunologically active agents as a means of treating these cancers. One of the most active immunologic messengers is interferon gamma, which has been observed in our laboratories to also have a direct cytotoxic effect on cultures of squamous cell carcinoma derived from the head and neck. To test the feasibility of treating patients with advanced but resectable head and neck cancer with this agent, we designed a phase I-II trial of recombinant human interferon gamma using a 24-hour infusion repeated weekly for four times. In this study, both tumor and immunologic parameters were studied before and after treatment. Eight patients were entered into the study with the highest recombinant human interferon gamma dose attempted being 0.25 mg/m2 per 24 hours. Minimal side effects were observed. Three patients had clinically measurable responses, four had stabilization of disease, and one had progression while receiving treatment. Histopathologic results of treatment were similar to in vitro observations. Necrosis, as well as differentiation of tumor cells, was observed. In some tumors there was a marked decrease in cellularity without a change in tumor volume due to increased extracellular keratin deposition. Our study indicates that evaluation of adoptive immunotherapy trials in head and neck cancer needs to include parameters other than simple tumor regression as an end point, otherwise therapeutically important lymphokine-induced changes may be missed. Further evaluation of recombinant human interferon gamma and agents that induce human interferon gamma are warranted. 
Incremental prognostic accuracy of clinical, radionuclide and hemodynamic data in acute myocardial infarction. A logical sequence of testing in evaluating prognosis early in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) would be to use clinical data first, then add noninvasive data and finally add invasive data. The incremental prognostic information concerning 1-year survival obtained from such a sequence in 107 patients with AMI was studied using logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic curves. Cardiac mortality was 24% at 1 year. Clinical data obtained soon after admission (prior myocardial infarction, heart rate, blood pressure, age) were 78 +/- 5% accurate in the prediction of 1-year survival. The addition of radionuclide-estimated left ventricular ejection fraction or invasive hemodynamic data to the clinical model at this time improved prognostic accuracy to 84 +/- 5% (p = 0.05) and 87 +/- 4% (p = 0.007), respectively. The further addition of invasive data to the model containing clinical and left ventricular ejection fraction data provided a further increment in prognostic accuracy to 89 +/- 4%, whereas no significant increase in accuracy was seen on addition of left ventricular ejection fraction to the model containing clinical and invasive data. It is concluded that clinical data provide important prognostic information concerning late survival early in the course of AMI. This may be improved by the logical application of noninvasive and invasive studies at this time. 
Dietary manipulation of methotrexate-induced enterocolitis. Administration of chemotherapy is limited by host toxicity, which is often manifested by severe enterocolitis. This study evaluated the effects of a liquid, elemental, chemically defined diet (ED) supplemented with 2% glutamine (Glu-ED) compared with a polypeptide diet (PPD) on the morbidity and mortality after methotrexate (MTX) administration. Fischer 344 rats (n = 80) were fed either a regular rat chow diet (RD), a 2% glycine supplemented elemental diet (Gly-ED), a 2% glutamine-supplemented elemental diet (GLU-ED), and a glycine-supplemented polypeptide diet(Gly-PPD) for 7 days prior to administration of MTX (20 mg/kg, ip). After 72 hours, eight rats per group were killed; portal vein and vena cava blood, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), liver, small intestine, and cecum were sampled for bacterial culture. Remaining animals were followed to calculate survival. One hundred percent of the Gly-PPD and 25% of the Glu-ED animals survived compared with 0% of the Gly-ED animals. Our data showed that ED resulted in an increased quantity of intestinal Gram-negative bacteria and diminished intestinal mucosal height and mucosal DNA/protein content. The polypeptide diet prevented intestinal mucosal atrophy, avoided MTX-induced enterocolitis and significantly improved animal survival compared with an elemental diet with or without glutamine supplementation. 
Contribution of regional vascular responses to whole body autoregulation in conscious areflexic rats. We designed studies to evaluate the autoregulation response during volume expansion in three major circulation regions (intestine, kidney, and hind limb) during simultaneous determination of whole body autoregulation in conscious areflexic rats. Cardiac output was measured with chronically implanted electromagnetic flow probes on the ascending aorta. Regional blood flow velocity was measured with pulsed Doppler flow probes on the superior mesenteric (n = 7), left renal (n = 7), and right iliac (n = 7) arteries. Doppler flow probes were calibrated in situ in each rat to determine regional blood flow values. Neurohumoral reflex control of pressure was removed pharmacologically, and blood pressure and cardiac output were returned to resting control values with intravenous norepinephrine infusion, which was maintained at that constant level throughout the study. Hemodynamic changes were measured in response to blood volume expansion with infusion of 0.9 ml blood over 6 minutes. This small change in blood volume resulted in significant increases in vascular resistance of 15% in the whole body, 8% in the intestine, 18% in the kidney, and 15% in the hind limb. The pressure-flow slope, used as an index of autoregulation (slope = 0, perfect autoregulation; slope = 1, rigid vasculature), averaged 0.34 in the whole body, 0.52 in the intestine, 0.19 in the kidney, and 0.39 in the hind limb. When compared with the whole body, blood flow autoregulation was less in the intestine, greater in the kidney, and the same in the hind limb. 
MRI in cerebral toxocaral disease. Toxocara canis, the common roundworm in the dog, can cause "visceral larva migrans" syndrome in humans, which may include generalised illness, eosinophilia, and symptoms arising from larval invasion of different organs. Of these, the clinically most important are liver, lungs, eyes and CNS. Involvement of the different parts of the CNS in human toxocaral disease has been described, but not the CT or MRI appearances of the cerebral lesions. In one case with a single focal epileptic fit, CT was described as normal. In the Toxocara canis case described, the cerebral lesions on MRI, before and after therapy, are shown. 
Treatment of hypertensive urgencies with oral nifedipine, nicardipine, and captopril. Sixty-five patients with uncomplicated hypertensive urgencies were treated in the emergency and cardiology departments with 20 mg nifedipine, 20 mg nicardipine, or 25 mg captopril in a randomized study. The study population consisted of 65 patients ranging in age from forty-one to seventy-one. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed for six hours after intake of the antihypertensive agents. Within sixty minutes nifedipine reduced blood pressure by an average of 74.7 mmHg for the systolic and 35.4 mmHg for the diastolic. Average heart rate increased significantly by 11.6 beats/min at within thirty minutes. Nicardipine and captopril produced equivalent falls in systolic (-81.6 and -79.4 mmHg) and diastolic (-37.3 and -33 mmHg) blood pressure respectively, but did not increase heart rate significantly. The antihypertensive effect of each drug was maintained until six hours after medication. In conclusion, nifedipine, nicardipine, and captopril show similar efficacy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies. The authors believe that these drugs can be used as first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies safely and effectively. 
Emergency department stabilization of pediatric patients with bacterial meningitis. Current advances. The infant or child who presents to the Emergency Department with bacterial meningitis may have nonspecific vague symptoms with few signs of serious illness. However, the disease is often rapidly progressive and life-threatening, and may be associated with respiratory failure, circulatory failure, increased intracranial pressure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or convulsions, any of which may lead to a fatal outcome. It is important for the triage technician in an Emergency Department to cautiously inspect each young patient who presents with illness, carefully considering whether the presenting syndrome of symptoms and signs might be consistent with early meningitis. If the young patient is triaged in a nonemergent category, then periodic assessments of the patients waiting to be seen may ensure that, when the infant or child with an obscure presentation develops evidence suggesting this diagnosis, the triage technician will promptly notify the appropriate definitive care providers who assume responsibility for immediate definitive evaluation and stabilization. Changes in delivery of lifesaving care to the life-threatened child are being impacted by current advances in the understanding of the biochemical basis of disease at the cellular and subcellular levels. Endotoxin release into the blood causes increased production of kinins, which results in vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability. Members of the leukotriene family may also enhance vascular permeability as well as produce augmented leukocyte aggregation to vascular endothelium, vasoconstriction, and bronchoconstriction. Endotoxin activates the complement cascade and induces platelets to form reversible aggregates that may be trapped in the pulmonary microcirculation; and endotoxemia-activated platelets release serotonin, which may be associated with pulmonary hypertension. Now that we have antibiotics that are effective against organisms whose degradation produces endotoxin, there is interest in lessening the host inflammatory response to endotoxin through use of dexamethasone as an anti-inflammatory agent. Clinical trials have revealed that patients who received dexamethasone became afebrile earlier and were less likely to acquire deafness after bacterial meningitis. Because administration of antibiotics is the current specific medical therapy for this life-threatening microbial invasion, it is reasonable to continue to strive to shorten the interval between recognition of disease and specific therapy. However, new studies suggest that consequences of the complex host inflammatory response (at the cellular and subcellular level) to microbial invasion and endotoxin release from bacterial degradation are increasingly important in determining survival or severity of morbidity. Therapeutic intervention with specific antibiotics and steroid anti-inflammatory agents for modulating host responses enhances outcome. 
A short plasma exchange protocol is effective in severe myasthenia gravis. Plasma exchange has been reported to be a successful therapeutic procedure for the treatment of severely compromised myasthenic patients, but the optimal regimen in terms of costs or clinical benefit has not so far been determined. We have investigated the efficacy of a short plasmapheresis protocol of two exchanges 1 day apart in a series of 70 patients with severe forms of myasthenia gravis. Patients were evaluated before and 7 days after the first exchange. A positive outcome was observed in 70% of the plasma exchange cycles performed. Disease severity did not seem to be a negative prognostic factor for the efficacy of this short protocol, which was well tolerated by patients. In only 1 case were major side-effects observed. In spite of its short duration, the exchange treatment plus concomitant immunosuppressive drug therapy was not followed by early clinical deterioration. 
Visceral leishmaniasis: a difficult diagnosis and unusual causative agent. In a young man who had a prolonged fever of unknown origin, hepatosplenomegaly, and progressive pancytopenia, stained smears, blood-agar cultures of bone marrow, and serologic testing for antileishmanial antibodies were negative. Biopsies from liver and bone marrow were uninformative. Visceral leishmaniasis was diagnosed only after splenectomy, when amastigotes were finally cultured from the spleen. The parasite was shown to be an unusual leishmanial parasite, possessing a mixture of intrinsic biochemical and serologic characteristics displayed independently by Leishmania tropica and Leishmania donovani sensu lato, the latter being the usual cause of visceral leishmaniasis. After splenectomy, parasites were also demonstrated in stained bone marrow aspirate smears. Recovery was uneventful after treatment with antimony for 28 days. Visceral leishmaniasis can be a cause of fever of unknown origin and should be considered in its differential diagnosis in endemic areas. 
Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Ultrasonography with graded compression was performed in 525 patients with clinical signs of acute appendicitis. Of 207 patients with surgically proven appendicitis the inflamed appendix (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) had been visualized sonographically in 177 (86 per cent). The score for non-perforated appendicitis (91 per cent) was higher than for perforated appendicitis (55 per cent). Twenty-four patients in whom an inflamed appendix was seen on ultrasonography did not undergo surgery because of rapidly subsiding symptoms ('abortive appendicitis'). Four of these 24 developed recurrent appendicitis warranting surgery. Two underwent elective appendectomy and 18 have remained symptom-free. Of 155 patients with a subsequently confirmed alternative condition, ultrasonography made the correct diagnosis in 140: bacterial ileocaecitis (69), mesenteric lymphadenitis (eight), gynaecological conditions (34), urological conditions (eight), caecal diverticulitis (six), perforated peptic ulcer (six), Crohn's disease (two) and miscellaneous conditions (seven). Of 139 patients in whom no definite diagnosis was made ultrasonography showed no abnormalities in 138. In four patients a false positive sonographic diagnosis of appendicitis was made and in two patients with appendicitis an alternative condition was incorrectly diagnosed. During the last 3 years of the study the negative appendicectomy rate was 7 per cent and delay beyond 6 h after admission occurred in only 2 per cent of patients with surgically proven appendicitis. When used to complement the clinical diagnosis ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and patient management in those suspected of having acute appendicitis. 
Proportionate mortality trends: 1950 through 1986 Mortality trends in the United States from 1950 through 1986 were analyzed for the conditions that are or have recently been among the six leading causes of death. The age-adjusted mortality rate for all causes has decreased from 841.5 to 541.7 per 100,000 population. Cause-specific, age-adjusted mortality rates have declined from 1950 through 1986 for cerebrovascular disease, injuries, perinatal conditions, heart disease, and influenza and pneumonia. Time trends in the proportion of persons dying of each of these diseases, however, have varied; the proportion dying of cerebrovascular disease, injuries, and perinatal conditions has decreased, and the proportion of persons dying of heart disease and influenza and pneumonia has remained fairly stable from 1950 through 1986. During this same time, age-adjusted death rates have increased for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and have remained fairly stable for malignant neoplasms, while the proportions of persons dying of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and malignant neoplasms have increased dramatically. For people aged 35 to 64 years, malignant neoplasms have now overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death. For those aged 65 years and older, heart disease remains the leading cause of death, accounting for almost 50% of all deaths in persons 85 years and older. 
Postsepsis bradycardia in children with leukemia. OBJECTIVE: We observed sinus bradycardia in a small number of children with hematologic malignancies who were recovering from sepsis. Our objective was to define this symptom complex and attempt to delineate its etiology. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A pediatric ICU in a children's oncology hospital. PATIENTS: Children admitted to the ICU over a 24-month period who developed persistent bradycardia (heart rate less than 5% for age for greater than 1 hr) after an episode of sepsis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven children developed postsepsis bradycardia. Six patients had a primary diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient had acute lymphocytic leukemia. All patients had positive blood cultures (Streptococcus mitis, n = 4; Escherichia coli, n = 2; and Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1). All seven children were clinically recovering from sepsis when the bradycardia developed. Neither hypotension nor other symptom was associated with the bradycardia. No therapy was given for the bradycardia. Echocardiograms and ECGs were normal in all patients, except for the presence of bradycardia. Bradycardia persisted for 24 to 72 hrs. After that time, heart rates slowly increased to the normal range for age. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that this syndrome may result from alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor function or an unidentified humoral factor produced by the invading organism or as part of the host's response to sepsis. Prior drug therapy or the underlying illness may predispose to this condition, since all the patients had acute leukemia. As the bradycardia was clinically insignificant, invasive therapeutic or diagnostic strategies were not indicated. 
The use of an intraluminal shunt for bypass grafts of the cavernous internal carotid artery. Technical note. The authors describe an indwelling intraluminal shunt for use during graft bypass procedures of the cavernous internal carotid artery. The clinical use of this shunt in a patient with meningioma invading the right cavernous sinus is described. This shunt has also been found applicable during carotid endarterectomy, and should prove to be a useful addition to the neurosurgical armamentarium for skull-base surgery. 
Exaggerated and prolonged thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) test responses in tertiary hypothyroidism. A 60 year old man with panhypopituitarism due to a large meningioma and prolonged and exaggerated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) responses is described. Initial investigations showed a subnormal urinary free cortisol concentration, a low serum cortisol taken at 0900 hours, and a low free T4 concentration. The TSH was towards the upper end of the normal range. Subsequently pituitary function tests showed subnormal production of luteinising hormone in response to luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) and a short synacthen test with a low 30 minute cortisol value. Long synacthen testing showed a normal response at four days, confirming that the abnormalities were due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause. A computed tomogram showed a large meningioma compressing the hypothalamus, pituitary, and temporal lobe. TRH testing showed a prolonged and exaggerated response, consistent with tertiary hypothyroidism. 
High energy neutron treatment for pelvic cancers: study stopped because of increased mortality. OBJECTIVE--To compare high energy fast neutron treatment with conventional megavoltage x ray treatment in the management of locally advanced pelvic carcinomas (of the cervix, bladder, prostate, and rectum). DESIGN--Randomised study from February 1986; randomisation to neutron treatment or photon treatment was unstratified and in the ratio of 3 to 1 until January 1988, when randomisation was in the ratio 1 to 1 and stratified by site of tumour. SETTING--Mersey regional radiotherapy centre at Clatterbridge Hospital, Wirral. PATIENTS--151 patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic pelvic cancer (27 cervical, 69 of the bladder, seven prostatic, and 48 of the rectum). INTERVENTION--Randomisation to neutron treatment was stopped in February 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patient survival and causes of death in relation to the development of metastatic disease and treatment related morbidity. RESULTS--In the first phase of the trial 42 patients were randomised to neutron treatment and 14 to photon treatment, and in the second phase 48 to neutron treatment and 47 to photon treatment. The relative risk of mortality for photons compared with neutrons was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.40 to 1.10) after adjustment for site of tumour and other important prognostic factors. Short term and long term complications were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS--The trial was stopped because of the increased mortality in patients with cancer of the cervix, bladder, or rectum treated with neutrons. 
Cardiovascular evaluation in blunt thoracic trauma using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Blunt chest trauma can result in significant cardiothoracic injury, which can include cardiac contusion, aortic injury, and myocardial valvular injury. Nineteen patients with no prior history of cardiac abnormalities who sustained severe blunt chest trauma and had widening of the mediastinum on chest radiographs were prospectively evaluated using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). In each instance TEE was performed without difficulty, excellent images were obtained of the aorta and heart, and no complications were noted. Abnormalities were seen in 12 (63%) patients, with hypokinetic regional wall motion consistent with cardiac contusion demonstrated in five (26%) patients. Tricuspid regurgitation was found in three (16%) patients, and aortic and mitral regurgitation in one (5%) patient each. Aortic wall hematomas were seen in two patients, one of whom had an intimal tear on aortography, and a pericardial effusion was seen in one patient with an aortic intimal tear confirmed angiographically. Thus TEE can be performed safely in the acute setting of patients sustaining severe blunt chest trauma and yield useful information with respect to cardiovascular function and the aorta. 
Treatment of voiding complaints and incontinence in painful bladder syndrome. The treatment of voiding complaints and incontinence in painful bladder syndrome requires careful attention to detail. As the exact nature of these conditions is unknown, no single modality is effective, and multiple treatments may be required. A sympathetic and supportive physician is necessary in all these cases. 
Listeriosis in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Although resistance to Listeria monocytogenes infection requires intact T cell-mediated immunity, only 20 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and listeriosis (including one patient described herein) have been reported to date. Listeriosis developed before AIDS in five cases. Syndromes included meningitis in nine cases, bacteremia in nine, brain abscess in one, and endocarditis in one. Eighteen patients were treated with ampicillin, penicillin, or amoxicillin with or without aminoglycosides. Clinical and microbiologic responses were obtained in one patient with bacteremia treated with vancomycin and in one patient with meningitis treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Three of the nine patients with meningitis died, as did the patient with brain abscess. All nine patients with bacteremia and the patient with endocarditis survived. No case of relapse was documented. L. monocytogenes, although uncommon, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile illness, meningitis, and brain abscess in patients with HIV infection. 
Management of hypertensive crises. The availability of potent antihypertensive drugs that will decrease markedly elevated blood pressure within minutes to hours has changed the concepts of definition and therapy of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. Intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside can be used in the truly emergent situation and is effective, reliable, and safe. While oral therapy is more convenient, it is not as consistently effective as parenteral administration and can lead to excessive reductions in blood pressure that are more difficult to manage than when short-acting agents are given intravenously. 
Postmortem studies of the heart in three fatal cases of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hearts of individuals who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan, with particular attention paid to the coronary arteries, the neural structures, and the conduction system of the heart because of reported terminal disturbances of cardiac rhythm and conduction. STUDY MATERIAL: Three hearts fixed in neutral formalin and well preserved with all the relevant areas of conduction system intact. METHODS: Light microscopic examination of subserial sections of the sinus node, atrioventricular node and His bundle, coronary chemoreceptor and regional nerves, ganglia, and small coronary arteries. Routine stains used were Goldner trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson. RESULTS: Arterial abnormalities were numerous and primarily of two types: focal fibromuscular dysplasia causing moderate to severe narrowing, as well as endarteritis and panarteritis. Extensive examples of neuritis and ganglionitis were present throughout the heart, including the conduction system, where arterial abnormalities were also abundant. In the coronary chemoreceptor there were both old and new lesions comprising focal inflammation with degeneration as well as older areas of fibrotic destruction. Within the sinus node, areas of dense fibrosis replaced all nodal tissue. These abnormalities were similar in nature and extent in all three hearts. CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic lesions present in the coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system of the heart in patients who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome provide a suitable anatomic substrate for substantial cardiac electrical instability, including the occurrence of sudden death. In cases of unexplained cardiac electrical instability or sudden unexpected death an inquiry should be made about previous use of L-tryptophan. In patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, the possibility of cardiac electrical instability should be considered as part of long-range clinical management. 
The use of an intraluminal shunt for bypass grafts of the cavernous internal carotid artery. Technical note. The authors describe an indwelling intraluminal shunt for use during graft bypass procedures of the cavernous internal carotid artery. The clinical use of this shunt in a patient with meningioma invading the right cavernous sinus is described. This shunt has also been found applicable during carotid endarterectomy, and should prove to be a useful addition to the neurosurgical armamentarium for skull-base surgery. 
Contemporary management of neurofibromatosis. The neurofibromatoses are two distinct entities with different genetic origins. The phenotypic expressions and required treatments are different. The devastating nature of neurofibromatosis-2 may be more effectively controlled through the application of advanced imaging techniques and contemporary neurotologic procedures. The most common manifestation of neurofibromatosis-2 is that of bilateral acoustic neuromas. The eventual total bilateral sensorineural deafness associated with this condition can be obviated in selected cases if the diagnosis is established early. Follow-up data are reported for three patients in whom hearing was preserved in at least one ear. When removal with hearing preservation is not possible, subtotal tumor removal with decompression of the internal auditory canals may delay progression of hearing loss. A new approach to tumors of the pterygomaxillary fossa that have extended to the middle cranial fossa has been successfully applied and is described. 
Sex cord tumor with annular tubules associated with endometriosis of the fallopian tube. Sex cord tumor with annular tubules (SCTAT) is a distinctive ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor. The authors describe a case of SCTAT arising outside the ovaries, in the fallopian tube. The authors are aware of only one other case of extra-ovarian SCTAT, in an umbilical hernia sac in an adult woman. The case reported was an incidental finding in a hysterectomy specimen, obtained because of carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix in a 32-year-old woman. The patient is alive and disease-free two years after surgery. The 1-cm tumor in the right fallopian tube was composed of typical ring-shaped tubules encircling hyalinized basement membrane-like material. In addition, glands and stroma of endometriosis were intimately admixed with the nests of tumor. The implications of these findings for the origin of SCTAT and ovarian sex cord structures are discussed. 
Clinical features and circulating gonadotropin, insulin, and androgen interactions in women with polycystic ovarian disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interactions of hyperinsulinemia and inappropriate gonadotropin secretion in women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD). DESIGN: Comparative study of endocrinologic parameters in subjects with PCOD. SETTING: Open patient clinic of reproductive endocrinology at University Central Hospital of Turku, Finland. PATIENTS: Fourteen nonobese and 10 obese patients with PCOD. Seven healthy women for reference data collection. Normal thyroid function, serum prolactin concentration, normal diurnal cortisol variation, euglycemia in all subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum concentrations of insulin, testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, sex hormone-binding globulin, immunoreactive luteinizing hormone (LH), bioactive LH, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). RESULTS: The concentration of insulin was higher and that of bioactive LH was lower in obese than in nonobese PCOD women in whom the levels were also above the upper reference value. There was a negative correlation between insulin and bioactive LH levels (r = -0.57). Bioactive LH correlated inversely with the body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.50). After eliminating the effect of the BMI, the correlation between bioactive LH and insulin was no longer significant (r = -0.37). The bioactive LH and immunoreactive LH/FSH ratio correlated significantly (r = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that hyperandrogenic women can be divided into two subgroups: those with insulin resistance, normal or minimally elevated LH, and markedly elevated insulin levels; and those with elevated LH levels, no insulin resistance, and normal insulin concentrations. Obesity is associated with the former, and high bioactive LH levels with the latter subgroup. 
Acute respiratory infections. During the past decade, recognition of the significance of pneumonia for childhood mortality has greatly increased. Etiologic studies have clarified the role of Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae as the pathogens most responsible for childhood pneumonia in developing countries. Case management intervention strategies using community health workers to identify cases of pneumonia by counting respiratory rate and observing chest indrawing have been shown to reduce ARI-related mortality. Although research is underway to develop more effective vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-type b H. influenzae, effective case management will remain the most realistic method of reducing mortality in the next decade. Important gaps remain in our understanding of the pathogenesis, etiology, and epidemiology of acute respiratory infections. Our understanding is complicated by the multiplicity of viral and bacterial agents and their interrelationships, by an abundance of interacting host risk factors, and by diverse social, cultural, and environmental factors. However, sufficient knowledge is available to support the implementation of the WHO case management intervention strategies, which will save the lives of the many children now dying because of pneumonia. 
Sclerotherapy of bleeding esophageal varices using a thrombogenic cocktail. The short- and long-term efficacy of a thrombogenic sclerosant (1% tetradecyl sulfate, thrombin, and cefazolin) was studied in 101 patients. The majority of patients had alcoholic cirrhosis with Child's C classification (84/101). Bleeding was controlled in 94 per cent of patients with the first sclerotherapy. In-hospital and early (within 6 weeks) mortality were 14 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. There was a strong correlation with hospital mortality and the severity of hepatic disease. Long-term follow-up in 70 patients (mean of 16 months) showed that survival correlated with compliance to follow-up sclerotherapy and abstention from further alcohol intake. Mortality in patients compliant with follow-up was 5 per cent (1/19), as compared with 24 per cent (12/51) in patients who were not compliant with follow-up sclerotherapy. The mortality in alcoholic cirrhotic patients who abstained from further alcoholic intake was 6 per cent (1/17), as compared with 23 per cent (10/44) in those who continued to abuse alcohol. No systemic thrombotic or allergic events related to the use of bovine thrombin were noted during a total of 349 sclerotherapy sessions. 
Compartment syndrome complicating prolonged use of the lithotomy position. Two patients with three postoperative calf compartment syndromes, which followed prolonged lithotomy positioning, will be presented. Potential physiologic mechanisms are described, and a review of current cases in literature are summated. 
Levels of morphine and metabolites in CSF during respiratory depression after intraventricular morphine injection. We report a case of respiratory depression after intracerebroventricular morphine administration of a dose inadvertently 10 times greater than the typical daily dose. At the time of the respiratory dysfunction, the concentrations of morphine and its metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples were determined. On comparison of these results with previous clinical studies in which there was no respiratory depression, no relationship was found between the occurrence of respiratory depression and the concentration of morphine or its metabolites in the CSF. The occurrence and characteristics of respiratory depression may be related to the concentrations of morphine and its metabolites in bulbar tissue. 
Vaginal adenosis and clear cell carcinoma after 5-fluorouracil treatment for condylomas. Vaginal adenosis and clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina occurred in a 44-year-old woman after treatment for condylomata acuminata. She had no known exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero. Biopsy-proven vaginal adenosis appeared 8 months after intravaginal 5-fluorouracil application for recurrent urogenital condylomata acuminata. Forty months later, biopsies showed residual adenosis with foci of clear cell adenocarcinoma. Although clear cell adenocarcinoma is associated with vaginal adenosis and cervical ectropion in DES-exposed women, its occurrence in adenosis after 5-fluorouracil therapy has not been reported to the authors' knowledge. In this report, this rare but serious complication of treatment of condylomata acuminata is highlighted, and the literature regarding the development of non-DES-associated vaginal adenosis is discussed. 
Study of brain electrolytes and organic osmolytes during correction of chronic hyponatremia. Implications for the pathogenesis of central pontine myelinolysis. Osmotic injury induced by rapid correction of severe chronic hyponatremia has been implicated in the development of central pontine myelinolysis. Organic osmolytes known previously as "idiogenic osmoles" accumulate intracellularly to protect cells from osmotic injury. We investigated the changes of these organic osmolytes as well as electrolytes in the brain during the induction and correction of chronic hyponatremia. Using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and HPLC, we found that in rats with chronic hyponatremia (3 d, serum sodium = 109 +/- 3 meq/liter), brain concentrations of myoinositol (41%), glycerophosphorylcholine (45%), phosphocreatine/creatine (60%), glutamate (53%), glutamine (45%), and taurine (37%) were all significantly decreased compared with control values (percentage control value shown, all P less than 0.01). The contribution of measured organic osmolytes and electrolytes to the total brain osmolality change was 23 and 72%, respectively. With rapid correction by 5% NaCl infusion, significant brain dehydration and elevation of brain Na and Cl levels above the normal range occurred at 24 h. These changes were not seen with slow correction by water deprivation. Reaccumulation of most organic osmolytes except glycerophosphorylcholine is delayed during the correction of hyponatremia and is independent of the correction rate of serum sodium. It is concluded that: most of the change of brain osmolality in chronic hyponatremia can be accounted by the changes in organic osmolytes and brain electrolytes; and rapid correction of hyponatremia is associated with an overshoot of brain sodium and chloride levels along with a low organic osmolyte level. The high cerebral ion concentrations in the absence of adequate concentrations of organic osmolytes may be relevant to the development of central pontine myelinolysis. 
Simulated aggressive skull base erosion in response to benign sinonasal disease. Benign sinonasal masses and slow-growing neoplasms tend to remodel the nasal vault and facial bones, and this is particularly true of nasal polyps and inverted papillomas. However, when such benign masses press against the floor of the anterior cranial fossa and the walls of the sphenoid sinuses, simulated aggressive bone destruction rather than bone remodeling usually occurs. This type of bone destruction implies to the radiologist that a carcinoma may also be present, and this information could dissuade a surgeon from operating with an attempt at cure. In fact, about 90% of the time with inverted papillomas and in virtually all cases of nasal polyposis, no carcinoma is present. The computed tomographic (CT) scans and magnetic resonance images of 14 patients are used to demonstrate these changes. In addition, the CT scans of three patients with malignancies are shown to illustrate the similarity in the bony skull base changes. 
Improved treatment results in boys with overt testicular relapse during or shortly after initial therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A Pediatric Oncology group study. Boys with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have overt testicular relapse (OTR) during initial continuation chemotherapy or within 6 months thereafter have poor outcomes, with long-term survival similar to patients with marrow relapse during treatment. In April 1983, the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) adopted for these patients an intensive treatment protocol (POG 8303) consisting of a four-drug systemic reinduction (prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and asparaginase), a brief intensive consolidation phase with teniposide and cytarabine, and a 2-year program of continuation chemotherapy with weekly rotating drug pairs (vincristine/cyclophosphamide and teniposide/cytarabine) with or without (by randomization) four-drug reinforcement pulses every 16 weeks. Bilateral testicular radiation (2600 cGy) was administered during reinduction, and intrathecal chemoprophylaxis was given every 4 to 6 weeks. Among 38 eligible study patients with OTR, 5 had prior or concominant extramedullary relapse in other sites. The median duration of complete remission before OTR was 27 months (range, 10 to 42 months). All 38 patients achieved clinical remission after reinduction. Three patients withdrew while in remission, 22 had another relapse (12 marrow, 5 central nervous system (CNS), 2 testicular, 1 retroperitoneal, 1 prostate, and 1 eye), and 13 (34%) remain in complete remission from 32+ to 74+ months after OTR (median, 53+ months). Eighteen patients had their therapy electively discontinued, and five relapses occurred thereafter. These results are superior to those observed in patients with first marrow relapse treated with the same protocol. Approximately one third of patients with OTR treated with POG protocol 8303 exhibit prolonged second remissions with the potential for cure. 
Confirmation of endosonographic detection of external anal sphincter defects by simultaneous electromyographic mapping. Anal endosonography was performed in 13 consecutive patients with post-traumatic faecal incontinence. Thirteen acoustic defects in the external anal sphincter (two hyperechoic, four of mixed echogenicity and seven hypoechoic) were analysed electromyographically by locating under ultrasound guidance the tip of a concentric needle within the defect. The electromyographic activity in this zone was compared with ultrasonically normal muscle. Eleven of 13 sonographic defects showed no electrical activity on electromyography, there was one technical electromyography failure, and one defect was too deep to be reached by the electromyography needle. The electromyographic response was normal in each case within ultrasonically normal muscle. Anal endosonography is recommended as the initial investigation to locate defects, which may be confirmed electromyographically thereby limiting the number of painful needle insertions required for complete mapping of the external anal sphincter. 
Spirochetes in atrophic skin lesions accompanied by minimal host response in a child with Lyme disease. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, which has rarely been observed in the United States, is a late skin manifestation of Lyme borreliosis. A 12-year-old girl who spent summers on Cape Cod presented with a 2-year history of hyperpigmentation and atrophy of the skin on the hands, wrists, and ankles. The skin biopsy specimen of an affected area showed mild dermal fibrosis, a few inflammatory cells, and spirochetes morphologically compatible with Borrelia burgdorferi. An IgG antibody response to B. burgdorferi could be elicited by immunoblotting, but not by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We conclude that this patient had chronic Lyme borreliosis manifested only by indolent infection of the skin. 
Deletional switch recombination occurs in interleukin-4-induced isotype switching to IgE expression by human B cells. There is controversy as to whether deletional rearrangement occurs between the IgM and IgE switch regions (S mu and S epsilon, respectively) during switching to the IgE isotype. We have addressed the issue by stimulating normal human B cells, sorted for lack of expression of surface IgE, to produce IgE by infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the presence of interleukin 4 (IL-4). Genomic DNA was amplified for S mu/S epsilon switch junction fragments by utilizing the nested-primer polymerase chain reaction. Switch junction fragments were amplified from B cells infected with EBV in the presence of IL-4 but not from B cells infected with EBV alone. The DNA sequence of these "switch fragments" revealed direct joining of S mu to S epsilon in each case. The recombination sites within S mu were clustered within 900 base pairs at the 5' end of the switch region, suggesting that there are "hot spots" for recombination within S mu. The S epsilon recombination sites were scattered throughout the S epsilon region. These findings indicate that IL-4-induced isotype switching to IgE production in human B cells is accompanied by DNA rearrangements with joining of S mu to S epsilon. 
Intercostal-to-pulmonary arterial anastomosis, complicated by high-output heart failure: case report. A patient who had high-output heart failure resulting from anastomosis of the intercostal and bronchial arteries to the right pulmonary artery is reported. The patient was a fifty-one year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with left heart failure. A radionuclide angiocardiogram revealed blood flow from the aorta to the right pulmonary artery. A descending aortogram revealed abnormally dilated right intercostal and bronchial arteries, which formed the anastomosis. The right pulmonary artery was visualized via that anastomosis. Tuberculous pleurisy in the patient's history was considered to be the cause of the anastomosis. The therapeutic procedure used was embolization via a catheter for the anastomosis, but most anastomoses could not be embolized. The present report is considered the first on anastomosis of the intercostal artery to the pulmonary artery to the extent that high-output heart failure occurs. 
Tissue plasminogen activator release and plasminogen activator inhibitor levels in coronary artery disease. Unstable angina and Q wave myocardial infarction are associated with intraluminal coronary thrombosis, a process to which impaired fibrinolysis may contribute. The authors examined the extrinsic fibrinolytic system, including tissue plasminogen activator antigen, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity and antigen, and euglobulin clot lysis time before and after venous occlusion in 56 patients undergoing coronary angiography for chest pain syndromes and in 16 healthy controls. Fibrinolysis variables were similar (with greater than 95% confidence) in the patients with thrombus-associated coronary syndromes as compared with those with chest pain syndromes not due to coronary thrombosis. These fibrinolytic variables were also similar to those in patients without coronary artery disease and in healthy controls. Their data suggest that defective fibrinolysis is not involved, at least systemically, in the pathogenesis of thrombus-associated coronary artery syndromes. 
Influence of allopurinol on cardiac complications in open heart operations. During cardiac operations, the heart is subjected to total ischemia and reperfusion, causing serious operative and postoperative complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and infarctions that may be partly due to free radical generation. Thus, allopurinol was tested to see if it could reduce cardiac complications during open heart operations. Ninety patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting were studied prospectively. Fortyfive patients were treated with allopurinol and 45 patients acted as controls. Treatment requiring arrhythmias in the allopurinol group was 6.6% compared with 33.3% in the control group (p less than 0.01). The percentage of patients requiring inotropes was significantly lower in the allopurinol group than in the control group (4.4% versus 26.6%; p less than 0.01). Perioperative myocardial infarction did not occur in the allopurinol group but was seen in 8 patients (17.7%) in the control group. Intraaortic balloon pumping was used in 5 control patients (11.1%) but not in the allopurinol group. This study shows that allopurinol decreases significantly the incidence of cardiac complications in open heart operations. 
Cerebral hemodynamics in ischemic cerebrovascular disease. During the past decade, technological advances have made it possible to measure regional cerebral hemodynamics in individual patients. Studies performed with these techniques have demonstrated that the degree of carotid stenosis correlates poorly with the hemodynamic status of the ipsilateral cerebral circulation. The primary determinant of cerebral perfusion pressure and blood flow under these circumstances is the adequacy of collateral circulatory pathways. Since collateral circulation varies from patient to patient, there is no critical degree of carotid stenosis that consistently produces hemodynamic compromise of the cerebral circulation. It is, thus, time to abandon the concept of the hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis as it relates to the pathogenesis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease. Measurements of regional cerebral hemodynamics have provided new insight into the pathogenesis of transient ischemic attacks and generated some preliminary data on the prognostic and therapeutic importance of chronic reductions in regional cerebral perfusion pressure. Further investigations into the importance of hemodynamic factors in ischemic stroke can now be based on accurate assessment of cerebral (not carotid or vertebrobasilar) hemodynamics in the context of other coexisting epidemiological, clinical, hematological, and angiographic risk factors. 
The impact of breast cancer on sexuality, body image, and intimate relationships. For women, breast cancer remains a common and dreaded experience. It is normal for a diagnosis of breast cancer to evoke grief, anger, and intense fear. Most women, however, face this crisis and master it without developing major psychiatric disorders or severe sexual dysfunction. The options of breast conservation and reconstruction give women a new sense of control over their treatment and are quite successful in helping women feel comfortable with their bodies again. The effectiveness of breast conservation and reconstruction in preventing or ameliorating sexual problems after breast cancer diagnosis is less clear, however. Any impact these options have on sexuality is subtle and may relate more to a woman's feelings of being desirable than to how often she has sex, her lovemaking practices, or how much she enjoys sex. We need more information on how chemotherapy and hormonal therapy affect women's sex lives. As clinicians, we should pay more attention to our patients' complaints of vaginal pain, dryness, and overall loss of sexual desire during systemic treatment. Practical advice on lovemaking techniques and a clinician's open attitude towards discussing sexual issues can prevent a great deal of anxiety and sadness as women with breast cancer search for ways to keep their sex lives satisfying. 
Natural anticoagulants in systemic lupus erythematosus. Deficiency of protein S bound to C4bp associates with recent history of venous thromboses, antiphospholipid antibodies, and the antiphospholipid syndrome. The association of thrombosis with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) could be due to their interference with natural phospholipid dependent anticoagulant mechanisms. We studied antigenic protein C (APC), functional protein C (FPC), free protein S (FPS), protein S bound to C4 binding protein (C4bp-S), antithrombin III (ATIII), as well as IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in 38 patients with SLE with a history of thromboses and 70 patients with SLE without such history. We found a high frequency of deficiencies of natural anticoagulants in both groups of patients with SLE but, because of patient selection, we could not determine the actual prevalence of these defects. Patients having had a venous thrombosis in the previous year had low C4bp-S more frequently than patients with older or no thromboses. When we divided our patients with SLE into those who had a definite, probable, questionable or no antiphospholipid syndrome (aPS) we found the frequency of C4bp-S deficiency to be significantly higher in those with definite aPS than in those without aPS. Intermediate proportions were found in patients with probable and questionable aPS. The levels of C4bp-S decreased as the levels of aCL, particularly IgG, increased. Stepwise discriminant analysis of natural anticoagulants selected deficiencies of C4bp-S and FPC with increased ATIII as a set of variables with highest predictive power for classification of patients with and without aPS. Thus, deficiencies of natural anticoagulants may occur frequently in patients with SLE. 
Parathyroid adenoma in a cancer center patient population. The association of parathyroid adenoma and antecedent events or relationships was examined retrospectively in 103 patients with parathyroid adenoma drawn from a cancer institute patient population. Patients were divided into two study groups by the referral pattern-intramural or community. The major contrast between the two groups was that the intramural patients had cancer diagnoses. The factors of advanced age, female gender, and prior regional irradiation appeared to be associated with the development of parathyroid adenoma. An interrelationship of incidental cancer and parathyroid adenoma, however, was not supported. Breast and differential thyroid cancers were most frequently associated with parathyroid adenoma, but age, gender, and irradiation were bias influences. 
Correlations between fibrinolytic function and acute myocardial infarction. The diurnal variation of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor--2 important factors in regulation of fibrinolysis--is well established, but its clinical implications are not yet fully understood. Fibrinolytic function was measured in a group of 133 patients less than 45 years of age, 3 months after they presented with myocardial infarction, and they were compared with an equal group of carefully matched control subjects. A sub-sample of 71 patients and 50 control subjects was examined 3 years later. Tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor plasma levels were higher in patients versus control subjects at 3 months and at 3 years after myocardial infarction, with a high degree of correlation between the 2 determinations (r = 0.87). Of all hemostatic parameters studied, only low tissue plasminogen activator activity and increased tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor levels were significantly different between patients with and without recurrent infarction during the 3-year period. In those patients with a second infarction greater than 3 years later, however, tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor concentration was not significantly related to reinfarction. 
Intractable heart failure despite angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics: long-term effectiveness of add-on therapy with pimobendan. In 25 patients whose chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) had recently worsened to New York Heart Association class IV, pimobendan (5 to 20 mg/day) was added to maximum conventional therapy consisting of digoxin, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, coumadin derivatives to prevent thromboembolic complications, and amiodarone to suppress serious ventricular rhythm disturbances. CHF was fatal in less than 1 month in five patients (two had shown some initial improvement). The other 20 had sustained improvement by at least one functional class, interrupted by episodes of CHF that usually responded to intravenous therapy. Median survival was 12 months (range 10 days to greater than 3 years); five patients died suddenly, 12 died of intractable CHF, and two died of other causes. Six patients were alive 3 years after the onset of treatment with pimobendan. Add-on therapy with pimobendan produced a sustained improvement in many patients with severe CHF that was no longer responding to a combination of digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. 
A successful murine model for contact sensitization to a sesquiterpene-alpha-methylene-gamma-butyrolactone: sensitization to alantolactone in four strains of mice. Induction of allergic contact hypersensitivity to a sesquiterpene lactone, alantolactone, was studied in four strains of mice: C3H/He, DBA/2, Balb/b, and Balb/c. The last three were successfully sensitized. A significant dose/response was demonstrated in these species, as well as an experimental "overload effect" in Balb/c and Balb/b strains. Histologic studies confirmed the allergic nature of the reaction. From the overall results, alantolactone can be considered a moderate sensitizer in mouse as well as in guinea pig. This study shows that the murine model can be used for experimental contact sensitization with moderate allergens, without the use of Freund's adjuvant for induction. 
Lumbar regional anaesthesia and prophylactic anticoagulant therapy. Is the combination safe? A survey has been carried out in all Danish anaesthetic departments (n = 80) regarding the attitude towards the use of epidural/spinal lumbar analgesia in patients who were receiving prophylactic anticoagulant therapy for the prevention of thromboembolism. About 60% of the departments used the techniques in patients receiving low-dose heparin and no side effects had been experienced. Spinal and epidural anaesthesia were in general regarded as being contraindicated in patients fully anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists. In the world literature, the attitude towards the combination is conflicting. No randomised trial has been performed and complications are almost entirely confined to patients fully anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists. Only one case of an epidural haematoma has been recorded when subcutaneous low-dose heparin was used as thromboprophylaxis. 
Eyelid necrosis and periorbital necrotizing fasciitis. Report of a case and review of the literature. Necrotizing fasciitis is an uncommon and severe soft tissue infection characterized by cutaneous gangrene, suppurative fasciitis, and vascular thrombosis. The disease is usually preceded by trauma in patients that have systemic problems, most commonly diabetes and alcoholism. Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are the most frequent bacterial etiologies; however, combinations of numerous facultative and anaerobic organisms have also been isolated. Involvement of the face and periocular region is rare. A case is presented here, as well as a review of the clinical features of 15 other patients previously described, in whom eyelid necrosis due to periorbital necrotizing fasciitis developed. Early surgical debridement and drainage of necrotic tissues and appropriate parenteral antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy. The mortality rate in patients with periorbital spread was 12.5%, with the prognosis known to be adversely affected by delay in diagnosis and treatment and/or extension of infection from the face to the neck. Reconstruction of the eyelids with skin grafts was necessary in most cases to avoid such complications as cicatricial lid retraction, lid malpositions, and lagophthalmos. 
Relative kindling effect of detoxification and non-detoxification admissions in alcoholics. We reviewed the histories of 340 men and 60 women who were admitted for alcohol detoxification to determine if hospitalizations unrelated to detoxification increased the prevalence of seizures observed in these patients. Previous investigations on this cohort suggested that recurrent detoxification admissions increased the probability of seizure histories. Detoxification and non-detoxification hospitalizations were calculated from patient reports and chart reviews on patients admitted for alcohol detoxification. Discriminant analysis of each type of hospitalization and total hospitalizations for each sex revealed an increased risk of seizure activity correlating with non-detoxification hospitalizations, but the correlation was weaker than that observed for detoxification admissions and for total admissions. This correlation between hospitalizations and seizure prevalence supports the hypothesis that recurrent alcohol withdrawal may have a kindling effect. 
Effects of protein size on the rate of import of the precursors of aldehyde dehydrogenase and ornithine transcarbamylase into rat liver mitochondria. It is known that a signal peptide is required for the import of a protein into mitochondrial matrix. It is also known that a signal peptide can be attached to any protein and allow it to be imported. We recently reported that the rate of import of rat liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor was slower than that of ornithine transcarbamylase precursor (Wang TTY, Farres J, and Weiner H. Arch Biochem Biophys 272, 440-449, 1989). It was not known if the difference in the rate of import was related to the fact that the mature portion of aldehyde dehydrogenase is larger (500 amino acids compared with 322 amino acids) or because the signal peptides were different. We further showed that treatment of the mitochondria with alcohols caused an inhibition of the import of the precursor of aldehyde dehydrogenase but not that of ornithine transcarbamylase. In the present study we constructed chimeric proteins that contained the signal peptide from one precursor protein and the mature portion from the other. We found that the rate of import was related to the overall size of the precursor protein. Consistent with this observation was finding that a truncated aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor, which contained 317 amino acids, was imported more rapidly than was the authentic precursor. Consistent with this finding was the fact that butanol caused the inhibition of only the large precursor proteins. Thus, it appears that size of the protein being imported is a major determinant of the rate at which a precursor protein is imported into mitochondria. 
Orthotopic cardiac transplantation in two patients with previous malignancy. This report presents 2 patients with previous malignancy in whom congestive cardiomyopathy developed secondary to doxorubicin toxicity. Both patients underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation 3 and 5 years ago and are now in functional class I with no evidence of malignant recurrence. 
Weight-loss experience of black and white participants in NHLBI-sponsored clinical trials. We examined race-specific weight-loss results from two randomized, multicenter trials; the Hypertension Prevention Trial (HPT) and the Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP). Mean weight change from baseline averaged 2.2 kg less in black women than in white women during 18 mo of follow-up in TOHP and 2.7 kg less during 36 mo of follow-up in HPT. Mean weight loss averaged 2.0 kg less in black than in white men in TOHP and 1.4 kg less in HPT. Because of greater weight gain in black control subjects, a comparison of net weight loss (change in intervention minus change in control participants, within-race) showed a less marked difference than did black-white differences in weight loss within the actively treated group. Thus, relative to weight that would have been gained without the intervention, the experience of blacks and whites was more similar. Racial differences in weight loss may result from a combination of behavioral, sociocultural, biological, and programmatic factors. 
Angioscopically directed valvulotomy: a new valvulotome and technique. Despite a large experience with "blind" retrograde valvulotomy in in situ vein bypass grafting, the incidence of residual competent valves remains high, and valvulotome-induced injury is common. In this study we describe a new valvulotome and technique of angioscopically directed valvulotomy and review the video tape recordings of 85 completion angioscopies of in situ femorodistal bypasses. Fifty-three vein grafts were prepared with the blind retrograde valvulotomy technique and 32 vein grafts with the new valvulotome and angioscopy. The use of the new valvulotome and technique is compared with that of the standard blind retrograde valvulotomy technique, and the normal endoluminal anatomy and incidence of primary disease in saphenous vein grafts was noted. The incidence of valvulotome-induced injury was 5/32 (15.6%) and 45/53 (85%) in vein grafts prepared with angioscopically directed valvulotomy and blind retrograde valvulotomy, respectively. Residual competent valves were found in 10/53 (18.9%) in blind retrograde valvulotomy and 0/25 of angioscopically directed valvulotomy vein grafts (p = 0.0114). In 22/53 vein grafts unsuspected primary disease was detected. Angioscopically directed valvulotomy with the new valvulotome and technique is feasible, reliable, and safe. It avoids residual competent valves, minimizes valvulotome-induced injury, and allows the detection and correction of unappreciated primary vein graft abnormalities. The new valvulotome and technique is a first step in the complete endoluminal preparation of the in situ vein graft. 
Predictors of death from aortic aneurysm among middle-aged men: the Whitehall study. Among 18,403 male civil servants examined at age 40-64 years there were 99 deaths attributed to aortic aneurysm during 18 years of follow-up. Each case was matched by age to ten controls who survived longer than the case. The risk of all types of fatal aneurysm was substantially increased for current smokers of manufactured cigarettes (rate ratio compared with lifelong non-smokers = 6.5; 95 per cent confidence interval 2.3-18.7), pipe or cigars (6.7; 1.7-26.5) and hand-rolled cigarettes (25.0; 7.5-83.3). Diastolic blood pressure was strongly associated with dissecting aneurysm (rate ratio per 10 mmHg increase = 2.4; 95 per cent confidence interval 1.7-3.2) and abdominal aneurysm (1.5; 1.2-1.9) but not other aneurysms (1.0; 0.7-1.5). The independent effects of height, adiposity, plasma cholesterol, glucose intolerance, reported angina and intermittent claudication were not significant. Hypertension and smoking, particularly of hand-rolled cigarettes, are confirmed as major and potentially remediable risk factors for fatal aortic aneurysm. 
Endothelial cell seeding. Endothelial cell seeding is a technique that has developed over the past 15 years in response to the need for a high performance synthetic vascular graft. This review details our present knowledge of seeding and examines the various problems that have hampered its introduction into clinical practice. 
Smoking and hypertension: risk factors for carotid stenosis. The prevalence of smoking, hypertension and diabetes mellitus was assessed in 221 patients suffering from internal carotid stenosis and compared with the prevalences in two sex- and age-matched control groups composed of subjects having normal Doppler findings and from non-neurological outpatients. Of the subjects with carotid stenosis 27.6% were hypertensive smokers in comparison with 9.5% and 17.2% in the two control groups. The difference of the stenosis cohort from the two control groups was significant (P less than 0.01 and P = 0.016 respectively). There was no statistically significant differences between the occurrence of diabetes and hypertension in non-smokers and patients who smoked. In 394 investigated patients suffering from carotid stenosis or occlusion an obstruction index, based on the Doppler shift frequency, was calculated. This index was lowest in the normotentive non-smokers. It was only insignificantly higher in the hypertensive non-smokers but significantly so in the normotensive smokers. The index was highest in the hypertensive non-smokers. It was concluded that cigarette smoking, especially if associated with hypertension, is a determinant risk factor for carotid stenosis and occlusion. 
Frequency of abnormal sphincter of Oddi manometry compared with the clinical suspicion of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Patients with pancreaticobiliary pain or idiopathic pancreatitis have been classified as having definitive (type I), presumptive (type II), or possible (type III) sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) based on clinical, laboratory, and ERCP data. This study was undertaken to determine the frequency of abnormal sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) when patients are classified by this system. Two hundred and thirteen patients with pancreaticobiliary pain were evaluated clinically; SOM, ERCP, and ductal contrast drainage time tests were performed. For biliary types I, II, and III, the frequency of abnormal SOM was 85.7%, 55.1%, and 28.1%, respectively. Similarly, for pancreatic types I, II, and III, an elevated basal sphincter pressure occurred in 92.3%, 58.2%, and 35.1%, respectively. When patients with an abnormal basal sphincter pressure were characterized by the magnitude of the elevation, the manometric profiles were similar for types I, II, and III. These data suggest that elevated sphincter pressure occurs more frequently in type III patients than previously reported, and supports consideration of SOM when evaluating and treating type II and type III patients. 
Gastroesophageal reflux, as measured by 24-hour pH monitoring, in 509 healthy infants screened for risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Continuous long-term esophageal pH monitoring has become the preferred test to quantify acid gastroesophageal reflux. Because reflux to a limited extent is physiologic, the determination of optimal thresholds to separate normal from abnormal reflux is mandatory. Esophageal pH was measured during 24 hours in 509 healthy thriving infants, aged 3 days to 1 year, using a glass microelectrode with an external reference electrode connected to a portable recorder. Percentiles of the four parameters studied (reflux index or percent of the investigation time with a pH less than 4, number of episodes with a pH less than 4 during 24 hours, number of episodes lasting greater than 5 minutes, the duration of the longest episode (in minutes) are presented. A percentile curve of the reflux index regarding the age distribution shows that the normal range for the reflux index during the first 12 months of life is about 10% (95 percentile), decreasing from 13% at birth to 8% at 12 months. Application of an age-related percentile curve offers a close-to-reality possibility of data interpretation and illustrates that there is inevitably an overlap of data between normal and abnormal populations, because reflux is a phenomenon occurring to some extent in every human being. 
Abnormal hormonal and renal responses to saline load in hypertensive patients with parental history of cardiovascular accidents. BACKGROUND. Acute cardiac and cerebrovascular accidents are more frequent in hypertensive subjects with a family history of acute vascular accidents. The mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to vascular disease in these subjects are unknown. We investigated whether a parental history of premature heart attack or stroke in hypertensive subjects is associated with abnormalities of sodium handling. METHODS AND RESULTS. Patients with mild, uncomplicated essential hypertension were divided into two subgroups according to family history: a subgroup with a parental history of premature heart attack or stroke (FV+, n = 18) and a subgroup with a family history completely negative for vascular accidents (FV-, n = 14). The two subgroups were comparable with respect to age, weight, sex distribution, blood pressure, duration of hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, renal function, and organ damage. Baseline plasma renin activity (PRA), concentrations of aldosterone (PA), atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and norepinephrine, and urinary electrolyte excretion were also comparable in the two subgroups. Despite these similarities, the responses to an acute saline load, measured under controlled metabolic and experimental conditions, were different in the two subgroups. In the FV+ subgroup at 60 minutes of saline load, PRA fell by 1.0 +/- 0.2 ng/ml/hr and PA concentration by 89.4 +/- 26 pg/ml and ANF concentration increased by 38 +/- 9 pg/ml, whereas in the FV- subgroup the corresponding responses were -2.3 +/- 0.3 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.005), -190 +/- 43 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), and 80 +/- 13 pg/ml (p less than 0.005), respectively. Urinary sodium excretion was delayed in the FV+ subgroup (270 +/- 67 mu eq/min at 60 minutes) compared with the FV- subgroup (555 +/- 157 mu eq/min at 60 minutes, p less than 0.05). At 120 minutes of saline load, significant (p less than 0.005) differences in PRA and ANF concentration were still observed. In a control group of eight normal subjects the responses to a saline load were comparable to those in the FV- subgroup but greater than those in the FV+ subgroup at 60 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. These results provide evidence that the hormonal and renal adjustments to an acute salt load are impaired in hypertensive patients with a parental history of vascular accidents. We speculate that abnormalities of sodium handling may represent markers of a more rapid development of vascular injury in human hypertension. 
Total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthrosis in patients who have Paget disease of bone at the knee. Thirteen patients who had had sixteen total knee arthroplasties for pagetic gonarthrosis were followed for a mean of seven years (range, two to fifteen years). Involvement of the femur or tibia with Paget disease was associated with multiple technical difficulties at operation and with a final position in suboptimum varus or valgus alignment (ten limbs) or suboptimum alignment of the mechanical axis (nine limbs). The presence of bone with Paget disease did not affect the amount of blood lost during the operation, the postoperative course, or the rate of loosening of the prostheses. At the most recent evaluation, nine patients had no pain, three had mild pain, and one had moderate pain. The mean Knee Society pain score improved from 42 points preoperatively to 88 points and the mean functional score, from 33 to 86 points. 
Management of traumatic injuries to the facial nerve. Penetrating and nonpenetrating trauma to the head and neck produces myriad injuries to the facial nerve. This article presents a rationale of management of neural injury, emphasizing extracranial and intratemporal trauma and techniques of neurorrhaphy. 
Anterior plate fixation in spine tumor surgery. Indications, technique, and results. Anterior decompression by vertebrectomy is now well established as the procedure of choice to optimize neurologic recovery in patients with a deficit due to tumor involvement of the vertebral body. Fifteen patients with tumor involvement of the cervical or thoracic spine and neurologic deficit were treated by single-stage anterior decompression and AO plate stabilization. No patient suffered neurologic deterioration after surgery. All patients with thoracic lesions who were unable to walk on presentation and who managed to survive their primary disease improved to a level that allowed independent ambulation with a frame. There were no problems, such as loss of fixation or deformity. It is concluded that standard AO plates provide adequate stabilization of the cervical and thoracic spine after vertebrectomy for tumor involvement. 
PAF-induced bowel necrosis. Effects of vasodilators. Ischemic bowel necrosis in the rat is produced by injecting platelet-activating factor (PAF) intravenously. Since intestinal hypoperfusion is observed after PAF injection, we hypothesize that mesenteric vasoconstriction is the mechanism of bowel injury. We thus studied the effects of vasodilators in this model. We found that: (1) Phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615 (leukotriene antagonist) and PGE1 counteracted the PAF-induced mesenteric flow reduction and ameliorated the bowel injury. However, phenoxybenzamine and prazosin were relatively ineffective in correcting PAF-induced hypotension, showing that bowel injury can be prevented independently of the hypotensive state. (2) Nitroglycerin failed to prevent bowel injury, although it improved the mesenteric blood flow. Thus, in opposition to our initial hypothesis, correction of the mesenteric flow reduction induced by PAF does not always prevent intestineal necrosis. (3) Only phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615, and PGE1 ameliorated PAF-induced hemoconcentration and bowel injury. This suggests a correlation between vascular injury (expressed by "leaky" vessels and the consequent hemoconcentration) and bowel necrosis. (4) Although both nitroglycerin and hydralazine relax smooth muscle, hydralazine seemed to aggravate bowel necrosis. The mechanism remains unclear. 
Benign intrinsic tectal "tumors" in children. A specific group of intrinsic dorsal midbrain tumors was identified in six children by computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Each patient presented with raised intracranial pressure as a result of hydrocephalus due to obstruction of the sylvian aqueduct. No patient had brain-stem signs referable to the tectal tumor initially or subsequently. All six children underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversionary procedures. The radiological features were consistent and specific, with all patients showing tectal calcification or primary increased attenuation of the tectal plate on CT scans. In addition, lack of contrast enhancement was noted initially in four patients and eventually in all six patients. In all patients MR imaging showed a focal tectal tumor distorting the collicular plate with no cystic component and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. There has been no evidence of progression in these six patients in the follow-up period ranging from 8 months to 17 years (8 months and 2 1/2, 4 1/2, 8, and 17 years). Diversion of CSF has been the only surgical treatment and no patient underwent deep x-ray therapy. Five patients have had normal intellectual development. In contrast to the majority of previously described periaqueductal and tectal tumors, this group of lesions appeared to be truly benign. The authors suggest that patients presenting with these clinical and radiological features may be managed by CSF diversion, serial examination, and MR imaging. 
Appearance of thrombosis-inducing activity in the plasma of patients undergoing pulmonary resection. Thrombosis-inducing activity (TIA) was detected in the peripheral blood of patients with lung cancer who had undergone pulmonary resection. TIA was examined by intravenously injecting plasma from the patients into BALB/c mice. The plasma containing TIA induced multiple thromboses in the lung and caused the mice to die 3 to 30 minutes after injection. The subjects were 19 patients whose plasma contained no TIA before operation. TIA was detected in 5.3 percent (1/19) on the first postoperative day (POD), 47.4 percent (9/19) on the seventh POD, 47.1 percent (8/17) on the 14th POD, 26.7 percent (4/15) on the 21st POD, and 20 percent (2/10) on the 28th POD. Plasma fibrinogen levels and peripheral platelet counts increased postoperatively and reached a maximum on the seventh and 14th POD, respectively. Peripheral blood with TIA had a significant elevation of plasma fibrinogen levels and platelet counts as compared to that without TIA. These observations suggest that TIA is present in blood in a hypercoagulable state in patients after pulmonary resection. Since tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1 are known to induce hypercoagulable states both in vitro and in vivo, we tried to determine whether it was possible to detect both cytokines in blood indicated as hypercoagulable state by the presence of TIA. They did not, however, reach detectable levels in the blood. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma, alcohol, and cirrhosis: facts and hypotheses. Despite the epidemiological evidence of a correlation between ethanol abuse and hepatocellular carcinoma, some of the results of experimental and clinical studies remain controversial. Apart from inducing cirrhosis, which may be viewed as a precancerous liver lesion, ethanol may act as a cocarcinogen. Most investigations on this topic have focused on two aspects: ethanol's capacity to induce the cytochrome P-450-dependent microsomal biotransformation system and its interference with at least one DNA repair mechanism. Ethanol exposure enhances the capacity of mixed function oxidases to activate many chemical carcinogens, such as dimethylnitrosamine (DMN). On the other hand, ethanol exposure fails to influence DMN-induced liver carcinogenesis. The capacity of alcohol to inhibit DMN-demethylase activity has not been clearly demonstrated in experiments carried out with human tissue. In conclusion, both the effects of ethanol and their underlying mechanisms as regards liver carcinogenesis are open to debate. The link between ethanol abuse and hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be mediated mainly by its capacity to induce cirrhosis. 
Finger tremor after carbon disulfide-based pesticide exposures. Index finger tremor accompanying voluntary movement was studied in 19 age-matched control subjects and in 19 grain industry employees chronically exposed to carbon disulfide-based fumigants. Visual judgments of tremor amplitude made by neurologists during clinical examinations equaled the sensitivity of computerized tremor amplitude measurements. Tremor frequency variations detectable only with computerized measurement were present in grain workers with and without increased tremor amplitudes. Frequency differences discriminated between normal subjects and 74% of the grain workers. The distribution of tremor frequency power in the grain workers was often sequestered at 5 to 7 Hz, reminiscent of tremor in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest that the measurement of subtle tremor frequency changes may provide an early indication of chronic carbon disulfide poisoning. 
Chronic diarrhea. A practical approach for the pediatrician. Despite the high prevalence of chronic diarrhea there is no universal approach to its diagnosis and treatment. This article summarizes the pathophysiologic processes that result in chronic diarrhea and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this often distressing problem. 
Long-term complications of polyurethane-covered breast implants. The authors's personal experience using an earlier manufactured polyurethane-covered gel prosthesis is presented. Very long-term follow-up did not validate the author's initial enthusiasm. It is to be hoped that the newer polyurethane-covered implants will give more satisfactory long-term results. 
Transformed mammalian cells are deficient in kinase-mediated control of progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. To investigate the role of kinase-mediated mechanisms in regulating mammalian cell proliferation, we determined the effects of the general protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine on the proliferation of a series of nontransformed and transformed cultured rodent and human cells. Levels of staurosporine as low as 1 ng/ml prevented nontransformed cells from entering S phase (i.e., induced G1 arrest), indicating that kinase-mediated processes are essential for commitment to DNA replication in normal cells. At higher concentrations of staurosporine (50-75 ng/ml), nontransformed mammalian cells were arrested in both G1 and G2. The period of sensitivity of nontransformed human diploid fibroblasts to low levels of the drug commenced 3 hr later than the G0/G1 boundary and extended through the G1/S boundary. Interference with activity of the G1-essential kinase(s) caused nontransformed human cells traversing mid-to-late G1 at the time of staurosporine addition to be "set back" to the initial staurosporine block point, suggesting the existence of a kinase-dependent "G1 clock" mechanism that must function continuously throughout the early cycle in normal cells. The initial staurosporine block point at 3 hr into G1 corresponds to neither the serum nor the amino acid restriction point. In marked contrast to the behavior of nontransformed cells, neither low nor high concentrations of staurosporine affected G1 progression in transformed cultures; high drug concentrations caused transformed cells to be arrested solely in G2. These results indicate that kinase-mediated regulation of DNA replication is lost as the result of neoplastic transformation, but the G2-arrest mechanism remains intact. 
Lineage-restricted clonality in biphasic solid tumors. Cytogenetic analysis of two pulmonary chondroid hamartomas and nine breast adenofibromas revealed clonal chromosome aberrations in both hamartomas and in four breast tumors. To determine lineage of the cells with chromosome aberrations, a combined immunohistochemical/cytogenetic approach was developed that enabled simultaneous ascertainment of cytogenetic aberrations and immunohistochemical features in individual cells. Immunohistochemical/cytogenetic evaluation of one hamartoma and two adenofibromas demonstrated that neoplastic proliferation, in each case, was confined to the mesenchymal (stromal) component, whereas epithelial cells appeared to be reactive. Cytogenetically abnormal short-term cultures of the remaining hamartoma and another of the breast adenofibromas were composed entirely of mesenchymal elements, indicating mesenchymal clonality in those tumors as well. Our findings support redesignation of pulmonary chondroid hamartomas as 'pulmonary chondromas' and suggest that carcinomas developing within fibroadenomas arise from reactive epithelial proliferation. Combined immunohistochemical/cytogenetic analysis might be useful in the development of novel therapeutic approaches that selectively target neoplastic populations within solid tumors. 
Instability of a 550-base pair DNA segment and abnormal methylation in fragile X syndrome. The fragile X syndrome, a common cause of inherited mental retardation, is characterized by an unusual mode of inheritance. Phenotypic expression has been linked to abnormal cytosine methylation of a single CpG island, at or very near the fragile site. Probes adjacent to this island detected very localized DNA rearrangements that constituted the fragile X mutations, and whose target was a 550-base pair GC-rich fragment. Normal transmitting males had a 150- to 400-base pair insertion that was inherited by their daughters either unchanged, or with small differences in size. Fragile X-positive individuals in the next generation had much larger fragments that differed among siblings and showed a generally heterogeneous pattern indicating somatic mutation. The mutated allele appeared unmethylated in normal transmitting males, methylated only on the inactive X chromosome in their daughters, and totally methylated in most fragile X males. However, some males had a mosaic pattern. Expression of the fragile X syndrome thus appears to result from a two-step mutation as well as a highly localized methylation. Carriers of the fragile X mutation can easily be detected regardless of sex or phenotypic expression, and rare apparent false negatives may result from genetic heterogeneity or misdiagnosis. 
Lichen planus and mesalazine. Lichen planus is a recognized complication of sulfasalazine therapy. Two patients developed typical oral and cutaneous lichen planus on sulfasalazine and their skin lesions recurred when they were subsequently changed to mesalazine. Lichen planus only resolved on withdrawal of both drugs. It seems likely that the aminosalicylic acid moiety is responsible for this reaction and that lichen planus is a true complication of mesalazine therapy. 
Bacteremia in febrile patients. A clinical model for diagnosis. Among 244 patients aged 18 to 98 years who were consecutively hospitalized in a department of internal medicine because of a febrile disease, 52 (21%) were bacteremic. On a logistic regression analysis, five variables known within 24 hours of admission were found to be associated both significantly and independently with bacteremia: low serum albumin level, low premorbid performance status, chills, renal failure, and an assumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection on admission. The logistic model was used to divide patients into three groups. In group 1, the percentage of bacteremic patients was 5%, in group 2, 40%, and in group 3, 83%. The percentage of deaths in the three groups was 0%, 23%, and 50%, respectively. The model was validated in a second group of 257 patients. The percentage of bacteremia was 1% in group 1, 23% in group 2, and 65% in group 3. The death rate in three groups was 3%, 4%, and 35%, respectively. The accuracy of the attending physician in diagnosing bacteremia within 24 hours of hospitalization was compared with that of the model. Use of the model could have improved the diagnostic accuracy in 5% of the patients in group 1 and in 18% of patients in group 3. 
Pharmacologic roles of heparin and glucocorticoids to prevent restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Restenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is the major clinical problem limiting the long-term efficacy of this treatment for coronary atherosclerosis. Recent advances in the understanding of the biology of restenosis indicate that intimal hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells is the predominant cause for restenosis. Therefore, therapeutic agents that inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation should be candidate drugs to prevent restenosis. Heparin has documented antiproliferative effects on smooth muscle cells, and the availability of low molecular weight heparins that lack anticoagulant properties makes them ideal agents. Glucocorticoids have wide effects on inflammatory and wound healing events and inhibit smooth muscle cell growth in culture and in animal models of arterial injury. Recent laboratory data suggest that combination therapy with both low molecular weight heparin and hydrocortisone may be a powerful treatment regimen to limit restenosis. 
Haemodynamic interactions of muscle relaxants and sufentanil in coronary artery surgery. The haemodynamic interactions between sufentanil (S) and muscle relaxants (MR) were studied in 40 ASA physical status III or IV patients (four groups of ten) scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (ABG). Group I received pancuronium (P) 0.08 mg.kg-1, Group II received vecuronium (V) 0.1 mg.kg-1, Group III received atracurium (A) 0.5 mg.kg-1 and Group IV metocurine 0.1 mg.kg-1 plus pancuronium 0.02 mg.kg-1 (M-P). Sufentanil, 20 micrograms.kg-1 was administered before sternotomy, 10 micrograms.kg-1 being injected before tracheal intubation and 10 micrograms.kg-1 afterwards. Heart rate (HR), ECG leadII and V5, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial and pulmonary blood pressures, central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (W) were measured and recorded at the time of seven strategic events between the pre-induction of anaesthesia period and sternotomy. Cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistances (SVR) were also measured before induction of anaesthesia and after the administration of S 10 micrograms.kg-1 plus the MR. The HR decreased from baseline values in the post-tracheal intubation period in all groups except in P group. The mean arterial pressure also decreased significantly in all groups except in the P group. The CO did not change from baseline values but SVR decreased in all groups. There was no evidence of new myocardial ischaemia according to the ECG monitoring and there was no significant difference in the HR changes between patients who had or who had not received beta-blockers in any group. We conclude that within the present study conditions and design, HR and blood pressure changed least with pancuronium. 
Coronary artery vasoregulation and left ventricular function in patients with angina pectoris-like pain and normal coronary angiograms. Twenty patients with angina pectoris-like pain, normal coronary angiography and abnormal exercise 201Tl scans were investigated by means of haemodynamic, coronary sinus blood flow and lactate determinations before and after cold provocation, pacing and dipyridamole infusion. Radionuclide angiography, a new exercise 201Tl scan and noninvasive hyperventilation and ergonovine tests were performed. Intracoronary infusions of acetylcholine were given in increasing doses and a second coronary angiogram in combination with a 201Tl scintigram was performed. Despite a previously pathological 201Tl scintigram, with reversible perfusion defects, only ten of the patients had reversible perfusion defects at the second investigation. Hyperventilation and ergonovine tests did not result in ECG signs indicative of coronary spasm. Intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine resulted in a diffuse coronary constriction in 3 of 14 patients, and in one patient a perfusion defect was observed on thallium scintigram. In conclusion, although most of the common methods for inducing coronary vasospasm were used, no consistent pattern of reaction was found to explain the chest pains experienced in this group of patients. 
Atrial natriuretic peptide-induced relaxation of pre-constricted isolated rat perfused lungs: a comparison in control and hypoxia-adapted animals. 1. To further understand the vasodilator actions of atrial natriuretic peptide and its role in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, we studied the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide in the isolated perfused rat lung during normoxic ventilation and after elevation of pulmonary artery pressure by either hypoxic ventilation or infusion of prostaglandin F2 alpha. Control animals were compared with littermates that had become adapted to a 10% O2 environment for 3 weeks. Atrial natriuretic peptide was compared with atriopeptin I and atriopeptin III in order to study its structure-activity relationship. 2. Five experiments, each involving six control and six chronically hypoxic rats, were performed. During normoxic ventilation, atrial natriuretic peptide (30 ng-3 micrograms) produced a dose-dependent reduction in pulmonary artery pressure in chronically hypoxic rats, but had no action in the control animals. 3. Atrial natriuretic peptide dose-dependently abolished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction to a greater extent in chronically hypoxic rats (EC50 98 ng) than in control rats (EC50 298 ng; P less than 0.001). Bolus atrial natriuretic peptide (100 ng) produced a plasma concentration of 22.6 pmol/l at 1 min, which is within the pathophysiological range. Initial plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels were 9.4 pmol/l in control animals and 27.4 pmol/l in chronically hypoxic rats. 4. Chronically hypoxic rats were more sensitive to atriopeptin I, atriopeptin III and atrial natriuretic peptide than were the control rats (P less than 0.05). Atrial natriuretic peptide and atriopeptin III were equipotent and were 10 times more potent than atriopeptide I in both groups (P less than 0.001). 
Midazolam improves electrophysiologic recovery after anoxia and reduces the changes in ATP levels and calcium influx during anoxia in the rat hippocampal slice. Since blockers of excitatory transmission have been shown to reduce anoxic and ischemic neuronal damage, augmentation of inhibitory transmission by agents such as midazolam might have a similar protective effect. Rat hippocampal slices were maintained in vitro and used to determine whether and by what mechanism midazolam improves recovery of evoked responses after anoxia. The Schaffer collateral pathway in the slice was stimulated electrically, and an extracellular potential, the evoked population spike, was recorded from the CA1 pyramidal cells, which are postsynaptic. The slices were made anoxic by substituting artificial cerebrospinal fluid aerated with 95% nitrogen-5% carbon dioxide for fluid aerated with 95% oxygen-5% carbon dioxide. Percentage recovery was expressed as the amplitude of the evoked population spike 60 min after anoxia divided by its preanoxic amplitude. Protection in this model is defined as a significant (P less than 0.05) improvement in percentage recovery compared to the recovery of untreated slices. There was no recovery of the response recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells after 5 min of anoxia (4 +/- 2%) (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]). Slices were treated with midazolam 10 min before, during, and 10 min after anoxia. Midazolam (1 microM) did not enhance recovery after anoxia when dissolved either in water (3 +/- 3%) or in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (1 +/- 1%). A higher concentration of midazolam (100 microM) did enhance recovery when dissolved in DMSO (27 +/- 7%) but not when dissolved in water (5 +/- 2%). To test whether prolonged pretreatment with midazolam dissolved in water would enhance recovery, slices were treated for 30 min prior to anoxia. 
Selective microscopic examination of gallbladders, hernia sacs, and appendices. The usefulness of many "routine" medical procedures is being challenged in the health care atmosphere of today. This study was undertaken to determine the utility of routine microscopic pathologic examination of three frequently submitted surgical specimens. Pathology reports of 39,568 consecutive specimens, 17,105 appendices, 14,654 hernia sacs, and 7,809 gallbladders, submitted over a 49-year period, were reviewed. Microscopic examination of these tissues detected few unexpected findings. In those instances in which unexpected findings were discovered the primary surgery was curative or additional surgery would not have altered the prognosis. When careful, thorough gross examination by the surgeon and pathologist failed to disclose significant abnormalities or confirmed obvious disease such as inflammation, microscopic examination of these tissues might have been eliminated without a change in patient outcome. Although it could be argued that this microscopic pathologic correlation may be helpful for quality control and/or feedback of surgical decision making, the data indicate that gross examination alone may be sufficient in most cases, since unexpected microscopic findings are rare. The indications for microscopic examination of appendices, hernia sacs, and gallbladders are listed. Substantial savings of resources and time may be expected when selective microscopic examination is used. 
Deletions within the pseudoautosomal region help map three new markers and indicate a possible role of this region in linear growth. Short stature is consistently found in individuals with terminal deletions of Xp. In order to refine the localization of a putative locus affecting height, we analyzed two patients with a partial monosomy of the pseudoautosomal region at the molecular level. Eight pseudoautosomal probes were used for the genetic deletion analysis through dose evaluation. Three of them represent new markers (DXS415, DXS419, and DXS406) which were positioned on the pseudoautosomal map by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Our data suggest that a locus affecting height maps in a region of about 1.5 Mbp, distal to the DXS406 locus and proximal to the DXS415 locus, a region which includes two CpG islands, and rule out an involvement of very distal sequences at the X/Y telomeres. 
Sleep apnea in acromegaly. OBJECTIVE: To provide information on the nature, prevalence, and severity of sleep apnea in patients with acromegaly. DESIGN: Consecutive case series. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients with acromegaly were consecutively referred: 33 patients were referred because of clinical suspicion of sleep apnea and 20 patients were referred without suspected apnea. MEASUREMENTS: Sleep studies as well as growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) measurements were done. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (93%; 95% Cl, 85% to 100%) referred because of suspicion of sleep apnea had sleep apnea compared with 12 patients (60%; Cl, 37% to 83%) referred without suspected sleep apnea. Patients with sleep apnea did not have biochemical evidence of increased disease activity (random growth hormone, 12.7 +/- 4.4 micrograms/L; mean growth hormone at 24-hour sampling, 10.8 +/- 8.4 micrograms/L; IGF-1, 90.0 +/- 7.5 nmol/L) compared with patients without sleep apnea (random growth hormone, 14.2 +/- 4.9 micrograms/L, P greater than 0.2; mean growth hormone, 12.4 +/- 3.5 micrograms/L, P greater than 0.2; IGF-1, 90.0 +/- 10.0 nmol/L, P greater than 0.2). Central sleep apnea was the predominant type of apnea in 33% (Cl, 18% to 47%) of patients and was associated with higher random growth hormone and IGF-1 levels than was obstructive apnea (random growth hormone, 23.4 +/- 3.9 compared with 8.8 +/- 3.1 micrograms/L, P less than 0.001; IGF-1, 126 +/- 17.5 compared with 72.5 +/- 7.5 nmol/L, P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep apnea is common in acromegaly. The rate of central sleep apnea was unexpectedly high in patients with acromegaly, and biochemical evidence of increased disease activity was associated with the presence of central apnea rather than with the degree of sleep apnea. Altered respiratory control is a possible mechanism producing sleep apnea in acromegaly. 
Paraganglioma of urethra. Paraganglioma of the urethra is a rare tumor; only 4 cases have been reported previously. We report a fifth case of urethral paraganglioma and review the literature. 
Localization of metallothionein in hair follicles of normal skin and the basal cell layer of hyperplastic epidermis: possible association with cell proliferation. Metallothionein is a low-molecular-weight metal-binding protein. Although it is inducible by a variety of agents and ubiquitously present in many tissues, its physiologic functions are still not clear. The present study was undertaken to determine the possible functions of metallothionein in both the proliferation and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Metallothionein was detected immunohistochemically in hair matrix cells of the bulb and cells of the outer root sheath of anagen hair follicles, but not in dermal papillae in normal skin in the back of mice. In hyperplastic epidermal tissue, induced by either a phorbol ester tumor promoter or cholera toxin, the basal cells of the interfollicular epidermis stained strongly for metallothionein. Elevated expression of mRNA of the metallothionein gene was also demonstrated when the skin was stimulated by agents that induced hyperplasia. Papillomas produced by two-stage carcinogenesis protocols also stained for metallothionein. These observations suggest that metallothionein is involved in the proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes. 
Hemostatic wrapping of ruptured liver in two postpartum patients. A variety of surgical techniques with variable success rates have been reported in the management of the spontaneously ruptured liver in pregnancy. We managed two cases of postpartum ruptured liver by wrapping the liver in hemostatic material. Hemostatic encapsulation effectively controlled massive bleeding of ruptured livers in two postpartum patients. 
Middle ear adenoma: tumour of mixed mucinous and neuroendocrine differentiation. Two cases of progressive hearing loss due to middle ear tumours are described. The histological characteristics numbered intraluminal mucin production and neuroendocrine features, as shown by argyrophilia and ultrastructural demonstration of dense core granules. These tumours have been known by many different names, reflecting the controversies relating to their presumed histogenesis and differentiation. The currently preferred designation is middle ear adenoma, and these two cases provide further evidence for dual lines of differentiation. 
Suture technique affects perianastomotic colonic crypt cell production and tumour formation. Suture line recurrence is an important cause of failure after potentially curative resection for colonic carcinoma. Our aim was to determine whether suture technique affected the incidence of perianastomotic tumours in experimentally induced colonic cancer. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups. A 1 cm longitudinal colotomy was repaired with four interrupted 6/0 polypropylene monofilament sutures, using either a transmural technique (n = 18) or a seromuscular technique (n = 18). Control animals (n = 18) had a sham laparotomy. All animals received nine, weekly, subcutaneous injections of azoxymethane (total dose 90 mg/kg) starting 6 weeks after laparotomy. Surviving animals were killed 32 weeks after laparotomy. Five animals from each group were given intraperitoneal bromodeoxyuridine (100 mg/kg) 1 h before being killed. At death, perianastomotic tumours occurred more frequently in animals with transmural sutures than in either controls or those with seromuscular sutures. This difference was associated with a greater mucosal bromodeoxyuridine crypt cell labelling index in the transmural suture group. We conclude that a transmural anastomotic suture technique promotes the development of experimental perianastomotic colonic tumours. 
Recurrent deletion in the human antithrombin III gene. Eight unrelated patients with recurrent thromboembolism, a family history of thrombosis, and plasma antithrombin III (ATIII) activity/antigen levels consistent with a diagnosis of heterozygous type I ATIII deficiency were studied by polymerase chain reaction/direct sequencing of ATIII gene exon-coding regions. Frameshift mutations of one base and two bases, respectively, were found to have occurred in two unrelated patients at the same GAG codon (Glu 245) within exon 4 of the ATIII gene. A literature search showed six further hitherto unrecognized deletion "hotspots" in four other human genes. These deletion-prone sites exhibited sufficient sequence homology with each other to derive a consensus sequence (T G A/G A/G G A/C), suggesting that deletion in human genes may not only be non-random but also sequence-directed. 
Detection of polyadenylated RNA in hepatitis B virus-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells by polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a reverse transcriptase step characterized a specific transcription activity in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in two patients (1 and 2) with chronic hepatitis positive for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBc). Patient 1 was also coinfected with human hepatitis delta virus. A patient who cleared HBV replication after antiviral treatment with vidarabine served as negative control. HBV-specific RNA poly A sequences were detected by PCR in PBMC of patients 1 and 2 even without detectable HBV DNA (patient 2) as shown by dot blot and PCR assays. RNA sequences were found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The demonstration of HBV mRNA sequences within PBMC suggests the transcription of viral DNA, in agreement with the findings of HBV surface antigen in PBMC. The results in patient 1 demonstrated HBV mRNA sequences in leukocytes even without PCR-detectable HBV DNA sequences, likely due to ongoing hepatitis delta virus replication. 
Gold weight lid load as a secondary procedure. This paper discusses the use of gold weight lid load as a secondary procedure. By using three representative patients, I emphasize the following points: First, the dominance of the eye must be determined so that postoperative changes in the eyelid height can be anticipated. Second, in order to obtain an accurate weight of the implant needed, the restrictive effect on the eyelid from the previous surgery (a tarsorrhaphy or an encircling band) must first be eliminated. Third, to ensure the best result and the patient's comfort, lacrimal function, Bell's phenomenon, and levator function must be assessed. 
Effect of intracoronary diltiazem on infarct size and regional myocardial function in the ischemic reperfused canine heart This study was designed to investigate whether intracoronary diltiazem given before reperfusion could enhance myocardial salvage in the canine heart. Twenty-five dogs were subjected to 90 min of coronary occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion. The dogs were assigned to one of three experimental groups. The early diltiazem group received intracoronary diltiazem into the distal coronary bed at the onset of coronary occlusion and for 60 min after reperfusion. The late diltiazem group received the same amount of drug beginning 15 min before reperfusion and the control group received saline solution for 90 min of occlusion and 60 min of reperfusion. Infarct size expressed as a percent of the area at risk was significantly smaller in the early and late diltiazem groups (15.6 +/- 3.6% and 21.2 +/- 5.1%, respectively) than in the control group (49 +/- 4.6%) (p less than 0.05). Intracoronary diltiazem restored systolic function of the stunned, previously ischemic tissue to essentially normal preocclusion values. Segmental shortening after reperfusion averaged 21.6% in the early diltiazem group versus 0 +/- 1.7% and 7.3 +/- 4% for the control and late diltiazem groups, respectively (p less than 0.05). Low dose intracoronary diltiazem did not alter hemodynamic variables or myocardial blood flow but did improve segmental shortening 2 and 6 h after reperfusion. These data indicate that intracoronary diltiazem given during occlusion or just before reperfusion increases the salvage of myocardium compared with the salvage achieved by reperfusion alone. These results also suggest that intracoronary diltiazem given during the ischemic period enhances systolic contractile function of postischemic stunned myocardium. 
Influence of the site of tumor growth on the capacity of a low tumorigenic line of Friend erythroleukemia cells to differentiate. Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLC) passaged in mice are highly tumorigenic and multiply extensively in the livers of suckling DBA/2 mice without differentiating. In contrast, in vitro passaged FLCs injected intravenously were of low tumorigenicity, multiplied to a limited extent in the livers of suckling mice, and underwent marked differentiation from the proerythroblast to the orthochromatic erythroblast stage in the liver. The presence of characteristic C-type virions budding from the cell surface in various stages of erythroid differentiation served as a marker of the injected FLCs. When the same in vitro passaged FLCs that differentiated in the liver were injected subcutaneously in suckling mice, they formed large subcutaneous tumors consisting of sheets of undifferentiated tumor cells. It is concluded that the tumorigenicity of FLCs depended on the site of tumor growth and that there is an inverse correlation between the tumorigenic capacity and the capacity to differentiate. 
Gallstone fragmentation during biliary lithotripsy: effect of stone composition and structure. In vitro lithotripsy with the Siemens Lithostar was conducted on 36 radiolucent or minimally calcified gallstones housed in an anthropomorphic phantom. The ease and pattern of fragmentation were correlated with global composition for the entire stone, regional or microcomposition (determined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy), and microstructure (determined by scanning electron microscopy). Stones made up of more than 62% cholesterol required 50% more shock waves to pulverize all fragments to 0.3 cm or less than did stones of less than 62% cholesterol (p less than .01). An inverse relationship was found between the number of shock waves needed for fragmentation and the cholesterol content (r = .77). Although a broad range of fragmentation responses occurred, little variation was seen in the ease of fragmentation within stone families. The majority of stones fractured along radially oriented cholesterol plates, but one third of stones treated showed initial chipping or flaking at the periphery before radial fracture. This type of peripheral erosion most often occurred in stones with peripheral pigment rims. These stones required more shock waves and lagged in pulverization compared with more homogeneous cholesterol stones. The efficiency of fragmentation during biliary lithotripsy correlates with the stones' global cholesterol content. A stone's architecture, as reflected by its regional composition and microstructure, partially predicts the mechanism of fragmentation. These in vitro data may be useful in further refining criteria for selecting patients and understanding the fragmentation process. 
Prognostic value of raised prostatic acid phosphatase and negative skeletal scintigraphy in prostatic cancer. Of 438 consecutive cases of newly diagnosed prostate cancer, 178 (41%) had skeletal metastases (T0-4 M1) at the time of diagnosis according to skeletal scintigraphy; 139 men had serum prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) greater than twice the upper limit of normal on 2 separate occasions at the time of diagnosis and 65% of them had metastases on bone scan. However, 49 men with normal bone scans were found to have similarly raised serum PAP. (Such patients are defined as having skeletal metastases in the current Medical Research Council immediate versus deferred orchiectomy study and stratified accordingly). The actuarial survival of this group was calculated by life table methods and was compared with that of 2 other subgroups: those patients having metastases demonstrated on bone scan, and those patients having both normal bone scans and normal serum PAP. The survival of the "metastatic by acid phosphatase" group was significantly better than that of the "metastatic by bone scan" group but did not differ from that of patients having both normal scans and PAP. For patients with no scintigraphic evidence of skeletal metastases at diagnosis, those with a raised PAP were at a significantly greater risk of scan conversion, although this was more powerfully predicted by high histological grade. 
Cancer occurrence in a cohort of patients surgically treated for peptic ulcer. A cohort of 4107 patients treated surgically for peptic ulcer between 1955 and 1960 was followed up to determine the incidence of cancer by record linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. A total of 930 cases of cancer were observed during 76,634 person-years. Relative risks of cancer were computed by comparison with the recorded cancer incidence in the Danish population. During the first five years after surgery the relative risk of gastric cancer was slightly increased (RR = 1.43), but 5-15 years after the operation the risk was lower than expected (RR = 0.55). Thereafter, the relative risk of gastric cancer increased steadily and increased more than twofold after 25 years. Lung cancer occurred more frequently in the cohort members than expected (RR = 1.66), but the relative risk was independent of time since surgery. Malignancies other than gastric cancer and cancers related to tobacco smoking were close to the expected numbers. The results do not support the findings of a recent British study of similar size in which increased risks were reported for cancer at other sites. 
Proteinase trapping: screening for viral proteinase mutants by alpha complementation. Many virally encoded proteinases cleave themselves out of a polyprotein, with cleavage occurring usually at their own N terminus. This property was used to develop an in vivo screening system using the lacZ gene fragment of M13mp18. When a fusion protein of the alpha fragment of beta-galactosidase and an active 2A proteinase of human rhinovirus 2 was expressed, alpha complementation was not affected, as the 2A proteinase cleaved itself off the alpha fragment. However, fusion of an inactive 2A prevented alpha complementation, as the 2A polypeptide remained fused to the alpha fragment. After random mutation of the 2A gene by PCR amplification, mutants were screened; M13 phage defective in alpha complementation were obtained at an efficiency of 5% and were shown to contain mutated 2A genes. Intermolecular cleavage was then examined by expressing an alpha fragment-inactive proteinase fusion protein as substrate for an active 2A proteinase expressed from an M13 vector. alpha complementation indicated intermolecular processing of the 2A cleavage site on the alpha fragment-inactive proteinase fusion protein. This versatile system thus allows the high-density screening of both active and inactive proteinase mutants, cleaving either intramolecularly or intermolecularly, and should be applicable to other proteinases of high specificity. 
Excimer laser ablation of fibrocartilage: an in vitro and in vivo study. To date, lasers have found only limited applications in orthopedics. We employed a 308 nm XeCl excimer laser for ablation of fibrocartilage, in order to investigate the feasibility of excimer laser assisted meniscectomy. Experiments were conducted both in vitro and in vivo. For the in vitro study, human menisci, obtained during surgery and autopsy, were irradiated via a 600 microns core fiber at radiant exposures ranging between 20 mj/mm2 and 80 mj/mm2, at 20 Hz. Ablation rate measurements and histological analysis of the samples were performed. The ablation rates were found to range from 3 microns/pulse to 100 microns/pulse depending on the radiant exposure and/or the applied pressure on the fiber delivery system. Thermographic analysis was also performed during pulsed excimer as well as CW Nd:Yag and CW CO2 laser irradiation. Temperatures were lower for excimer laser (Tmax less than 65 degrees) than CW ND: Yag (Tmax less than 210 degrees) or CW CO2 (Tmax less than 202 degrees) laser. For the in vitro study, medial meniscectomy was performed in 15 rabbits with the excimer laser and a CW Nd:Yag laser in the right and left knee respectively. Excimer laser irradiation was performed at 70 mj/mm2. Nd:Yag irradiation was performed via a 600 microns core fiber at power outputs between 20 to 40 W for 10 and 20 seconds duration. The healing response to injury was investigated by histological analysis of the menisci after 1 day, 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks following the laser procedure. Excimer laser treated menisci showed less inflammatory reaction and noticeable repair with minimal inflammatory response. 
Palliation of malignant tracheal strictures using silicone T tubes. The use of silicone T tubes for intubation of malignant tracheobronchial strictures may provide some degree of palliation of this distressing condition. It was used in seven patients with malignant lesions and two with benign strictures (resulting from tracheal trauma and lung transplantation). Four patients (two with cancer) are still alive and well with the tube in position. All patients noted improvement in dyspnoea and stridor. The main problems were tube migration (one patient), tracheo-oesophageal fistula (one patient), and blockage of the tube by tumour (two patients) or encrusted secretions (three patients). Airway patency was restored when the tube was blocked by cleaning or by laser resection of the tumour. With careful supervision and education of the patient intubation can give useful palliation to patients with distressing upper airways obstruction. 
The effect of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy on the upper urinary tract. A total of 66 patients with low grade, low stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who were treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) underwent cystourethrography to detect vesicoureteral reflux. BCG was instilled weekly for 6 weeks and monthly thereafter for up to 24 months. Whenever vesicoureteral reflux was found or morphological abnormalities were detected on excretory urography (IVP) an isotope renal scan was performed to evaluate the relative renal function. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in 13 patients (19.7%): 10 had grades 1 and 2A, and 3 had grade 2B reflux. The number of BCG instillations ranged from 8 to 22. IVPs were normal in 11 patients. In 2 patients mild unilateral dilatation was present before BCG instillations, and this remained unchanged during and after therapy. None of the 13 patients with vesicoureteral reflux had IVP features suggestive of urinary tuberculosis. In 11 patients the refluxing renal systems had normal relative renal function (50 to 55%). Two patients had a decrease to 40% of the relative renal function with normal IVPs, suggesting a nonBCG related cause. We conclude that BCG therapy is safe in patients with minimal reflux. 
Intraoperative evaluation of intestinal ischemia: a comparison of methods. Methods for evaluating intestinal ischemia include standard clinical criteria, Doppler ultrasonography, and intravenous fluorescein injection. Each has disadvantages, and a combination of methods is often used. The purpose of this study was to determine whether surface oximetry could be used to assess perfusion in an animal whose intestinal diameter approximates that of infants. Reversible arterial, venous, and arteriovenous occlusion was studied in rabbit intestines. After 6 to 8 hours of occlusion, intestinal vascularity was evaluated by the four methods listed. Doppler ultrasonography and surface oximetry were found to be unreliable tools for assessing perfusion in this animal model. We conclude that standard clinical criteria and fluorescein remain the standards for intraoperative evaluation of intestinal perfusion. 
Ventricular tachycardia with congenital ventricular diverticulum. A 24-year-old man presented with symptomatic, recurrent, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). He was found to have a basal inferior left ventricular diverticulum. His sustained VT was reproduced by programmed electrical stimulation and was unresponsive to procainamide, tocainide, propafenone, and flecainide. Endocardial mapping followed by resection and cryoablative surgery was performed. The patient had only one recurrence after 18 months, with subsequent control with procainamide for over 14 months. 
Clinical parameters predictive of malignancy of thyroid follicular neoplasms. Needle aspiration biopsy is commonly employed in the evaluation of thyroid nodules. Unfortunately, the cytologic finding of a "follicular neoplasm" does not distinguish between a thyroid adenoma and a follicular cancer. The purpose of this study was to identify clinical parameters that characterize patients with an increased risk of having a thyroid follicular cancer who preoperatively have a "follicular neoplasm" identified by needle aspiration biopsy. A total of 395 patients initially treated at Vancouver General Hospital and the British Columbia Cancer Agency between the years of 1965 and 1985 were identified and their data were entered into a computer database. Patients with thyroid adenomas were compared to patients with follicular cancer using the chi-square test and Student's t-test. Statistically significant parameters that distinguished patients at risk of having a thyroid cancer (p less than 0.05) included age greater than 50 years, nodule size greater than 3 cm, and a history of neck irradiation. Sex, family history of goiter or neoplasm, alcohol and tobacco use, and use of exogenous estrogen were not significant parameters. Patients can be identified preoperatively to be at an increased risk of having a follicular cancer and accordingly appropriate surgical resection can be planned. 
Metabolic markers of stress-induced myocardial ischemia. The human heart in the fasting state extracts free fatty acids (FFA), glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and ketones from circulating blood. The utilization of FFA accounts for most of the oxygen consumed and energy produced at rest. Patients with angiographically demonstrable coronary artery disease and stable angina pectoris have a resting myocardial metabolism similar to that of normal individuals. During atrial pacing in normal persons, there is a significant enhancement of glucose uptake but that of FFA is unchanged, and the oxidation of carbohydrates accounts for more than 60% of the energy produced. In patients with stable angina, myocardial perfusion becomes regionally inadequate during stress. Despite the increase of myocardial glucose utilization, carbohydrate oxidation is negligible. Pyruvate will not be oxidized but in the presence of increased amounts of reduced coenzymes will be reduced to lactate. In addition, a greater amount of alanine will be released by the myocardium through the transamination of pyruvate, with a concomitantly greater uptake of glutamate that serves as the NH2 donor. In addition, glutamate may be used as an anaerobic fuel through conversion to succinate coupled with GTP formation. Although coronary hemodynamics, including myocardial perfusion, return to baseline within a few minutes after stress, a longer time course is needed for myocardial metabolism to become normal. In particular, myocardial utilization of exogenous glucose remains higher well after the normalization of hemodynamic parameters. This is more pronounced in postischemic myocardium, but it also occurs in nonischemic muscle, and glucose is presumably used for rebuilding glycogen stores that were depleted during ischemia. 
Orthotopic liver transplantation for incurable alveolar echinococcosis of the liver: report of 17 cases. Between 1986 and 1989, orthotopic liver transplantations were performed in our unit for 17 patients with incurable alveolar echinococcosis. Ten patients had hilar involvement (group I), and seven patients had posterior localization (five of them had chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome) (group II). The delay between diagnosis and the orthotopic liver transplantation was more than 48 mo in group Ia (six patients), less than 24 mo in group Ib (four patients) and less than 48 mo in group II. Previous operations were more common in group Ia than in group Ib and II. Five patients have died-four in group I and one in group II. The actuarial survival rate at 15 mo was 75%. Early reoperations were frequent (69%), mainly caused by rebleeding. Bacterial and fungal infections occurred only in group Ia (four cases) and group II (three cases). In eight patients (palliative group), residual foci of infected nonhepatic tissue occurred after surgery. The titer of specific antibodies decreased during the first 3 mo in all the patients but one. In patients with radical liver transplantation, the complete disappearance of specific antibodies occurred within 2 yr in four cases. In the remaining five patients, specific antibodies remained detectable, but no evidence of recurrence has been obtained up to now. In the palliative group, a peak of specific IgM occurred at 3 mo; an increase of specific IgG was observed later. The growth of residual parasitic foci was relatively slow, and all these patients remained asymptomatic with a mean follow-up of 19 mo. We conclude that orthotopic liver transplantation is feasible in incurable alveolar echinococcosis and could be proposed without delay to patients with parasitic Budd-Chiari syndrome or complicated secondary biliary cirrhosis. In the other cases, the best time to perform an orthotopic liver transplantation is more difficult to determine. Nevertheless, in the perspective of an orthotopic liver transplantation, the management of these patients has to change, and repetitive laparotomies for palliative surgical procedures have to be replaced by interventional radiology. 
Avoiding the blanket approach to insomnia. Targeted therapy for specific causes. A systematic approach to the common complaint of insomnia usually results in a specific clinical diagnosis with clear therapeutic implications. Use of effective treatment strategies tailored to the situation can make treating insomnia a gratifying experience instead of a frustrating one. 
Transformation of T lymphocytes by the v-fos oncogene. Activation of T lymphocytes through the T cell antigen receptor has been shown to stimulate a rapid and transient accumulation of c-fos mRNA and protein. Transfection of a normal murine T lymphocyte clone with the FBJ-v-fos oncogene resulted in generation of a cell line that was morphologically transformed, had lost the requirement for IL-2 for proliferation, and was tumorigenic in adult syngeneic mice; however, the transformed cells retained the ability to proliferate in response to IL-2. The transformed cells did not show constitutive expression of IL-2 or c-fos mRNA, although the promoter regions of both IL-2 and c-fos genes contain AP-1 sites that are expected to be targets for binding of Fos/Jun complexes. In contrast, the transformed T cells showed increased constitutive expression of IL-2R alpha and c-myc mRNA; these genes may represent cellular targets for transformation by v-fos and physiologic activation by c-fos. We discuss the possibility that these transformed cells behave as cells partially activated through the TCR, and that transformation occurs through a mechanism independent of IL-2. 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Treatment of choice for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Our initial experience with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for symptomatic cholelithiasis has involved 152 patients. Patient age ranged from 17 to 83 years; most were female (78%). Their average weight was 170 pounds (range, 75 to 365 lbs.). Twenty-two per cent had a single gallstone, while 9% had two to three stones and 64% had more than three stones. Exclusion criteria initially included upper abdominal scarring, severe acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and inability to tolerate general anesthesia. The first two of these are now only relative contraindications with increased experience. Thirteen of the one hundred fifty-two procedures (8.5%) required conversion to an open operation. Average time of operation was 138 minutes. Intraoperative cholangiography was attempted in 78% of cases and was completed successfully in 66% of those attempted. There have been no deaths. The complication rate has been low: 4% major, 0% life-threatening, and 7.2% minor complications. Postoperative analgesic requirements are remarkably low: 36% of patients required no narcotics after leaving the recovery room. Eighty-seven per cent of patients successfully undergoing LC were discharged by the first postoperative day. Most patients resumed normal activities within 1 week after discharge. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy offers the majority of patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis an improved treatment option, resulting in significantly less postoperative pain, hospitalization, and recuperation time. 
Sucralfate versus antacids or H2-antagonists for stress ulcer prophylaxis: a meta-analysis on efficacy and pneumonia rate. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Histamine2 (H2)-receptor antagonists and antacids have been the basic drugs for the prevention of stress bleeding in ICU patients during the past decade. Recently, drugs without major influence on gastric pH have been investigated in stress bleeding prophylaxis. Therefore, a meta-analysis (Mantel-Haenszel test) was undertaken to determine the efficacy of sucralfate in the prevention of macroscopically visible stress bleeding, as well as the influence of sucralfate on the frequency of pulmonary infections. RESULTS: The efficacy of sucralfate was compared with H2-antagonists in nine studies and with antacids in eight studies. Sucralfate was significantly more effective than H2-antagonists (typical odds ratio 0.532, 95% confidence interval 0.303 to 0.933) and equally as effective as antacids (typical odds ratio 0.868, 95% confidence interval 0.452 to 1.667). The pneumonia rates of those patients who were administered sucralfate were compared with the rates of those patients who were given H2-antagonists in five studies and with those patients who were given antacids in four studies. Pneumonia was a significantly more frequent occurrence under prophylaxis with H2-antagonists (typical odds ratio 0.498, 95% confidence interval 0.316 to 0.783) as well as with antacids (typical odds ratio 0.402, 95% confidence interval 0.235 to 0.687). CONCLUSION: Sucralfate is an effective drug for the prevention of stress bleeding that minimizes the risk of nosocomial pneumonia in long-term ventilated ICU patients. 
Helicobacter pylori infection and the risk of gastric carcinoma BACKGROUND. Infection with Helicobacter pylori has been linked with chronic atrophic gastritis, an inflammatory precursor of gastric adenocarcinoma. In a nested case-control study, we explored whether H. pylori infection increases the risk of gastric carcinoma. METHODS. From a cohort of 128,992 persons followed since the mid-1960s at a health maintenance organization, 186 patients with gastric carcinoma were selected as case patients and were matched according to age, sex, and race with 186 control subjects without gastric carcinoma. Stored serum samples collected during the 1960s were tested for IgG antibodies to H. pylori by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data on cigarette use, blood group, ulcer disease, and gastric surgery were obtained from questionnaires administered at enrollment. Tissue sections and pathology reports were reviewed to confirm the histologic results. RESULTS. The mean time between serum collection and the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma was 14.2 years. Of the 109 patients with confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma (excluding tumors of the gastroesophageal junction), 84 percent had been infected previously with H. pylori, as compared with 61 percent of the matched control subjects (odds ratio, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 7.3). Tumors of the gastroesophageal junction were not linked to H. pylori infection, nor were tumors in the gastric cardia. H. pylori was a particularly strong risk factor for stomach cancer in women (odds ratio, 18) and blacks (odds ratio, 9). A history of gastric surgery was independently associated with the development of cancer (odds ratio, 17; P = 0.03), but a history of peptic ulcer disease was negatively associated with subsequent gastric carcinoma (odds ratio, 0.2; P = 0.02). Neither blood group nor smoking history affected risk. CONCLUSIONS. Infection with H. pylori is associated with an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and may be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of this malignant condition. 
Differential effects on right ventricular function of transient right, left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary occlusions during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Right ventricular function was studied by means of a thermodilution catheter before, during and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the proximal right (group 1, n = 8), left anterior descending (group 2, n = 8) or left circumflex (group 3, n = 8) coronary artery. All patients had evidence of myocardial ischemia, with single-vessel disease affecting the proximal segment of one of the three major coronary arteries; no patient had had a previous myocardial infarction and all had normal cardiac function at baseline study. Cardiac index decreased during balloon inflation. Mean pulmonary artery pressure was unaffected in group 1 but increased in group 2 (from 19 +/- 5 to 31 +/- 11 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and in group 3 (from 19 +/- 2 to 22 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Right ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 62 +/- 9% to 52 +/- 10% (p less than 0.01) in group 1 and from 64 +/- 7% to 44 +/- 10% (p less than 0.005) in group 2, and returned to normal within 2 min after balloon deflation in both groups. In group 3, right ventricular ejection fraction was unchanged during balloon inflation (58 +/- 5% at baseline, 58 +/- 9% at 60 s, p = NS). Therefore, brief occlusion of the proximal segments of the left anterior descending or right coronary artery results in marked alteration of right ventricular performance that is probably caused by right ventricular free wall ischemia in the right coronary group and by the concomitant effects of septal ischemia and increased right ventricular afterload in the left anterior descending artery group. 
The presence in experimental animals of a colon specific Mr 40,000 protein(s) with relevance to ulcerative colitis. In patients with ulcerative colitis a colon tissue bound IgG and serum antibodies against an Mr 40,000 colonic protein(s) has been identified. Using an anti-Mr 40,000 protein monoclonal antibody, 7E12H12, by an immunocytochemical method, the protein was localised in human tissue exclusively to colonic epithelial cells. In this study the presence of the Mr 40,000 protein was assessed in experimental animals by the direct and inhibition enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using the anti-Mr 40,000 protein monoclonal antibody, 7E12H12 (IgM isotype). In addition, a total of 129 specimens including colon, small intestine, gall bladder, biliary tract, and kidney from nine strains of rats and mice, and from human tissue were studied by the immunocytochemical method using 7E12H12. All colon specimens from both humans and animals reacted with 7E12H12 in the immunocytochemical and ELISA assays. None of the non-colonic organs reacted with 7E12H12. While in human colon 7E12H12 recognised the absorptive epithelial cells, in all the animals it recognised mainly the colonic goblet cells. Extracts of animal colon but not of small intestine inhibited the binding of 7E12H12 to the human colon extract. This study shows the presence of an organ specific Mr 40,000 colonic epithelial protein(s) in humans and experimental animals. A differing cellular localisation of the Mr 40,000 protein(s) in human v animal tissue was also shown. Further characterisation of the Mr 40,000 protein(s) may provide important clues regarding the autoimmune mechanisms in ulcerative colitis. 
Lymphatic abnormalities in Alagille's syndrome. Chylous pleural effusions developed in a patient with Alagille's syndrome who had dysplasia of the lymphatic system. Lymphatic abnormalities are not a recognised feature of Alagille's syndrome. 
Endoscopic contact Nd:YAG laser resectional vaporization (ECLRV) and esophageal dilatation (ED) in advanced malignant obstruction of the esophagus. Malignant esophageal obstruction in patients with advanced and metastatic carcinoma is unsuitable for surgery. Palliative treatment must provide adequate swallowing with minimum complications in these often seriously ill patients. Twenty consecutive patients underwent endoscopic Nd:YAG contact laser resection and vaporization (ECLRV) and esophageal dilatation (ED) for advanced esophageal carcinoma since August, 1985. Average duration of the disease when first referred was 7.2 months. Tumor cell type was either squamous cell carcinoma (n = 11) or adenocarcinoma (n = 9). Tumor location was distal (n = 14), middle (n = 5), or upper (n = 2). Mean tumor length was 7.5 cm. Mean preoperative luminal diameter was 1 mm, with total obstruction in ten (50%) patients. The operative procedure in all patients was under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube intubation. Rigid and flexible endoscopes were both used as indicated. Mean postoperative luminal diameter was 15 mm. All but four were able to swallow fluids on the first postoperative day, followed by semisolids the next day without discomfort. Minor perforation was noted in three cases and managed in two conservatively. One more patient had difficulty in swallowing due to extra-esophageal compression, in spite of a technically successful laser therapy. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was carried out in eight cases. Eleven patients were retreated successfully for recurrent obstruction and two were treated more than twice, at a mean of six-week intervals. Endoscopic contact laser resectional vaporization with esophageal dilatation was relatively safe and provided an improved quality of life in this preliminary study group, providing a mean survival of 18.5 weeks (range 2-50 weeks). 
Orbital lesions with granulomatous inflammation. Orbital lesions characterized by granulomatous inflammation are a heterogeneous group of diseases of various causes with a common histopathological substrate involving aggregates of epithelioid cells. Forty-one patients (27 females and 14 males) with biopsy-proven granulomatous inflammation were seen at an orbital clinic between 1978 and 1989. The mean age at presentation was 40.2 (extremes 6 and 77) years. Two main clinical presentations were noted: painless, subacute or chronic mass effect, and tender, subacute inflammatory process. Six patients had secondary features that were infiltrative in character. The lesions were primarily located in the anterior superior orbit. In nearly half the patients the granulomatous reaction was confined to the orbit (predominantly ruptured dermoid and localized orbital sarcoid), and the remainder had either regional involvement (Wegener's granulomatosis or fibro-osseous process) or systemic involvement (sarcoidosis). 
Spontaneous recovery of renal function after resection of contralateral hypernephroma. We report a case of nonfunction of an anatomically normal kidney associated with a contralateral hypernephroma. X-ray and radionuclide imaging suggested a disturbance of the contralateral renal blood flow at the microvascular level. Normal function resumed after tumor resection. The implications for management are discussed. 
Gastrointestinal transit of solid-liquid meal in chronic alcoholics. Gastric emptying, mouth-to-cecum transit, and whole-gut transit of a solid-liquid meal were measured in 46 chronic alcoholics and in 30 control subjects by using scintigraphic techniques, hydrogen breath test, and stool markers. In the alcoholics various parameters such as ethanol consumption, gastrointestinal symptoms, and alcoholic neuropathy were determined and related to gastrointestinal transit times. Although there was no significant overall difference of gastric emptying, abnormally delayed gastric emptying was detected in 23.9% of the alcoholics but no control subject (P less than 0.005). Mouth-to-cecum transit was significantly prolonged in the alcoholics (P less than 0.001) with 14 alcoholics (37.8%) disclosing delayed mouth-to-cecum transit. No significant differences between both groups were detected concerning whole gut transit. In the alcoholics there was a significant correlation of dyspeptic symptoms with delayed gastric emptying (P less than 0.006), and alcoholics with diarrhea had an accelerated mouth-to-cecum transit as compared to those without diarrhea (P less than 0.05). Neither the presence of autonomic or peripheral neuropathy nor the presence of liver cirrhosis or ascites was significantly related to gastrointestinal transit times. However, the daily ethanol ingestion significantly correlated with gastric emptying (P less than 0.005). It is concluded, therefore, that in chronic alcoholics the small intestine and the stomach are most likely to be affected by gastrointestinal transit disorders and that these transit abnormalities are potentially related to toxic damage of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. 
Treatment of accidental digital injection of epinephrine. The use of epinephrine auto-injectors for prehospital treatment of severe allergic reactions has become increasingly popular in recent years. Anxiety when patients are called on to use these spring-loaded devices may lead to complications. We present the case of a 28-year-old woman who accidentally injected epinephrine 1:1,000 solution 0.3 mL into her right index finger with an automatic epinephrine injector. The approach to the treatment of these complications has been varied in the literature, including local sympathectomy, topical nitrates, and either local or intra-arterial phentolamine. This potentially disabling case of epinephrine-induced vasospasm of digital arteries was treated successfully with local infiltration of phentolamine. 
The porcine model for the understanding of thrombogenesis and atherogenesis. The hypothesis originated by Carl Rokitansky a century ago that thrombosis contributes substantially to atherosclerosis has been rekindled by accumulating experimental and clinical evidence. On the basis of our experience with the experimental porcine model, several important biologic determinants of thrombosis have been identified. The degree of vascular injury seems to be the primary determinant of the thrombotic response. In addition, hemodynamic shear stress and the presence of the von Willebrand factor have important roles in the process of thrombosis. Although there is little evidence that thrombosis is a factor in the initiation of spontaneous, or naturally occurring, atherosclerosis, substantial evidence suggests that thrombosis has an essential role in the progression of spontaneous atherosclerosis and also in the early pathogenic process of the syndromes of accelerated atherosclerosis-namely, heart transplant atherosclerosis, vein graft disease, and coronary restenosis after angioplasty. Advances in the understanding of vascular injury and of the interactions of blood cells with the vascular wall have allowed development of new experimental antithrombotic strategies and subsequent clinical applications in the prevention of these vascular diseases. 
Complex ventricular ectopic activity in patients less than 20 years of age with or without syncope, and the role of ventricular extrastimulus testing. To assess the potential for ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular extrastimulus testing was performed in 33 young patients with complex ventricular ectopic activity defined as multiform ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), couplets or nonsustained VT, or a combination, found during electrocardiographic monitoring. There were 21 male and 12 female patients with a mean age of 11 years (range 1 to 18). Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence (14 patients) or absence (19 patients) of syncope. Patients with syncope had ostensibly normal hearts (9 patients) or miscellaneous heart disease (5 patients). Patients without syncope had ostensibly normal hearts (8 patients) or miscellaneous heart disease (11 patients). Ventricular stimulation protocol consisted of burst pacing and 1 to 4 programmed extrastimuli decreasing to refractoriness at 3 drive-train cycle lengths, and at 2 pacing sites (right ventricular apex and outflow tract) during the drug-free baseline state and isoproterenol infusion. No patient had VT induced with 1 or 2 extrastimuli. VT was induced in 13 of 14 patients (93%) with syncope, and in 9 of 19 patients (47%) without syncope (p less than 0.05). Using a 3-extrastimuli protocol, 8 of 14 patients (57%) with and 3 of 19 patients (16%) without syncope had VT induced (p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that VT may be the cause of syncope in young patients with complex ventricular ectopic activity. 
Clinical benefits of structural and functional changes with calcium antagonists. Calcium antagonists have a large variety of pharmacologic effects in addition to those exploited clinically. All drugs used in the management of hypertension, including calcium antagonists, are coming under increasing scrutiny for the possible beneficial and adverse effects they may have on the circulation and risk factor profile. This is particularly because of concern about the relative resistance of coronary heart disease to antihypertensive drug treatment and the increasing interest in evaluating the impact of blood pressure-lowering drugs on surrogate endpoints such as left ventricular hypertrophy. Given the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic heterogeneity of calcium antagonists, it may be wise to keep in mind the subtypes as exemplified by the prototypes nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil and to extrapolate from one type to another with great caution. The increased understanding of the diversity among calcium antagonists as well as the pathophysiology of hypertension and other vascular diseases promises an exciting future for calcium antagonists in cardiovascular therapeutics. 
Risk of peritonitis and fatal septicaemia and the need to defunction the low anastomosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the need to defunction the low anastomosis after anterior resection of the rectum with total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. Two hundred consecutive patients (125 defunctioned, 75 non-defunctioned) undergoing low anterior resection for carcinoma were included in the study. Peritonitis requiring emergency laparotomy occurred in 8 per cent of the patients who did not have a defunctioning stoma compared with less than 1 per cent of those patients who had a defunctioning stoma (P less than 0.01). There was no mortality related to closure of the stoma but seven patients developed a faecal fistula and ten developed an incisional hernia. Despite current trends to avoid the defunctioning stoma, these results suggest that after total mesorectal excision the faecal stream should be temporarily diverted away from the anastomosis that is 6 cm or less from the anal verge to protect against potentially life-threatening anastomotic leakage. 
Acute and sustained changes in sodium balance during nifedipine treatment in essential hypertension. PURPOSE: To assess the changes in sodium excretion and sodium balance after initiation of nifedipine treatment and after withdrawal of nifedipine. PATIENTS: Eight patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate essential hypertension were entered in a single-blind, placebo-controlled study of 39 days' duration. METHODS: Two 7-day periods while on a fixed sodium intake of 150 mmol/day approximately 3 weeks apart. After 4 days of a placebo and fixed sodium intake, patients were given nifedipine GITS (gastrointestinal therapeutic system) once a day and carefully studied for the following 4 days. Thereafter, patients continued to receive nifedipine GITS, and approximately 3 weeks later they were studied again for a week while on a fixed sodium intake. Nifedipine administration was stopped and changes occurring after withdrawal were studied. RESULTS: Nifedipine caused a significant increase in sodium excretion with a cumulative loss of sodium of 38 mmol per subject within the first 4 days of treatment. The withdrawal of nifedipine treatment caused a significant decrease in sodium excretion and a cumulative retention of sodium of 42 mmol per subject within the first 4 days of withdrawal. CONCLUSION: Nifedipine causes an acute and a sustained reduction in sodium balance in patients with essential hypertension. This prolonged effect may contribute to the mechanism whereby nifedipine lowers blood pressure. 
The interaction of proinsulin with the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor in human liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. Because of the sequence homology and tertiary structure similarities between proinsulin (PI) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), it is possible that PI interacts with the IGF-I receptor with higher affinity than insulin. To test this hypothesis in man, we have partially purified IGF-I receptors from liver, muscle, and adipose tissue and studied their interaction with PI, insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II. With some tissue to tissue variation, [125I]insulin binding was 4- to 8-fold greater than IGF-I binding. Unlabeled IGF-I at about 1 x 10(-9 M, IGF-II at about 1 x 10(-8) M, and insulin at about 1 x 10(-6) M displace 50% the binding of [125I]IGF-I to its receptor, whereas PI at 1 x 10(-6) M displaces less than 20% of the binding of [125I]IGF-I to its receptor. We conclude that in human liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, PI does not interact with the IGF-I receptor at a higher affinity than insulin, and the affinity of IGF-I receptors is several-fold lower than that of insulin receptors. It is, therefore, unlikely that if PI were to be administered to man any of its biological effects would be by interacting with the IGF-I receptor. 
The yield of barium enema in patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair or abdominal hysterectomy. It is the practice of some gynecologists and general surgeons to preoperatively evaluate the colon with a barium enema (BE) examination to exclude potential intestinal involvement or coexistent disease in patients undergoing pelvic or hernia operations. This practice appears to be based on anecdotal data with few studies specifically evaluating its usefulness. We retrospectively evaluated the records of 190 patients at William Beaumont Army Medical Center during 1986 to 1987 who received a preoperative BE prior to total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) or inguinal hernia repair (IHR). The tumor registry charts of 59 patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the colon and rectum during the same period were also cross-checked to determine if any were detected during preoperative evaluation for TAH or IHR. BE findings were considered significant if they altered surgical management or asymptomatic carcinoma was detected. Of 86 patients screened before TAH by BE, eight had abnormal findings with subsequent colonoscopy revealing four with adenomatous polyps, one of which required surgical resection. Of 104 patients screened before IHR by BE, 15 had abnormal findings with subsequent colonoscopy revealing five patients with adenomatous polyps and two with adenocarcinoma. Screening preoperative BE had a low yield of clinically significant findings, which was even lower in the subgroup with carcinoma. There was no apparent relationship between findings and age in our study. Our results suggest that the use of routine preoperative BE has a low yield and should be performed only if clinical symptoms or findings suggest a need for this study. 
Does tremor pace repetitive voluntary motor behavior in Parkinson's disease? In patients with Parkinson's disease and in normal subjects, the influence of tremor on repetitive voluntary movement was investigated in the index finger by comparing frequency of isometric force tremor with frequency of voluntary alternating isometric contractions. Tremor frequency, measured over the range from 0 to 70% maximum voluntary force, usually increased with force. The tremor frequency band was lower and more often overlapped with the upper voluntary frequency range in patients than in normal subjects. Normal subjects could accurately produce voluntary contractions at all cue frequencies from 1 to 5 Hz. Patients could produce auditory-paced frequencies of 1 and 2 Hz, but at higher cue frequencies, their voluntary contractions were often faster or slower than the cue. The faster or "hastened" voluntary frequencies were within the tremor frequency band, whereas the slowed voluntary frequencies were below it. Maximal voluntary frequency was often greater than the lowest but always less than the highest tremor frequency. It is concluded that parkinsonian tremor may pace voluntary repetitive movements to go faster than intended with the highest tremor frequency being an upper limit for voluntary frequency. Similar mechanisms may underlie the hastened repetitive vocal responses that were also observed in the parkinsonian patients. 
Serum alpha-L-fucosidase. A more sensitive marker for hepatocellular carcinoma? Forty-nine liver disease patients (7 chronic persistent hepatitis, CPH; 10 chronic active hepatitis, CAH; 13 liver cirrhosis, LC; 9 primary hepatocellular carcinoma, PHC, without LC; and 10 PHC with associated LC) and 20 controls were assessed for their serum alpha-L-fucosidase (ALF) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and several routine liver injury parameters. Tumor diameter in those with hepatic cancer was assessed by angio-CT. Only ALF and AFP were significantly greater in patients with PHC and PHC + LC patients as compared to patients with LC alone. At an accepted cutoff level of 500 ng/ml, the AFP level provided 43% false negative tests. On the other hand, an ALF level exceeding 740 mumol/hr/ml provided a sensitivity of 84% with a specificity of 94%. No relationship between the ALF level and Child's criteria or with any liver injury parameter was evident. Considering all individual values, the ALF, rather than the AFP, correlated with tumor size. This finding suggests the ALF level may be of value in the early detection of PHC as well as in the follow-up of patients treated for PHC. 
Postoperative protein metabolism: effect of nursing elderly patients for 24 h after abdominal surgery in a thermoneutral environment. We have studied the effect of intraoperative body heat conservation and 24-h thermoneutrality on postoperative whole body protein turnover using stable isotope methodology in a group of elderly patients undergoing colorectal surgery for rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma. Two groups of eight patients were studied. One group (control, or cold) received routine intraoperative and postoperative care. All patients in the second group (warmed) were maintained at normothermia during anaesthesia and surgery; these patients were nursed after surgery in a warm room (ambient temperature 28-30 degrees C) for a period of 24 h. General anaesthesia, surgical care and nutritional support were similar in both groups. A constant nutritional intake, based on nitrogen 0.1 g kg-1 day-1 and energy 20 kcal kg-1 day-1, was provided orally for 7 days before surgery and i.v. after operation for 4 consecutive days. Whole body protein breakdown and synthesis, as assessed by stable isotope methodology, increased significantly 2 and 4 days after surgery in both groups (P less than 0.01), but the increase in protein breakdown in the warmed group on day 2 was significantly less than that in the cold group (P less than 0.05). The increase in leucine oxidation in the warmed group on the 2nd day after surgery was not significant, and was less than the increase observed in the cold group (P less than 0.05). However, by the 4th day, leucine oxidation was enhanced significantly in both groups (P less than 0.01). 
Nasal haemangiopericytoma. Haemangiopericytoma is an uncommon vascular tumour frequently diagnosed with difficulty. The immunohistochemical findings of strong positivity to vimentin together with other diagnostic features (histological and ultrastructural) improves the certainty of its diagnosis. We report a case arising in the nose and outline diagnostic problems especially relating to histopathology. 
Elevated intraoperative blood carboxyhemoglobin levels in surgical patients--Georgia, Illinois, and North Carolina. In October 1990, three hospitals, one each in Georgia, Illinois, and North Carolina, reported 26 episodes of elevated blood carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels (normal: less than 3% in a nonsmoker, less than 10% in a smoker) during surgery in patients with no known carbon monoxide (CO) exposure. All three hospitals are large, medical-school-affiliated, training institutions. Hospital A (Georgia) reported 15 episodes from January 1987 through September 1989; hospital B (North Carolina), eight episodes from January through October 1990; and hospital C (Illinois), three episodes from January through September 1990. All of the episodes were detected during routine blood gas analyses that included COHb measurements (co-oximetry). In eight episodes, peak COHb levels were greater than 20%. Usually, when an elevated COHb level was detected intraoperatively, 100% oxygen was administered, an alternate gas source was instituted, and COHb levels returned to normal. No deaths or serious complications were reported. 
Neurotrophic protein S100 beta stimulates glial cell proliferation. Nervous system development involves a coordinated series of events, including regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation by specific extracellular factors. S100 beta is a neurotrophic protein that has been implicated in regulation of cellular proliferation, but direct evidence was lacking. In this report, nanomolar concentrations of S100 beta are shown to stimulate proliferation of rat C6 glioma cells and primary astrocytes. An S100 mutant with a single amino acid change was inactive. S100 beta also stimulated increases in the steady-state levels of c-myc and c-fos protooncogene mRNAs and complemented the effects of platelet-derived growth factor. Two neuroblastoma cell lines did not proliferate in response to S100 beta, suggesting that the mitogenic activity of S100 beta is selective for astroglial cells. These results suggest that S100 beta may be involved in the coordinate development and maintenance of the central nervous system by synchronously stimulating the differentiation of neurons and the proliferation of astroglia. 
Overnight studies in severe chronic left heart failure: arrhythmias and oxygen desaturation. Overnight studies were performed in 10 patients with severe chronic left heart failure (New York Heart Association grades III and IV) without pulmonary disease and in eight controls. Transcutaneous oxygen (Po2) and carbon dioxide tensions (Pco2) and oxygen saturation were measured and the electro-cardiogram was recorded. During sleep mean oxygen saturation fell to 92.7% (minimum 86.1%) from 95.1% when awake. During the night oxygen saturation was below 95% for 62% of the time, below 90% for 6% of the time, and below 85% for 1% of the time. In four patients there were oxygen desaturation dips (a fall of greater than 4% in oxygen saturation from a stable baseline that lasted greater than 30 s) with concurrent increases in Pco2. Two patients had bradycardia during the dips: in one there was non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during the dips and in the other there was ST depression (greater than 0.1 mV at 80 ms after the J point) during a dip. In the controls the fall in mean oxygen saturation from 95.4% when they were awake to 94.4% when they were asleep was less than the fall in patients with heart failure and there were no desaturation dips or arrhythmias. Thus patients with severe heart failure had episodes of oxygen desaturation during sleep, some of which were associated with arrhythmia. Such episodes may be related to the increased risk of sudden death in chronic heart failure. 
Phase I trial of tissue plasminogen activator for the prevention of vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Recent laboratory studies have demonstrated that intracisternal administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) can facilitate the normal clearing of blood from the subarachnoid space and prevent or ameliorate delayed arterial spasm. The results of a preliminary Phase I trial of intracisternal rt-PA in 10 patients are reported with documented aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). All patients enrolled were classified as clinical Grade III or IV (according to Hunt and Hess) with thick clots or layers of blood in the basal cisterns and major cerebral fissures (Fisher Grade 3). Ventriculostomy and surgery for clipping of the aneurysms were performed within 48 hours of hemorrhage. In one patient, 10 mg rt-PA was instilled into the subarachnoid cisterns prior to closing the dura. In the remaining nine patients, a small silicone catheter was left in the subarachnoid space and rt-PA (5 mg in four cases or 1.5 mg (0.5 mg every 8 hours for three infusions) in five cases) was instilled 12 to 24 hours after surgery. Minor local bleeding complications were noted in all patients receiving 5 or 10 mg rt-PA. Oozing was noted at the operative incision site in four of five patients and at the ventriculostomy site in two patients. One patient developed a small epidural hematoma that was treated by delayed drainage. No bleeding complications were noted in the patients receiving the lower regimen of rt-PA (three infusions of 0.5 mg each). Serial coagulation studies demonstrated no evidence of systemic fibrinolysis. Analysis of cisternal cerebrospinal fluid samples revealed thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) levels for 24 to 48 hours. Follow-up cerebral angiography 7 to 8 days after rupture disclosed mild to moderate spasm in nine patients, while one patient with hemorrhage from a posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm had severe focal spasm of the vertebral arteries that was not symptomatic. These results suggest that postoperative treatment with rt-PA may be effective in reducing the severity of delayed cerebral vasospasm. The results of serial t-PA levels suggest that the lower dosage regimen with divided dosages at 8-hour intervals is well tolerated and that even lower dosages may be effective. Further studies are clearly indicated. 
The long distance effects of brain lesions: visualization of axonal pathways and their terminations in the human brain by the Nauta method. This study aims at determining the reliability and the optimal post-injury survival time for the application of the Nauta technique to the analysis of the human brain. The Nauta method reveals the degeneration not only of nerve fibers, myelinated and unmyelinated, but also of their terminations. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural observations appear to prove that the Nauta technique indeed stains axons in human autopsy material. The optimal survival time for the use of the Nauta method was found to be between nine days and five months. In cases with longer survival times--up to 20 months--the Nauta technique and a previously proposed polarizing technique (showing birefringent breakdown products of myelin) can be used as complementary methods. Applying these techniques to the human brain may help define the anatomical basis of neurological and neuropsychological symptoms important for man.
