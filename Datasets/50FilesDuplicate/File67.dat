2	Electrophysiology of motor pathways for sphincter control in multiple sclerosis. The central and peripheral motor pathways serving striated sphincter muscle function were studied using cortical and lumbar transcutaneous electrical stimulation, pudendal nerve stimulation and sphincter electromyography in 23 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and sphincter disturbance, including incontinence of urine or faeces, urinary voiding dysfunction, or constipation. The central motor conduction time was significantly increased in the MS group compared to controls (p less than 0.05). Damage to both the upper and lower motor neuron pathways can contribute to sphincter disturbance in MS. The latter may be due to coexisting pathology or to involvement of the conus medullaris by MS. 
3	Chronic headache associated with a functioning shunt: usefulness of pressure monitoring. Chronic headaches in a shunt-dependent patient with small ventricles has long been treated with little or no regard to intracranial pressure. In this study, pressure monitoring on 12 such patients demonstrated that they fell into three distinct categories: 3 had headaches caused by intracranial hypertension, 2 had headaches from hypotension, and 7 showed no relation of symptoms to pressure. As therapeutic procedures for treating these three categories are entirely different and sometimes opposing, it is clear that intracranial pressure monitoring is essential to successful management of this complaint. 
5	Activated protooncogenes in human lung tumors from smokers. Fourteen primary human lung tumor DNAs from smokers were analyzed for transforming activity by two DNA transfection assays. Activated protooncogenes were detected in 3 of 11 tumor DNAs by the NIH 3T3 focus assay, whereas activated protooncogenes were detected in 11 of 13 tumor DNAs by the NIH 3T3 cotransfection-nude mouse tumorigenicity assay. K- or NRAS genes activated by point mutation at codons 12 or 61 were detected in a large cell carcinoma, a squamous cell carcinoma, and 5 adenocarcinomas. An HRAS oncogene activated by a different mechanism was detected in an epidermoid carcinoma. One adenocarcinoma was found to contain an activated RAF gene. Two unidentified transforming genes were detected in a squamous cell carcinoma DNA and two adenocarcinoma DNAs. Eight of 10 lung adenocarcinomas that had formed metastases at the time of surgery were found to contain RAS oncogenes. No significant increase in metastasis was observed in the lung adenocarcinomas that contained one or more 6-kilobase EcoRI alleles of the LMYC gene. Overall, 12 of 14 (86%) of the lung tumor DNAs from smokers were found to contain activated protooncogenes. RAS oncogenes appear to play a role in the development of metastases in lung adenocarcinomas. 
2	High incidence of viral hepatitis among American missionaries in Africa. Protestant missionaries (n = 360) serving in sub-Saharan Africa between 1967-1984 were studied to determine the risk of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Personnel were serologically screened for antibody to both the hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) and the surface antigen to the hepatitis B virus (anti-HBs) prior to departure, periodically during service abroad, and upon completion of their African tour. Rates of seroconversion were used as measures of the incidence of infection. Prior to service, 16% of the staff had anti-HAV and 3% had anti-HBs; post-service rates were 42% and 26%, respectively. Over 90% of the staff with greater than 20 years of service were seropositive for anti-HAV. For both viruses, the infection rate was highest during the first 1-2 years of service, when 28% of those susceptible to HAV and 11% of those susceptible to HBV became infected. Over the next decade, the median annual attack rate was 5.4% for HAV and 4.2% for HBV. Differences in the missionary HBV infection rate among the various African nations served tended to reflect differences in the magnitude of chronic HBV carriage among indigenous population groups. We conclude that missionaries to sub-Saharan Africa are at enhanced risk of both HAV and HBV infection, and that all should receive passive immunization with immune globulin and active immunization with hepatitis B vaccine. 
2	Glutathione disulfide formation and oxidant stress during acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in mice in vivo: the protective effect of allopurinol. Acetaminophen (500 mg/kg i.p.) induced hepatotoxicity in fasted ICR mice in vivo. Acetaminophen also caused a long-lasting 50% reduction of the hepatic ATP content, an irreversible loss of hepatic xanthine dehydrogenase activity and a transient increase of the xanthine oxidase activity. All effects occurred before parenchymal cell damage, i.e., the release of cellular enzymes. The hepatic content of GSH and GSSG was initially depleted by acetaminophen without affecting the GSSG:GSH ratio (1:200), however, during the recovery phase of the hepatic GSH levels the GSSG content increased faster than GSH, resulting in a GSSG:GSH ratio of 1:18 24 h after acetaminophen administration. The mitochondrial GSSG content increased from 2% in controls to greater than 20% in acetaminophen-treated mice. The extremely elevated tissue GSSG levels were accompanied by a 4-fold increase of the plasma GSSG concentrations but not by an enhanced biliary efflux, although hepatic GSSG formation and biliary excretion were not affected by acetaminophen. Allopurinol protected dose-dependently against acetaminophen-induced cell injury, the loss of ATP and the increase of the GSSG content in the total liver and in the mitochondrial compartment without inhibiting reactive metabolite formation. High, protective as well as low, nonprotective doses of allopurinol almost completely inhibited hepatic xanthine oxidase and dehydrogenase activity, but only high doses prevented the increase of the mitochondrial GSSG content. The data indicate a long-lasting, primarily intracellular oxidant stress during the progression phase of acetaminophen-induced cell necrosis. The protective effect of allopurinol is unlikely to involve the inhibition of reactive oxygen formation by xanthine oxidase but could be the result of its antioxidant property. 
1	Spindle and epithelioid cell nevus (Spitz nevus). Natural history following biopsy. A clinical follow-up study of 49 cases of spindle and epithelioid cell nevus is presented to address the question about the potential for local recurrence. Only 19 (39%) of the 49 lesions were initially excised en toto, and the remainder (30 cases) had positive margins; six of the latter spindle and epithelioid cell nevi were reexcised, and no evidence of a residual nevus was found in five of the six cases. There were no recurrences in the 49 patients during an average follow-up period of 5.0 years (range, 1 to 10 years). The rarity of recurrent spindle and epithelioid cell nevus would justify a conservative approach to management, with clinical follow-up alone recommended after a subtotal excision, when the pathologic diagnosis is unequivocal. 
3	Language function following anterior temporal lobectomy. The authors report the results of a prospective investigation that evaluated postoperative changes in language function after dominant (29 cases) or nondominant (35 cases) anterior temporal lobectomy for treatment of complex partial seizures. These patients received conservative resection of lateral temporal cortex but aggressive resection of medial temporal cortex. None of the patients underwent functional mapping of cortical language ability. All patients were assessed with a standardized aphasia battery (Multilingual Aphasia Examination) before and 6 months after surgery. Postoperatively, the dominant anterior temporal lobectomy group did not show any significant losses in language function compared to patients who underwent nondominant anterior temporal lobectomy. In addition, the dominant temporal lobectomy group showed significant postoperative improvement in complex receptive language comprehension compared to the nondominant group. These results suggest that patients with complex partial seizures of medial temporal lobe onset can undergo a conservative resection of lateral temporal cortex without language mapping. Such surgery carries little risk to language function and provides an excellent postoperative surgical outcome. 
1	Left ventricular fibroma: echocardiographic diagnosis and successful surgical excision in three cases. The management of three patients with left ventricular fibromas is outlined. All were asymptomatic children. Routine chest radiography suggested cardiac masses. M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography were valuable adjuncts to conventional angiography in assessing these children. Electrocardiographic changes, present in all cases, were shown to regress postoperatively. We stress the importance of these noninvasive aids in the initial investigation and outline our operative methods of reconstruction. 
5	Reoperations on heart valve prostheses: an analysis of operative risks and late results. To evaluate risks and complications of reoperations on heart valve prostheses, we reviewed data on 183 patients who underwent reoperation because of prosthetic valve malfunction. The incremental effect of the redo procedure on hospital mortality and morbidity was studied by comparing primary and reoperative procedures and analyzing a series of possible predisposing factors. Late survival after first and second reoperations was computed, and possible determinants of late mortality were examined. Overall operative mortality was 8.7%; emergency operation (p = 0.0001), previous thromboembolism (p = 0.05), and advanced New York Heart Association functional class (p = 0.031) were the independent determinants. In a series of 1,355 patients having primary or secondary isolated valve replacement, the redo procedure was a significant risk factor in the univariate analysis (p = 0.025) but not in the multivariate analysis except for the subset of patients having mitral valve replacement (p = 0.052). The postoperative course was quite complicated, as evidenced by the long mean stay in the intensive care unit (mean stay, 3.8 days; longer than 2 days for 26% of the survivors). Nevertheless, postoperative complications were not significantly greater after a redo procedure than after a primary operation. Actuarial survival at 7 years was 57.3% +/- 8%. A comparison with a nonhomogeneous series from our institution did not demonstrate significant differences. In the subset of 16 patients having a second reoperation, late survival was 37.8% +/- 16% at 2 years. Advanced New York Heart Association class (p = 0.0001), double prosthetic valve dysfunction (p = 0.003), and any indication other than primary tissue failure (p = 0.06) were determinants of late mortality. 
4	Crohn's disease and retinal vascular disease. Patients with Crohn's disease may manifest extraintestinal findings including ocular involvement. We treated two patients with Crohn's disease who manifested retinal vascular disease that may have been related to the immune nature of the underlying disease or possibly to changes in the vasculature or coagulation system. One patient had a central retinal vein occlusion and the other had retinal vasculitis involving retinal arteries and veins with an apparent branch retinal artery occlusion. Both patients were in excellent health except for Crohn's disease, which was confirmed by a biopsy specimen. In one patient, the diagnosis of retinal vasculitis preceded the clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease, whereas for the second patient the symptomatology of the intestinal disease preceded the ocular manifestations. We suggest that inflammatory bowel disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of retinal vascular occlusive disease, especially in a young patient. 
1	Hypercalcemia with excess serum 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D in lymphomatoid granulomatosis/angiocentric lymphoma. Hypercalcemia has been described in a variety of granulomatous and lymphoproliferative disorders in association with elevated serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. In such cases, hypercalcemia appears to be the consequence of excessive production of 1,25(OH)2D by the lymphocyte/macrophage line. The authors report a patient with lymphomatoid granulomatosis/angiocentric lymphoma who developed hypercalcemia with extreme elevation in serum 1,25(OH)2D. Therapy with steroids reduced the serum calcium and 1,25(OH)2D levels to normal. Hypercalcemia has not previously been reported in lymphomatoid granulomatosis/angiocentric lymphoma. The distinctive features of this malignancy, and the derangement in the metabolism of 1,25(OH)2D in lymphoproliferative disorders in general, are discussed. 
1	Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score in patients with cerebrovascular disease and in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) activity in peripheral blood was determined in 54 patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD), 11 patients with primary brain tumor, and 23 patients with metastatic brain tumor. The LAP score of the primary brain tumor patients (155 +/- 40) was significantly higher (P less than 0.03) than the LAP score for cerebrovascular disease patients (96 +/- 87). The LAP score levels of the metastatic brain tumor patients (251 +/- 55) was significantly higher as compared with both the cerebrovascular disease (P less than 0.001) and primary brain tumor groups (P less than 0.001). The LAP score could serve as an additional, although non-specific, marker to assist in the differentiation between cerebrovascular disease and brain tumors. 
5	Effect of interleukin-1-beta on metastasis formation in different tumor systems. Experiments were done to determine the effect of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 beta) on metastasis formation in different tumor systems. Intravenous administration of 1 microgram of human recombinant IL-1 beta given 1 hour before tumor cell injection augmented lung colony formation (experimental metastases) by the human A375 melanoma variants, the human HT-29M colon carcinoma, the SN12-K1 renal carcinoma in nude mice, the murine B16 melanoma variants, and the murine UV-2237M fibrosarcoma in syngeneic recipients. The same treatment did not induce lung colony formation by a human rectal carcinoma (HCC-P2988) or by a murine reticulum cell sarcoma (M5076), both of which are not metastatic to the lung. Spontaneous metastases were studied in C57BL/6 mice bearing the B16-BL6 melanoma (metastatic to the lung) in their footpad and the M5076 reticulum cell sarcoma (metastatic to the liver) subcutaneously. Daily intraperitoneal treatment with 1 microgram of IL-1 beta increased lung and liver metastases. These findings indicate that treatment of mice with IL-1 beta can increase the number of artificial or spontaneous metastases and that this effect is not limited to a single tumor type or to a specific organ. 
3	Indications for thymectomy in myasthenia gravis. Fifty-six board-certified neurologists with interest and expertise in myasthenia completed a survey of indications for thymectomy in myasthenia gravis. Thymectomy was advocated for virtually all patients with thymoma, for a variable subset of patients with generalized myasthenia without thymoma, and occasionally for selected patients with disabling ocular myasthenia. 
1	Head and neck paragangliomas: a clinicopathologic study with DNA flow cytometric analysis. A total of 11 head and neck paragangliomas were the subject of pathologic study, including histologic, immunohistochemical, and DNA flow cytometric analyses. We cannot absolutely predict aggressive clinical behavior using histologic parameters alone, but we can use such parameters to segregate patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. Several trends were observed in the current study. Tumors with higher S-phase fractions, G2/M fractions, or aneuploid cell populations tended to behave "aggressively." The presence of sustentacular cells in the primary tumors cannot be used as an absolute indicator of tumor metastatic potential, as two metastatic paragangliomas in this study contained sustentacular cells in both the primary and metastatic lesions. DNA ploidy status cannot be used as an absolute prognostic parameter as the two metastatic tumors were composed of diploid primary and metastatic lesions. The three tumors with aneuploid cell populations showed "aggressive" histologic and clinical features, but the length of the follow-up period for these cases is too limited to draw any conclusions. Although no absolute criteria can be used at present to gauge aggressiveness, close follow-up of these patients is essential, especially if pathologic findings suggest an "aggressive" course (ie, "malignant" histology, higher S-phase fractions, G2/M fractions, aneuploid cell populations, or decreased sustentacular cell density). 
2	Referral of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis for liver transplantation. All patients with primary biliary cirrhosis referred to this unit for consideration for transplantation between April 1981 and January 1989 were analysed retrospectively to assess whether disease stage at referral affects the outcome after grafting and whether greater awareness of the benefits of the procedure means that patients are now being referred at an earlier stage. Seventy of the 107 patients have been grafted, with an overall one year actuarial survival of 62%. A better prognosis at the time of referral, as assessed by both serum bilirubin concentration and a mathematically derived prognostic index, was associated with a greater probability of survival after grafting. Patients in the tertile with the best prognosis (median serum bilirubin concentration at referral 84 mumol/l and estimated survival in the absence of transplantation of more than nine months) had a 78% one year actuarial survival after transplantation, whereas those in the tertile with the worst prognosis (median serum bilirubin concentration 467 mumol/l and estimated survival of less than four months) had a one year actuarial survival of only 50%. No trend towards earlier referral of patients, however, was shown using either of these two markers. This retrospective analysis suggests that many patients are being referred too late for an optimal outcome. We recommend that patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who are potential candidates for liver grafting should be referred to a transplant centre before the serum bilirubin concentration approaches 150 mumol/l. 
5	Evaluation and therapy of breakthrough bleeding in women using a triphasic oral contraceptive. This study was designed to investigate the incidence and pattern of breakthrough bleeding (BTB) in 1,259 women who were prescribed for the first time a triphasic oral contraceptive (OC, 7-7-7) and to evaluate a hypothesis of management for BTB persisting after three cycles. The new users were compared with a control group of 696 women who had used various OCs for at least 6 months. The incidence of BTB in the control group was 16.8% and in the new users was 24.9%, 17.5%, and 15.3% in the first 3 months, respectively. Breakthrough bleeding occurred late in the 7-7-7 package in 58% and early or midway through the package in 17% and 25%, respectively. We hypothesized that late-package BTB would improve if the patient was switched to a monophasic pill similar to the relatively estrogenic formulation of the beginning of the package and vice versa for early or midpackage BTB. Seventy women with BTB at 3 months were randomly given 0.5/35 or 1/35 for a further 3 months. Breakthrough bleeding was more likely (P less than 0.05) to improve in women switched to 1/35 compared with 0.5/35 regardless of where in the package BTB occurred. 
4	A risk-benefit analysis of elective bilateral oophorectomy: effect of changes in compliance with estrogen therapy on outcome. A bilateral oophorectomy at the time of elective hysterectomy is often performed to prevent ovarian cancer. The assumption that endogenous estrogen can be easily replaced with supplemental medication fosters the decision for routine oophorectomy. Published reports on the use of postmenopausal estrogen indicate that compliance is less than perfect. This fact could affect the overall outcome. Decision analysis techniques with Markov cohort modeling were used to evaluate the policy of elective bilateral oophorectomy. Results from studies judged methodologically sound were combined to determine values representing the influence of estrogen on coronary heart disease, breast cancer, and osteoporotic fracture. The decision tree also explicitly incorporated patient compliance. When compliance with estrogen therapy is assumed to be perfect, oophorectomy yields longer life expectancy than retaining the ovaries. When actual drug-taking behavior is considered, retaining the ovaries results in longer survival. This analysis highlights the importance of including the effects of patient compliance with treatment recommendations when the impact of a health policy decision such as prophylactic surgery is assessed. 
5	Relief of tracheal compression by aortopexy. We have performed aortopexy in 12 children with tracheal compression. Six infants had compression secondary to a vascular anomaly (group 1), and the other 6 had previous repair of esophageal atresia (group 2). Eleven of the 12 children are alive after a mean follow-up of 36 months. In group 1, 1 patient died and 3 patients (50%) experienced recurrent respiratory distress. Five infants sustained a major postoperative complication, and the average postoperative hospital stay was 25 days. In group 2, however, aortopexy was uniformly successful. There were no deaths, no postoperative complications, and no cases of postoperative respiratory distress, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was only 10 days. For children with reflex apnea after repair of esophageal atresia, aortopexy is lifesaving and can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality. Great caution is indicated in children with tracheal compression from other causes. 
2	Transcatheter oily chemoembolization in the management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis: results of a Western comparative study in 60 patients. Transcatheter oily chemoembolization is widely used as palliative therapy for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma in high-incidence Asiatic areas. To assess its usefulness in the Western form of this cancer, 30 French patients were treated between 1987 and 1990 by intraarterial hepatic injection of a Lipiodol-doxorubicin emulsion followed by embolization with 0.5 to 1 mm gelatin sponge particles. The number of procedures ranged from one to five. All patients had advanced, symptomatic and inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (Okuda's staging: I, n = 8; II, n = 14; III, n = 8); none was found under systematic screening. All had underlying cirrhosis (Child-Pugh's class: A, n = 15; B, n = 12; C, n = 3) that was alcoholic in origin in 27 cases and posthepatitic B in origin in 3 cases. The results of the treatment were assessed by comparison with a group of 30 untreated patients admitted to the same unit between 1984 and 1987. Patients of both groups were closely matched for clinical presentation, global disease staging and precise anatomical extension. The overall 1- and 2-yr survival rate was 59% and 30%, respectively, for the treated patients vs. 0% at 1 yr for the untreated patients. The latter all died from local disease with end-stage liver failure and/or uncontrollable variceal bleeding. In the former, the three patients with Child's class C cirrhosis died after the first procedure. During the follow-up (range = 3 to 26 mo), 11 additional patients died, 8 from metastatic generalization. 
5	Effects of aerobic exercise training on symptomatic women with mitral valve prolapse. The effects of a 12-week aerobic exercise training protocol on 32 symptomatic women with mitral valve prolapse were studied. Subjects were randomly assigned to control or exercise groups. Exercise subjects completed a 12-week (3 times per week) exercise training program based on guidelines established by the American Heart Association for phase II cardiac rehabilitation programs; control group subjects maintained normal activities. Before and after training, subjects underwent maximal multistage treadmill testing, and measurements were obtained for plasma catecholamine levels at rest and during peak exercise; they completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and General Well-Being Schedule. Weekly symptom frequency of chest pain, arm pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, mood swings, dizziness and syncope were monitored for the 12-week period. Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance, multivariate analysis of covariance, and analysis of covariance with repeated measures. Compared with control subjects, the exercise group showed a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in State Trait Anxiety Inventory scores, an increase in General Well-Being scores, an increase in functional capacity and a decline in the frequency of chest pain, fatigue, dizziness and mood swings. No statistically significant differences were noted in catecholamine levels at rest or during peak exercise. These findings support the use of aerobic exercise in the management of symptomatic women with mitral valve prolapse. 
2	A multifactorial analysis of mortality and morbidity in perforated peptic ulcer disease. Perforated peptic ulcer disease remains a source of considerable morbidity and mortality, and the suggested methods of surgical therapy are diverse. We reviewed the course of 113 patients who were treated surgically and identified 14 factors that influenced the morbidity or mortality rates, or both. Multiple regression analysis showed that the number of coexisting medical conditions, a lower mean blood pressure level and the duration of acute perforation were independent risk factors for death, while age, use of a bronchodilator, a lower mean blood pressure level and the number of coexisting medical conditions correlated positively with all complications. A duodenal site was independently favorable with respect to all complications. The type of operation performed either simple closure, vagotomy and drainage or resection, did not influence morbidity or mortality. The most severely ill patients also did not benefit from any particular type of operation in the short term. Long term results were improved with definitive operation, as measured by the Visick classification and the need for reoperations. Definitive operations are recommended for virtually all patients with perforated peptic ulcer. 
5	Ovarian neoplasms and the risk of adnexal torsion. Previous reports examining adnexal torsion suggested that benign ovarian neoplasms are more likely to undergo torsion than malignant ovarian neoplasms. To our knowledge, this clinical observation has not been quantified. To examine this hypothesis, we reviewed our experience with ovarian neoplasms found at the time of surgery over a 10-year period. Benign ovarian neoplasms had a 12.9-fold increased risk of undergoing adnexal torsion when compared with malignant ovarian neoplasms (95% confidence interval, 10.2 to 15.9). The histologic type of ovarian neoplasm does not appear to affect the rate of adnexal torsion. Adnexal torsion rarely involves cancer. 
1	Aspergillus terreus endophthalmitis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A 65-year-old woman with a 7-year history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with acute visual loss, pain, and redness in her right eye. Results of stains and cultures of anterior chamber fluid were negative. Neurologic problems, bronchopulmonary pneumonia, recurrent skin lesions, and a low-grade fever developed. Progressive respiratory distress ensued, and the patient died 1 month after presentation. Cultures from antemortem sputum and skin samples were positive for Aspergillus terreus. Postmortem histologic results showed extensive A terreus invasion of the posterior vitreous, retina, choroid, and anterior optic nerve. This organism was also found in histologic sections from the right adrenal gland, left kidney, thyroid, urinary bladder, right lung, skin, esophagus, sputum, vessels of the myocardium, and brain. To our knowledge, A terreus endophthalmitis has not been reported previously. 
1	General assay for phosphoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid: a candidate marker for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. The components of protein phosphorylation systems (protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and their phosphoprotein substrates) are highly enriched in neuronal cells compared with other cell types. We exploited this relative neuronal enrichment of protein phosphorylation system components to develop a general assay technique for putative protein kinase substrates (phosphoproteins) in human cerebrospinal fluid. Using this cerebrospinal fluid phosphoprotein assay, we have detected a putative protein kinase C substrate protein of apparent Mr 60 kd in 6 of 14 patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration but not in any of 55 patients with a variety of other neurological diseases. Phosphoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid may provide novel and unique markers for the diagnosis or staging of neuronal diseases as well as offer potential insights into the biochemical characterization of affected neuronal populations. 
5	A comparison of the efficacy and safety of pergolide and bromocriptine in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Pergolide is a synthetic ergoline derivative with highly potent long-acting PRL-lowering activity, allowing therapy of hyperprolactinemia with a once daily administration of the drug. The results of two open-label, randomized controlled multicenter clinical trials are reported. Pergolide (taken once a day), was compared with bromocriptine (taken two to four times daily) regarding efficacy and safety in the reduction of PRL levels, the cessation of galactorrhea and amenorrhea, the improvement in sexual function, and tumor shrinkage in hyperprolactinemia without (trial I; 61 patients) and with radiologically evident pituitary tumors (trial II; 96 patients). Both drugs were equally effective in lowering PRL levels in both trials. A median optimal dose of 50 micrograms pergolide and 5 mg bromocriptine/day suppressed PRL levels in the 61 patients of trial I by more than 80%. During the 24-week investigational period galactorrhea disappeared in 96% and 87% of patients, whereas menstruation returned in 90% and 96% of patients, respectively. An equally high efficacy (optimal median dose: 75-100 micrograms pergolide, 7.5-10 mg bromocriptine daily) was observed in trial II, although the resumption of menses was less frequent than in the patients of trial I (50% and 58% of patients, respectively). Sexual dysfunction improved similarly on both drugs in about half the patients. In addition, tumor shrinkage occurred to a similar extent with both drugs. A high incidence of adverse events was noted especially at the initiation of therapy with both compounds: nausea, dizziness, vomiting, asthenia, headache, and decrease in blood pressure occurred at a similar incidence and extent during the use of pergolide and bromocriptine. Patients in trial I treated with pergolide reported a slightly higher incidence of fever, vasodilatation, and flu syndrome. Conclusions: in these 24-week studies comprising a total of 157 hyperprolactinemic patients, a once daily administration of pergolide was shown to be as safe and effective as the two to four times daily ingestion of bromocriptine. Longer-acting dopamine agonists like pergolide that can be taken once daily, are likely to increase the ease to adherence to the therapeutic regimen. This might result in a higher compliance to medical treatment of hyperprolactinemia. 
5	Outbreak of spontaneous staphylococcal arthritis and osteitis in mice. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterial species found in association with nongonococcal bacterial arthritis in humans. We present here the first description of spontaneous bacterial arthritis and osteitis in mice. Clinically, the most obvious findings were swelling and/or ankylosis of hindpaws and nodose changes of the tail. The prevalence of arthritis and osteitis ranged from 0% to greater than 50% of the mice studied, depending on the mouse strain. The most prominent histopathologic feature of the arthritis was hypertrophy of the synovial tissue and destruction of cartilage and underlying bone. Most of the S aureus-infected mice displayed an identical phage type, which was also the only S aureus phage type found in skin isolates from clinically healthy mice. However, a few S aureus isolates were not typeable, indicating that an additional strain(s) might cause bacterial arthritis in mice. 
5	Paralytic shellfish poisoning--Massachusetts and Alaska, 1990 [published erratum appears in MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 1991 Apr 12;40(14):242] Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a foodborne illness caused by consumption of shellfish or broth from cooked shellfish that contain either concentrated saxitoxin, an alkaloid neurotoxin, or related compounds. This report summarizes outbreaks of PSP that occurred in Massachusetts and Alaska in June 1990. 
4	Cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem component. A report of seven cases. Seven patients had a cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem femoral component. Four patients died in the operating room, and three patients were successfully resuscitated. When the three survivors were eventually discharged from the hospital, they had no known permanent cardiac, pulmonary, or neurological sequelae. Factors that were common to all of the patients were advanced age, osteoporotic bone, a previously undisturbed intramedullary canal, and use of a long-stem femoral component and several batches of methylmethacrylate. Hip arthroplasty with a long-stem femoral component is associated with substantial risk in these patients. Excessive pressurization of cement should be avoided, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring should be used when the described conditions are present. 
5	Endothelium-dependent responses in long-term human coronary artery bypass grafts. In the present study, responses of long-term human coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs) to known endothelium-dependent vasodilators, acetylcholine, calcium ionophore A23187, thrombin, and histamine, as well as authentic nitric oxide, the putative endothelium-derived relaxing factor, were studied. Sixteen CAGBs were isolated within 1-2 hours from hearts of 14 patients receiving a cardiac transplant. A total of 109 ring segments were prepared from these CABGs and studied in vitro. The duration of the CABGs ranged from 7 months to 12 years. Addition of acetylcholine (0.01-10 microM), calcium ionophore A23187 (0.01-1.0 microM), thrombin (0.01-1.0 unit/ml), and histamine (0.01-1.0 microM) consistently produced a dose- and endothelium-dependent relaxation, reaching a maximum of -35.3 +/- 3.3%, -45.3 +/- 5.5%, -26.9 +/- 4.8%, and -17.8 +/- 2.5% (mean +/- SEM), respectively. No significant difference was observed among the CABGs with different duration of transplantation, whereas the relaxant responses of different segments along the entire length of a CABG were markedly different. These latter differences in the endothelium-dependent responses appear to correlate inversely with the development of intimal proliferative lesions in these CABGs. Addition of nitric oxide (0.01-10 microM) produced a potent dose- and endothelium-independent relaxation, which was also slightly depressed in CABGs with severe intimal proliferation. These results demonstrate that long-term transplanted human saphenous vein grafts retain their endothelium-dependent responses and that development of severe intimal proliferative lesions, rather than the duration of the grafts, result in marked alterations in the reactivity of these transplanted CABGs. 
3	Symptomatic pineal cyst: case report. Pineal cysts are being described with increasing frequency since the advent of magnetic resonance imaging. Although pineal cysts are incidental findings in as many as 4% of magnetic resonance imaging studies, symptomatic pineal cysts are quite rare. We present a case of pineal cyst causing aqueductal obstruction with symptomatic hydrocephalus and resultant headache and syncope, which was treated by surgical resection. A review of the relevant literature and discussion follow. 
2	Starch peritonitis. A case report and clinicopathologic review. A case of starch peritonitis is presented with a review of the history of this continuing problem. The syndrome's presentation, diagnosis, histopathology and treatment are discussed. The rarity of starch peritonitis today may be due to more attention to glove washing by surgeons, fewer impurities in the glove powder or lack of recognition of the syndrome. In order to prevent a resurgence of the starch peritonitis syndrome we must continue to emphasize the importance of washing gloves, maintain the quality control and purity of the powder used, and be cognizant of the signs and symptoms so that such cases may be managed nonoperatively. 
4	Effect of maintenance digoxin therapy on aerobic performance and exercise left ventricular function in mild to moderate heart failure due to coronary artery disease: a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Despite 200 years of use, the ability of digitalis glycosides to improve exercise capacity in patients with congestive heart failure remains controversial, partly because of imprecise end points and suboptimal study design. Therefore, this question was examined in 10 ambulatory patients (8 men and 2 women) aged 46 to 70 years (mean 57.8) in sinus rhythm with mild to moderate chronic stable congestive heart failure due to coronary artery disease and systolic left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 32 +/- 12). All underwent maximal treadmill exercise with respiratory gas analysis and upright cycle ergometry with gated radionuclide angiography after 4 weeks of digoxin or placebo therapy, administered in a randomized double-blind crossover protocol. Neither treadmill exercise duration (7.7 +/- 2.3 versus 7.3 +/- 2.7 min) nor peak oxygen consumption (18.7 +/- 3.7 versus 18.4 +/- 5.4 ml/kg per min) differed between digoxin and placebo regimens. However, the change in peak oxygen consumption induced by digoxin was inversely related to the peak oxygen consumption during placebo therapy (r = -0.64, p less than 0.05). At maximal treadmill effort, heart rate (138 +/- 16 versus 141 +/- 21 beats/min), oxygen pulse (10.3 +/- 2.1 versus 9.9 +/- 2.2 ml/beat), ventilation (40.3 +/- 10.6 versus 42.0 +/- 10.8 liters/min) and ventilatory equivalent (29.4 +/- 4.8 versus 31.5 +/- 6.8) did not differ between digoxin and placebo treatment, although systolic blood pressure was higher during digoxin therapy (163.0 +/- 23.1 versus 153.2 +/- 25.3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). 
1	The physical state of human papillomavirus 16 DNA in cervical carcinoma and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Cervical carcinomas and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) were analyzed for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA using Southern blot hybridization. Of the five HPV types examined (HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 33), HPV 16 DNA was detected most frequently. In most HPV 16-positive carcinomas examined, HPV 16 DNA was present in an integrated state in cellular DNA with or without the coexistence of episomal species. In one case, however, only episomal species were detected. Among seven cases of HPV 16-positive CIN, four contained HPV 16 DNA only in the episomal state and the rest contained HPV 16 DNA only in the integrated state, but the coexistence of both states was not found. These results suggest that the integration of HPV 16 DNA is not necessary for cells to become malignant, although it is frequently associated with malignant cells. 
3	Severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption. A severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption is described. Data are presented to show a significant absorption of lidocaine through diseased skin when lidocaine cream is used as a local anesthetic. Awareness of this route of intoxication might be important in patients in whom neurologic or psychiatric symptoms develop while large amounts of lidocaine cream are being used. 
3	Effects of short spaceflights on mechanical characteristics of rat muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the contractile protein characteristics after 5-day (Cosmos 1514) and 7-day (Cosmos 1667) spaceflights. The experiments were performed on skinned fibers from the soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis, and plantaris muscles isolated from Wistar rats. A reduction in fiber diameter might explain the decrease in the maximal tension in the soleus, whereas this tension was unaltered in the gastrocnemius and the plantaris. Moreover the calcium sensitivity of the myofilament appeared modified in the soleus and in the gastrocnemius: The tension/pCa relationships were shifted toward higher calcium concentrations, indicating a decrease in the apparent calcium binding constant of the troponin C. The tension/pCa relationship appeared unaltered in the plantaris after spaceflight. Finally, the studies of the time to reach a steady tension indicated an increase in the rate of force development in the soleus and, on the contrary, a slowing down in the plantaris. No change in the gastrocnemius was found. The results were analyzed with references to the different muscle functions in disuse atrophy. 
2	Dyspareunia. Tracing the cause. Difficult or painful sexual intercourse is a sensitive topic for most women. The causes range from inflammation of the vulva and interstitial cystitis to marital discord. To exclude an organic disorder, a detailed pelvic examination with good lighting and magnification is in order. Dr DeWitt describes the technique for meticulous examination and discusses the diagnoses that need to be considered. 
4	Atrial fibrillation with cardiac tamponade as the initial manifestation of malignant pericarditis This article describes the case of a 72-year-old woman with cardiac tamponade and atrial fibrillation as the initial manifestation of a lymphoid malignancy. The pathogenesis of cardiac tamponade, various diagnostic modalities, and therapy of this condition are reviewed. 
1	Hyperplastic gastric polyps associated with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection and active gastritis. We report two cases of patients with 3-yr histories of upper gastrointestinal symptoms, hyperplastic gastric polyps, and active chronic gastritis. Biopsies retrospectively stained with Giemsa revealed the persistent presence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) in gastric biopsies of both patients throughout the 3 yr. After treatment with amoxicillin and bismuth subsalicylate, both became asymptomatic, one demonstrating disappearance and recurrence of the gastric polyps in conjunction with the HP. These cases demonstrate 3 yr of hyperplastic gastric polyps associated with HP and active gastritis. 
4	Antihypertensive effect and pharmacokinetics of nitrendipine in children. Nitrendipine, a new calcium-channel antagonist, was used to treat 25 children (aged 6 months to 17 years) with severe hypertension. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mean +/- SEM) fell from 148 +/- 2/99 +/- 2 mm Hg to 128 +/- 4/77 +/- 3 mm Hg after 24 hours and to 121 +/- 2/75 +/- 2 mm Hg after 2 weeks. No further reductions in systolic or diastolic blood pressure were observed after continued therapy. Transient reflex tachycardia occurred during the first week of therapy. Other adverse effects were uncommon and included headaches, flushing, palpitations, and edema. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated at steady state after an oral dose of 0.56 +/- 0.04 mg/kg in 13 children. Although absolute oral bioavailability could not be determined, estimates of the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, the apparent peak serum concentration, and the apparent time at which the peak serum concentration occurred indicated that both the rate of absorption and oral bioavailability are variable. Coadministration of nitrendipine with food decreased the rate of absorption and may have reduced oral bioavailability. A relationship between age and the apparent plasma elimination half-life of nitrendipine was not observed. Nitrendipine, 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg per dose administered orally every 6 to 12 hours, appeared to be an effective and safe treatment for resistant hypertension in infants and children. 
4	Ascites not due to congestive heart failure in a fetus with lupus-induced heart block. Hydrops developing in fetuses with lupus-associated heart block has usually been assumed to result from congestive heart failure. We present a case in which fetal ascites associated with complete heart block resolved promptly after administration of betamethasone and prednisone to the mother, who had anti-SSA and who developed clinical lupus erythematosus. This resolution occurred with no demonstrable change in fetal cardiac function. We conclude that an immune mechanism, rather than congestive heart failure, was responsible for the fetal ascites. 
1	The natural history of colorectal cancer. Opportunities for intervention. There is now a better understanding of the natural history of colorectal cancer, which has provided a basis for intervention to influence outcome. The possible interventions include earlier detection of colorectal cancer, removal of premalignant adenomas, demonstration of the mucosal field defect that precedes neoplasia to evaluate baseline risk and its change with dietary modification, and identification of inherited and dietary risk factors. Five controlled trials evaluating early detection of colorectal cancer with fecal occult blood testing have enrolled more than 309,000 patients. Early stage cancers with improved survival has been observed, but data on mortality reduction have not as yet been reported. Studies of patients with adenomas have demonstrated high synchronous and metachronous rates as a basis for complete colon evaluation initially and a surveillance follow-up program. Hyperproliferation and lack of normal differentiation have been observed as a field defect in the colon preceding neoplasia. Inherited factors have recently been shown to be important in a larger proportion of individuals destined to develop colorectal adenomas and cancer. These observations of the natural history of colorectal cancer have provided new opportunities for the application of radiologic and endoscopic techniques in diagnosis and surveillance; each examination has its merit. Further research is needed to answer many critical questions that have been raised regarding the impact of these interventions. 
2	Anal sphincter function after intersphincteric resection and stapled ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. This study was done to determine the effect of the direct ileal pouch-anal anastomosis upon pressure and sensory components of the anal canal and ileal pouch. These findings were related to postoperative continence. Thirty-three patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (25 continent, eight with episodic minor incontinence) were studied 3 +/- 0.3 and 25 +/- 5 months after ileostomy takedown. The maximum resting pressure in the anal canal was significantly lower in patients with an imperfect result (35 +/- 5 mm Hg) than in continent patients (44 +/- 5 mm Hg) (P less than 0.05). Postoperatively the maximum squeeze anal pressure was slightly greater in continent than in incontinent patients (99 +/- 8 mm Hg vs. 87 +/- 7 mm Hg) (P greater than 0.05). The postoperative recto-(ileo-)anal inhibitory reflex was present in 27 percent. The linear correlation between strength of rectal (ileal) distension and depth resp. duration of internal sphincter relaxation as preoperatively observed disappeared postoperatively in every group of patients. Simultaneous measurements of pouch and anal pressure in patients with imperfect results revealed a reduced positive pouch anal pressure gradient compared to the continent group. This low pouch-anal pressure gradient is thought to be responsible for the increased incidence of soiling in some of our patients. 
4	Platelet activation by emotional stress in patients with coronary artery disease. We studied the effects of experimentally induced emotional stress (mental arithmetic) on different hemodynamic parameters, catecholamine levels, and serum and platelet function tests in 25 postinfarction patients and in 10 apparently healthy, age-matched control subjects. Mental stress (10 minutes) induced significant increments in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, double product, and cardiac output, indicating a sympatho-adrenal stimulation that was confirmed by a significant increase in serum epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. All of the effects disappeared at minute 10 of recovery. Concomitantly, the test produced a significant increase in platelet aggregation (induced by 3 microM ADP or 1 microgram/ml collagen), the formation of circulating platelet aggregates, and an increase in thromboxane B2 levels in plasma and serum. These effects were also rapidly reversible. Similar activation of hemodynamic parameters and a similar but less evident increase in platelet function by emotional stress were observed in control subjects. A possible artifact due to factitious platelet activation by catheter sampling was excluded with experiments in which a 40-minute rest was introduced after the baseline period and before mental stress; platelet activation did not occur during baseline or rest periods, only after emotional stress. Furthermore, the antiplatelet drug dipyridamole reduced the stress-induced formation of platelet aggregates in postinfarction patients. These results demonstrate the existence of a direct link between emotional stress and platelet function and offer an explanation of one of the mechanisms through which mental stress may be involved in the development of coronary artery disease. 
2	Sucralfate used as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe erosive peptic esophagitis resulting from gastroesophageal reflux. A total of 36 patients with grade 2 or greater erosive esophagitis and an abnormal 24-h pH monitor study, were treated in a randomized, double-blind fashion to assess the efficacy of sucralfate suspension as adjunctive therapy to cimetidine for severe esophagitis secondary to gastroesophageal reflux. Treatment consisted of cimetidine, 300 mg qid and either sucralfate suspension (1 g/10 ml) or an identical placebo suspension, 10 ml after meals and 20 ml hs. Patients were treated for 12 wk unless endoscopic healing occurred earlier. Initial evaluation and monthly follow-up consisted of symptom monitoring, endoscopic evaluation and pre- and post-therapy esophageal manometry, Bernstein test, and 24-h pH monitoring. The combination of cimetidine and sucralfate suspension was superior to cimetidine alone in improving daytime heartburn symptoms (p less than 0.05) but not nighttime heartburn, dysphagia, or regurgitation. Sucralfate plus cimetidine improved the overall endoscopic outcome of esophagitis more than cimetidine alone (p less than 0.05). More patients exhibited endoscopic healing in the adjunctive sucralfate group than in the cimetidine-only group. Endoscopic healing, however, was not statistically different between groups. We conclude that sucralfate used as adjunctive therapy to cimetidine resulted in improvement of some of the symptoms of reflux, and probably increases the likelihood of complete healing of esophagitis, compared with cimetidine alone. 
3	Spinal cord injury after subclavian flap aortoplasty. An experimental study in piglets. Paraplegia is a rare but much feared complication of corrective surgery for coarctation of the aorta. The problem was studied in 31 newborn pigs submitted to subclavian flap aortoplasty. The aortic cross-clamping time ranged from 9-25 min. Twenty-three piglets with clamping times 9-18 min were neurologically intact, whereas eight with aortic clamping for 18-25 min became paraplegic. The clinical implications for newborn children with symptomatic aortic coarctation are discussed with regard to these experimental findings. 
5	Salpingoscopy in patients with contralateral ectopic pregnancy. Patients who experience a tubal pregnancy have a poor prognosis in terms of reproductive potential and are at increased risk of a repeat EP. Salpingoscopy is a new endoscopic technique that allows the detection of abnormalities of the tubal mucosa. In seven patients with a follow-up longer than 6 months, an IUP occurred only in patients with a normal ampullary mucosa, whereas a recurrent tubal pregnancy occurred in the patient that conceived with an abnormal tubal mucosa. These preliminary results suggest that salpingoscopy may constitute an important prognostic factor in these patients. 
2	Primary malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. A report of seven cases and a review of the literature. Mesothelioma of the peritoneum is a rare malignant neoplasm easily mistaken by both surgeon and pathologist for one of the more common neoplasms of the abdomen. Review of our records from metropolitan-area hospitals for the past 15 years identified seven patients with primary peritoneal mesotheliomas. Their diagnosis, management, and survival is analyzed. We report a case of an extended survivor (7 years) and one of a long-term survivor (15 years), as well as what we believe to be the only case in the literature presenting with a coexistent malignant neoplasm. Prevention of this commonly fatal neoplasm is linked to avoiding occupational exposure to asbestos; long-term survival for a few patients may be achieved with correct identification of the neoplasm and aggressive management. This report includes a review of the literature. 
4	Drug-induced supraventricular tachycardia: a case report of fluoxetine. We report the occurrence of supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension in a 54-year-old woman after maintenance therapy with fluoxetine. Although cases of tachycardia and palpitations have been reported, supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension have not been directly attributed to fluoxetine. 
3	Acute tolerance in morphine analgesia: continuous infusion and single injection in rats. This study aimed to determine whether the decline of the analgesic effect of morphine with a continuous infusion or that after a single injection correlates with the changes in brain concentration of morphine. The analgesic effect of morphine and its brain and serum concentrations were determined with a continuous 8-h infusion at a constant rate and after a single subcutaneous injection of the agent. The analgesic effect was determined by measuring the threshold of motor response to noxious stimulation. Brain and serum concentrations of morphine were detected by radioimmunoassay with the use of 125I-labeled morphine. With the constant-rate (4 mg.kg-1.h-1, intravenous) morphine infusion, the peak of analgesia could not be maintained: the increase in the pain threshold at 2 h was 1,003 g and at 8h was 286 g (a decrease in analgesia by 72%, P less than 0.0002). At the same time, the brain morphine concentration tended to increase, to 278 ng/g at 2 h and 329 ng/g at 8 h. After the single morphine injection (6 mg/kg, subcutaneous), recovery from analgesia occurred at a much faster rate than did the decrease in morphine brain concentration; the decrease in pain threshold was 79% at 90 vs. 30 min after the injection (P less than 0.0001), and the corresponding decrease in brain concentration was 28% (NS). The absence of correlation between analgesia and morphine brain concentration both with the constant-rate morphine infusion and after the single injection suggests the development of acute tolerance, which is pharmacodynamic in nature. 
3	Kindling susceptibility and genetic seizure predisposition in inbred mice. Olfactory bulb kindling rates were studied in two inbred strains of genetically seizure-prone mice (DBA/2 and El) and in three non-epileptic inbred strains [C57BL/6 (B6), ddY, and C3H/He (C3H)]. None of the DBA/2 mice had been stimulated to seizure before or during the kindling and all mice were studied at 4-6 weeks of age, before development of spontaneous or movement-induced seizure activity in the El strain. The audiogenically seizure-susceptible DBA/2 mice required the fewest number of stimulations to reach stage 5 seizure (mean +/- SE = 4.0 +/- 0.6). The nonepileptic C3H mice required the most stimulations to reach stage 5 seizures (22.6 +/- 1.4). Kindling rates for B6 (9.6 +/- 0.6), El (14.8 +/- 1.1), and ddY (18.5 +/- 1.0) strains were intermediate, and the kindling rate for each strain was significantly different from that of the other strains. These findings show that the seizure-susceptible El mouse kindles more rapidly than the genetically similar but nonepileptic ddY control and suggest that an inherited seizure susceptibility accelerates the kindling rate. Nonepileptic B6 mice kindled more rapidly than El mice, however, suggesting that genetic factors other than those that influence seizure susceptibility are of primary importance in the determination of the kindling rate. 
5	The surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. I. Summary of the current concepts of the mechanisms of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia that is frequently resistant to medical therapy and has no satisfactory surgical therapy. The development of an effective surgical procedure to treat atrial fibrillation has been hampered by the paucity of clinically relevant information on the basic mechanisms responsible for the arrhythmia. This paper summarizes the current concepts of the electrophysiologic abnormalities in atrial flutter and fibrillation. 
5	Do life events or depression exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease? A prospective study. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether depressed mood or life events are associated with an exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. DESIGN: A prospective study of a consecutive sample of patients with relapsing inflammatory bowel disease, followed by monthly questionnaires and periodic office visits. SETTING: A referral-based gastroenterology clinic at a medical school. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 32 patients with inflammatory bowel disease who had had at least one relapse in a 2-year period after entry into the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Social Readjustment Rating Scale (measuring life events), the Beck Depression Inventory (a visual analog scale for depressed mood) and an inventory of intestinal symptoms were completed monthly by each subject with a 78% rate of compliance. A mean of 2.2 exacerbations was seen per subject during the study period. Life events were not temporally associated with changes in intestinal symptoms. Significant associations were found between intestinal symptoms and the two mood scales (P less than 0.05 for each), but no directionality in symptom occurrence could be detected in a time-lagged analysis. The results were similar when the months preceding exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease were analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS: Although these findings suggest that mood changed concurrently with exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, no evidence indicated that stressful life events or depressed mood precipitated exacerbations in this study group. 
2	Esophageal candidiasis in AIDS. Successful therapy with clotrimazole vaginal tablets taken by mouth. In this paper we describe the results of oral therapy of esophageal candidiasis with clotrimazole vaginal tablets in 25 homosexual men with AIDS, of whom 19 had oral candidiasis and 16 had esophageal symptoms. Therapy with clotrimazole vaginal tablets, 100 mg, taken by mouth cleared the esophageal symptoms, oral candidiasis, and esophageal lesions completely in all 25 men. Clotrimazole vaginal tablets are a useful alternative to other antifungal agents for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis in AIDS patients. 
5	Delayed hearing loss after neurovascular decompression. We report two unusual cases of delayed hearing loss after neurovascular decompression of structures within the cerebellopontine angle. In the first case, the patient noted a unilateral hearing loss 3 weeks after undergoing vascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve for tic douloureux. This gradually improved over an 18-month period. In the second case, the patient awoke on the 4th day after vascular decompression of the facial nerve for hemifacial spasm with a bilateral hearing loss that has remained unchanged after the onset. These are examples of delayed acoustic dysfunction occurring with a shift in surgically freed vessels and may have been induced by newly directed neurovascular compression or distortion. 
3	The "stuck twin" phenomenon: ultrasonographic findings, pregnancy outcome, and management with serial amniocenteses. Thirteen consecutive twin pregnancies affected by the "stuck twin" phenomenon were reviewed to determine the potential benefit of serial amniocenteses. The fetal survival rate for the eight pregnancies that underwent serial amniocenteses was 69% (11 of 16 fetuses). This is significantly improved compared with a fetal survival rate of 20% among the five preceding pregnancies managed without serial amniocenteses at the same institution (p = 0.01). It is also markedly improved compared with a combined fetal survival rate of 16% among 48 previously reported pregnancies with the stuck twin phenomenon managed without serial amniocenteses (p less than 0.0001). Survival correlated with the absence of concomitant pregnancy complications (i.e., maternal hypertension or intractable labor) and with the absence of severe fetal structural abnormalities. Procedural complications occurred in three of eight pregnancies (37.5%) managed with serial amniocenteses and was attributed as a cause of fetal death in one case. Two of 11 survivors (18%) had complications after serial amniocenteses including brain infarction and renal tubular necrosis. Serial amniocenteses may significantly improve the survival rate of twin gestations affected by the stuck twin phenomenon but may be associated with complications among survivors. 
1	Surgical staging of cervical cancer. Noninvasive radiologic methods to detect paraaortic lymph node metastases are reliable when combined with FNA of enlarged lymph nodes. However, the sensitivity is low, and undetected microscopic metastases leads to treatment failure. These patients with paraaortic lymph node metastasis are not treated with extended-field radiation, and they all die within 3 years. The CT scanning is probably the best diagnostic method to evaluate cervical cancer, because it can assess the primary tumor, the urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, liver parenchyma, and retroperitoneum. It also permits the guidance of FNA and the arrangement of radiation ports. Surgical staging provides the direct assessment of the peritoneal cavity and the retroperitoneal spaces. Metastatic tumor, including enlarged lymph nodes, can be resected, but this is of dubious benefit. The operative morbidity is acceptable, with fewer intestinal complications when the extraperitoneal approach is used, and long-term morbidity is minimal when appropriate paraaortic radiation doses are employed (less than 5,000 cGy). Surgical staging has provided data on the frequency of paraaortic lymph node metastasis by stage of cervical cancer, and thus, treatment strategies can be better developed. Extended-field radiation results in 5-year survival rates of 20-25% in patients with microscopic paraaortic lymph node metastasis, patients who would not survive without the treatment. However, surgical staging has produced only a modest boost in survival rates, because of the high rate of pelvic and systemic failure. When extended-field radiation is used prophylactically or in patients with probable lymph node metastasis seen on radiographic studies, survival rates are similar to patients irradiated after surgical staging finds paraaortic lymph node disease. As our ability to predict, and detect nonsurgically, positive paraaortic node disease improves, extended radiation (or other adjuvant therapy) could be used more frequently without operation in patients who are at high risk for metastatic disease. In a study by Haie et al, prophylactic paraaortic radiation was given to patients at high risk for paraaortic metastasis. In patients with a high probability of local disease control, paraaortic radiation significantly reduced the incidence of paraaortic and distant metastases. Patients with known paraaortic lymph node metastases frequently have occult systemic metastases. In these same patients, pelvic failure is also common. Thus, until effective systemic therapies emerge, a marked improvement in survival is unlikely in patients who have paraaortic lymph node metastasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Inner ear cholesteatoma and the preservation of cochlear function. Labyrinthine destruction by direct cholesteatoma invasion has always been considered a serious threat to the inner ear function. A number of reports in the literature have cited both patients who had preservation of hearing despite widespread erosion of the labyrinth by cholesteatoma and patients who had retained auditory function despite surgical removal of the matrix from the labyrinth. In most cases the vestibular portion of the inner ear was invaded but cases of cochlear involvement have been described as well. Twelve cases with pre-operative auditory function preservation despite extensive labyrinthine destruction treated at our Institution are reported. Seven cases retained cochlear function post-operatively. Possible explanations of this occurrence and implications of related with hearing preservation in the presence of widespread inner ear destruction by chronic inflammatory disease are discussed. 
3	The progression of mild idiopathic dementia in a community population. Thirty-one subjects aged 75 years and over who were identified as suffering from mild, idiopathic dementia in a large community survey were reviewed at annual intervals for 2 years. Diagnoses and severity ratings were based on defined criteria following a mental state examination, a medical and psychiatric history, detailed cognitive testing, and an interview with relatives or other key informants. Fourteen subjects became more severely demented within 2 years. The initial cognitive test battery failed to reveal any differences between respondents whose dementia advanced and those whose condition remained unchanged, but, in the former group, subjects' symptoms had been present for longer, and a greater proportion had been recognised as demented, or possibly demented, by their general practitioners. We suggest that subjects whose dementia progressed had actually been more severely disabled at the time of identification. 
4	Studies of myocardial protection in the immature heart. I. Enhanced tolerance of immature versus adult myocardium to global ischemia with reference to metabolic differences. This study compares the metabolism and functional responses of adult and immature hearts to a standard ischemic insult. Ten adult dogs (25 to 27 kg) and 10 puppies (6 to 10 weeks old) underwent 45 minutes of aortic clamping on bypass. Preoperative and postoperative ventricular performance (Starling curves), biochemical factors, and water content were measured. Global ischemia in adults produced a 30% mortality rate (3/10) and low output syndrome in survivors (33% recovery of stroke work index). Conversely, all puppies survived and stroke work index returned to 85% of control, with less edema developing (0.4% versus 2% water gain, p less than 0.05). Puppies expended comparable glycogen stores but used more glutamate (15.4 versus 8.6 mumol/gm dry weight), produced more alanine (18.9 versus 6.4 mumol, p less than 0.05), succinate (19 versus 8.2 mumol, p less than 0.05), and malate (2.6 versus 0.15 mumol, p less than 0.05) during ischemia, and recovered better postischemic aerobic metabolism (410 versus 255 nmol tissue pyruvate, p less than 0.05). We conclude that tolerance of immature hearts to ischemia is related to amino acid utilization by transamination and increased substrate level phosphorylation, as occurring in diving mammals, suggesting retention of intrautero adaptive mechanisms. 
5	Carotid endarterectomy for chronic retinal ischemia. Carotid arterial disease may result in a variety of ischemic ocular problems that can eventually lead to permanent blindness. From 1984 to 1988, 18 patients underwent reconstruction of the carotid artery in an attempt to restore normal retinal arterial flow and, thereby, reverse or prevent progression of ischemic oculopathy. During a mean period of 21 months after carotid arterial reconstruction, subjective improvement in vision as well as a resolution in eye and periorbital pain was reported in 87.5 per cent of the patients. Measured visual acuity improved or stabilized in 94.4 per cent; macular photostress recovery times improved in 87.5 per cent, funduscopic examinations noted improvement or resolution in ischemic signs in 93.3 per cent and intraocular pressures improved in two of three patients. One patient experienced recurrent episodes of amaurosis fugax, which resolved after two weeks and did not recur. A second patient experienced an increase in intraocular pressures with visual deterioration, required laser photocoagulation after which the condition of the patient stabilized but only after significant visual impairment. Carotid arterial reconstruction is effective for the treatment of ischemic oculopathy and is most beneficial if performed early, before the onset of irreversible neovascular glaucoma. 
2	Aetiology of pancreatic cancer Curative surgery is possible in only a small minority of patients with pancreatic cancer and, to date, responses to chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been disappointing. To make any impact on the incidence of the disease a clearer understanding of its aetiology is required. This review explores present knowledge of the aetiology and epidemiology of pancreatic cancer. 
5	Ascites revealing peritoneal and hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis with peliosis in agnogenic myeloid metaplasia: case report and review of the literature. A 61-year-old man presented with ascites in the course of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM). Ascitic fluid was exudative and contained mature and immature leukocytes, erythroid cells, and megakaryocytes as observed on a bone marrow smear. Peritoneal biopsy showed myeloid metaplasia, and liver biopsy revealed intrasinusoidal myeloid metaplasia and peliosis. Ascites cleared after abdominal radiotherapy but treatment resulted in transient aplasia. Subsequently, portal hypertension was demonstrated by hepatic transjugular catheterization. Complications of splenomegaly led to splenectomy and splenorenal shunt followed by fatal acute hepatitis and septic shock. A review of the literature and an analysis of mechanisms of ascites occurring in AMM, especially peritoneal implants of myeloid tissue and occurrence of peliosis in myeloproliferative disorders, are presented. 
4	The dynamics of platelet thrombus formation rate, thrombus retention time, and rate of embolization on a control and heparin bonded polyurethane angio-catheter. The dynamics of platelet deposition and embolization from control and heparin bonded polyurethane catheters (CPC and HBPC) was evaluated with In-111 labeled autologous platelets (IN-PLT) and a computerized gamma camera (CGC). Ten non-heparinized dogs (18-25 kg) were catheterized in both femoral arteries with 10 cm of CPC and HBPC (5 Fr., Cordis) 24 hr after injection of 300-420 microCi of In-PLT, and imaged for 3 hr with the computerized gamma camera. The regional platelet deposition curves (RPDC) indicated multiple peaks and valleys; the curves were analyzed for early rate of thrombus formation (upswing), thrombus retention time (full width at half maxima of the RPDC-peak), and rate of embolization (downswing) on both catheters. The four parameters (mean +/- SD) of thrombosis on catheters and integral of the radioactivity time curve for the 3 hr duration of imaging were calculated from normalized counts/sec. The rate of thrombus formation and rate of embolization are higher for the control than HBPC, suggesting that heparin-bonding decreases the early rate of thrombosis and embolization. The thrombus adhesivity and retention time appear shorter for the control catheter, indicating that the control thrombogenic catheter forms multiple thrombi and emboli than HBPC. The integral appears larger for the control catheter than HBPC. In vivo (dynamic) studies, in vitro studies, and critical analyses of the radioactivity time curve were essential for complete evaluation of thrombogenicity of catheters and other cardiovascular prostheses. 
2	Jejunal-rectal fistula as a complication of postoperative radiotherapy. We present the case of a patient with an unusual, complex enteric fistula with multiple tracts and associated abscesses. The fistula was a late complication of radiotherapy, administered three years earlier, after resection for carcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Most of the small bowel was involved in the radiation-induced disease. A wide resection was performed successfully. This report reviews current literature on intra-abdominal postradiotherapy injuries, particularly intestinal fistulae. 
4	Coronary bypass surgery: is the operation different today? Patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting have undergone an evolution in recent years. To document this change, we analyzed two groups of patients in 1981 (n = 1586) and 1987 (n = 1513) to document preoperative and postoperative variables important in determining immediate morbidity and mortality after isolated coronary bypass. Between 1981 and 1987, patients were found to be older (greater than or equal to 70 years, 8.7% versus 21.8%, p less than 0.0001), more often diabetic (15% versus 24%, p less than 0.0001), have a greater prevalence of triple vessel disease (14.5% versus 46.1%, p less than 0.0001), and have more left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 0.60 +/- 14 versus 0.54 +/- 13, p less than 0.0001). To facilitate analysis and because of overlap between subgroups, we subdivided patients into three subgroups for statistical comparison of the years 1981 and 1987: subgroup I, no prior procedure (n = 1546 in 1981 and 1396 in 1987); subgroup II, optimal group (n = 503 in 1981 and 292 in 1987, and defined as no prior procedure, ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 and age less than 65 years); subgroup III, patients having reoperations (n = 40 in 1981 and 117 in 1987). Internal mammary artery grafting was infrequently used in 1981 but was used in 72.1% in 1987. Major postoperative morbidity between the 2 years for the total population increased significantly: need for intraaortic balloon pumping, 1.4% versus 4.7%, p less than 0.0001; myocardial infarction 3.5% versus 5.5%, p less than 0.008; stroke, 1.4% versus 2.8%, p less than 0.008; and wound infection, 1.0% versus 3.0%, p less than 0.001. Wound infection (all types) in 1987 was increased sevenfold in patients having a perioperative myocardial infarction (0.7% versus 5%, p less than 0.0001). For young patients with good left ventricular function (subgroup II), there was no increase in these morbid events between 1981 and 1987. Hospital mortality in the total population increased significantly between 1981 and 1987 from 1.2% to 3.1% (p less than 0.0002), respectively. It was lowest for the patients in optimal condition (subgroup II) in both years, 0.8% versus 1.1%, and highest for reoperative patients, 5.3% versus 4.3%. In 1981, 58% of patients (503/870) were in the optimal group compared with 35% (292/828) in 1987 (p less than 0.0001). The last six years have seen a progressive trend in surgically treating older, sicker patients who have more complex disease, with a significant reduction in the best candidate group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
4	Job dimensions associated with severe disability due to cardiovascular disease. This study explored associations among job activities and disability due to cardiovascular disease by merging national disability data with independently-obtained job activity data. Disability data were taken from a 1978 U.S. health interview survey (n = 9855). Expert ratings of job activities (dimensions) were obtained from a job analysis database (n = 2485 occupations). The two databases were merged such that job dimension data were imputed to each occupation in the disability database. Odds ratios for cardiovascular disability were calculated for scores in the second, third, and fourth quartiles for each of the 32 job dimensions, using scores in the first quartile as the standard. Job dimensions associated with cardiovascular disability were (a) hazardous situations; (b) vigilant work and responsibility for others; (c) exchanging job-related information; and (d) attention to devices. Occupations identified with high scores on these job dimensions included transportation jobs (air traffic controllers, airline pilots and attendants, bus drivers, locomotive engineers, truck drivers), teachers (preschool, adult education), and craftsmen/foremen (machinists, carpenters, and foremen). 
5	Pancreatic ascites: treatment by continuous somatostatin infusion. Two male patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse were admitted with pancreatic ascites (high concentration of amylase, raised protein concentration, no specific cytologic features). Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) confirmed gross ascites and inflammation of the pancreas in both patients, and a pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas in one of them. Treatment with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and a H2-blocking agent was instituted and continued for 4 and 2 wk, respectively. Due to lack of improvement, somatostatin infusion (250 micrograms/h) was started. During the next few days, there was a rapid improvement of the clinical status, and the production of ascites ceased. We conclude that somatostatin infusion should be tried before any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic intervention in patients with pancreatic ascites. 
3	Recurrence of acoustic neurilemoma as a malignant spindle-cell neoplasm. Case report. A 75-year-old man presented with a right cerebellopontine angle tumor 11 months after complete macroscopic resection of a right acoustic neurilemoma. Histological examination of the recurrent tumor showed a malignant spindle-cell neoplasm with positive staining for S-100 protein. The patient had no stigmata of von Recklinghausen's disease. It is proposed that this recurrence represents progression from a benign to a malignant acoustic nerve-sheath tumor, an event that is extremely rare outside the clinicopathological context of neurofibromatosis. 
1	Increased expression of the multidrug-resistance gene in undifferentiated sarcoma. We analyzed multidrug-resistance gene (mdr1 gene) expression in a patient with undifferentiated sarcoma of the liver using the cloned cDNA for the mdr1 gene. Tissue samples were available at the time of initial diagnosis and of two intracranial relapses after chemotherapy with a regimen including doxorubicin and teniposide. The level of mdr1 gene expression was increased sevenfold in the intracranial tumor at the time of first relapse and 11-fold at the second relapse. This case may be an example of acquired multidrug resistance associated with overexpression of the mdr1 gene. 
5	Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis. Six patients with evidence of secondary syphilis presented with visual loss in both eyes caused by large, placoid, yellowish lesions with faded centers at the level of the pigment epithelium in the macula and juxtapapillary areas. All eyes had vitreitis. All of the lesions showed a similar fluorescein angiographic pattern of early hypofluorescence and late staining. Five patients had mucocutaneous lesions typical of secondary syphilis. All five patients treated with antibiotics had prompt improvement in visual function and resolution of the fundus lesions. The ophthalmoscopic and angiographic appearance of these posterior fundus lesions was sufficiently characteristic to suggest a diagnosis of secondary syphilis. Modification of the host response to syphilis by human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection may be partly responsible for this peculiar fundus picture. Three of the four patients tested positive for HIV. 
2	Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is an extremely rare entity. Because of its unusual clinical presentation and confusing histologic picture, a diagnosis of malignancy is frequently made. Thus the surgeon is closely involved with the case and extensive procedures are not uncommon. However, this lesion is benign and will even regress spontaneously, making radical surgical procedures contraindicated. The difficulty lies in establishing an accurate diagnosis and the histologic pitfalls of this particular process. Conservative therapy can then be applied, avoiding surgical morbidity. 
1	DNA flow cytometry of colorectal carcinoma: correlation of DNA stemlines with other prognostic indices. DNA flow cytometry (FCM) was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of 38 surgically resected colorectal carcinomas (CRC). Forty-seven percent of tumors exhibited aneuploidy and 53% were diploid. Seventy-two percent of patients in the aneuploid but only 35% in the diploid group were alive after a mean follow-up of 30.7 and 28.8 months (p = 0.01), and 5-yr survival of 56.7% and 11.7%, respectively (p less than 0.05). The site of tumor location, Dukes' stage, and serum CEA level did not predict a certain DNA stemline. However, irrespective of the ploidy pattern, a serum CEA level greater than 5.0 was associated with a higher mortality and poor 5-yr survival (p less than 0.005). Similarly, advanced Dukes' stage was associated with higher mortality (p less than 0.05). Forty-six percent of the patients with lesions that were Dukes' B2 or advanced stage received adjuvant therapy. Eighty-five percent of this subgroup of patients died; 18% of these patients had aneuploid tumors. The role of FCM in the assessment of prognosis of CRC deserves further clinical evaluation in a randomized control trial. 
3	Misperceptions of comprehension difficulties of stroke patients by doctors, nurses and relatives. Doctors, nurses and relatives involved with 30 recently aphasic stroke patients were asked to predict how the patient would perform on a comprehension test. Results show that not only do doctors, nurses and relatives underestimate the receptive disability of these patients, but they also illustrate a lack of agreement between health professionals. Implications for management are considered. 
4	Elective resection of 332 abdominal aortic aneurysms in a southern West Virginia community during a recent five-year period. This study analyzed 33 variables that might potentially affect outcome in a series of 332 consecutive elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs in a southern West Virginia community. One of the interesting features of this series was that the repairs were done by 22 surgeons with varying degrees of experience. The mortality and complication rates were compared for various potential risk factors by both univariant methods (chi 2, Fisher's exact, and Student t tests) and multivariant methods of analysis. Our early mortality (2.1%) and postoperative complication rates were consistent with those of other series. With multiple linear regression models, five factors were selected as significant independent risk factors associated with an increasing number of postoperative complications: the number of blood transfusions (p less than 0.0001), left renal vein ligation (p less than 0.0001), the presence of greater than 50% renal artery stenosis (p = 0.0012), the lesser experience of the surgeon (p = 0.0203), and the history of prior cardiac catheterization (p = 0.0245). The only factor statistically correlated with mortality rate was an increased number of postoperative complications (p less than 0.0001). Neither postoperative complications nor mortality rate was found to be significant and independently influenced by other demographic, clinical, or operative factors. It is tempting to speculate that surgeons with less experience might be well served to refer patients with significant renal artery stenosis and coronary artery disease. Our mortality and complication rates were not increased by performing preoperative angiography and therefore prudent surgeons may find this helpful in selecting patients for safer repair. 
2	Fibronectin-related substance located in the chief cells of human and rat gastric mucosa. A novel substance located in the chief cells of human and rat gastric mucosa, which was detected immunologically by either polyclonal or monoclonal antihuman fibronectin (FN) antibodies, is reported. All three polyclonal antihuman FN antibodies used in this study reacted immunohistologically exclusively with the chief cells. Monoclonal antibody against C-terminal peptide or cell binding peptide reacted clearly with the human chief cells, but monoclonal antibodies against FN N-terminal and midmolecule failed to react with the cells. Western blot analysis of the rat gastric mucosal extract with polyclonal antihuman FN antibody showed that this substance has a molecular weight of about 70,000 Da. Therefore, this substance appears to be a fragment containing the C-terminal peptide of whole molecule FN and thus in the present study is named FN-related substance (FNRS). In a further study with ethanol-induced ulcer model of the rat, the physiological significance of FNRS was examined. The FNRS decreased remarkably, in a dose-dependent manner, in the fundic mucosa of the rats that ingested ethanol. The FNRS appeared to be associated with development of mucosal damage and repair, subsequently playing, in part, an important role in the gastric mucosal protection mechanism. 
1	Magnetic resonance imaging in neurological disorders. To investigate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in neurological disorders, 115 children were studied in two groups. Group A (78 patients) was studied by paired computed tomography and MRI cranial scans. Group B (37 patients) was studied by paired computed tomography assisted myelography (CTM) and MRI spinal scans. In group A, the scans were generally equivalent for supratentorial tumours and for investigating fits, hydrocephalus, benign intracranial hypertension, and cerebral atrophies, but MRI scanning was superior for posterior fossa tumours and cysts. In group B, MRI scans were superior for intramedullary spinal tumours, spinal dysraphic problems with tethering or syrinx, and were complementary to CTM in diastematomyelia. 
1	Inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth in the brain. Suppression of endothelial cell turnover by penicillamine and the depletion of copper, an angiogenic cofactor. Microvascular proliferation, a hallmark of malignant brain tumors, represents an attractive target of anticancer research, especially because of the quiescent nonproliferative endothelium of the normal brain. Cerebral neoplasms sequester copper, a trace metal that modulates angiogenesis. Using a rabbit brain tumor model, normocupremic animals developed large vascularized VX2 carcinomas. By contrast, small, circumscribed, relatively avascular tumors were found in the brains of rabbits copper-depleted by diet and penicillamine treatment (CDPT). The CDPT rabbits showed a significant decrease in serum copper, copper staining of tumor cell nuclei, microvascular density, the tumor volume, endothelial cell turnover, and an increase in the vascular permeability (breakdown of the blood-brain barrier), as well as peritumoral brain edema. In non-tumor-bearing animals, CDPT did not alter the vascular permeability or the brain water content. CDPT also inhibited the intracerebral growth of the 9L gliosarcoma in F-344 rats, with a similar increase of the peritumoral vascular permeability and the brain water content. CDPT failed to inhibit tumor growth and the vascularization of the VX2 carcinoma in the thigh muscle or the metastases to the lung, findings that may reflect regional differences in the responsiveness of the endothelium, the distribution of copper, or the activity of cuproenzymes. Metabolic and pharmacologic withdrawal of copper suppresses intracerebral tumor angiogenesis; angiosuppression is a novel biologic response modifier for the in situ control of tumor growth in the brain. 
3	Problems and solutions of pedicle screw plate fixation of lumbar spine. Fifty-seven patients with low back pain and sciatica of various causes were reviewed with reference to problems associated with pedicle plate fixation of the lumbar spine. Eleven percent of patients had neurologic problems postoperatively and 3.5% (two patients) had severe sensory impairments. All patients had this complication in the early phases of the study. Of 297 screws, 17 broke, ie, 5.7%. These breakages occurred in 12 of 57 patients (21%). In patients with spondylolisthesis, the degree of slip correction averaged 53% postoperatively, which decreased to 35% at the 1-year follow-up. Slip angle was maintained after correction. Pedicle screw plate fixation is an effective form of immobilization of the lumbar spine used in achieving arthrodesis. The surgeon must be fully trained in methodology. It is recommended that screw and plate materials be improved to prevent screw breakage. 
1	Relationship of 4F2 antigen with local growth and metastatic potential of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. The 4F2 antigen is a cell-membrane glycoprotein which arises early in the G0-G1 phases of the cell cycle. This molecule is present in all established human cell lines and most malignant human cells. The authors used an indirect immunophosphatase method to study 50 squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx and ten lymph-node metastases, corresponding to six primary tumors, for 4F2 expression. The tumors showed several patterns of 4F2 staining which were correlated with different behaviors and prognoses of the neoplasms. Three different patterns (no staining, peripheral staining, and diffuse 4F2 expression) are described as are their relationships with metastatic behavior of the carcinomas. Tumors with metastases were found only in the third group (P = 0.0001). These results led to the following conclusions: (1) the 4F2 antigen is present in squamous cell carcinomas; (2) its distribution reflects the tumor-spreading pattern; and (3) it correlates with differentiation and metastatic behavior. 
5	Pneumococcal anticapsular antibodies in patients with chronic cardiovascular and obstructive lung disease in The Netherlands. Differences in pneumococcal anticapsular antibody concentrations were assessed among patients with various chronic disorders and among young (25-35 years of age) and older adults (55-65 years). Antibody concentrations were determined by ELISA, using the whole 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine as antigen. No differences in mean or distribution of serum antibody concentrations were found among young adults (either healthy or asthmatic) or among older adults (healthy or with chronic obstructive pulmonary or chronic cardiovascular disease). Each group included individuals with low antibody levels. Therefore, the enhanced susceptibility to pneumococcal infections reported for some groups at risk, that is, elderly individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary or chronic cardiovascular disease, cannot be attributed solely to low anticapsular antibody concentrations. 
5	Injection or heat probe for bleeding ulcer. A prospective randomized trial was performed to compare the efficacy of endoscopic epinephrine injection and heat probe treatment in actively bleeding peptic ulcers. Emergency endoscopy in 1758 patients over an 18-month period identified 132 patients with active ulcer bleeding. They were randomized to receive either endoscopic epinephrine injection or heat probe treatment. After endoscopy, the patients were transferred to the surgical gastroenterology ward and were managed by surgeons unaware of the treatment option. Bleeding was initially controlled in 96% by epinephrine injection and in 83% by heat probe (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in outcome as measured by transfusion requirement (4.5 units vs. 3.8 units), emergency surgery (20% vs. 22%), hospital stay (8 days vs. 7 days), and mortality (2 vs. 4) between the injection group and the heat probe group. Two patients in the heat probe group experienced perforation. We conclude that both endoscopic epinephrine injection and heat probe treatment are effective in stopping bleeding from actively bleeding ulcers. Epinephrine injection is technically easier to perform and has a higher initial success rate. 
1	Severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption. A severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption is described. Data are presented to show a significant absorption of lidocaine through diseased skin when lidocaine cream is used as a local anesthetic. Awareness of this route of intoxication might be important in patients in whom neurologic or psychiatric symptoms develop while large amounts of lidocaine cream are being used. 
1	Pleomorphic adenoma in the periphery of the lung. Report of a case and review of the literature. A pleomorphic adenoma of the lung recurred after 9 years. The primary tumor consisted mainly of cartilaginous and fibrous elements with a small area of epithelial cell nests, whereas the second one possessed epithelial cell nests with cartilaginous stroma. Immunohistochemical studies showed that both tumors had neoplastic cells with immunoreactive S100, keratin, actin, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acid protein-positive cytoplasm. The primary tumor, which was resected from the periphery of the lung, was not connected with the trachea or the bronchus macroscopically. To our knowledge, the literature contains only six reports of pleomorphic adenoma in the lung. 
5	Achalasia in the elderly. Effects of aging on clinical presentation and outcome. Clinical and manometric data from 13 elderly subjects with idiopathic achalasia (mean age 79 +/- 2 years) were compared with findings from younger subjects with the same disease (n = 79) to see if aging altered the presentation and outcome of this motor disorder. Fewer elderly subjects complained of chest pain (27% vs 53%), and the pain was significantly less severe (P less than 0.01). Other presenting features (including sex, duration of symptoms, and presence and severity of dysphagia) did not differ between the groups. Across all patients, age weakly and inversely correlated with residual postdeglutitive lower esophageal sphincter; (LES) pressure (R = -0.34), and residual pressure was significantly lower in the older subjects (8.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg vs. 11.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; P = 0.02). No differences in basal LES pressure or esophageal-body contraction amplitudes were present between the groups. Initial success with pneumatic dilation was similar in the two subject groups, but the number of older subjects available for analysis was too small to draw strong conclusions. These results indicate that aging decreases the elevation of LES residual pressure that occurs with achalasia. As elderly achalasia patients also present with less chest pain, the findings may be interrelated. 
5	The effect of flunarizine on essential tremor. We investigated the effect of flunarizine treatment (10 mg/d) in 17 subjects with essential tremor in a double-blind placebo-controlled design. Tremor was assessed by clinical scoring, tremographic recordings, and subjective rating by subjects. Of the 15 subjects who completed the study, 13 showed improvement. We conclude that flunarizine is effective treatment for essential tremor. 
4	Short-term effect of hepatic arterial versus portal venous reperfusion on energy levels of liver tissue. The hepatic artery and the portal vein blood vary in flow, oxygenation, and hormonal content. It was uncertain which blood supply has a greater effect on the recuperative process of the hepatocytes in the ischemic liver during the initial reperfusion. The ability of the liver cells to restore its energy phosphates is related to the viability of the liver. This study was designed to determine the differences of the high energy phosphate in the liver predicated upon whether reflow was first provided by either the hepatic artery or the portal vein followed by subsequent reperfusion from both vessels. The recovery of ATP upon 10 min of only hepatic arterial reperfusion after 15 min of total ischemia was much slower compared to the portal venous reperfusion only. It may be undesirable, therefore, to reperfuse the liver with hepatic arterial blood first immediately after warm liver ischemia. 
2	Elective resection for diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon. From 1966 to 1987, 177 consecutive patients were operated on electively for diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon. The indications for surgery were: colovesical fistula (n = 12), suspicion of residual abscess (n = 39), two or more previous attacks of acute inflammation (n = 52), chronic symptoms (n = 72) and suspicion of carcinoma (n = 2). An abscess was found at operation in 76 patients (43 per cent) and this was extracolic with local peritonitis in 52 patients (29 per cent). An unsuspected abscess was found in 25 of the 72 patients operated on for chronic symptoms. Colonic resection with primary anastomosis was performed in 95 per cent of the 177 patients and in 94 per cent of those 52 patients with an extracolic abscess. There were no postoperative deaths and no clinical anastomotic leakages. Long-term results were very good in 85 per cent of the 177 patients and in 82 per cent of the 72 patients operated on for chronic symptoms. The results of this series suggest that a one-stage procedure can be safely performed with some technical precautions in most patients operated on electively for diverticular disease, even if an extracolic abscess is found. The good long-term results in patients operated on for chronic symptoms suggest that such symptoms should be taken into account with respect to surgical indications. 
3	Penetrating craniocerebral trauma. The authors review the pathophysiology of penetrating and perforating cranial wounds. Radiologic evaluation includes computed tomography and angiography. Operative technique and perioperative critical care are discussed, with special emphasis on the control of the intracranial pressure. Other problems such as fluid and electrolyte disorders and nutrition are discussed in relation to neurosurgery. 
1	Results of transsphenoidal extirpation of craniopharyngiomas and Rathke's cysts. Fourteen patients undergoing transsphenoidal extirpation of craniopharyngiomas or Rathke's cysts underwent endocrinological evaluation before and after surgery. One patient died during the procedure because of uncontrollable arterial bleeding. The other patients were followed for up to 16 years (average, 8.5 years). One patient had recurrence of tumor 12 years after surgery. Another patient, the only one operated on because of a recurrent craniopharyngioma after previous radiation therapy, died 2 years after the transsphenoidal operation. No patient recovered pituitary functions that had been lost before surgery. One patient, who had an isolated growth hormone deficiency, and another, who had panhypopituitarism with sustained antidiuretic hormone secretion, had no change postoperatively from their preoperative endocrine status. The other 11 patients lost pituitary function and required pharmacological replacement of one to four pituitary hormones. 
5	Duodenogastric reflux and gastric histology after cholecystectomy with or without sphincteroplasty. Sixteen patients who had undergone cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty, 14 cholecystectomized patients and ten control patients were studied to evaluate whether differences existed in duodenogastric reflux and whether these were related to morphological damage of the gastric mucosa. Duodenogastric bile reflux during fasting was evaluated by measuring the concentration of total bile acids (by an enzymatic method) and single bile acids in the gastric juice by high performance liquid chromatography. The damage was evaluated histologically by systematic endoscopic biopsy of the antrum and body of the stomach. There was a statistically significant difference in fasting bile reflux between the three groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, P less than 0.001), and the group that underwent cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty had a significantly higher median value than the cholecystectomized group (P less than 0.05) and the control group (P less than 0.01). The distribution of chronic antral atrophic and superficial gastritis was different in the three groups (chi 2 test, P less than 0.005). Chronic atrophic gastritis was associated with cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty (P less than 0.01), while chronic superficial gastritis was more frequent in cholecystectomized patients. These results suggest that there may be more duodenogastric reflux after cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty than after cholecystectomy alone, and that there may be a correlation between the amount of duodenogastric reflux and the severity of mucosal damage. 
4	Effects of hydralazine and prostaglandin E1 on regional myocardial function in the ischemic canine heart. The effects of hydralazine and prostaglandin E1 on regional myocardial function were studied in dogs. Sixteen dogs were randomly assigned to one of two drug treatment groups of eight dogs each. The first group (G1) was treated with 0.4 mg/kg hydralazine administered as a bolus. The second group (G2) received prostaglandin E1 given as an infusion for a total dose of 0.8 micrograms/kg. Regional myocardial function was assessed through the measurement of myocardial segment shortening during systole. We call this index percent systolic shortening (%SS). An ischemic heart preparation was created by partial occlusion of coronary blood flow. The degree of induced ischemia was determined by following the reduction in %SS. Hydralazine reduced %SS of the ischemic myocardium while increasing the cardiac index, stroke volume index, and coronary blood flow. Prostaglandin E1 increased %SS, cardiac index, and stroke volume index in the ischemic heart preparation. Hydralazine, therefore, induced dissociation between global ventricular function and regional myocardial function whereas prostaglandin E1 did not. The present findings emphasize that evaluation of vasoactive drugs should consider their effects on regional myocardial function as well as on global hemodynamics. 
4	Medical management of congestive heart failure. The syndrome of congestive heart failure can result from a variety of cardiac disorders of which left ventricular dysfunction is the most common. The clinical presentation is determined by the interaction between cardiac dysfunction and a series of compensatory mechanisms that are activated throughout the body. Therapy for this disorder is best approached through an understanding of this complex relationship and an appreciation for the influence of preload, afterload, and contractility on cardiac performance. Recent important advances in therapy include the use of combined diuretic therapy, a better understanding of the value of the digitalis glycosides, and evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can relieve symptoms and prolong life. More intensive therapy earlier in the course of congestive heart failure appears to have some clinical benefit. The use of ACE inhibitors during this phase may delay progression of the underlying left ventricular dysfunction. Future therapy will be influenced by the results of ongoing trials that are testing both new agents and expanded indications for drugs that are currently available. 
5	Kidney transplantation in patients aged sixty years and older. Outcomes of renal transplantation were reviewed for 26 transplants performed in 25 patients 60 years of age or older between 1985 and 1989. Three grafts were from family donors and 23 were from cadaver donors. Twenty-one were first transplants and five were retransplants. Cyclosporine was used as primary immunosuppression and azathioprine and prednisone were administered to most patients. Overall patient and graft actuarial survival rates were 79% and 71%, respectively, at both 1 and 3 years. Patients (n = 14) free of both diabetes and cardiac disease (low risk) had 1- and 3-year patient and graft survival rates of 91% and 84%, respectively. Conversely, high-risk patients (n = 12) had patient and graft survival rates at 1 and 3 years of 67% and 58%, respectively. Early deaths (less than or equal to 6 months) were caused by sepsis (two patients) or cardiac events (three patients), and four of the five were in high-risk patients. Irreversible rejections and serious infectious complications were not as common as steroid-induced diabetes, which occurred in five patients. This experience suggests that kidney transplantation can be done safely and successfully in patients older than 60 years of age and should be the treatment of choice for low-risk patients in this category. 
1	Clinical problems in follow-up of patients after conservative surgery and radiotherapy. Patients treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy for early-stage breast carcinoma are at risk of developing an ipsilateral breast recurrence for a long period. Fortunately, few such patients present with an inoperable recurrence or simultaneous distant metastases. Salvage rates are high and may be improved by early detection. Although usually unambiguous, physical examination of the treated breast may reveal changes attributable to surgery and radiotherapy that can mimic a recurrent cancer. There also is substantial overlap in radiologic appearance between benign and malignant lesions. It may be necessary to perform a biopsy when there is a question of recurrence. Careful life-long follow-up of patients thus is a critical part of their care. 
5	A prospective study of aspirin's effect on red blood cell loss in cardiac surgery. The effect of aspirin on red blood cell (RBC) loss and blood transfusions was evaluated prospectively in 100 consecutive patients, with normal bleeding times, undergoing elective coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery. Patients taking 85-325 mgm of aspirin daily up to or within 48 hours of surgery (the "aspirin" group) were compared to patients not taking aspirin or those who had discontinued aspirin at least 4 days before surgery (the "no-aspirin" group). RBC loss was determined by measuring preoperative and postoperative RBC volume using RISA and 51Cr techniques. There were no significant differences, respectively, between the aspirin and no-aspirin groups for: RBC loss (1158 +/- 67 ml vs 1129 +/- 47 ml, p = 0.737), chest tube drainage (925 +/- 31 ml vs 844 +/- 70 ml, p = 0.553), and gm% discharge Hemoglobin (Hgb) (9.94 +/- 0.32 vs 9.49 +/- 1.4, p = 0.0148). Strict criteria for blood transfusions were employed: (1) intraoperative hematocrit of less than 21%, (2) postoperative Hgb of less than 7 gm% for patients less than 70 years old and (3) postoperative Hgb of less than 8 gm% for patients greater than 70 years old. There were no significant differences, respectively, between the aspirin and no-aspirin groups for units of blood transfused (1.32 +/- vs 1.21 +/- 0.20, p = 0.843) and patients not receiving transfusions during the entire hospitalization (44% vs 50%). Patients taking 85-325 mgm of aspirin with a normal bleeding time undergoing elective CABG did not have increased RBC loss or increased transfusion requirements. These results indicate it is not necessary to delay elective CABG surgery for the purpose of discontinuing aspirin. 
5	Ocular pathologic features of arteriohepatic dysplasia (Alagille's syndrome). Arteriohepatic dysplasia (Alagille's syndrome), an autosomal dominant condition involving jaundice caused by a developmental scarcity of intrahepatic bile ducts, has characteristic cardiovascular, skeletal, facial, and ocular features that distinguish it from extrahepatic biliary atresia and an array of other neonatal intrahepatic cholestatic disorders. Two children who died of this syndrome had prominent Schwalbe's rings with attached iris strands characteristic of Axenfeld's syndrome. Additional histologic findings of iris atrophy and stromal nodules, however, made the designation Axenfeld-Reiger's syndrome more appropriate. Pigmentary retinopathy, degeneration of Bruch's membrane, and prominent lipofuscin deposition in the ciliary muscle noted in one of the patients were not regarded as primary changes of Alagille's syndrome, but were believed to be secondary to acquired deficiency of the fat-soluble vitamins A and E. Early recognition of the ocular changes in arteriohepatic dysplasia is helpful in establishing the proper diagnosis to avoid unnecessary abdominal surgery and institute vitamin therapy. 
5	Clue cells in predicting infections after abdominal hysterectomy. Seventy women scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy were examined for the presence of clue cells in the vaginal discharge in an attempt to identify a possible risk group for development of postoperative infection. Seven of 20 women (35%) with clue cells developed vaginal cuff infections or wound infections, compared with four of 50 women (8%) without clue cells (P less than .01). Women with bacterial vaginosis, diagnosed by air-dried vaginal smears, are therefore at risk for postoperative infection. 
5	The recalcitrant perineal wound after rectal extirpation. Applications of muscle flap closure. Perineal wounds developing after abdominoperineal resection result in chronic purulent drainage and intermittent episodes of sepsis and are generally unresponsive to conservative medical and surgical treatment. Thirteen consecutive patients (aged 27 to 74 years; mean, 48 years) who underwent debridement and immediate muscle flap closure of these wounds were analyzed to identify risk factors for delayed healing and to evaluate the effectiveness of muscle flap coverage. Three risk factors were identified: preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy, resection for recurrent carcinoma, and inflammatory bowel disease. A total of 19 muscle flaps (11 gracilis, five gluteal thigh, two gluteus maximus, and one rectus abdominis) were used to close these wounds. During an average 3.5-year follow-up, four (31%) minor complications and one (8%) recurrence were noted to occur. Muscle flaps provide safe, effective, single-stage procedures for the closure of chronic perineal wounds. 
2	Preliminary report: the antegrade continence enema. The principles of antegrade colonic washout and the Mitrofanoff non-refluxing catheterisable channel were combined to produce a continent catheterisable colonic stoma. The intention was that antegrade washouts delivered by this route would produce complete colonic emptying and thereby prevent soiling. The procedure has been successfully carried out in five patients with intractable faecal incontinence. 
4	Relative accuracy of three scintigraphic methods for determination of right ventricular ejection fraction: a correlative study with ultrafast computed tomography. The accuracy of three scintigraphic methods for determination of right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) was tested in 29 patients using ultrafast computed tomography (UFCT) as the gold standard. RVEF measurements by the ECG-gated first-pass approach showed excellent correlation with the UFCT results (r = 0.96, y = 0.06 + 0.91x), while both the standard gated acquisition blood-pool imaging (r = 0.71, y = 0.14 + 0.59x) and the nongated first-pass curve approach (r = 0.63, y = 0.18 + 0.37x) significantly underestimated RVEF. The error can be ascribed to partial inclusion of the atrial activity in the region assigned to the right ventricle. The tricuspid valve plane was found to move by a distance equal to 9%-33% (mean = 20%) of the right ventricular long-axis between systole and diastole. This translational motion was more pronounced with higher EFs. 
4	Estrogen replacement and coronary artery disease. Effect on survival in postmenopausal women. The relationship among postmenopausal estrogen use, coronary stenosis, and survival was examined retrospectively in 2268 women undergoing coronary angiography. The patients were selected for study if their age was 55 years or older at the time of angiography or if they had previously undergone bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal estrogen use in 1178 patients with coronary artery disease (greater than 70% stenosis) and 644 patients with mild to moderate coronary artery disease (5% to 69% stenosis) was compared with 446 control subjects (0% stenosis) using life-table analysis. Over 10 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in survival among patients initially free of coronary lesions on arteriography who had either never used (377) or ever used (69) estrogens. Among patients with mild to moderate coronary stenosis, 10-year survival of those who had never used estrogens was 85.0% and it was 95.6% among 99 "ever users." Survival was 60.0% among those with more than 70% coronary stenosis who had never used estrogen and it was 97.0% among 70 ever users. The "never users" group were older (65 vs 59 years), had a lower proportion of cigarette smokers (40% vs 57.1%), a higher proportion of subjects with diabetes (21.7% vs 12.9%) and hyperlipidemia (58% vs 44%), and approximately equal numbers of hypertensives (56.0% vs 54.3%). Cox's proportional hazards model was used to estimate survival as a function of multiple covariables. Estrogen use was found to have a significant, independent effect on survival in women. We conclude that estrogen replacement after menopause prolongs survival when coronary artery disease is present, but it has less effect in the absence of coronary artery disease. 
5	Patient-controlled analgesia in children. We report our experience in introducing patient-controlled analgesia at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow. Twenty-five children used the technique after orthopaedic or general surgery using the Graseby system. The pump was loaded with 1 mg/kg morphine sulphate in 50 ml. A bolus dose of 0.02 mg/kg (1 ml) and a lockout interval of 10 minutes were the initial settings. The dose used, pain and sedation scores, respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded. Ages ranged from 5-15 years (mean 9.6) and the method was used for a mean of 48 hours after operation. Morphine requirements averaged 26 (micrograms/kg)/hour (SD 10.6). Pain control was good and sedation minimal. Adverse effects were few and minor. Education of patients, parents and nurses is essential for its success and safety. The technique is an effective and safe means of providing good quality analgesia in school age children. 
4	Intermittent claudication, heart disease risk factors, and mortality. The Whitehall Study In the Whitehall study, 18,388 subjects aged 40-64 years completed a questionnaire on intermittent claudication. Of these subjects, 0.8% (147) and 1% (175) were deemed to have probable intermittent claudication and possible intermittent claudication, respectively. Within the 17-year follow-up period, 38% and 40% of the probable and possible cases, respectively, died. Compared with subjects without claudication, the probable cases suffered increased mortality rates due to coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, but the mortality rate due to noncardiovascular causes was not increased. Possible cases demonstrated increased mortality rates due to cardiovascular and noncardiovascular causes. This difference in mortality pattern may be due to chance. Possible and probable cases still showed increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality rates after adjusting for coronary risk factors (cardiac ischemia at baseline, systolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol concentration, smoking behavior, employment grade, and degree of glucose intolerance). Intermittent claudication is independently related to increased mortality rates. It is not a rare condition, and simple questionnaires exist for its detection. The latter can be usefully incorporated in cardiovascular risk assessment and screening programs. 
4	Predictors of long-term cardiac survival in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The predictors of 5-year cardiac survival in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) were analyzed in a series of 637 consecutive patients. The average age was 59 +/- 11 years in 472 men and 165 women. Diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction and unstable angina were present in 119 (19%), 261 (41%) and 305 (47%) patients, respectively. Angiographically, 460 patients had 2-vessel and 177 patients had 3-vessel CAD. The left ventricular contraction score was greater than or equal to 12 in 55 patients. Angiographic success (less than 50% residual stenosis) was achieved in 85% of the 1,343 narrowings and clinical success was obtained in 526 (83%) of the 637 patients. Complete revascularization was obtained in 177 (34%) of 526 successful patients. Procedure-related complications resulted in death in 9 patients (1.4%), in Q-wave myocardial infarction only in 6 patients (0.9%) and in emergency bypass surgery in 44 patients (6.9%) (of whom 10 had Q-wave myocardial infarction). Follow-up for greater than or equal to 1 year and up to 6 years after PTCA was obtained in 608 (95%) of the 637 patients. To determine the predictors of 5-year cardiac survival, 28 clinical, angiographic and procedural variables were analyzed by Cox proportional-hazards regression. The estimated 5-year survival after PTCA was 88 +/- 2% in successful patients and 77 +/- 5% in patients in whom PTCA was unsuccessful (p less than 0.001). When clinical success was forced into the Cox regression, the left ventricular contraction score of greater than or equal to 12, diabetes mellitus and age greater than or equal to 65 years showed additional adverse effects on survival. 
4	Cardiorespiratory effects of antagonism of diazepam sedation with flumazenil in patients with cardiac disease. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil is currently under intense study. Despite much clinical experience, no detailed invasive hemodynamic studies of its use in cardiac patients have been published. In the present study, hemodynamic and respiratory variables were measured in 10 cardiac patients undergoing catheterization of the right and left sides of the heart, before and after sedation with intravenous diazepam, and after reversal of sedation with flumazenil. A sleep dose of diazepam (12.2 +/- 5.1 mg, mean +/- SD) caused only slight decreases in mean arterial pressure (103 +/- 12 to 98 +/- 14 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (13.2 +/- 6.3 to 11.7 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (20.8 +/- 7.5 to 17.3 +/- 10.0 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), with no significant changes in respiratory gas homeostasis. Intravenous flumazenil (0.22 +/- 0.07 mg) resulted in spontaneous awakening and return to full orientation, yet caused no significant alteration in either hemodynamic or respiratory variables measured. Reversal of diazepam-induced sedation by flumazenil in cardiac patients appears safe and effective. 
2	Pivoting larynx--an unusual clinical observation at laryngoscopy. Rigid oesophagoscopy was planned in the investigation of a young patient with dysphagia. During laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation an unusual pivoting manoeuvre was required to see the vocal cords. Although the initial diagnostic investigations were unhelpful, follow up directed at explaining the clinical observations led to an eventual diagnosis of anterior tubercles of C6, which explained the observation and accounted for the dysphagia. 
3	Effect of sleep and sleep deprivation on ventilatory response to bronchoconstriction. To characterize ventilatory responses to bronchoconstriction during sleep and to assess the effect of prior sleep deprivation on ventilatory and arousal responses to bronchoconstriction, bronchoconstriction was induced in eight asthmatic subjects while they were awake, during normal sleep, and during sleep after a 36-h period of sleep deprivation. Each subject was bronchoconstricted with increasing concentrations of aerosolized methacholine while ventilatory patterns and lower airway resistance (Rla) were continually monitored. The asthmatic patients maintained their minute ventilation as Rla increased under all conditions, demonstrating a stable tidal volume with a mild increase in respiratory frequency. Inspiratory drive, as measured by occlusion pressure (P0.1), increased progressively and significantly as Rla increased under all conditions (slopes of P0.1 vs. Rla = 0.249, 0.112, and 0.154 for awake, normal sleep, and sleep after sleep deprivation, respectively, P less than 0.0006). Chemostimuli did not appear to contribute significantly to the observed increases in P0.1. Prior sleep deprivation had no effect on ventilatory and P0.1 responses to bronchoconstriction but did significantly raise the arousal threshold to induced bronchoconstriction. We conclude that ventilatory responses to bronchoconstriction, unlike extrinsic loading, are not imparied by the presence of sleep, nor are they chemically mediated. However, prior sleep deprivation does increase the subsequent arousal threshold. 
1	Angiotropic intravascular large-cell lymphoma (malignant angioendotheliomatosis): report of a case and review of the literature. We present a case of angiotropic large-cell lymphoma and review the literature in order to define the neurologic features of this rare disorder. This is the first report of gadolinium-DTPA imaging in angiotropic large-cell lymphoma that demonstrates infarcts of multiple ages, as well as striking meningeal enhancement. Angiotropic large-cell lymphoma should be suspected in patients with clinical evidence of small and large cerebral vessel disease and diagnosis requires skin, liver, renal, meningeal, or brain biopsy. Single modality treatment, using either radiation therapy or steroids, has been ineffective, and new findings of a lymphomatous origin of this neoplasm suggest that combination chemotherapy may be indicated. 
3	Fracture-dislocation of the base of the fifth metacarpal with an ulnar motor nerve lesion: case report. We report a case of delayed diagnosis of a fracture dislocation of the base of the fifth metacarpal with a resultant ulnar motor nerve lesion. The patient achieved marked improvement after fracture reduction and ulnar neurolysis. 
3	Relationship of clinical features with psychological status in primary fibromyalgia. Clinical features and psychological status determined by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in 103 patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) were analyzed by univariate and multivariate techniques to determine if clinical features were related to psychological status or were intrinsic to PFS per se. The central features of PFS, e.g., number of pain sites, number of tender points, fatigue, and poor sleep, were independent of psychological status. However, discriminant analysis identified 4 variables--patient-reported depression, anxiety, stress, and pain severity--which together predicted 3 MMPI subgroups with an accuracy of 55% (P less than 0.001); the only musculoskeletal feature--pain severity--alone provided an accuracy of only 34% (P greater than 0.05). These data suggest a new concept, that the central features of fibromyalgia are independent of the psychological status and are more likely related to the PFS itself. However, pain severity may be influenced by psychological factors. 
4	Disappearance of renin-induced proteinuria by an ACE-inhibitor: a case report. A 55-year-old man developed renovascular hypertension that was characterized by high plasma renin activity. This was accompanied by nephrotic range proteinuria. Treatment with nifedipine and furosemide lowered the blood pressure to normal values, but proteinuria persisted. However, treatment with an ACE-inhibitor brought resolution of the proteinuria, suggesting a role for angiotensin II in urinary protein loss. 
2	Management of an extensive tracheoesophageal fistula by cervical esophageal exclusion. Giant tracheoesophageal fistulae occurring in ventilator-dependent patients usually result in significant ventilatory embarrassment. Cervical exclusion of the fistula can safely control the fistula and quickly restore adequate ventilation to these critically ill patients. 
5	Genetic mapping of "Lubag" (X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism) in a Filipino kindred to the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome. "Lubag" is an X-linked disorder causing dystonia and parkinsonism that has only been described in families from the Philippines, principally from the island of Panay. We have established linkage between the disease phenotype "lubag" and DNA markers which span the Xp11.22-Xq21.3 region by using a large Filipino family with 8 affected men in three generations. These DNA markers define an interval of about 20 centimorgans in the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome as the most likely site of the disease locus XDPD (X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism). XDPD has a maximum multipoint log likelihood ratio score (Zmax) of about 4.6 over the interval from Xq12 to Xq21.31 (DXS159-DXYS1X). The co-occurrence of dystonia and parkinsonism in lubag and in other known disorders suggests there may be a common pathogenetic mechanism. Identification of the genetic defect in this family may provide an important clue toward understanding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of both dystonia and parkinsonism. 
1	Primary carcinoma of the gallbladder. Seventy-four patients with primary carcinoma of the gallbladder, diagnosed over 18 years from 1969 to 1987, were studied retrospectively. The most common presenting complaint was abdominal pain, followed by jaundice and weight loss. Surgery was performed in 61 patients and of these patients, only two had accurate preoperative diagnosis which was made by ultrasonography. Twelve of the 13 patients who were treated medically had the disease diagnosed at autopsy. One of the 13 patients had the diagnosis of gallbladder cancer by the findings of ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning. The resectability of the surgically managed group was 36.1%, and the majority of patients with advanced tumors (82.2%) were deemed unresectable. The most common histologic type was adenocarcinoma. Liver was the organ most commonly invaded (76.5%) by direct extension and/or metastases, followed by regional lymph nodes (52.9%). The overall 5-year survival rate was 5.4%. A high index of suspicion of the disease, intraoperative examination of gallbladder specimen, and earlier, more aggressive surgical treatment may improve patient survival. 
1	Postoperative ectopic craniopharyngioma. Case report. The case of an ectopic craniopharyngioma arising from a seed of tissue deposited along the operative track is reported. The uniqueness of this lesion is addressed. Ideal therapy and controversies regarding radiation therapy of craniopharyngiomas are discussed in light of this new variation in recurrence. 
5	Impaired sympathetic nerve function in the inflamed rat intestine. The effect of intestinal inflammation on norepinephrine release from the myenteric plexus in the Trichinella spiralis-infected rat was assessed. Longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus preparations were preincubated with [3H]norepinephrine and release was evoked by electrical field stimulation and KCl administration. Preincubation of preparations with desipramine or pretreatment of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine significantly suppressed the uptake and evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine; electrical field stimulation but not KCl-evoked release of [3H] norepinephrine was sensitive to tetrodotoxin. These results confirm the presence of functioning sympathetic nerves in the preparations. T. spiralis infection was associated with significant suppression of both electrical field stimulation and KCl-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine on the sixth day postinfection, and the suppression persisted 100 days postinfection. No suppression of [3H]norepinephrine release was seen in the worm-free and noninflamed ileum of infected rats. Suppression of [3H]norepinephrine release from the jejunum of infected rats was attenuated by treatment with betamethasone (3.0 mg/kg SC daily). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that intestinal inflammation suppresses the release of norepinephrine from the myenteric plexus in the Trichinella-infected rat. 
5	Effect of electrocautery on wound healing in midline laparotomy incisions. The effect of electrocautery on midline fascial wound healing was studied in 108 Sprague-Dawley rats. Midline wound tensile strength was significantly reduced in fascia incised with the coagulation current compared with the cutting current or scalpel. In addition, tissue necrosis and inflammation as well as adhesion formation between the incision and abdominal viscera were more extensive in animals with incisions made using coagulation current. The results of the study indicate that the use of electrocautery coagulation current is associated with increased tissue damage and a significant reduction in the tensile strength of healing wounds. The contribution of electrocautery to wound complications in patients needs further evaluation. 
5	Comparison of outcomes of double and single lung transplantation for obstructive lung disease. The Toronto Lung Transplant Group. Single lung transplantation has recently been applied with success in patients with obstructive lung disease. Such patients were previously managed by bilateral pulmonary transplantation. Between November 1986 and January 1990, 18 patients underwent transplantation for obstructive lung disease in our center. Eleven double lung transplants and seven single lung transplants were performed in patients having a mean age of 43.4 and 44.1 years, respectively. Operative death occurred in two of 11 double lung transplantations and one of seven single lung transplantations. Each patient underwent preoperative and 3-month postoperative pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analyses, nuclear lung scans, and 6-minute walk tests. There was no difference in the preoperative values for any of these parameters. Double lung recipients had significantly higher forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity than single lung recipients. However, the ratios of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to vital capacity were not different. Arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tension were not different between the two procedures. Whereas double lung transplantations caused a slight preponderance of perfusion to the right lung, the transplanted lung in single lung recipients received a mean of 79.5% +/- 12.3% of predicted flow and only 61.6% +/- 5.0% of predicted ventilation. Three-month 6-minute walk distances were markedly improved in both groups, with double lung recipients achieving 573.0 +/- 44.7 m in comparison with the 528.0 +/- 43.0 m achieved by the single lung recipients. Single lung transplantation is a satisfactory option in patients with obstructive lung disease and might offer significant advantages to the older patient population, in which risk of double lung transplantation is high. 
1	Observations on the pathophysiology of Nelson's syndrome: a report of three cases. Nelson's syndrome is generally regarded as an unusual sequela of primary bilateral adrenalectomy when performed for Cushing's disease. It is classically defined by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, considerably elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, and an enlarged sella turcica. In this report, we present three cases initially treated by transsphenoidal sellar exploration for Cushing's disease. In two of these cases, remission of hypercortisolism did not occur after the initial pituitary exploration. A microadenomectomy was performed in one case and, in the other, no microadenoma was found. In both, Nelson's syndrome occurred after adrenalectomy. A second transsphenoidal operation and radiotherapy were required to control tumor growth. In another case, transsphenoidal adenomectomy of an ACTH-secreting tumor initially led to a remission of hypercortisolism for 4 years, but recurrent Cushing's disease necessitated adrenalectomy, and again Nelson's syndrome occurred. The documentation of a pre-existing ACTH-secreting basophilic pituitary microadenoma before adrenalectomy, as seen in two of our cases, has not been previously reported, and these observations of "non-classical" courses have major implications for the pathophysiology of Nelson's syndrome. 
5	Predictors of postextubation stridor in pediatric trauma patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine which factors are the best predictors of postextubation stridor in pediatric trauma patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Burn and Trauma ICUs at Harborview Medical Center from March to September 1989. PATIENTS: Children were eligible for the study if they were less than 15 yr old, were intubated for greater than 12 hr, and did not have underlying cardiopulmonary disease. The study included 25 patients with 30 extubations. RISK FACTORS ASSESSED: Age, type of injury (burn vs. trauma), location of intubation ("field" vs. hospital), endotracheal tube size, length of intubation, and presence of an airleak around the tube at the time of extubation at 30 cm H2O pressure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Moderate to severe postextubation stridor requiring treatment with racemic epinephrine, helium-oxygen, reintubation, or tracheostomy. RESULTS: Treatment for postextubation stridor was required after 11 (37%) of 30 extubations, with five reintubations and one tracheostomy. The best predictor of postextubation stridor was absence of an airleak at the time of extubation (sensitivity 100%, positive predictive value 79%, p less than .001), followed by type of injury (facial burn vs. all others; sensitivity 64%, positive predictive value 88%, p less than .001). After controlling for these two factors, no other factor studied was a significant predictor of postextubation stridor. CONCLUSION: In pediatric trauma patients, mechanism of injury (facial burn vs. other) and absence of an airleak at the time of extubation are the strongest factors predicting postextubation stridor. Patients with one or both risk factors require special attention to airway management. 
5	Sinistral (left-sided) portal hypertension. Between 1953 and 1988, 21 patients with splenic vein thrombosis (SVT), 12 of whom had sinistral portal hypertension (SPH) were treated at our institution. SVT was identified at autopsy in nine patients. Twelve additional patients presented with SPH: bleeding esophageal varices, SVT and normal hepatic function. SVT was caused by pancreatic neoplasm (5), chronic pancreatitis (5), and pancreatic pseudocyst (2). SVT was diagnosed by splanchnic angiography, splenoportography, computerized tomography, and ultrasonography. Gastric varices were diagnosed by endoscopy (10) and barium swallow (2). Splenectomy was performed as primary therapy in 10 patients. Three of these 10 had en block distal pancreatectomy. Two high-risk patients had splenic artery embolization, one as a prelude to splenectomy performed 48 hours later and the other as definitive therapy. One splenectomized patient continued to bleed. No further bleeding occurred in 10 splenectomized patients in follow-up from 1 week to 14 years. Sinistral portal hypertension is a clinical syndrome of splenic vein thrombosis caused by pancreatic pathology and manifests as bleeding gastric varices in patients with a patent portal vein and normal hepatic function. Splanchnic arteriography is necessary for accurate diagnosis. Splenectomy is the effective treatment of choice. 
5	Ventricular arrhythmias in ischemic heart disease. Ventricular arrhythmias remain the leading cause of death from coronary artery disease. This review summarizes current thinking in several areas relating to the pathophysiology, prognosis, and therapy of ventricular arrhythmias associated with acute and chronic coronary artery disease syndromes. The experimental basis of arrhythmias in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia and chronic myocardial infarction is described, stressing the important pathophysiologic differences between these two conditions. The effects of the autonomic nervous system as a key modulator of ischemic arrhythmogenesis are discussed. Insights, derived from endocardial mapping studies, into the nature of ventricular tachycardia in humans with chronic myocardial infarction are described, including implications for risk stratification and therapy to prevent arrhythmia recurrence. Current therapeutic principles are discussed in the management of ventricular arrhythmias associated with coronary artery disease, including pharmacologic approaches, surgical and catheter ablation, and automatic implantable cardioverting and defibrillating devices. 
3	An intracranial mass lesion in systemic xanthogranulomatosis: case report. The authors describe a 42-year-old woman with systemic xanthogranulomatosis and bilateral intraorbital tumors, who subsequently developed multiple lesions of the intracranial dura mater, spinal cord, retroperitoneum, pericardium, and mediastinum. Systemic xanthogranulomatosis is histologically similar to systemic Weber-Christian disease, except for the absence of subcutaneous panniculitis. Immunohistochemical studies suggest that this clinical entity can be differentiated from histiocytosis X, because foamy cells in systemic xanthogranulomatosis demonstrate macrophages but not T-zone histiocyte markers. Differentiation of this disease from other intracranial xanthogranulomas and treatment are discussed. 
5	Primary sarcomas of the major salivary glands. Sarcomas arising in the major salivary glands are rare. This article presents the clinicopathologic features of 11 patients with primary sarcomas of the parotid gland (eight men and three women aged 7 to 75 years; mean age, 42 years). The 11 sarcomas were histologically typified as follows: three malignant fibrous histiocytomas and two each of neurosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, fibrosarcomas, and osteosarcomas. Four patients experienced disease recurrences, and seven patients developed metastases. Seven patients died of their sarcomas, with a mean survival time of 30 months. Four patients were alive from 5 to 12 years (one each with angiomatoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and neurosarcoma). Prognosis correlated with size of the neoplasm, type of sarcoma, and histologic grade. In this respect, salivary gland sarcomas behaved in identical fashion to their soft-tissue counterparts. 
4	Inverse correlation between plasma vitamin E and mortality from ischemic heart disease in cross-cultural epidemiology. Essential antioxidants were determined in plasma of middle-aged men representing 16 European study populations, which differed sixfold in age-specific mortality from ischemic heart disease (IHD). In 12 populations with "common" plasma cholesterol (5.7-6.2 mmol/L) and blood pressure, both classical risk factors lacked significant correlations to IHD mortality, whereas absolute levels of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) showed a strong inverse correlation (r2 = 0.63, P = 0.002). Evaluating all populations, cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure were moderately associated, but their correlation was inferior to that of vitamin E. In stepwise regression and multiple regression analysis, mortality was predictable to 62% by lipid-standardized vitamin E, to 79% by vitamin E and cholesterol, to 83% after inclusion of lipid-standardized vitamin A (retinol), and to 87% by all the above parameters plus blood pressure. Thus, in the present study the cross-cultural differences of IDH mortality are primarily attributable to plasma status of vitamin E, which might have protective functions. 
4	Myocardial metabolism of fluorodeoxyglucose compared to cell membrane integrity for the potassium analogue rubidium-82 for assessing infarct size in man by PET Potassium loss from damaged myocardial cells is linearly related to CPK enzyme loss reflecting extent of necrosis. The potassium analog, rubidium-82 (82Rb), is extracted after i.v. injection and retained in viable myocardium but is not trapped or washed out of necrotic regions. To compare myocardial cell metabolism with membrane dysfunction as indicators of necrosis/viability, 43 patients with evolving myocardial infarction and coronary arteriography had positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and the potassium analog 82Rb. Percent of heart showing FDG defects and 82Rb washout on sequential images indicating failure to retain the potassium analogue were visually assessed and quantified by automated software. Infarct size based on rubidium kinetics correlated closely with size and location on FDG images (visual r = 0.93, automated r = 0.82), suggesting that loss of cell membrane integrity for trapping the potassium analog 82Rb parallels loss of intracellular glucose metabolism, both comparable quantitative markers of myocardial necrosis/viability. 
1	Failure of nutritional recovery after total gastrectomy. Malnutrition is reported to be an inevitable consequence of total gastrectomy, although there are few data to support this contention. Six patients of median age 63 years underwent total gastrectomy for malignancy. At follow-up (median 45 months, range 25-60 months) each patient was clinically tumour-free and underwent dietary assessment, faecal fat and nitrogen measurement and routine haematological testing. Protein and fat stores, measured by neutron activation analysis and the tritiated water dilution technique, were compared with the same measurements made before operation and with predicted values. Mean (s.d.) dietary intake (2224(381) kcal day-1 and 81(15)g protein day-1) met the patients' estimated requirements. Mean(s.d.) serum albumin and faecal nitrogen values were normal but there was notable steatorrhoea (21(17) g day-1). Body composition measurements revealed profound deficiencies of body-weight (P less than 0.02), protein (P less than 0.01) and fat (P less than 0.02) before operation which were not corrected by an apparently curative total gastrectomy (P less than 0.05), although further deterioration was prevented. 
5	Abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 6 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To determine the biologic significance of the structural rearrangements of the long arm of chromosome 6(6q) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis, we studied 412 consecutive children whose leukemic cell chromosomes had been completely banded and identified 45 (11%) children with this abnormality. The 45 cases were divided into del(6q) only (n = 11), del(6q) and numerical abnormalities (n = 4), del(6q) and structural abnormalities (n = 23), and 6q translocations (n = 7). The breakpoints of del(6q) were subgrouped: del(6)(q15q21) in 11 cases, del(6) (q13q21) in six, del(6)(q21q23) in four, del(6)(q15) in four, del(6)(q15q23) in three, and other deletions in 10 cases. Notably, all these deletions encompassed the 6q21 band, suggesting that this might be the locus of a recessive tumor suppressor gene, the absence of which contributes to malignant transformation or proliferation. Among the seven children with 6q translocations, a previously unidentified nonrandom translocation, t(6;12)(q21;p13) was noted in two cases with an early pre-B immunophenotype. Clinical features and event-free survival were similar among children with or without 6q abnormalities. Overall, children with 6q abnormalities were less likely than those without the abnormality to have a pre-B immunophenotype (P = .03). T-cell immunophenotypes were equally represented in cases with or without 6q abnormalities. However, all four children with del(6q) and a 12p abnormality had early pre-B ALL and all three children with del(6q) and a 9p abnormality had a T-cell immunophenotype. The lack of specificity for a particular immunophenotype may imply that the gene or genes affected by 6q abnormalities are broadly active in the multistep process of lymphoid leukemogenesis. The relatively high frequency of microscopically visible del(6q) indicates the need for molecular studies to identify cases with submicroscopic deletions. 
5	Large diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for infrarenal aortic aneurysm surgery. The performance of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft used for aortic aneurysm replacement was evaluated. ePTFE grafts were implanted in 241 patients undergoing infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Sixty patients were operated as emergencies for aneurysm rupture and 181 electively. One hundred and fourteen bifurcated and 127 tube grafts were inserted. The transperitoneal approach was used in 64 cases and the remainder were placed using a retroperitoneal approach. There was a one-month mortality of 2.8% in elective and 20% in emergency cases. Median follow-up was 26 months. Specific graft complications included one infected graft resulting in a graft-enteric fistula. No graft rupture, degeneration, dilatation, pseudoaneurysm or late graft limb thromboses were observed in up to 7 years of follow-up. The aortic ePTFE prosthesis demonstrated satisfactory performance over the period studied. 
5	Cervical lymph nodes from an unknown primary tumor in 190 patients. Over 10 years, 475 patients with isolated lateral neck masses were evaluated: 190 with lymph nodes from an unknown primary tumor (LNUP), 188 with neck lymphomas, 78 with benign tumors, 10 with sarcomas, and 9 with chemodectomas. This study focused on the patients with LNUP. Only 86 patients were treated with surgery (plus radiotherapy). Other patients were treated with radiotherapy (84) or chemotherapy (13) or had no treatment (7). For the overall population, failures in the neck occurred in 51% of the patients and distant metastases in 27%, while primary tumors appeared in 16%. Survival rates at 3, 5, and 10 years were 27%, 19%, and 7%, respectively, for the overall population and 45%, 35%, and 19%, respectively, for the surgical group. The diagnosis and therapeutic approach had a direct effect on neck control; failure in the neck occurred in 7 of 47 patients (15%) when fine needle aspiration and radical neck dissection with radiotherapy were performed, in 5 of 12 patients (42%) when fine needle aspiration and modified neck dissection with radiotherapy were used, in 5 of 12 patients (42%) when adenectomy diagnosis and radiotherapy treatment were performed, and in 6 of 11 patients (54%) when diagnosis by incisional biopsy was performed prior to admission, despite subsequent radical neck dissection and radiotherapy treatment. In our opinion, panendoscopy and fine needle aspiration should be the first-line diagnostic approach. When cytologic diagnosis proves impossible, the second-line approach must consist of cervical exploration with frozen section examination and excisional biopsy, followed by immediate appropriate treatment. In cases of LNUP, radical neck dissection seems to be preferable. 
1	Expression of placental alkaline phosphatase in gastric and colorectal cancers. An immunohistochemical study using the prepared monoclonal antibody. The authors developed monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) against human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP). Four specific MoAb reacting only with PLAP and two nonspecific MoAb reacting equally with isozymes of alkaline phosphatase (hepatic, intestinal, and placental) were obtained. Immunohistochemical staining with the specific MoAb showed that the cell membrane and cytoplasm of cancer cells were stained in gastric and colorectal carcinoma. The incidence of PLAP positivity was 23% (25 of 107) of all gastric carcinomas. Among gastric carcinomas, the 42% (13 of 31) positivity of highly differentiated carcinoma (papillary adenocarcinoma and well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma) was a significantly higher rate than that found in poorly differentiated carcinoma (poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma, five of 41, 12%). The incidence of PLAP positivity was 11% (four of 35) in colorectal carcinoma. In contrast, gastric adenoma, intestinal metaplasia, and noncancerous tissue adjacent to cancer did not show staining. These results indicated that expression of PLAP was apt to occur in more highly differentiated gastric carcinoma and was highly specific for carcinoma in the gastrointestinal tract, although its incidence was not high. 
3	Anomalous macular vessels: case report and review of the recent Japanese literature. We examined a 19-year-old woman with large macular vessels who had temporarily impaired visual acuity. The anomalous macular vessels had arteriovenous shunts and were associated with abnormal capillary networks. In a review of the recent Japanese literature, we found another eight patients with anomalous macular vessels who had undergone fluorescein angiography. We prefer the term anomalous macular vessels to describe this condition. 
1	Protection of the small intestine against irradiation by means of a removable prosthesis. In radiation therapy of tumors, several techniques are used to prevent injury of the intestinal loops. Their purpose is to drive the intestine out of the external beam. Understanding the disadvantages they present, a temporary prosthesis which effectively protects the small bowel, and is easy to remove, has been developed. The device is a 600 to 1,000 ml, silicone rubber, expandable balloon. When implanted in the pelvis or retroperitoneal cavity, and filled, this balloon displaces the intestinal loops out of the pelvic irradiation field. It may remain either filled or empty between each irradiation session. Due to its particular elliptical shape, once empty, the balloon can be removed through a 3 cm incision under local or peridural anesthesia at the completion of radiotherapy. Eleven patients with recurrent (8) or primary (3) cancer have been implanted. The protective effect has been evaluated on successive biologic tests, performed during treatment. No problem related to the prosthesis, no alteration of the biologic tests, nor bowel injury have been observed after several months follow-up. This device is suitable for preventing intestinal complications during therapy, allowing a higher dose of radiations in some cases. 
4	Femoro-popliteal and femoro-distal bypass: a comparison between in situ and reversed technique. The present report compares the in situ technique with that using the reversed vein for femoropopliteal bypass. In 1986 the in situ technique was introduced at our clinic as the preferred method for femoropopliteal bypass with the lower anastomosis below the knee or femorodistal bypass. Forty patients operated with the in situ technique were compared with an equal number of patients operated with the reversed technique 1983-1985. The two groups were comparable regarding concomitant cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, preoperative ankle-brachial index and level of distal anastomosis. Patency after 6 months was significantly higher (84%) for the in situ grafts compared to reversed veins (49%). The difference was mainly caused by a significantly higher patency for in situ grafts anastomosed to infrapopliteal arteries. Despite better patency rates in the in situ group limb salvage at 6 months was the same in both groups. Operating time was also similar in both groups. It is concluded that the in situ technique is superior to the reversed technique, at least in infrapopliteal reconstructions. The superior patency rate and the technical advantages without apparent disadvantages are the basis for the recommendation to use the in situ technique for femoropopliteal and femorodistal bypass. 
1	Indications for the surgical treatment of osteomas of the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. Sixty-one patients with an osteoma of the frontal or ethmoid sinuses have been studied. The following indications for surgical removal of these osteomas are suggested: osteomas extending beyond the boundaries of the frontal sinus, if enlarging, if localized in the region adjacent to the nasofrontal duct, if signs of chronic sinusitis are present, osteomas of the ethmoid sinuses, irrespective of their size and if patients with osteomas complain of headache and other causes of headache have been excluded. The operation of choice is the osteoplastic flap operation. 
3	Automatic rifle injuries: suicide by eight bullets. Report of an unusual case and a literature review. A 25-year-old man committed suicide by shooting himself with eight bullets fired from a military rifle set on automatic. This rifle has two firing modes: an automatic mode and a self-loading, single-shot mode. Using this case as an example, some important aspects of firearm injuries are discussed with special emphasis on those points that are relevant to automatic military rifles and most applicable to forensic pathology practice. Some of the pathologic features of firearm wounds are reviewed and the role of the pathologist is discussed. Lastly, the most important points that help the pathologist to determine the type or nature of a firearm death--that is, whether it is an accident, homicide, or a suicide--are discussed. Classically, the number of the firearm wounds is used to differentiate suicide from homicide. As in the case reported here, however, when an automatic rifle or a military rifle set on automatic is used, the number of wounds is not a reliable indicator of the type of death. 
5	Localization of the human angiogenin gene to chromosome band 14q11, proximal to the T cell receptor alpha/delta locus. The gene encoding angiogenin, a potent inducer of blood vessel formation, has been localized within the human genome. It is present as a single copy per haploid genome and is located on chromosome 14, on the basis of discordancy analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell lines. This localization was refined to 14q11 by in situ hybridization of an angiogenin probe to metaphase chromosomes prepared from both normal human lymphocytes and RPMI 8402 cells. The results from the RPMI 8402 cells also establish that the angiogenin gene resides proximal to a translocation breakpoint within the T cell receptor alpha/delta locus and therefore upstream from that locus. An AvaII RFLP, present at a frequency of 29% in an unselected collection of human placental DNAs, was identified in the coding region of the gene and results from a single silent transversion. 
5	Electrocardiographic and antiarrhythmic effects of intravenous amiodarone: results of a prospective, placebo-controlled study. The antiarrhythmic efficacy of intravenously administered amiodarone was examined in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study that involved 77 patients after coronary artery bypass surgery. Amiodarone was given after surgery in a loading bolus of 300 mg for 2 hours followed by 1200 mg every 24 hours for 2 days and 900 mg every 24 hours for the next 2 days. Amiodarone suppressed both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias within 12 hours after the start of therapy. Particularly, the incidence of atrial fibrillation (5% vs 21% in the control group; p less than 0.05) and of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (3% vs 16%; p less than 0.05) was reduced by amiodarone. Heart rate was slowed (p less than 0.001) and repolarization--as judged by JTc interval--was prolonged compared with the control group (p less than 0.01). In two patients, amiodarone infusion was stopped because of excessive QTc prolongation. No detrimental hemodynamic effects of the drug were observed. Thus the intravenous administration of amiodarone appears to be suitable for patients in whom rapid suppression of symptomatic supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias is warranted in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction. 
5	Immunity to and frequency of reinfection with respiratory syncytial virus. To better understand the duration of immunity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the role of serum antibodies to the surface glycoproteins, F and G, in susceptibility to reinfection, 15 adults with previous natural RSV infection were challenged with RSV of the same strain group (A) at 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, and 26 months after natural infection. By 2 months about one-half and by 8 months two-thirds of the subjects became reinfected. Each challenge resulted in infection in at least one-fourth of the subjects. Within 26 months 73% had two or more and 47% had three or more infections. The duration of immunity tended to increase after two closely spaced infections. Higher neutralizing, F and GA antibody levels before challenge correlated significantly with protection against infection. However, even in subjects with the highest antibody levels, the risk of reinfection was 25%. Specific nasal IgA antibody titers did not correlate significantly with protection. This suggests that humoral neutralizing, F, and G antibodies correlate with resistance to reinfection, but protection is far from complete and is of short duration. 
5	Squamous carcinoma metastatic to the sternum. A 63-year-old man had a 10 x 16-cm sternal mass 18 months after a second aortocoronary bypass operation. The resected lesion was a metastatic tumor of squamous histology. No primary tumor was found. The diagnostic work-up and treatment options are presented. 
3	Anisocoria in the pigmentary dispersion syndrome We studied four patients with anisocoria and the pigmentary dispersion syndrome. In all patients, the larger pupil was on the side of the greater iris transillumination. The amount of anisocoria was between 0.5 and 1.5 mm and was the same in both the light and dark. There was no blepharoptosis, and all pupils dilated normally with cocaine. All of the patients were young men with myopia, and one patient had increased intraocular pressure. 
1	Endometrial carcinoma: the relevance of cervical cytology. In patients with endometrial carcinoma, preoperative identification of poor prognostic factors is helpful in planning therapy. Extended surgical staging, including pelvic and periaortic node dissection, is indicated in patients with deep myometrial invasion or high-grade tumor, or when other risk factors for extrauterine spread are present. In this study, cervical cytology was reviewed in 86 patients with endometrial carcinoma, all of whom underwent surgical staging, to correlate the cytologic results with surgical and pathologic findings. Cervical cytology was normal in 20 patients (23%), whereas suspicious or malignant endometrial cells were present in 23 and 43 cases (27 and 50%), respectively. Suspicious or malignant cervical cytology was associated with deeper myometrial invasion (P = .011), higher postoperative tumor grade (P = .006), positive peritoneal washings (P = .012), and more advanced stage by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics criteria (P = .024). When compared with patients with normal cervical cytology, those who had malignant endometrial cells had over twice the risk of deep myometrial invasion (67 versus 30%), twice the risk of grade 2 or 3 tumor (60 versus 30%), and three times the risk of positive peritoneal washings (33 versus 10%). Seventy-four percent of patients with malignant cervical cytology were stage IC or more. In contrast, 70% of patients with normal cervical cytology were stage IA or IB. Patients with endometrial carcinoma who have malignant endometrial cells detected by cervical cytology are at increased risk of having a deeply invasive, high-grade, advanced-stage tumor, and therefore are more likely to require extended surgical staging. 
3	Uses and complications of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Uvulopalatopharygoplasty has become widely performed for chronic snoring and for cases of obstructive sleep apnoea. Unfortunately this operation is not without morbidity and complications. We report our results of a prospective series of 50 patients undergoing uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with a minimum follow-up of one year. Snoring was abolished in 18 (36 per cent) and substantially reduced in the remainder. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, identified in 11 patients pre-operatively, was reduced in severity in all but three. Troublesome complications were seen in 18 (36 per cent) patients, namely intermittent velopharyngeal incompetence in five (10 per cent), pharyngeal dryness in 11 (22 per cent) and loss of taste in five (10 per cent). One patient had nasopharyngeal stenosis requiring correction. A cautious approach to this operation is required with rigorous case selection. The importance of full assessment and careful follow-up should not be underestimated. 
4	Psychosomatic factors in borderline hypertensive subjects and offspring of hypertensive parents. Psychosomatic factors, sympathoneural and sympathoadrenal as well as cardiovascular mechanisms, were studied in 24 patients 18-24 years of age with borderline hypertension, 50 age-matched normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents, and 49 controls with no family history of hypertension. They were compared by projective and questionnaire-based psychological tests and their circulatory and neurohormonal reactivity to mental (Stroop color-word conflict test and arithmetic test) and physical stressors (orthostasis and bicycle ergometry test) were measured. Borderline hypertensive subjects externalized aggression less (p less than 0.05) but internalized it more (p less than 0.05) and were more submissive (p less than 0.05) when compared with controls. Offspring of hypertensive parents showed a similar but weaker pattern. Both risk groups reported more positive interactions with their parents (genetic risk subjects versus controls, p less than 0.05; borderline hypertensive patients versus controls, p = 0.08) and had higher state-anxiety levels (p less than 0.05). There were more subjective symptoms of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated functions (e.g., tachycardia, tremor) in borderline hypertensive subjects and offspring of hypertensive parents, elevated heart rates (analysis of repeated measures, p less than 0.001), and enhanced plasma norepinephrine concentrations (p less than 0.05) when compared with controls. These findings in subjects at risk for the development of hypertension suggest that psychosomatic factors and sympathetic overactivity are involved in the early phase of hypertension. 
5	Holter monitoring of ventricular arrhythmias in a randomised, controlled study of intravenous streptokinase in acute myocardial infarction. The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias attributed to streptokinase treatment in acute myocardial infarction is not well defined. Holter monitoring was performed for 24 hours in 81 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to intravenous streptokinase 1.5 x 10(6) IU (n = 55) or placebo infusion (n = 26) 6.7 hours (mean) after the onset of symptoms. No episodes of ventricular fibrillation were recorded. For the whole 24 hour period and during the first three hours after the start of treatment the incidence and frequency of ventricular arrhythmias were similar in the patients randomised to streptokinase and to placebo. But when the results in patients randomised "early" after the onset of symptoms of suspected acute myocardial infarction were analysed separately the frequency of abnormal complexes, pairs, runs, and repetitive arrhythmias seemed to be higher in patients allocated to streptokinase. This may reflect arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. 
5	Pulmonary resection combined with cardiac operations. Surgical management of patients with concomitant critical cardiac disease and resectable lung lesions is controversial. During a 7-year period (1982 to 1988), 21 patients underwent combined cardiac and pulmonary operations. Patients had cardiac symptoms only; the lung lesions were found on preoperative chest roentgenograms. The pathological diagnosis was established in only 2 of the patients before operation. All underwent concurrent pulmonary resection during cardiac operations requiring extracorporeal circulation. The pulmonary operations included 17 wedge resections and four lobectomies. The final diagnoses in 8 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer included epidermoid carcinoma (4), adenocarcinoma (3), and bronchoalveolar carcinoma (1). Postoperatively, 1 patient required a permanent pacemaker and 1 patient died. The actuarial survival at 5 years for all patients who underwent combined procedures was 95%. The 5-year survival for the 8 patients with lung cancer was 88% compared with 100% for those with benign pulmonary pathology (p = 0.172). This experience suggests that combining pulmonary resection with cardiac operations is safe and offers a favorable prognosis to a select group of patients. 
5	Antivenom therapy in Russell's viper bite. Bleeding and renal failure are the two main manifestations responsible for the high morbidity and mortality in untreated Russell's viper bite victims. This study was an effort to find prognostic factors and a practical therapeutic approach for the care of such patients. Early detection of abnormalities in the clot quality test and/or evidence of systemic bleeding followed by immediate correction of the clotting defects using specific antivenom can reduce morbidity in Russell's viper envenomation. 
2	Changes in the basal dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells from alcoholic patients--a quantitative Golgi study. Although a variety of pathological changes have been described in the brains of chronic alcoholic patients, there have been no studies which have addressed the question of alterations in cortical neuronal dendritic arborisation. Loss of neurons from the superior frontal gyrus and shrinkage of neurons from both the superior frontal gyrus and motor cortex has been documented in chronic alcoholic patients; these areas were chosen for this study. Using a modified rapid Golgi technique the basal dendritic arborisation of layer III pyramidal neurons was compared in 15 male alcoholic patients and 15 age-matched male controls. All parameters measuring basal dendritic arborisation were significantly less in the alcoholic cases for both the superior frontal and motor cortices. Changes in the arbor are in the terminal branches, which is consistent with other models of dendritic plasticity. Such changes may explain both permanent and reversible functional deficits in chronic alcoholic patients. 
1	Unexpected, spontaneous conversion of a family of rats, from low-leukemic to high-leukemic inbred line. From a nucleus of Sprague-Dawley rats received in 1960 from the National Institutes of Health, we have raised, by brother-to-sister mating, a colony of these animals. The incidence of leukemia in 313 females and 316 males was 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively. About 3 years ago, we observed a relatively high incidence of leukemia in offspring of a healthy female, no. 1. Among the offspring of this female, observed through 12 successive generations, there were 17 leukemias among 44 females (38.6%) and 21 leukemias among 40 males (52.5%), developing at ages varying from 6 to 11.6 months. The most frequent form of leukemia observed was acute myeloid, with a high count of myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes; lymphatic form was relatively rare but was observed occasionally; pronounced anemia was common. In most instances, on autopsy, the pathological picture was that of an enlarged spleen and liver, with the exception of those few animals that developed lymphatic leukemia, with thymic and mesenteric lymphoid tumors. We have no satisfactory explanation for this sudden, unexpected conversion of a part of our Sprague-Dawley rat colony from low-leukemic to high-leukemic inbred line. As a working hypothesis, the possibility of a spontaneous activation of a hypothetical oncogenic virus should be considered. The high leukemic C58 inbred line of mice originated in a similar, unexplained manner [MacDowell, E.C. & Richter, M.N. (1935) Arch. Pathol. 20, 709-724]. However, leukemia developing in mice was subsequently found to be caused by a transmissible virus, whereas, thus far at least, no evidence of a transmissible virus has been found in leukemia developing spontaneously in rats. 
5	Alcohol-dependent unilateral vestibular impairment persisting after a closed head injury. A 20-year-old man suffered a closed head injury followed by symptoms of right-sided labyrinthine concussion with complete clinical recovery within 3 weeks. Episodic vertigo and ataxic gait occurred after the ingestion of small amounts of alcohol over the next 2 years. Electro-oculography revealed a right-sided peripheral type vestibular lesion, only after taking alcohol. This was interpreted as an alcohol-induced impairment of central compensation following an incomplete recovery from right-sided labyrinthine trauma. 
2	Diagnosis of magnesium-induced diarrhea BACKGROUND. There is no specific method of diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea. Therefore, the frequency and clinical importance of diarrhea caused by magnesium are unknown. The purposes of this study were to establish a method for diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea and to apply it to patients with chronic diarrhea. METHODS. We measured fecal output of soluble magnesium and fecal magnesium concentration in 19 normal subjects with formed stools (15 collection periods), with non-magnesium-induced diarrhea (36 collection periods), and with diarrhea induced by magnesium hydroxide alone (11 collection periods) or in combination with phenolphthalein (3 collection periods), and in 359 patients with chronic diarrhea. RESULTS. The upper limits of fecal output of soluble magnesium and fecal magnesium concentration in normal subjects were 14.6 mmol per day and 45.2 mmol per liter, respectively. When normal subjects had diarrhea due to the ingestion of magnesium hydroxide alone or in combination with phenolphthalein, fecal magnesium output was always abnormally high. For each millimole increase in fecal magnesium output, fecal weight increased by approximately 7.3 g. The fecal magnesium concentration was very high when magnesium was the only cause of diarrhea but only moderately elevated when diarrhea was induced by magnesium hydroxide plus phenolphthalein. Biochemical and clinical evidence indicated that excessive ingestion of magnesium was an important cause of chronic diarrhea in 15 of the 359 patients with chronic diarrhea (4.2 percent), if not the only cause. CONCLUSIONS. Quantitative fecal analysis for soluble magnesium is an accurate method of diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea. Some patients with chronic diarrhea ingest excessive amounts of magnesium (in antacids or food supplements), and physicians may fail to discover this before embarking on an expensive and invasive diagnostic evaluation. 
2	Cytologic patterns in juice from human pancreatic transplants: correlation with histologic findings in the graft. In 19 patients who had undergone pancreatic transplantation with temporary exteriorization of the pancreatic juice, graft tissue became available for histologic examination. In these patients the cytologic patterns in the pancreatic juice were compared with the histologic findings in the graft specimens. In five samples the diagnosis by cytologic studies was rejection. Acute rejection was confirmed in all the histologic specimens. In eight cytologic samples, graft pancreatitis was suspected because of the increased amounts of neutrophils, degenerating cells, epithelial cells, monocytes, and some macrophages, with or without necrotic tissue fragments. All eight histologic specimens showed findings characteristic of pancreatitis. In three cytologic samples, bacteria or fungi were observed. Histologic examination of these patients showed graft pancreatitis. In four patients the cytologic findings were normal. Graft histologic factors were normal in two instances. In one of these grafts there was graft pancreatitis, and in one graft chronic vascular rejection was seen. Our study shows that two different pathologic events occurring in the pancreatic graft (i.e., acute rejection and pancreatitis) are reflected by characteristic changes in pancreatic juice cytology. 
4	Ultra short-acting intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade as add-on therapy in acute unstable angina. To assess the efficacy and safety of the ultra short-acting beta-blocking agent, esmolol, in acute unstable angina, we administered esmolol to 21 patients who had persistent angina despite conventional medical therapy. Following a baseline Doppler echocardiographic examination, esmolol was titrated to reduce the rate-pressure product by at least 20%. Once the patients had been receiving a maintenance dosage for 30 minutes, Doppler echocardiographic studies were repeated. Mean esmolol dose at target response was 17 +/- 16 mg/min, with the dosage range of 8 to 24 mg/min. Esmolol was effective in alleviating anginal chest pain in 18 of the 21 patients. Seven patients eventually underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and eight had coronary bypass surgery. The remainder were discharged receiving medical therapy including oral beta-blockade. During esmolol therapy, heart rate and blood pressure decreased significantly (86 +/- 14 to 68 +/- 12 beats/min and 125 +/- 16 to 103 +/- 20 mm Hg, both p less than 0.001). Cardiac output decreased from 5.4 +/- 1.3 to 4.5 +/- 1.1 L/min (p less than 0.001) secondary to a decrease in heart rate as stroke volume remained unchanged. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 47 +/- 12 to 49 +/- 13 with esmolol therapy, although this change was not statistically significant. Both the one third filling fraction as well as E/A ratio (ratio of early-to-late diastolic filling velocities) increased with esmolol therapy (35 +/- 8% to 38 +/- 8% and 0.73 +/- 0.2 to 0.85 +/- 0.23, both p less than 0.005), indicating improvement in left ventricular diastolic function. 
5	Intravenous and oral corticosteroids for the prevention of relapse after treatment of decompensated COPD. Effect on patients with a history of multiple relapses To determine if a regimen of intravenous and oral corticosteroids reduces the relapse rate after treatment of decompensated COPD in the ED, 30 patients were studied. Forty-five visits in which intravenous and oral corticosteroids were given (T visits) were compared with an equal number of matched visits in which they were withheld (N visits). No differences were noted between T and N visits with respect to clinical findings, laboratory results and other forms of therapy. Treatment with corticosteroids reduced the relapse rate within 24 h of discharge. At 48 h, the cumulative relapse rate for T visits (8.9 percent) was significantly lower than for N visits (33.3 percent; p = 0.005). For patients with a history of multiple relapses, a regimen consisting of intravenous and oral corticosteroids reduces the risk of relapse after ED treatment of decompensated COPD. 
5	Physiology of aging related to outcome in the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Thirty-nine patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were enrolled in a study to identify potential age-related changes in organ system function that may help explain the apparent association between age and poor outcome in these patients. Criteria for enrollment included an arterial PO2-to-inspired O2 concentration ratio less than or equal to 200 in a clinical setting consistent with ARDS. Patients were excluded if they were less than 18 yr old, had clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure, were seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus, or had stage II metastatic lung cancer. Patients were divided into two groups: those less than 60 yr old (mean 42 +/- 3 yr, n = 17) and those greater than or equal to 60 yr old (73 +/- 2 yr, n = 16). A group of six patients was analyzed as a separate subset based on a body temperature less than or equal to 97.5 degrees F at enrollment (hypothermic patients, 73 +/- 4 yr old). Sepsis was present in 67% of the nonhypothermic patients and in all the hypothermic patients. Mortality rates were 12% in the patients less than 60 yr and 69% in the nonhypothermic patients greater than or equal to 60 yr. All the hypothermic patients died. Sequential data obtained over 6 days were compared within and between groups. The following results were obtained. 1) The ratio of arterial PO2 to inspired O2 fraction was greater and the positive end-expiratory pressure used was significantly less in the patients greater than or equal to 60 yr old compared with the younger group. 
5	Benign parotid tumour enucleation--a reliable operation in selected cases. The method of surgical treatment for benign tumours of the parotid gland had not yet been rationalized, but many authors recommend parotidectomy as the most appropriate procedure. A series of 289 operations for parotid swelling is reported; the majority of mixed and Warthin's tumours underwent enucleation without either complications or recurrence. The rationale of parotidectomy versus enucleation is discussed but in fast growing, deeply infiltrating and recurrent tumours, parotidectomy appears to be the best choice. In the other group of more commonly occurring tumours, enucleation represents a reliable time saving option. 
4	Effects of low perfusate Ca2+ concentration on newborn myocardial function after ischemia. A greater dependence on transsarcolemmal Ca2+ flux and immaturity of Ca2+ sequestration capacity may potentiate Ca2(+)-mediated reperfusion injury in the newborn myocardium. The effect of serum ionized Ca2+ concentration on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function after ischemia was studied in 5-7-day-old piglets undergoing a 90-minute period of cold-blood cardioplegic arrest. In the control group, Ca2+ was maintained at 1.2 mM (Group A [n = 6]). The cardioplegic solution and bypass perfusate were modified to achieve a low Ca2+ concentration, 0.25 mM, in Group B (n = 6). Left ventricular pressure-volume loops were acquired by using high-fidelity pressure-sensor-tipped and volume-conductance catheters. Ventricular function was assessed from the slope of end-systolic (Ees) and end-diastolic (k) pressure-volume relations during transient caval occlusion. Both groups showed a significant reduction in Ees after ischemia (p less than 0.05). Intergroup comparison of Ees after ischemia demonstrated a better recovery of the systolic function in the low Ca2+ group, 64 +/- 7% versus 49 +/- 6% in the normal Ca2+ group (p = 0.05). There was a significant increase in chamber stiffness index in group A (k, 0.48 +/- 0.06 to 0.65 +/- 0.05 ml-1, p less than 0.01) versus no significant change in group B. This study shows 1) the feasibility of acquiring continuous pressure-volume data in neonatal hearts by using a conductance catheter system, and 2) better preservation of systolic function and diastolic compliance in normal newborn myocardium by low Ca2+ concentration in the peri-ischemic period. 
4	Fragmented atrial activity in patients with transient atrial fibrillation. Prediction of atrial fibrillation (AF) is very important in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or in the selection of pacemaker therapeutic modality. In 25 patients with transient AF, the response of the atrial activity width to extrastimuli was examined in comparison with 25 patients without AF to see if the results could be used as an index of subsequent occurrence of AF. Programmed electrical stimulation using eight basic stimuli followed by single or double extrastimuli (P1P2 or P1P2P3) were delivered to the high right atrium, and the atrial activities were examined. The prolongation of the atrial activity caused by extrastimuli was termed fragmentation (Frg), and it was defined as the prolongation of more than 150% of the basic stimuli. Frg zone was defined as the zone of coupling intervals of the extrastimuli (P1P2 or P2P3) that caused Frg, and delta max Frg was defined as the difference between the widest Frg and the atrial wave width during basic stimuli. Fragmentation was reproducibly induced by extrastimuli, and there was an inverse relationship between Frg duration and the coupling interval of the extrastimuli (P1P2 or P2P3). Frg zone and delta max Frg were wider and longer in patients with transient AF in comparison with the control group for both single and double extrastimuli (p less than 0.001). AF inducibility using double extrastimuli was significantly high in patients with AF. 
3	Molecular biology of atherothrombotic brain infarction. Because reduced high density lipoproteins may contribute to atherothrombotic brain infarction, we performed molecular biologic and metabolic studies to characterize high density lipoprotein metabolism with respect to its role in reverse cholesterol transport, to clone the high density lipoprotein receptor, and to determine gene polymorphism for apolipoprotein A-I, the major protein of high density lipoprotein, because altered structure may impair reverse cholesterol transport. For high density lipoprotein metabolism measurements, high density lipoprotein 3 was isolated, purified, and labeled with iodine-125. The radiolabeled high density lipoprotein 3 was reinjected, and daily blood samples were taken for 10 days. Synthesis rates and fractional catabolic rates were determined from the specific activities and daily decrements. Preliminary data indicate that stroke-prone individuals' fractional catabolic rates for high density lipoprotein 3 are twice those of normal individuals. Also, the conversion of high density lipoprotein 3 to high density lipoprotein 2 is reduced in these individuals, suggesting that high density lipoprotein may be abnormally processed in individuals prone to atherothrombic brain infarctions. We surveyed more than 100 patients with carotid stenosis using a 2.2-kb probe for the apolipoprotein A-I gene. A subset of these patients displays polymorphism with restriction enzymes SacI or PstI. These preliminary findings suggest that gene polymorphism for apolipoprotein A-I may provide a molecular clue of atherothrombic brain infarction. 
4	Body surface mapping of high-frequency components in the terminal portion during QRS complex for the prediction of ventricular tachycardia in patients with previous myocardial infarction. To study the clinical significance of terminal QRS high-frequency components for the prediction of ventricular tachycardia, an 87-lead body surface signal-averaged mapping was performed in 21 healthy subjects (control) and in 41 patients with previous myocardial infarction (anterior, 20; inferior, 21). Mapping data were analyzed and averaged (129.7 +/- 26.5 beats) for 160 seconds, and the signal-averaged beat was filtered with a bidirectional bandwidth (80-250 Hz) digital filter. J-point was determined from the 87-lead RMS voltage of nonfiltered QRS. For each lead, we calculated the sum of the absolute value of filtered QRS from 20 msec ahead of the J-point to the J-point (A-20). The body surface distribution of A-20 was expressed as A-20 map. The maxima in A-20 maps were mainly located on the upper sternal region in healthy subjects, on the left anterior chest in patients with previous anterior myocardial infarction, and on the central anterior chest in patients with previous inferior myocardial infarction. In the patients in both the group with anterior myocardial infarction and the group with inferior myocardial infarction, the value of maximum was significantly greater than in the subjects in the control group (0.181 +/- 0.086 and 0.138 +/- 0.048, respectively, vs. 0.075 +/- 0.031 mV.msec; p less than 0.01). In patients with myocardial infarction (n = 41), the value of maximum was significantly greater with ventricular tachycardia (n = 11) than without ventricular tachycardia (n = 30) (0.240 +/- 0.076 vs. 0.130 +/- 0.043 mV.msec; p less than 0.01). 
1	Occurrence of human papillomavirus type 16 DNA in cutaneous squamous and basal cell neoplasms. Sixty-eight cutaneous squamous cell neoplasms (in situ and invasive) and 26 basal cell carcinomas from 89 patients were analyzed for DNA sequences homologous to the human papillomavirus (HPV) types found predominantly in the genital tract. Thirty-six (53%) of the squamous cell neoplasms contained HPV DNA as detected by filter or in situ hybridization analysis. The frequency of detection of HPV DNA was dependent on the site of the lesion. Of 40 genital squamous cell neoplasms (penile, vulvar, and perianal), 27 (68%) had detectable HPV DNA. In 25 of these, the HPV type was 16 or HPV-16-related, which was similar to the results for the squamous cell neoplasms of the finger (HPV DNA in 9 of 11 tumors with HPV-16 in seven). None of 16 squamous cell neoplasms from sites other than the genital tract or the finger had detectable HPV DNA. HPV DNA was detected in one of the 26 basal cell carcinomas (4%). We conclude that, for cutaneous epithelial malignancies, HPV-16 is restricted to squamous cell neoplasms of the genital tract and finger. These data are consistent with venereal transmission of HPV-16 to the periungual region and suggests a role for this virus in the evolution of squamous cell carcinoma at this site. 
3	Structural alterations of nerve during cuff compression. Whether compression nerve injury is due to ischemia, direct mechanical injury, or both remains unsettled. To assess structural changes of nerve during compression, peroneal nerves of rats were compressed at various pressures for different times, and the structural alterations were stopped by simultaneous in situ and perfusion fixation. The structural changes observed during a few minutes of compression cannot be explained by ischemic injury because the pathologic alterations characteristic of ischemia take many hours to develop and in any case are different from the ones found here. The pressure- and time-related structural changes observed in the present study under the cuff were (i) decrease in fascicular area and increase in fiber density due to expression of endoneurial fluid; (ii) compression and expression of axoplasm, sometimes to the point of fiber transection; (iii) lengthening of internodes; and (iv) obscuration of nodes of Ranvier due to cleavage and displacement of myelin and overlapping of nodes by displaced loops of myelin. At the edges of the cuff the changes were (i) increase of fascicular area probably from expressed endoneurial fluid; (ii) widening of nodal gaps, perhaps mainly from translocated axonal fluid; and (iii) disordered structure of axoplasm. We suggest that the process of paranodal demyelination and axonal transection are linked, occur during the act of compression, and are due to shear forces. The initial event is expression of endoneurial fluid, followed by compression and expression of axoplasm and cleavage and displacement of layers of myelin. Conceivably, with prolonged cuff compression ischemic injury might be found to be superimposed on mechanical injury. 
1	Adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus after total gastrectomy A 64-yr-old Japanese male who underwent a partial gastrectomy for a duodenal ulcer at the age of 21, a total resection of the remnant stomach for a stomal ulcer at age 25, and in whom Barrett's esophagus was diagnosed at age 47, was found to have a tumor at the distal esophagus and was operated on by thoracic esophagectomy. The tumor was a well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading down to the muscularis propria. The entire esophageal mucosa in the resected specimen was lined by columnar epithelium. This tumor was thought to derive from the Barrett's esophageal epithelium. 
1	Uneventful delivery following series of successive treatments for virilized Cushing syndrome due to adrenocortical carcinoma. A twenty-one-year-old virilized woman with Cushing syndrome due to a huge adrenocortical carcinoma was successively treated with trilostane (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor), subsequent adrenalectomy, and postoperative cis-platinum. Clinical or biochemical abnormalities peculiar to Cushing syndrome gradually subsided, and three and one-half years after the adrenal surgery, the patient delivered a normal female infant. This study points out some of the clinical and biochemical responses of each treatment. 
5	Effects of nimodipine on cerebral blood flow and neuropsychological outcome after cardiac surgery. Thirty-five patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were allocated randomly in a prospective double-blind study to receive either nimodipine 0.5 micrograms kg-1 min-1 or placebo. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured during and immediately after CPB. Neuropsychological tests were performed 6 months after surgery to determine any relationship between ischaemic damage and CBF and administration of nimodipine. There were no differences in CBF between the nimodipine (n = 18) and placebo groups (n = 17). Significant changes in neuropsychological tests were found in six patients tested 6 months after surgery but there were no conclusive signs of ischaemic damage. The nimodipine-treated group performed better in tests of verbal fluency and visual retention, suggesting that some memory functions were preserved better in this group. 
1	6-[18F]fluoro-L-fucose: a possible tracer for assessing glycoconjugate synthesis in tumors with positron emission tomography. The potential of 6-[18F]fluoro-L-fucose (6-[18F]FFuc) for assessing glycoconjugate synthesis in tumors with positron emission tomography (PET) was investigated. Using the tissue sampling method with five tumor models, different time-radioactivity profiles were found: a nearly constant level in Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) and different clearance patterns in others. Rapid clearance in normal tissues resulted in preferable uptake ratios for tumor imaging of brain and pancreas. Metabolic studies and the L-fucose loading effects on the tissue uptake proved the tracer to be a biochemically active L-fucose analog. Imaging of the intracranial rat glioma and 3LL in lungs or hepatomas in mice by autoradiography (ARG) and intramuscular VX-2 carcinoma in rabbits by PET was demonstrated. Using double-radionuclide ARG, similar distribution images of 6-[18F]FFuc and 14C-L-fucose but different tumor-to-liver uptake ratios were found. A metastasis model seemed to show a higher uptake of both tracers as compared to a primary tumor model. 
1	Introducing the 'walk-up' flap. Reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgeons often find the need for additional soft tissue even when a myocutaneous flap has been previously placed. This article introduces the principles, technique, and results of 32 "walk-up" muscle flaps derived from existing myocutaneous flaps. The anastomotic vascular ingrowth at the original myocutaneous flap's distal end permits its proximal detachment and axial vessel ligation to rotate the proximal two thirds to a tissue-deficient site. In our experience at the University of Miami, these flaps have been predictable (97% viable transfer rate), have provided vascular soft tissue in deficient areas, and have been skin grafted at their surface to increase oral lining or skin cover, among several other uses. 
1	Recurrent or metastatic disease in select patients with adrenocortical carcinoma. Aggressive resection vs chemotherapy. In a retrospective, nonrandomized comparison of patients with first recurrence of adrenocortical cancer, 18 patients were treated with chemotherapy (primarily mitotane) and 15 patients were treated with surgical resection plus similar chemotherapy. Surgical resection of recurrent adrenocortical cancer was often extensive, with morbidity in 20% of patients and no mortality. Mitotane therapy was ineffective at controlling tumor growth. Median survival from the time of diagnosis for all patients was only 23 months and no patient was cured. Disease-free interval greater than 12 months was associated with prolonged survival, but it only occurred in six patients (18%), with a similar frequency in both treatment groups. Surgical resection of recurrent disease was associated with prolonged survival from the time of first recurrence. The potential benefit of this resection was evident in the 5 patients (33%) who were able to live greater than 5 years from the time of first recurrence with improvement in symptoms and signs of hypercortisolism. Although no patient with recurrent adrenal cancer could be cured, resection of recurrent disease was associated with a slight prolongation of survival and good palliation of Cushing's syndrome. 
1	A randomized, controlled trial of prophylactic ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus pulmonary infection in recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants; The City of Hope-Stanford-Syntex CMV Study Group BACKGROUND. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated interstitial pneumonia is a major cause of death after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We conducted a controlled trial of ganciclovir in recipients of bone marrow transplants who had asymptomatic pulmonary CMV infection. We also sought to identify risk factors for the development of CMV interstitial pneumonia. METHODS. After bone marrow transplantation, 104 patients who had no evidence of respiratory disease underwent routine bronchoalveolar lavage on day 35. The 40 patients who had positive cultures for CMV were randomly assigned to either prophylactic ganciclovir or observation alone. Ganciclovir (5 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) was given twice daily for two weeks and then five times per week until day 120. RESULTS. Of the 20 culture-positive patients who received prophylactic ganciclovir, 5 (25 percent) died or had CMV pneumonia before day 120, as compared with 14 of the 20 culture-positive control patients (70 percent) who were not treated prophylactically (relative risk, 0.36; P = 0.01). No patient who received the full course of ganciclovir prophylaxis went on to have CMV interstitial pneumonia. Four patients treated with ganciclovir had maximal serum creatinine levels greater than or equal to 221 mumol per liter (2.5 mg per deciliter), as compared with none of the controls (P = 0.029). Of the 55 CMV-negative patients who could be evaluated, 12 (22 percent) had CMV pneumonia--a significantly lower rate than in the untreated CMV-positive control patients (relative risk, 0.33; P = 0.003). The strongest predictors of CMV pneumonia were a lavage-fluid culture that was positive for CMV and a CMV-positive blood culture, both from specimens obtained on day 35. CONCLUSION. In recipients of allogeneic bone marrow, asymptomatic CMV infection of the lung is a major risk factor for subsequent CMV interstitial pneumonia. Prophylactic ganciclovir is effective in preventing the development of CMV interstitial pneumonia in patients with asymptomatic infection. 
1	Multiple myeloma: VMCP/VBAP alternating combination chemotherapy is not superior to melphalan and prednisone even in high-risk patients. The efficacy of alternating vincristine, melphalan (M), cyclophosphamide, prednisone/vincristine, carmustine, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VMCP/VBAP) polychemotherapy was compared with the M and prednisone (MP) regimen as induction treatment in multiple myeloma (MM). Three hundred four MM patients entered this study between March 1983 and July 1986; the analysis was performed in December 1989. The treatment groups did not show significant differences with respect to major prognostic factors. Median overall survival was 33.8 months. In the VMCP/VBAP and MP arms, after 12 induction chemotherapy cycles, 59.0% and 47.3% (P less than .068) of the patients achieved an M component reduction greater than 50%. No significant difference was observed in the two treatment arms in terms of remission duration (21.3 v 19.6 months, P less than .66) and survival (31.6 v 37.0 months, P less than .28). Patients younger than 65 years did not show any advantage from the alternating polychemotherapy. At diagnosis, the plasma cell labeling index (LI) and serum beta-2 microglobulin (beta 2-m) were evaluated in 173 and 183 patients, respectively. A significantly reduced survival was observed for patients with LI greater than or equal to 2% (16.4 months) or beta 2-m greater than or equal to 6 mg/L (20.4 months). Even in these poor-risk subgroups, VMCP/VBAP was not superior to MP. 
4	Subnormal parasympathetic activity after cardiac transplantation. Heart period variability (standard deviation of 120 consecutive RR or PP intervals) was used to assess baseline parasympathetic activity in 18 patients with congestive heart failure before and after orthotopic cardiac transplantation, and was compared to that of 16 age-matched control subjects. Mean heart period variability (+/- standard error of the mean) was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) in control subjects (58 +/- 5 ms) than in the patients at any time before or after transplantation. Heart period variability of innervated recipient atria did not change significantly early (1 to 4 weeks) after transplantation (16 +/- 2 to 24 +/- 5 ms; p = 0.11), but increased significantly between weeks 15 and 37 after transplantation (30 +/- 5 ms, p less than 0.002 versus before transplantation). A stepwise regression model (R2 = 0.35; p = 0.01) showed that heart period variability was directly related to time after transplantation and inversely related to systolic arterial pressure after transplantation and degree of rejection. Heart period variability of the denervated donor atria did not change from early to late periods after transplantation, suggesting that vagal reinnervation of the donor heart had not occurred. These data indicate that baseline parasympathetic activity does not increase significantly during the first month after transplantation but increases significantly between months 3 and 6. 
4	Why do lean hypertensives have higher mortality rates than other hypertensives? Findings of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program. Specific causes of death were analyzed for 10,908 participants in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, to explore possible explanations for the observed excess 8.3-year mortality from all causes in hypertensives with low body mass. Although the cardiovascular mortality rate among men in the lowest decile of body mass (body mass index 21.96 or less) was 50% higher than that of men in the median class (body mass index 26.4-28.8), death rate for noncardiovascular deaths was more than 2 1/2 times higher in men with lean versus median body mass. The pattern was similar among women. Among noncardiovascular causes, striking differences in mortality rates between lean hypertensives and those of average body mass were observed for cirrhotic death (relative risk of 12+ in men and 11+ in women), for nonmalignant respiratory disease in men (relative risk of 7+), for violent death (both sexes), and for malignant neoplasms in men. Prevalence of smoking was almost twice as high in the lowest compared with the median body mass group; among the lean, excess deaths, particularly noncardiovascular deaths, were concentrated among smokers. Thus, male smokers in the lowest decile of body mass constituted only 3% of the study population, but contributed 8% of all deaths, 11% of all noncardiovascular deaths, and 22% of all cirrhotic deaths. A larger proportion of deaths occurred early in follow-up in the lean versus other hypertensives, suggesting occult disease among the lean at baseline. There was no evidence that more severe or treatment-resistant hypertension was present in or could explain excess mortality among the hypertensives with low body mass. The inference from the findings is not that overweight is protective for hypertensives nor that excess risk is due to leanness per se. Rather, a reasonable hypothesis, particularly from findings on specific causes of death, is that excess mortality in lean hypertensives is due to deleterious lifestyles, particularly smoking and excess alcohol intake, contributing to both leanness and risk of death. 
4	Effect of long-term exercise on regional myocardial function and coronary collateral development after gradual coronary artery occlusion in pigs. The effect of myocardial ischemia, induced by long-term exercise, on regional myocardial function and coronary collateral development was examined in pigs after gradual occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) with an ameroid occluder. Thirty days after surgery, regional myocardial function and blood flow were assessed during exercise in 22 pigs separated into exercise (n = 12) and sedentary groups (n = 10). The exercise group trained on a treadmill for 25 +/- 1 days, 30-50 min/day, at heart rates of 210-220 beats/min. After 5 weeks, another exercise test was performed. In the exercise group, after training, we observed an improvement in systolic wall thickening, expressed as a percentage of rest, in the collateral-dependent LCx region from 64 +/- 8% to 87 +/- 6% (p less than 0.01) at moderate exercise levels (220 beats/min) and from 45 +/- 7% to 73 +/- 7% (p less than 0.01) at severe exercise levels (265 beats/min). Transmural myocardial blood flow in the LCx region expressed as a ratio of flow in the nonoccluded region of the left ventricle also increased significantly (p less than 0.01) during severe exercise after 5 weeks. The sedentary group showed an improvement in systolic wall thickening in the LCx region during moderate exercise compared with the initial exercise test (p less than 0.05) but no significant change in systolic wall thickening or myocardial blood flow ratios during severe exercise after 5 weeks. We conclude that long-term exercise after gradual LCx coronary artery occlusion in pigs improves myocardial function and coronary collateral reserve in collateral-dependent myocardium during exercise. 
1	Quality of life research in oncology. Past achievements and future priorities. The status of quality of life research in oncology is assessed, and priorities for future research with regard to conceptual and theoretical developments, focus and content of research, research designs and practical strategies for research implementation, and transferring information to clinical practice and medical policy decision-making are identified. There is general agreement that quality of life is a subjective and multidimensional construct, yet comprehensive theoretical models have not been developed and applied fully. We recommend that future research be based on conceptual models that explicate the interrelationships among quality of life domains throughout the stages of cancer care. These models, and the longitudinal research that follows from them, should attend specifically to cross-class and cross-cultural issues to avoid overgeneralization from theory and research that are based largely on the views of the majority culture. We encourage the inclusion of this theory-based quality of life assessment as a standard component of clinical trials. Success in this endeavor will require additional standardization of quality of life measures for use across a range of cancer patient populations, including the development of age-specific norms and instruments designed to assess the entire family system. 
3	Kearns-Sayre syndrome presenting as renal tubular acidosis. Renal tubular acidosis and tetany were the 1st manifestations of Kearns-Sayre syndrome in a 5-year-old child. Subsequently, he developed progressive external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, retinopathy, heart block, and endocrinopathy. There was a 7.5-kb deletion of mitochondrial DNA documented in muscle, kidney, skin fibroblasts, and leukocytes, providing evidence for a multisystem mitochondrial cytopathy. 
4	Prognosis of acute myocardial infarction complicated by primary ventricular fibrillation. Principal Investigators of the SPRINT Study. In 5,839 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), hospitalized between July 1981 and July 1983 in 14 coronary care units in Israel, the incidence of primary ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 2.1%. Patients with primary VF resembled counterparts without VF in terms of age, gender, frequency of previous AMI and past cigarette smoking habits. The hospital course of patients with primary VF revealed increased incidence of primary atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular block. Increased serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase were noted among the patients with primary VF. In-hospital mortality rate was 18.8% in 122 patients with primary VF compared with 8.5% in 3,707 patients forming the reference group (p less than 0.01). Adjustment by age using logistic function yielded an estimate of 2.86 for relative mortality odds associated with primary VF, and further adjustment by gender, history of AMI, systemic hypertension, and by enzymatically estimated infarct size slightly reduced the estimated odds, at 2.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 4.46). Prognosis after discharge from the hospital was independent of primary VF. In conclusion, primary VF exerts an independent, significant effect on in-hospital mortality. 
4	Durability of vein graft revision: the outcome of secondary procedures. Occlusive lesions that reduced graft blood flow and ankle systolic pressure were identified in 83 femorodistal saphenous vein bypasses by use of duplex scanning or arteriography. Sites of stenosis included vein conduit (n = 41), anastomoses (n = 20), outflow arteries (n = 15), or inflow (n = 9) arteries. One hundred three secondary procedures consisting of vein-patch angioplasty (n = 31), sequential (n = 21) or interposition (n = 17) graft placement, percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (n = 17), or excision of the lesion and primary anastomosis (n = 16) were performed to correct primary (n = 85) or recurrent (n = 18) graft stenoses. Cumulative graft patency after reintervention was 96% at 1 year, and 85% at 5 years. Stenosis or occlusion of revision sites was less after excision (0 of 16) or replacement (1 of 17) of abnormal segments compared to vein-patch angioplasty (8 of 31) or balloon angioplasty (9 of 18). Sequential or jump grafts constructed to improve graft outflow impaired by either myointimal or atherosclerotic occlusive lesions were the least durable secondary procedures. Five of eight graft failures in this series resulted from sequential/jump graft occlusion. All categories of secondary procedures normalized graft and limb hemodynamics, although only one third of patients reported symptoms of limb ischemia before revision. Surveillance of infrainguinal vein bypasses for occlusive lesions is a valid concept to salvage patent but hemodynamically-failing grafts. Secondary procedures that excised the lesion, used autologous tissue reconstruction, and normalized hemodynamics at the revision site and in the vein bypass were associated with a low incidence of restenosis and prolonged graft patency. 
3	Epilepsy. As surgical treatments for adult and pediatric forms of epilepsy have become more refined, methods for noninvasive localization of epileptogenic foci have become increasingly important. Detection of focal brain metabolic or flow abnormalities is now well recognized as an essential step in the presurgical evaluation of many patients with epilepsy. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is most beneficial when used in the context of the total clinical evaluation of patients, including scalp EEG, invasive EEG, neuropsychologic testing, etc. Metabolic PET studies also give insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms of epilepsy. The dynamic nature of the interictal hypometabolism observed with 18[F]FDG in some patients suggests that excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters and their receptors may be involved. An exciting current application of PET scanning is the use of tracers for neurotransmitter receptors in the study of epilepsy patients. Mu and non-mu opiate receptors have been extensively studied and are beginning to give new insights into this disorder. Increased labeling of mu receptors in temporal neocortex using 11C-carfentanil has been demonstrated and, in some patients, supplements the clinical localization information from 18[F]FDG studies. Increased mu opiate receptor number or affinity is thought to play a role in anticonvulsant mechanisms. Specificity of increased mu receptors is supported by the absence of significant changes in non-mu opiate receptors. Other brain receptors are also of interest for future studies, particularly those for excitatory neurotransmitters. Combined studies of flow, metabolism, and neuroreceptors may elucidate the factors responsible for initiation and termination of seizures, thus improving patient treatment. 
5	Emergency center ultrasonography in the evaluation of hemoperitoneum: a prospective study. The reliability of ultrasonographic detection (US) of hemoperitoneum in blunt abdominal trauma was evaluated in a prospective study of 72 patients. Independent of the examiner, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were, respectively, 86.7%, 100%, and 97.2%. Laparotomy was indicated in 76.9% of US hemoperitoneum-positive cases. No negative laparotomies were performed in this study group. If hemoperitoneum is revealed in US and vital signs are unstable, we think laparotomy is indicated. We believe that US in an emergency center is a quick, safe screening method in the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. US might take over a great part of the role of diagnostic peritoneal lavage. 
2	Prospective randomized study on the effect of ranitidine against injection ulcer after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for esophageal varices. Thirty-five consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for esophageal varices were randomly allocated to either ranitidine-administered group (18 patients) or ranitidine-nonadministered group (17 patients), in an attempt to evaluate the efficacy of ranitidine for prevention and healing of postinjection ulcer with a prospective randomized trial. Two of seventeen patients in the nonadministered group dropped out of this trial because of development of gastric ulcer, so 18 patients in the first group were evaluated and compared with the 15 remaining patients in the second group. Sclerotherapy was performed with 5% ethanolamine oleate and 0.6% polydocanol; the mean number of injection courses and the mean amount of sclerosant were the same in both groups. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the two groups in either the occurrence rate or the size of injection ulcer 1 wk after the last session. However, the persistence rate of ulcer 1 month after last injection in the ranitidine-administered group was significantly lower than that in the ranitidine-nonadministered group (6.3% vs. 38.5%, p less than 0.05). Our study demonstrated that ranitidine administration will help to hasten healing of postinjection ulcer, although it was not effective for prevention of injection ulcer. 
5	Early gastric cancer. Twenty-eight-year experience. A retrospective study of early gastric cancer (60 patients) was performed to evaluate its diagnosis and treatment. Ninety-five per cent of patients presented with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and 53.3% had been treated for presumed benign disease for up to 48 months before diagnosis. Fiberoptic endoscopy detected these lesions more accurately than radiologic examination. The disease-free 5-year survival rate after resection was 76.4%. Survival showed no significant correlation with sex, tumor site, macroscopic appearance, extent of gastric resection, or histopathologic type. Tumors larger than 1.5 cm in diameter, invasion of submucosa, or lymph node metastasis resulted in significantly lower survival rates. Three of eight patients with nodal metastasis survived 5 or more years, including one who had second-echelon deposits. A high index of suspicion may permit more frequent detection. Extended lymphadenectomy (R2) is recommended to achieve the highest possible cure rate. 
1	Meningeal involvement in Bence Jones multiple myeloma. A case of Bence Jones kappa multiple myeloma with meningeal involvement in a 64-year-old woman is presented. Three years after the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, gait disturbances developed followed by visual disorders and impaired consciousness. A lumbar puncture revealed numerous atypical plasma cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. Craniospinal irradiation and intrathecal injections of methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisolone were effective for a short period. At autopsy, the leptomeninges were infiltrated diffusely with atypical plasma cells. A review of the literature showed that multiple myeloma with meningeal involvement is accompanied frequently by circulating atypical plasma cells or plasma cell leukemia. Meningeal involvement is a rare complication and shows poor prognosis in cases of multiple myeloma. 
3	Platelet-activating factor. A putative mediator in central nervous system injury? Platelet-activating factor (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) is a potent lipid autacoid produced by many cell types. Platelet-activating factor is produced by cerebellar granule cells in culture and has been extracted from brain tissue. Multiple platelet-activating factor receptors have been demonstrated in brain tissue. Activation of platelet-activating factor receptors in transformed neuronal cell lines involved increases in intracellular calcium. Platelet-activating factor has potent actions on cerebral vessels and cerebral metabolism when administered in vivo, but may not have direct effects on brain microvessels. Excessive platelet-activating factor production in pathological states of the nervous system such as neurotrauma and stroke has been shown in only a few models (e.g., spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion or focal repercussion brain injury). In multiple studies using highly specific and potent platelet-activating factor antagonists, reversal or prevention of key consequences of brain injury such as hypoperfusion following ischemia, reperfusion and edema, inflammatory cell accumulation, neurologic/motor deficits, and neuronal salvage were demonstrated. This review provides and analyzes evidence in support of the role that platelet-activating factor might have in modulation of brain function and pathophysiological processes in brain ischemia and trauma. 
1	Beta-carotene's effects on serum lipoproteins and immunologic indices in humans. Doses of beta-carotene for cancer-prevention trials have been chosen based on epidemiologic data. Mechanisms of the putative antineoplastic effects by beta-carotene are unknown but may involve modulation of the immune system. We measured plasma carotenoid concentrations and selected immunologic indices at baseline and at 2 and 4 wk in 50 healthy humans (5 groups of 10 each) ingesting 0, 15, 45, 180, or 300 mg beta-carotene/d for 1 mo in this randomized placebo-controlled, open-label, parallel study. Plasma beta-carotene concentrations were markedly increased by 2 wk and were correlated with dose. Beta-carotene concentrations plateaued between 2 and 4 wk except for the 300-mg group. Thus, we developed a dose-concentration curve to optimize beta-carotene-dose selection to achieve target plasma concentrations. We were unable to identify any effects of beta-carotene ingestion on the immunologic indices studied, but modest increases in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol were observed in all beta-carotene-treated groups. 
5	The alien hand sign. Localization, lateralization and recovery. The alien hand sign was first described by Brion and Jedynak as a "feeling of estrangement between the patient and one of his hands." The affected hand frequently shows a grasp reflex and an instinctive grasp reaction as well as elements of what Denny-Brown referred to as a "magnetic apraxia" associated with frontal lobe damage. Most notably, however, the affected hand is observed to perform apparently purposive behaviors that are perceived as being outside the volitional control of the patient. The patients interpret the behavior of their own affected limb as being controlled by an external agent. They do not feel that they are initiating or controlling the behavior of the hand and often express dismay at the hand's "extravolitional" activity. The patients attempt to control behavior of the alien hand with the unimpaired hand by forcibly restraining the affected limb, an act that may be termed "self-restriction." In this paper, we report an additional four cases of alien hand sign in right-handed subjects: two involving the right hand and two involving the left hand. In each case, the clinical findings were associated with extensive unilateral damage of the medial frontal cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to the affected hand. Furthermore, the alien movement gradually disappears over the course of 6-12 months after the stroke. These clinical case studies are presented and discussed in the context of the "dual premotoer systems hypothesis," an anatomicophysiological model that proposes that action is organized by two separate but interactive premotor brain systems corresponding to evolutionarily defined medial and lateral cortical moieties. It is hypothesized that the alien mode behavior results from unconstrained activity of the lateral premotor system in the damaged hemisphere. The residual volitional control in the limb occurs through the activity of the intact medial premotor system of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Recovery may occur through extension of these ipsilateral control mechanisms by compensatory changes in subcortical systems controlling hemispheric activation associated with adaptive behavior. This observation may be important in understanding mechanisms involved in motor recovery after stroke. 
1	Hepatic arterial embolization in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis. Transarterial hepatic embolization was attempted in 10 and succeeded in nine patients with hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied by extensive celiac arterial stenosis. All catheterization was done through the femoral artery. In six cases, the tip of the catheter (2.5-F ball-tip microcatheter in three cases, 4-F ball-tip supple catheter in three cases) was placed in the proper hepatic artery through the pancreaticoduodenal collaterals. In three cases, a ball-tip microcatheter was injected from the guiding catheter, which was placed in a pinhole of the celiac trunk. These techniques involving flow-guided ball-tip catheters are of great value for hepatic arterial catheterization in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis. 
4	Venous stasis and vein lumen changes during surgery The mechanisms underlying the development of postoperative deep vein thrombosis remain to be fully elucidated. Previous studies have suggested that peroperative venous distension may be a factor associated with venous thromboembolism. In this study we have obtained high resolution ultrasound images of gastrocnemius and posterior tibial veins in 62 patients undergoing a range of general surgical procedures. From these we determined the changes in vein diameter occurring during the operative procedures, in response to induction of anaesthesia, and after completion of surgery. Veins showed no evidence of dilatation in response to the induction of anaesthesia, but by the end of the operative procedure showed distension of 22-28 per cent. Distension was most prominent in the gastrocnemius veins, and lesser distension was observed in the posterior tibial veins. In a series of patients who received an infusion of 1 litre of saline in addition to basal requirements, distension was 57 per cent compared with 22 per cent in the corresponding control group. Intraoperative venous distension is associated with factors that lead to deep vein thrombosis and may be involved in the mechanisms which result in the commencement of deep vein thrombosis. 
5	Haemostatic changes in the loin pain and haematuria syndrome: secondary to renal vasospasm? Twenty-five patients (seven male, 18 female) were diagnosed as having the loin pain and haematuria syndrome. Presenting symptoms were either loin pain alone or pain associated with macroscopic or microscopic haematuria, and were longstanding, having been present for mean of 9.3 years in males, and 10 years in females. Ten patients described symptoms of passing gravel or renal stones but these were only demonstrated radiologically in two patients. Investigation of all patients showed anatomically normal renal tracts, normal renal function, and no significant proteinuria. Phase-contrast microscopy during episodes of haematuria revealed dysmorphic red cells in all 10 patients studied. Renal biopsies were performed in 20 patients and showed no glomerular pathology, but arteriolar and arterial hyalinosis was seen in 13 of 20 (65 per cent), fibro-elastosis in larger vessels in eight of 20 (40 per cent) and red blood cells in tubules in 13 of 20 (65 per cent) patients. The histological appearance in vessels was similar to that seen in cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity and would be consistent with the hypothesis that regional vasospasm occurs in the cortical circulation. Haematological studies in 22 patients, when compared with age and sex matched controls, showed the presence of circulating platelet aggregates, elevation of plasma beta-thromboglobulin (p less than 0.001), and increased platelet aggregation in response to serotonin and ADP (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.03, respectively). Plasma concentrations of D dimer (p less than 0.02) and C-reactive protein (p less than 0.03) were also significantly elevated in the patient group. There was no deterioration of renal function during a mean observation period of 3.7 years and no patients developed proteinuria. Treatment was largely supportive; seven patients with intractable loin pain underwent surgical denervation with the relief of pain in four. 
3	Outcome among surviving very low birthweight infants: a meta-analysis. Because published outcome studies are the only available source of data about the morbidity among surviving very low birthweight infants (VLBW, less than 1500 g) a search was carried out of 1136 references in the English language. A total of 111 outcome studies were found that reported morbidity data in cohorts of VLBW infants born since 1960. The methods used and results obtained in these studies were systematically assessed. No agreement exists about the definition of study populations, descriptive statistics, or measurement of outcome. Follow up ranged from six months to 14 years. In 85 cohorts the incidence of cerebral palsy was recorded, and in 106 that of disability. Studies that followed up infants for longer time periods reported higher incidences of disability. Studies from the United States reported higher incidences of disability than those from other countries. The median incidence of cerebral palsy among all the cohorts studied was 7.7%, and the median incidence of disability was 25.0%. Despite substantial improvements in the mortality of VLBW infants, poor outcomes among survivors are common. 
4	Emergency aortocoronary bypass after failed angioplasty. One thousand two hundred fourteen percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties were performed over a 38-month period. Sixty patients required immediate emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after angioplasty failure; 7 of these had evidence of acute myocardial infarction before angioplasty and were excluded from the study. Of the 53 patients remaining, 27 (51%) had electrocardiographic and enzyme evidence of postoperative myocardial infarction. Two patients died (4%), and 10 had postoperative complications (19%). No statistical significance was noted comparing age, sex, incidence of prior myocardial infarction or myocardial dysfunction, time for revascularization, or average number of grafts completed in those with single-vessel (n = 21) versus multiple-vessel (n = 32) coronary artery disease. Postoperatively, those with multiple-vessel disease required intraaortic balloon pump support (p = 0.06) and antiarrhythmic medications more frequently than single-vessel patients (p less than 0.01) and had a higher complication rate (p less than 0.05). Although not reaching statistical significance, the data also suggest a higher death and postoperative myocardial infarction rate in patients with multiple-vessel disease. Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty carries a higher morbidity and mortality than elective coronary artery bypass grafting, particularly for patients with multiple-vessel coronary artery disease. 
2	Acalculus lymphoeosinophilic cholecystitis associated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy. A case of unusual cholecystitis that developed on completion of interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy is described. A 62-year-old man was treated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells for disseminated renal cell carcinoma. During the course of the immunotherapy, his serum alkaline phosphatase level increased, as did the peripheral eosinophil count (0.31). Subsequently, clinical and radiologic evidence of acute cholecystitis was noted. The removed gallbladder showed acalculus cholecystitis with extensive diffuse infiltrates of numerous eosinophils and T lymphocytes, but sparse polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The authors name this unusual cholecystitis acalculus lymphoeosinophilic cholecystitis and believe it to be associated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy. The pathogenic relationship is discussed. 
5	Eleven years' experience with retinopathy of prematurity: visual results and contribution of cryoablation. We report our 11 years' experience of cryotherapy for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Charts of 624 infants weighing under 1250 g who were admitted to our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during 1977-87 were reviewed. Three hundred and eighty nine babies survived, and the total ROP prevalence was 57.5%. Cryotherapy was applied to 35%. Only one case (0.25%) of blindness was detected, and four babies (1%) had a final visual acuity of less than 20/200 in one eye. The complication rate following cryoablation was very low. 
1	Pulmonary tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries. A prospective study of 12 cases. Pulmonary tumor embolism leading to subacute cor pulmonale has been extensively studied. However, to our knowledge, the involvement of pulmonary alveolar capillaries has not previously been studied in detail. A prospective study was conducted on 112 autopsied patients with cancer to determine the presence of microembolism in the alveolar septal capillaries. Fifteen sections of predetermined lung areas were obtained and examined. Tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries was detected in 12 cases (10.7%), with simultaneous involvement of other vascular territories in 11. Seven patients had dyspnea; four, right ventricular failure; four, hypertrophy of the right ventricle; and three, arterial vascular sclerosis. The present data have led us to conclude that pulmonary tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries occurs in association with the involvement of arterial or lymphatic vessels and should be analyzed within the context of the study of subacute cor pulmonale. 
3	Comparison of motor response to apomorphine and levodopa in Parkinson's disease. The magnitude and pattern of motor responses to single doses of subcutaneous apomorphine and oral levodopa were compared in 14 patients with Parkinson's disease. Although apomorphine produced much shorter motor responses than levodopa, the quality of response to the two drugs was virtually indistinguishable. These clinical observations support the notion that integrity of striatal post-synaptic dopamine receptors is a key determinant of responsiveness to dopaminergic treatment in Parkinson's disease. 
2	Ultrasonic imaging of the abdomen. Report of the ultrasonography task force. Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association. As new imaging modalities emerge and existing technologies improve, indications for a particular imaging method may change. This article examines current indications for abdominal and prostatic ultrasound examination and, where possible, compares ultrasound with other imaging techniques. This is not an attempt to list all possible ultrasound indications or examinations, but rather an attempt to serve as an aid to informed imaging selection based on current literature and equipment. 
3	Frequency of three Hex A mutant alleles among Jewish and non-Jewish carriers identified in a Tay-Sachs screening program. Mutations in the HEX A gene, encoding the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A), are the cause of Tay-Sachs disease as well as of juvenile, chronic, and adult GM2 gangliosidoses. We have examined the distribution of three mutations--a 4-nucleotide insertion in exon 11, a G----C transversion at a 5' splice site in intron 12, and a 269Gly----Ser amino acid substitution in exon 7--among individuals enzymatically diagnosed as carriers of Hex A deficiency. Mutation analysis included polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the relevant regions of genomic DNA, followed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization; another test for heterozygosity of the exon 11 insertion was based on the formation of heteroduplex PCR fragments of low electrophoretic mobility. The percentage distribution of the exon 11, intron 12, exon 7, and unidentified mutant alleles was 73:15:4:8 among 156 Jewish carriers of Hex A deficiency and 16:0:3:81 among 51 non-Jewish carriers. Regardless of the mutation, the ancestral origin of the Jewish carriers was primarily eastern and (somewhat less often) central Europe, whereas for the non-Jewish carriers it was western Europe. Because a twelfth of the Jewish carriers and four-fifths of the non-Jewish carriers of Hex A deficiency had mutant alleles other than the three common ones tested, enzyme-based tests cannot be replaced by DNA-based tests at the present time. However, DNA-based tests for two-carrier couples could identify those at risk for the chronic/adult GM2 gangliosidoses rather than for infantile Tay-Sachs disease. 
1	Ectopic retinoblastoma within the 3rd ventricle: case report. Ectopic intracranial retinoblastomas are rare. These tumors usually occur in the pineal, parasellar, or suprasellar regions several years after the successful treatment of ocular retinoblastomas with no evidence of direct extension or distant metastasis. We report here a case of ectopic retinoblastoma occurring within the third ventricle. The tumor was surgically excised by the transventricular approach. Ectopic retinoblastomas exhibit greater differentiation than one would expect to observe in a metastatic lesion of this tumor. The distinction of ectopic retinoblastomas and metastasis from ocular retinoblastomas is important, since ectopic retinoblastomas, unlike metastasis, can be successfully managed by intensive therapy including radical excision. 
5	Age, sex, and road-use patterns of motor vehicular trauma in Rhode Island: A population-based hospital emergency department study. Population-based hospital emergency department data on motor vehicle traffic trauma in Rhode Island, 1984-85, are analyzed by age, sex, and road-use status. Annualized rates of overall and severe trauma were 1,195 cases (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1,164, 1,225) and 102 cases (95% CI = 94, 111) per 100,000 population, respectively. Overall and severe rates peaked at ages 15-24 years. Male rate excesses were most pronounced for motor-cycle and pedal cycle trauma. 
4	Effects of theophylline, atenolol and their combination on myocardial ischemia in stable angina pectoris. The effects of theophylline (400 mg twice a day), atenolol (50 mg twice a day) and their combination on myocardial ischemia were studied in 9 patients with stable angina pectoris in a randomized, single-blind, triple crossover trial. Placebo was administered to the patients during the run-in and the run-off periods. A treadmill exercise test and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were obtained at the end of each treatment period. Compared with placebo, theophylline significantly improved the time to onset of myocardial ischemia (1 mm of ST-segment depression) from 7.8 +/- 3.7 to 9.5 +/- 3.7 minutes (p less than 0.03) and the exercise duration from 9 +/- 3.4 to 10.1 +/- 3.5 minutes (p less than 0.04). During atenolol and during combination treatment, the time to the onset of ischemia and the exercise duration were similar (10.8 +/- 4.2 and 11.2 +/- 3.2 minutes, 11.2 +/- 3.6 and 11.5 +/- 3.2 minutes, respectively) and longer than during theophylline administration (p less than 0.05). Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring showed that, during theophylline administration, the heart rate was higher than during placebo throughout the 24 hours (p less than 0.05). During atenolol and during combination treatment the heart rate was similar and in both cases lower than during placebo (p less than 0.05). Compared with placebo, theophylline decreased the total ischemic time from 97 +/- 110 to 70 +/- 103 minutes (p less than 0.05). 
4	Renal artery stenosis in patients with aortic dissection: increased prevalence The authors retrospectively analyzed the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in 63 consecutive patients with aortic dissection who underwent thoracic and abdominal aortography. Ten patients (16%) had renal artery stenosis, five with atherosclerosis and five with fibromuscular lesions. Risk factors for aortic dissection were Marfan disease in nine patients, bicuspid aortic valve in one, and hypertension in 54 (including seven patients with Marfan syndrome). If the patients with Marfan syndrome and the patient with the bicuspid aortic valve are excluded, renal artery stenosis was present in 10 of 53 patients (19%) when the cause of dissection was presumably hypertension. This finding suggests that renovascular hypertension is a greater risk factor for aortic dissection than is essential hypertension. The success of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) in controlling renovascular hypertension has been proved. In this series, emergent PTRA successfully controlled the hypertension in one patient with a type B dissection, resulting in an excellent clinical outcome. Angiography should be routinely performed on patients with aortic dissections to evaluate for renal artery stenosis. 
2	Endoscopic and histologic appearance of the gastric mucosa in patients with portal hypertension. To assess reliability of the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the gastric mucosa for diagnosing portal hypertension, 50 patients with portal hypertension and 1323 controls were studied. Endoscopic evidence of mild gastritis was seen more frequently in patients with portal hypertension than in the control group (42% vs. 13.1%, p less than 0.001). The mosaic sign was also seen more frequently in patients with portal hypertension compared with controls (14% vs. 0.9%, p less than 0.001). However, the mosaic sign was found to be nonspecific, and the sensitivity for diagnosis of portal hypertension was only 14%. Biopsy specimens from the stomach of all patients with portal hypertension and 100 controls with a normal endoscopic appearance revealed mucosal vascular congestion in 72% of patients with portal hypertension compared with 59% of controls (NS). There was no correlation between endoscopic and histologic evidence of congestive gastropathy. Similarly, there was no correlation between the severity of mucosal vascular congestion and the degree of inflammatory changes observed in the biopsy specimens; both in the control (r = 0.1) and in patients with portal hypertension (r = 0.14). It is concluded that endoscopic and histologic features of the gastric mucosa in patients with portal hypertension are of low sensitivity and nonspecific and cannot be used to diagnose portal hypertension. 
5	Eight and 12 week courses of cyclophosphamide in nephrotic syndrome Seventy-three children with steroid dependent minimal change nephrotic syndrome were randomly allocated to receive treatment with cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day) for either eight or 12 weeks, in combination with prednisolone. All patients had previously relapsed while the dosage was being reduced or within 14 days of discontinuing prednisolone in the six months before receiving cyclophosphamide treatment (steroid dependent), and had severe steroid toxicity. Thirty two patients were treated with cyclophosphamide for eight weeks, and 41 for 12 weeks. There were no differences between the two groups in age at onset of nephrosis or entry into the study, sex ratio, duration of nephrosis, number of relapses before entry, and follow up period after entry. The relapse free rate of patients treated for eight weeks (25%) was similar to that of those treated for 12 weeks (24%) five years after stopping the treatment, and the mean relapse free interval and the sparing effect of cyclophosphamide (if any) on subsequent treatment with steroids did not differ between the groups. We conclude that cyclophosphamide should be used for no longer than eight weeks at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day in children with steroid dependent minimal change nephrotic syndrome. 
5	Usefulness of d, I sotalol for suppression of chronic ventricular arrhythmias. Sotalol is a unique beta-blocking drug, possessing significant class III antiarrhythmic activity. The efficacy and safety of 2 doses of sotalol (320 and 640 mg/day, divided in 2 doses) were compared to placebo in a 6-week randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of 114 patients with chronic ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) at frequencies of greater than or equal to 30/hour. Sotalol significantly reduced VPCs in patients receiving both low (n = 38) and high (n = 39) doses, compared with patients (n = 37) receiving placebo (by 75 and 88%, respectively, vs 10%; p less than 0.001, sotalol vs placebo; p less than 0.05, high vs low dose). The individual efficacy criterion (greater than or equal to 75% VPC reduction) was achieved in 34% of low-dose and 71% of high-dose sotalol versus 6% of placebo-treated patients (p less than 0.003, sotalol vs placebo; p = 0.007, high vs low dose). Repetitive beats were suppressed 25% by placebo (difference not significant), 80% by low-dose (p less than 0.003) and 78% by high-dose sotalol (p less than 0.005). Sotalol decreased heart rate (by 24 to 25%, p less than 0.001) and increased PR (by 4 to 6%, p less than 0.001) and corrected JT intervals (by 12 to 13%, p less than 0.001), but did not change ejection fraction. Proarrhythmia (nonfatal) occurred in 3 sotalol and in 2 placebo patients. Nine discontinued therapy because of adverse effects (1 low dose and 8 high dose, p less than 0.02). In summary, sotalol is an efficacious antiarrhythmic drug for VPC suppression; in lower doses, it is somewhat less effective but better tolerated. 
3	A double-masked evaluation of lignocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA) used to alleviate the pain of retrobulbar injection A randomised, placebo controlled, double-masked study was undertaken in 115 patients undergoing cataract surgery to assess the efficacy of the anaesthetic cream EMLA (eutetic mixture of local anaesthetic, lignocaine-prilocaine) in alleviating the pain of retrobulbar injection. Sixty three patients received the EMLA cream and 52 the placebo cream. The pain was assessed objectively by the anaesthetist, who observed the reaction of the patient on needle insertion, and subjectively by the patient. Significantly lower pain scores were recorded in patients treated with EMLA cream (anaesthetist's observation: p less than 0.01, patient's assessment: p less than 0.006). No patients experienced serious side effects in either treatment group. 
4	Changes in physician practice for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. To determine recent changes in physicians' practices for cardiovascular disease risk reduction, a randomly selected sample of practicing primary care physicians in the upper Midwest was interviewed by telephone in 1987 and again in 1989 (response rates, greater than 90%; N = 241). The reported mean cutoff levels for labeling a total serum cholesterol level as abnormal dropped from 5.84 to 5.43 mmol/L (226 to 210 mg/dL) and for initiating medication, from 7.34 to 6.54 mmol/L (284 to 253 mg/dL). The proportion of physicians using diuretics as preferred step 1 antihypertensive agents dropped from 60% to 32%. Preferences became evenly divided among diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Advice about physical exercise changed little, but consensus among practicing physicians was high. Substantial improvements were found in smoking cessation activities. Practicing physicians are proving to be responsive to new scientific evidence and education in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. 
2	Gallbladder motility in cholesterol gallstone disease. Effect of ursodeoxycholic acid administration and gallstone dissolution Gallbladder motility was evaluated by ultrasonography in 75 cholesterol gallstone patients and in 77 matched control subjects. All 75 gallstone patients were candidates for oral bile acid therapy (radiolucent gallstones, less than 2 cm in diameter, in well-opacified gallbladder), and 38 of them were also studied during ursodeoxycholic acid administration. An additional 20 gallstone patients were studied 1 year after confirmed gallstone dissolution with oral bile acids. Gallstone patients showed significantly greater fasting and residual volumes, a decreased percent of gallbladder emptying, but a similar absolute emptying and emptying rate compared with the control subjects. Greater fasting volumes and reduced percents of gallbladder emptying were also found in gallstone-free patients who achieved complete dissolution with oral bile acids. After ursodeoxycholic acid administration, fasting gallbladder volumes were greater, and percents of gallbladder emptying were further decreased than in untreated gallstone patients. In conclusion, greater fasting volumes, and not reduced gallbladder contractility, account for the defective gallbladder function in radiolucent (cholesterol-rich) gallstone patients. This condition is likely to precede, and possibly to promote, gallstone formation because it persists after gallstone dissolution. Ursodeoxycholic acid administration worsens the defect observed in gallstone patients. This finding also suggests, although indirectly, that the expected normalization of cholesterol saturation during oral bile acid administration is not paralleled by an improvement in gallbladder function. 
2	Pneumonia complicating abdominal sepsis. An independent risk factor for mortality. Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) is associated with a significant mortality, 66% in a previous retrospective study of NP complicating intra-abdominal sepsis (IAS). We prospectively compared the outcome of NP complicating IAS with that of recurrent IAS (R-IAS) in the absence of NP. Data were collected prospectively on 300 patients with IAS; 34 patients who presented with pneumonia were excluded from the analysis (44% mortality). One hundred seventy-one patients with no NP and no R-IAS (group 1) had a hospital mortality of 20% (34 patients); 36 without NP in whom R-IAS developed (group 2) had a 17% mortality (six patients); and 47 with NP but no R-IAS (group 3) had a 53% mortality (25 patients). Finally, 12 patients who had both NP and R-IAS suffered a 75% mortality (nine patients). We examined the relationships among the following putative risk factors and mortality: APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II score (at initial presentation with IAS), the need for mechanical ventilatory assistance following initial treatment for peritonitis, steroid requirement, generalized peritonitis vs abscess, and the need for surgical as opposed to percutaneous treatment. Using mortality as the dependent variable, group 2 vs 3 as the explanatory variable, and the risk factors as confounders, logistic regression analysis indicated that the group difference was significant after controlling for confounders. We conclude that NP complicating IAS is an independent risk factor associated with a significant mortality compared with R-IAS. These data challenge the notion that death in IAS is usually due to recurrent or persistent intra-abdominal infection. 
4	Effect of antiarrhythmic therapy on mortality in survivors of myocardial infarction with asymptomatic complex ventricular arrhythmias: Basel Antiarrhythmic Study of Infarct Survival (BASIS) In view of the high risk of sudden cardiac death and the prognostic importance of complex ventricular ectopic activity, the effects of prophylactic antiarrhythmic treatment were investigated prospectively in patients with persisting asymptomatic complex arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. End points were total mortality and arrhythmic events (sudden death, sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation). Of 1,220 consecutively screened survivors of myocardial infarction, 312 had Lown class 3 or 4b arrhythmia on 24 h electrocardiographic recordings before hospital discharge and consented to the study. They were randomized to individualized antiarrhythmic treatment (Group 1, n = 100), treatment with low dose amiodarone, 200 mg/day (Group 2, n = 98) or no antiarrhythmic therapy (Group 3 [control group], n = 114). During the 1 year follow-up period, 10 patients in Group 1 died, as did 5 in Group 2 and 15 in Group 3. On the basis of an intention to treat analysis, the probability of survival of patients given amiodarone was significantly greater than that of control patients (p less than 0.05). In addition, arrhythmic events were significantly reduced by amiodarone (p less than 0.01). These effects were less marked and not significant for individually treated patients (Group 1). These findings suggest that low dose amiodarone decreases mortality in the 1st year after myocardial infarction in patients at high risk of sudden death. 
1	Giant sclerosing leiomyoma of bladder presenting as chronic renal failure. The clinical and pathologic features of a case of giant sclerosing leiomyoma of the bladder in a male Polynesian patient are reported. The presenting complication of chronic renal failure due to tumor envelopment of both ureters and consequent bilateral renal obstruction appears to be unique in the literature. 
3	Diagnosis of thymoma in myasthenics using anti-striated muscle antibodies: predictive value and gain in diagnostic certainty. Assay of anti-striated muscle antibodies (StrAb) is used as a diagnostic test for thymoma in individuals with myasthenia gravis. Unfortunately, false positive results are common, and their effect on test accuracy is magnified by the relatively low frequency of thymoma in myasthenics. We estimated the predictive values of positive and negative StrAb assays (PV+ and PV-) and gain in diagnostic certainty using values for sensitivity, specificity, and thymoma frequency previously reported in the literature. Sensitivity for indirect immunofluorescence assays ranged from 0.83 to 0.84 (pooled estimate = 0.84; n = 68). Specificity ranged from 0.73 to 0.88 (pooled estimate = 0.77; n = 898). Frequency of thymoma ranged from 0.07 to 0.17 (pooled estimate = 0.12; n = 4,515). The expected gain in diagnostic certainty from StrAb was minimal in those aged 0 to 20 and those aged 60+. In those aged 20 to 60, a negative test helped to exclude thymoma, and a positive test raised diagnostic suspicion but was not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of thymoma (PV+ = 0.46). 
4	Tricuspid valve dysplasia or displacement in intrauterine life. In 450 cases of structural heart disease diagnosed prenatally, 38 fetuses (8.5%) had either a dysplastic or a displaced tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve was dysplastic in 22 fetuses, all of which had evidence of tricuspid regurgitation resulting in right atrial dilation and increased cardiothoracic ratio. An associated abnormality of the pulmonary valve occurred in 16 fetuses. The remaining 16 fetuses had Ebstein's malformation, 14 with evidence of tricuspid incompetence at presentation and 10 with an associated abnormality of the pulmonary valve. Of the 38 cases, the pregnancy was interrupted in 17, spontaneous intrauterine fetal death occurred in 8, 11 infants died postnatally and 2 infants are still alive; additional abnormalities were found in 8 cases (chromosomal anomalies in 2, ventricular septal defects in 2, corrected transposition in 2, the Chiari malformation in 2, supraventricular tachycardia in 1 case and coarctation of the aorta in 1). Fetuses with severe abnormalities are selected for fetal echocardiography by the four chamber screening program and a high rate of natural loss both in intrauterine life and immediately after birth was observed in the 21 cases in which pregnancy was continued. This would explain the higher incidence of tricuspid valve disease in our prenatal compared with postnatal series. Although increased cardiothoracic ratio and associated lesions of the right ventricular outflow tract contribute to the poor outcome in the cases detected prenatally, the absence of these features does not always indicate a good prognosis because progression of disease can occur with advancing gestational age. No absolute measurement or single echocardiographic feature emerged as a consistent predictive factor of prognosis. 
5	Premalignant lesions: role of antioxidant vitamins and beta-carotene in risk reduction and prevention of malignant transformation. Epidemiological studies have shown that diets rich in one or more antioxidant nutrients may reduce the risk of cancers of the lung, uterine cervix, mouth, and gastrointestinal tract. Study of premalignant lesions offers a comparatively expedient approach to identifying and evaluating the efficacy of the cancer chemopreventive components of foods. Some recent findings suggest roles for beta-carotene and/or vitamin C in reversing or reducing the risk of cervical dysplasia and oral leukoplakia. There are some indications that vitamin C and beta-carotene may reduce the risk of atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer. Additional epidemiological and molecular biology studies and clinical intervention trials using premalignant lesions as the marker of specific cancer risks should become an important component of future research in the area of cancer chemoprevention. 
4	Early assessment of coronary artery bypass graft patency by high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography. To assess the role of high-dose (up to 0.84 mg/kg during 10 minutes) dipyridamole echocardiographic testing in the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft patency early after surgery, 18 consecutive patients with angina underwent dipyridamole echocardiography and coronary angiography before and 7 to 10 days after bypass surgery. Coronary angiography showed 2- or 3-vessel disease in 7 and 11 patients, respectively. A total of 53 bypass grafts were performed. Before bypass surgery 14 patients had a positive and 4 a negative test result. No complication occurred during the test performed early after surgery. Of the 14 patients with positive dipyridamole echocardiographic results before surgery, 10 had negative and 4 had positive results after surgery. All 4 patients had negative results before and after surgery. In the 4 patients with positive results after dipyridamole echocardiographic testing before and after bypass surgery, dipyridamole time increased from 5.8 +/- 5 to 9.3 +/- 0.9 minutes (p = 0.3) after the procedure and wall motion score index at peak dipyridamole changed from 1.55 +/- 0.2 to 1.28 +/- 0.3 (p = 0.05). Forty-nine of 53 grafts were patent as seen on angiography. Dipyridamole echocardiographic results were positive in 4 of 5 patients who had at least 1 obstructed graft or native vessel obstructed distal to bypass graft insertion. The remaining patient had diagnostic electrocardiographic changes during dipyridamole infusion without wall motion abnormalities. Dipyridamole echocardiographic results were negative in all 13 patients who had complete revascularization. In the 4 patients with positive test results, the procedure correctly identified the localization of the diseased bypass graft. 
5	Maple syrup urine disease caused by a partial deletion in the inner E2 core domain of the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex due to aberrant splicing. A single base deletion at a 5'-splice donor site of an intron of the E2 gene disrupts the consensus sequence in this region. We have studied the molecular bases of maple syrup urine disease by analyzing the activity, subunit structure, mRNA sequence, and the genome of the affected enzyme. The branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) activity in the patient was 4.2-4.5% of the control level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the E2 subunit of BCKDH (Mr 52,000) was absent and another protein band with an Mr of 49,000 was present. We amplified the cDNA of the E2 subunit obtained from the patient's cell using the polymerase chain reaction method, then sequenced the amplified cDNA, in which a 78-bp deletion was identified. The consanguineous parents and a sister had two species of mRNA; the one corresponding to the normal E2 subunit and the other with a 78-bp deletion, whereas findings in a brother were normal. The molecular size of the translation products as deduced from the abnormal mRNA sequence was compatible with an abnormal protein band (Mr 49,000) detected in the patient's cells by immunoblot analysis. Analysis of genomic DNA of BCKDH-E2 subunit revealed that the 78-bp deletion in the mRNA was caused by an exon skipping due to a single base deletion in the 5'-splice donor site. As a result of the mutation, part of the inner E2 core domain was omitted. The specified region of the inner E2 core domain was highly homologous to the region of the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. These observations imply the biological importance of the region in the inner E2 core domain of BCKDH to maintain normal function of the activity. 
5	Facial pain. This article presents differential diagnosis and treatment of facial pain. Facial pain is classified in accordance with the recent work of the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society. The two major divisions are facial pain associated with disorders of the head and neck, including their parts, and disorders of cranial nerves, including their central connections. Special attention is paid to the controversial topics of temporomandibular joint dysfunction and atypical facial pain. 
1	Pseudopsammomatous meningioma with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen: a true secretory meningioma. Case report. A sphenoid-wing meningioma in a 60-year-old woman was accompanied by elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, which returned to normal after removal of the tumor. Light microscopic examination revealed a secretory meningioma containing numerous pseudopsammoma bodies and a prominent vascular pattern. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor cells and pseudopsammoma bodies to be CEA-positive. This case illustrates the possibility that secretory meningioma may be associated with clinically detectable secretion of CEA. The report also documents the rare occurrence of elevated serum CEA in a primary benign intracranial tumor. 
5	Laparoscopic cholecystectomy using intracorporeal lithotripsy. Over a 13-month period (November 1988 to December 1989), we performed our first 104 laparoscopic cholecystectomies using an intracorporeal ultrasonic lithotripsy technique. The procedure in three of these patients was converted to an open operation because of hemorrhage with unexpected findings of cirrhosis in two patients and dense subhepatic adhesions in a third. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successfully used in three other patients in whom common bile duct stones were identified. We encountered only three postoperative complications out of all the laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed. One complication was a biliary fistula that closed spontaneously 1 week after surgery. The remaining complications were attributable to abscesses, one subhepatic and one pelvic, which were aspirated and drained laparoscopically. There were no deaths. Advantages of the laparoscopic approach included decreased perioperative pain, shortened hospitalization, absence of scar, and more rapid return to prehospitalization activities. 
5	Bcl-2 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that blocks programmed cell death. The t(14; 18) chromosomal translocation of human follicular B-cell lymphoma juxtaposes the bcl-2 gene with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. The bcl-2 immunoglobulin fusion gene is markedly deregulated resulting in inappropriately elevated levels of bcl-2 RNA and protein. Transgenic mice bearing a bcl-2 immunoglobulin minigene demonstrate a polyclonal expansion of resting yet responsive IgM-IgD B cells which display prolonged cell survival but no increase in cell cycling. Moreover, deregulated bcl-2 extends the survival of certain haematopoietic cell lines following growth-factor deprivation. By using immunolocalization studies we now demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an integral inner mitochondrial membrane protein of relative molecular mass 25,000 (25k). Overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks the apoptotic death of a pro-B-lymphocyte cell line. Thus, Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and interfering with programmed cell death independent of promoting cell division. 
1	Human tumor fluorouracil trapping: clinical correlations of in vivo 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy pharmacokinetics. We previously reported that fluorouracil (5FU) accumulation and metabolism in human livers and tumors can be studied by in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS). We have extended these observations by evaluating the pharmacokinetics of 5FU in the tumors of 11 patients with carcinoma of the breast, colon, endometrium, cervix, and kidney, using 19F-NMRS in a 1.5 Magnetom (Siemens Medical Systems, Cerrito, CA) magnetic resonance imaging unit (MRI). These NMRS measurements detected a long-lived tumor pool of 5FU in six of 11 tumors in our patients including carcinomas in the pelvis, breast, lung, and liver. The half-life (T1/2) of this tumor pool of "trapped" 5FU was 0.33 to 1.3 hours (20 to 78 minutes), much longer than the T1/2 of 5FU in blood (5 to 15 minutes). Neither the anabolites of 5FU (fluorinated nucleosides, nucleotides, 5FU-RNA, or 5FU-thymidylate synthase) nor the catabolites (eg, fluorobetaalanine [FBAL]) were detectable by 19F NMRS. Patient response to chemotherapy appeared to correlate with the extent of trapping of free 5FU in the human tumors: in the seven patients receiving 5FU, or 5FU or FUdR plus leucovorin, four of four patients whose tumors trapped 5FU responded to fluorinated pyrimidine chemotherapy, whereas three patients in whom there was a failure to detect tumor trapping were resistant to 5FU. We conclude that NMRS is clinically feasible, and enables investigators to study 5FU pharmacokinetics and metabolism in tumors in vivo. 19F-NMRS of 5FU allows for in vivo evaluation of 5FU metabolic modulation and might be able to guide therapeutic decisions. 
1	Pediatric osteosarcoma: therapeutic strategies, results, and prognostic factors derived from a 10-year experience. Ninety-eight pediatric patients were treated with three separate protocols (Treatment and investigation of Osteosarcoma [TIOS] I, II, and III) and 47 developed recurrent disease (metastases and/or local recurrence). Actuarial overall disease-free survival (hereafter designated survival) was 43%. Over 90% of the patients were treated initially with preoperative intraarterial cisplatin (CDP). Postoperative chemotherapeutic regimens comprised high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue (MTX-CF), Adriamycin [( ADR] doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and cyclophosphamide. Primary definitive treatment comprised amputation or limb salvage (TIOS I and TIOS III). Patients treated with preoperative CDP and surgery (TIOS I and III) had a 62% survival. Patients in TIOS II refused surgical extirpation; they were treated exclusively with chemotherapy and had a 23% survival. Survival in patients treated with amputation was 55% and limb salvage 58%. Prognostic factors considered significant in relation to development of pulmonary metastases comprised tumor burden (P = .04) and the percentage of tumor necrosis induced by preoperative chemotherapy (P = .01). Histopathologic subtype was marginally significant: chondroblastic was more favorable as opposed to osteoblastic (P = .05). These findings are compared with results and prognostic factors published in the literature. 
5	Family psychoeducation, social skills training, and maintenance chemotherapy in the aftercare treatment of schizophrenia. II. Two-year effects of a controlled study on relapse and adjustment. Environmental-Personal Indicators in the Course of Schizophrenia (EPICS) Research Group. We demonstrated earlier that a novel family psychoeducational approach and an individual social skills training approach designed for patients living in high-expressed emotion households each reduced schizophrenic relapse by one-half when compared with medication controls in the 1st year after hospital discharge. The combination of treatments resulted in no relapse. Results have now been obtained after 2 years of continuous treatment. By 24 months, a persistent and significant effect of family intervention on forestalling relapse was observed, but the effect of social skills training was lost late in the 2nd year. There was no additive effect on relapse that accrued to the combination of treatments. Beyond 2 years, however, the effect of family intervention was likely compromised as well. Treatment effects on the adjustment of survivors were circumscribed, due, in part, to study design characteristics. Effects generally favored the social skills-alone condition at 1 year and the family condition or combined family/social skills condition at 2 years. 
1	Increasing annual incidence of primary malignant brain tumors in the elderly Between 1973 and 1985, total age-adjusted cancer incidence in the United States (all races, men and women) rose by 10.7%, with an average annual percentage change of +0.9%. Analysis of reported age-specific incidence of primary malignant brain tumors over the same years demonstrates that incidence rates increased dramatically between 1973/1974 and 1985. In 1985, incidence rates for persons aged 75-79, 80-84, and 85 years of age and over were 187%, 394%, and 501%, respectively, of rates in 1973/1974. Similar increases were found in both men and women, analyzed separately and combined. Average annual percentage changes in primary brain tumor incidence were +7.0%, +20.4%, and +23.4% in these age ranges, respectively. Reported incidence in younger persons varied little over the same period of time. The most common histologic type of primary brain tumor in the elderly was of glial origin, predominantly the glioblastoma multiforme and astrocytoma. These tumors are highly malignant and invariably fatal. Two possible causes may explain the increased incidence in the elderly: the introduction and extensive use of x-ray computed tomography since 1973 and/or a true increase in incidence occurring independently of diagnostic advances. 
3	Comparison of algorithms of testing for use in automated evaluation of sensation. Estimates of vibratory detection threshold may be used to detect, characterize, and follow the course of sensory abnormality in neurologic disease. The approach is especially useful in epidemiologic and controlled clinical trials. We studied which algorithm of testing and finding threshold should be used in automatic systems by comparing among algorithms and stimulus conditions for the index finger of healthy subjects and for the great toe of patients with mild neuropathy. Appearance thresholds obtained by linear ramps increasing at a rate less than 4.15 microns/sec provided accurate and repeatable thresholds compared with thresholds obtained by forced-choice testing. These rates would be acceptable if only sensitive sites were studied, but they were too slow for use in automatic testing of insensitive parts. Appearance thresholds obtained by fast linear rates (4.15 or 16.6 microns/sec) overestimated threshold, especially for sensitive parts. Use of the mean of appearance and disappearance thresholds, with the stimulus increasing exponentially at rates of 0.5 or 1.0 just noticeable difference (JND) units per second, and interspersion of null stimuli, Bekesy with null stimuli, provided accurate, repeatable, and fast estimates of threshold for sensitive parts. Despite the good performance of Bekesy testing, we prefer forced choice for evaluation of the sensation of patients with neuropathy. 
3	The Exeter Dysphagia Assessment Technique. The Exeter Dysphagia Assessment Technique (EDAT) uses noninvasive equipment to record, simultaneously, "feeding respiratory patterns," the time drink entered the mouth, and associated swallow sounds during feeding. The easily portable equipment enabled patients' swallowing ability to be tested, at the bedside if necessary, using a small amount of fruit-flavored drink. The results appear in chart form. EDAT findings from groups of normal subjects aged 2-90 years were compared with those from patients with dysphagia of neurologic origin and normal subjects under experimental feeding conditions. The results revealed maturation of the feeding respiratory pattern in the teenage years and remarkable consistency thereafter. Differences in the recordings between the normal and abnormal subjects were sufficiently marked to allow the findings to be used in the diagnosis of other patients with dysphagia of doubtful neurologic cause. Interpretation of the charts and recorded timings of the oral and pharyngeal stages of swallowing permitted a more accurate identification of sensory nerve, motor nerve, and functional involvement causing dysphagia of neurologic origin and may be used as a guide to the origin of the sensory deficit. 
4	Haemostatic changes during continuous oestradiol-progestogen treatment of postmenopausal women. To identify changes in haemostatic balance during continuous oestradiol-progestogen treatment, 60 postmenopausal women with climacteric complaints, mean age 55.4 years (range 44-68) were randomly allocated to receive one of four hormone replacement regimens for one year. All four formulations were administered daily and continuously, each contained 2 mg of 17 beta-oestradiol in combination with either norethisterone acetate, 1 mg (group A) or 0.5 mg (group B) or megestrol acetate, 5 mg (group C) or 2.5 mg (group D). No significant changes occurred during treatment within or between the groups in platelet count, fibrinogen and 2-antiplasmin. Activated partial thromboplastin time was shortened (P less than 0.05) in group D and a decline in factor VII activity and antigen (P less than 0.001) and in ATIII activity (P less than 0.05) was noted in group A. Protein C tended to decline in all treatment groups but statistically significant changes were noted only in groups A and C. Two women developed crural thrombosis during the observation period. 
2	Idiopathic gastroparesis is associated with a multiplicity of severe dietary deficiencies. Idiopathic gastroparesis (IG), a disorder characterized by abnormally delayed emptying of food from the stomach, is associated with many symptoms that could have an impact on dietary intake. The intake of dietary protein, carbohydrate, fat, fiber, vitamins, and minerals was prospectively evaluated in patients with symptomatic IG and compared with asymptomatic controls. Twenty-four patients and 24 age- and sex-matched controls completed a detailed 7-day diet record while consuming a self-selected diet. Dietary information was entered into a computer and analyzed using the Nutranal program. Results were expressed as daily intake and percent recommended dietary allowance (%RDA) when applicable. Patients consumed a diet containing fewer calories than would have been predicted based on age, height, sex, frame, and weight (85% of calculated energy expenditure vs 100%) for controls. Although patients with IG consumed significantly fewer calories than controls (1112 kcal vs 1431 kcal), the proportion of fat (32% vs 34%), carbohydrate (49% vs 48%), and protein (17% vs 16%) was similar in the two groups. Intake of vitamins B6, vitamin C, folate, niacin, riboflavin, thiamine, calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc were below the %RDA. Intake of vitamin B12, vitamin C, folate, thiamine, niacin, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc were significantly less than controls. Vitamin A intake was above the RDA and not different from that of controls. Prolonged t1/2 of solids correlated with diminished intake of protein, iron, niacin, and potassium. They correlated inversely with serum albumin in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis. Conclusion: Although eating less, patients with IG do not consistently alter the proportion of fat, carbohydrate, and protein in their diets. Because their diet is markedly deficient in a number of essential vitamins and minerals, dietary evaluation and counseling is suggested for all patients with idiopathic gastroparesis. 
3	Dwarf locus mutants lacking three pituitary cell types result from mutations in the POU-domain gene pit-1. Mutations at the mouse dwarf locus (dw) interrupt the normal development of the anterior pituitary gland, resulting in the loss of expression of growth hormone, prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone, and hypoplasia of their respective cell types. Disruptions in the gene encoding the POU-domain transcription factor, Pit-1, occur in both characterized alleles of the dwarf locus. The data indicate that Pit-1 is necessary for the specification of the phenotype of three cell types in the anterior pituitary, and directly link a transcription factor to commitment and progression events in mammalian organogenesis. 
1	Metastatic carcinoma of the gallbladder from renal cancer presenting as intraluminal polypoid mass. We report a rare case of secondary involvement of the gallbladder by metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A 71-year-old man was diagnosed as having a polypoid mass within the gallbladder when he underwent right nephrectomy for a renal cell carcinoma. A preoperative diagnosis of simultaneous carcinoma of the gallbladder was made, and extended cholecystectomy with regional lymphadenectomy was performed five months after the initial operation. Postoperative histological examination of the polypoid mass within the gallbladder and a pancreatic mass excised during the second surgery revealed these resected tumors to be identical to the clear cell type of renal cell carcinoma. We feel that this case presents synchronous involvement of the gallbladder and pancreas by metastatic renal cell carcinoma of the right kidney. 
5	Postpneumonectomy syndrome after left lung resection. A female infant with a right-sided aortic arch and ligamentum arteriosum underwent a left pneumonectomy for perinatal interstitial emphysema. Radiographic, bronchoscopic, and surgical evidence of compression of the right bronchial tree by the aorta, ligamentum arteriosum, right pulmonary artery, and thoracic spine subsequently developed. This report documents a rare example of postpneumonectomy syndrome following left lung resection. 
5	Treatment of severe intraventricular hemorrhage by intraventricular infusion of urokinase. Six patients with severe intraventricular hemorrhage were treated with direct intraventricular infusion of urokinase. In each case, hemorrhage extended into all ventricular chambers, and a cast formation and expansion of the third and fourth ventricles were found. Immediately after the therapy was started (within 7 days from onset of symptoms), reduction of intraventricular hematoma volume was observed on computerized tomography. On average, both the third and fourth ventricles became clear on the third day after hemorrhage; there was one exception, a case of ruptured aneurysm. Five of the six patients showed excellent or good outcome, although two developed delayed hydrocephalus. No infection or rebleeding was observed. The outcome in a retrospectively studied group of five patients not treated with urokinase is also reported. The authors conclude that this relatively easy method of treatment will greatly improve the prognosis of severe intraventricular hemorrhage. 
1	Conservative therapy for adnexal torsion. A case report. Adnexal torsion has traditionally been treated with oophorectomy because of the fear that untwisting the ovarian pedicle may result in a thrombotic embolus. Such a patient had bilateral adnexal torsion secondary to dermoid cysts. Since standard therapy, oophorectomy, was performed, the patient was surgically castrated. A review of the literature revealed no reported cases of a thrombotic embolus arising from the untwisting of twisted adnexa and supported conservation of the adnexa rather than routine extirpation, except when necrotic. 
4	Combination therapy for anaplastic giant cell thyroid carcinoma. Since 1981, 20 patients with anaplastic giant cell carcinoma of the thyroid have been prospectively treated according to a combination regimen of chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy. Two types of chemotherapy were used every 4 weeks, depending on the patient's age. For those younger than 65 years, a combination of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cisplatin (90 mg/m2) was given, and for older patients mitoxantrone (14 mg/m2) was used. Radiotherapy was carried out between Day 10 and Day 20 of the first four cycles of chemotherapy. It delivered 17.5 Gy in 7 fractions to the neck and the superior mediastinum. Survival exceeding 20 months was observed in three patients. Complete neck tumor response was observed in five patients, among whom four had undergone previous operations. No response was seen in distant metastases, which were the cause of death in 14 patients. These treatment modalities are effective in some patients, both in terms of survival and of local control, avoiding death from local invasion. Gross tumor resection should be performed whenever possible but should not delay the commencement of this protocol. Toxicity was high and remains the main limiting factor. 
1	Surgical therapy of the eyelids in patients with facial paralysis. Patients with facial paralysis have a degree of lagophthalmos and paralytic ectropion. We present our experience in the surgical management of 25 consecutive patients treated for these problems. Paralytic lagophthalmos was corrected using gold weights inserted into the upper eyelid. The advantages and disadvantages of this surgical technique are reviewed. Medial canthoplasty and lateral canthoplasty were performed to rectify paralytic ectropion. Ancillary procedures included browpexy, upper-lid blepharoplasty, and temporalis sling. The results were excellent in 23 of 25 patients and good in the remaining two. After a minimum of 6 months' follow-up, there were no complications. The authors believe that the above procedures will yield consistently excellent cosmetic and functional results in patients with paralysis of the eyelids. 
4	Drug response at electropharmacologic study in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias: the importance of ventricular refractoriness. The clinical and electrophysiologic predictors of successful antiarrhythmic drug therapy for patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia were evaluated in 59 consecutive patients undergoing serial electropharmacologic trials. Structural heart disease was less frequently present in patients for whom effective therapy was found (p less than 0.05). The presence of coronary artery disease and a history of prior myocardial infarction were significantly more frequently present in patients for whom antiarrhythmic drug therapy could not be found (p less than 0.05). The corrected QT interval and ventricular effective refractory period measured at a pacing cycle length of 400 ms were significantly shorter in responders compared with nonresponders (QT interval 428 +/- 52 versus 460 +/- 59 ms; ventricular effective refractory period 237 +/- 28 versus 254 +/- 24 ms; (p less than 0.05). In addition, the interelectrogram coupling interval of the ventricular extrastimulus initiating ventricular tachycardia was significantly shorter in responders compared with nonresponders (223 +/- 37 versus 251 +/- 33 ms; p = 0.003). Logistic regression analysis identified a short ventricular interelectrogram coupling interval (p less than 0.01) and absence of prior myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05) as the only independent predictors of antiarrhythmic drug suppression of the induction of ventricular tachycardia. Greater drug-induced increments in the ventricular effective and functional refractory periods were observed in responders than in nonresponders as was the shortest ventricular interelectrogram coupling interval. Thus, baseline electrophysiologic measurements identify patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia who are likely to respond to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Furthermore, these patients demonstrate greater drug-induced electrophysiologic changes. 
1	Adoptive immunotherapy of human pancreatic cancer with lymphokine-activated killer cells and interleukin-2 in a nude mouse model. A pancreatic cancer cell line was grown in orthotopic and heterotopic positions in young Swiss/NIH nude mice, which were tested with adoptive immunotherapy. Mice were injected with 1 x 10(7) human cancer cells in the subcutaneous tissue and duodenal lobe of the pancreas. The mice were randomly divided into four groups: group IA (LAK + IL-2) (N = 25) received 2 X 10(7) human lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from normal donors by tail vein injection followed by 10,000 units of human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) given intraperitoneally every 12 hours for 28 days; group IB (IL-2) (N = 27) was given the same dose of IL-2 alone; group IC (RPMI-1640) (N = 18) received a placebo consisting of 1 ml of RPMI-1640 intraperitoneally every 12 hours; and group ID (LAK) (N = 14) received 2 X 10(7) LAK cells but no IL-2. Toxicity was significantly higher in group IB, with a mortality rate of 45.5% (10/22 animals) versus a 0% mortality (0/25) in group IA. None of the group IA or IB animals died of pancreatic cancer during the experiment. The animals that did not receive IL-2 died before 28 days in 14.2% of group IC and in 16.7% of group ID. The area under the growth curve of subcutaneous tumors during the course of treatment and the pancreatic tumor weight at the end of treatment were compared in each group. Subcutaneous tumors had a reduced rate of growth in group IA animals compared to all the other treatments. Pancreatic tumor growth was slowed in group IA. The animals treated with IL-2 alone (group IB) showed some slowing of tumor growth that was intermediate between group IA, group IC, and group ID. A similar experiment was done with irradiated (375 rad) mice. Nine nude mice with tumors were treated with LAK + IL-2 (group IIA), eight received IL-2 alone (group IIB), and seven received placebo (group IIC). The antitumor effect of IL-2 alone was not present in the irradiated mice. A highly significant difference persisted between group IIA and all other groups. There was no difference in the histologic characteristics of tumors in control mice and in mice with inhibited tumor growth treated with IL-2 or IL-2 and human LAK cells. These results show that adoptive immunotherapy with human LAK cells and human recombinant IL-2 is effective against human pancreatic cancer growing in nude mice. This effect is independent from antitumor activity from IL-2 administrations alone. 
2	Long-term outcome of massive small bowel resection. The long-term outcome for seven patients 4-17 yr (mean 7.1 yr) after massive small bowel resection, leaving 5-160 cm (mean 86.4) of small bowel, was reviewed. Their mean age at the final enterectomy was 40 yr. Adaptation to foodstuffs and the effects of physiologic alterations and complicating diseases on their return to work were emphasized. More than 3.5 yr after surgery, the patients had adapted to many kinds of foodstuffs, but dietary fat could not be tolerated by three patients. Six patients returned to work an average of 2.7 yr after surgery, but four were obliged to discontinue their work because of rehospitalization for long-term complications. In addition, their working hours were limited, and they could not engage in heavy physical work, owing to physiologic alterations, such as a reduced metabolic state, after massive enterectomy. 
3	A study of cyproheptadine in the treatment of metastatic carcinoid tumor and the malignant carcinoid syndrome. Sixteen patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors and the malignant carcinoid syndrome were treated with cyproheptadine (Periactin, Merck, Sharp & Dohme, West Point, PA) at maximum tolerable doses that ranged from 12 to 48 mg daily. Usual side effects were mild sedation and dry mouth, but three patients found it impossible to sustain treatment due to nausea and vomiting. Most patients had significant relief of diarrhea, frequently associated with weight gain. Relief of flushing was uncommon. The therapeutic benefit produced by cyproheptadine would appear to be a peripheral effect because 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion in these patients was not reduced. Although there have been case reports of objective tumor regression with cyproheptadine therapy, this was not observed in any of these 16 patients. Cyproheptadine would appear to be a useful therapeutic tool for the management of diarrhea associated with the malignant carcinoid syndrome. An appropriate initial total daily dose is 0.4 mg/kg divided in three fractions with prompt modification to produce minimal and tolerable side effects. 
1	Immunocytochemical characterization of lung tumors in fine-needle aspiration. The use of cytokeratin monoclonal antibodies for the differential diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. In the current study, immunocytochemical typing of intermediate filaments was used for a differential diagnosis of human lung tumors from transthoracic fine-needle aspiration biopsies (TFNAB). The authors have compared the cytologic diagnosis of 53 lung cancer cases with the immunofluorescence patterns obtained using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, five of which (KG 8.13, KM 4.62, Ks B.17, KS 8.12, KK 8.60) react with specific cytokeratin polypeptides and one with vimentin (VIM 13.2). Only in six of 23 samples cytologically diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma did the immunocytochemical typing of cytokeratins (ICTC) confirm the cytologic diagnosis. In seven cases some of the tumor cells stained positively with antibody Ks B.17 specific for simple epithelial keratin (No: 18), suggesting the presence of some cells of glandular origin. In ten additional cases the ICTC was in conflict with the cytologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (i.e., antibodies Ks 8.12 and KK 8.60 were negative, and antibody Ks B.17, positive) supporting a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. In 14 of 18 cases cytologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, the ICTC confirmed the diagnosis whereas in four cases additional presence of some squamous cells was noticed. The ICTC labeling of cases cytologically diagnosed as undifferentiated and large cell carcinomas was similar to that of the group of adenocarcinomas. Thus, the application of cytokeratin typing for TFNAB samples seems to provide a vital complementation to routine cytologic study, especially for cases cytologically diagnosed as squamous carcinoma. 
1	Cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma from nonneoplastic liver. The authors reviewed a series of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens of the liver to identify useful cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from nonneoplastic liver. Ten cytologic features were examined in this study: high cellularity, acinar pattern, trabecular pattern, hyperchromasia, pleomorphism, irregularly granular chromatin, uniformly prominent nucleoli, multiple nucleoli, increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei. These features were examined in a series of 82 FNAB specimens from 52 patients with HCC and 30 patients with nonneoplastic lesions. With the use of a step-wise logistic regression analysis, three features were identified as predictive of HCC: increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (P = 0.001), trabecular pattern (P = 0.002), and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei (P = 0.03). When these three criteria were used, the sensitivity of diagnosing HCC by FNAB was 100%, and the specificity was 87%. 
5	Preexposure of the peritoneum to live bacteria increases later mixed intraabdominal abscess formation and delays mortality. Intraabdominal infections are a major source of morbidity and mortality for the trauma and postoperative patient. Transient peritoneal contamination with bacteria after either intentional or unintentional violation of the gut are common. The effect of this intermittent antigen exposure upon later formation of intraabdominal abscesses is unclear. Previous experiments by others have demonstrated that repeated exposure to Bacteroides fragilis capsular polysaccharide can induce a T lymphocyte-mediated immunity to subsequent induction of pure B. fragilis abscess formation. In a murine mixed intraabdominal abscess model, preexposure to live Escherichia coli, B. fragilis, or both increased the number of later abscesses and in some cases their bacterial composition. Further, immunization with E. coli alone increased late mortality without altering overall mortality. These data suggest that the alterations of immune function produced by live, transient bacteria upon subsequent mixed intraabdominal abscess induction result in fundamentally different consequences from those observed after specific polysaccharide antigen exposure and subsequent monomicrobial abscess induction. 
3	The development of infratentorial atrophy in patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia of late onset: a CT study. The development of infratentorial atrophy in six patients suffering from idiopathic cerebellar ataxia of late onset was studied by a retrospective evaluation of consecutive computed tomography (CT) scans. Four patients had evidence of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) both on clinical testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In these four patients, atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem became visible at the same time and progressed in a roughly parallel manner, whereas in the remaining two the brain stem was left intact. In all patients with OPCA, definite brain-stem atrophy was visible earlier than the appearance of non-cerebellar clinical symptoms. The present data suggest that CT investigations at regular intervals may be of prognostic value in cerebellar ataxias. 
1	Hemoperitoneum as a result of coital injury without associated vaginal injury. Hemoperitoneum as a result of coital injury without associated vaginal injury is an extremely rare entity, and evidence by only five cases that have been reported in the medical literature to date. We report five additional cases encountered in two medical centers. Two of these were ruptured corpus luteum cysts, one was a laceration of the round ligament, another was a laceration of an ovary, and the fifth was rupture of a serous cystadenoma. This diagnosis should be considered in patients with hemoperitoneum after coitus. 
3	Snow skiing for the physically disabled. The sport of snow skiing by the physically disabled, which originated in Europe in 1935 and first received attention in the United States in the 1940s, is reviewed in terms of opportunities available, instructions, adaptive equipment necessary, and benefits provided. Persons with a wide variety of disabilities (such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, hemiplegia, amputation, blindness, spina bifida, and muscular dystrophy) can participate. Accordingly, a wide range of adaptive equipment is available--including outrigger skis, flip-skis, canting wedges, ski bras, "toe spreaders," sit-skis, and mono-skis--to allow safe enjoyment of the sport. Programs for instruction of the disabled skier are increasing in number and popularity, and numerous opportunities are available to enter competitive events sponsored by National Handicapped Sports. Both the participants and the instructors relate the numerous physical and psychologic benefits that can be derived from skiing; the sport provides an almost universal enjoyment of the sense of freedom and independence. Snow skiing is an enjoyable, beneficial, outdoor cold-weather activity that the disabled population can safely learn with proper instruction. 
4	Epidemiologic features of asymptomatic cerebral infarction in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. We performed unenhanced computed tomographic scans on 141 asymptomatic patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Thirty-six patients (26%) had hypodense areas consistent with cerebral infarction. The majority of these were small deep infarcts, seen in 29 patients (21%), but 13 patients (9%) had cortical or large deep infarctions. Twelve patients had more than one infarct on computed tomographic scan. Increasing age and increased left atrial diameter were the only clinical features associated with asymptomatic infarction. Patients older than 65 years with a left atrial diameter greater than 5.0 cm (n = 23) had a 52% prevalence of asymptomatic infarction. Patients younger than 65 years with a left atrial diameter less than 5.0 cm (n = 38) had an 11% prevalence of silent infarction. Patients with only one of these risk factors (n = 72) had a 24% prevalence of silent infarction. Infarction was more common in those with chronic (34%) as opposed to intermittent (22%) nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, but this difference was not significant. Hypertension, diabetes, duration of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction were not associated with asymptomatic infarction. A history of hypertension was present in only 35% of our patients with small-deep asymptomatic infarction, similar to the percentage in patients without stroke. Asymptomatic cerebral infarction is common in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The association with enlarged left atria and the lack of correlation with major cerebrovascular risk factors suggests a cardioembolic mechanism. Further study is needed to determine the functional and prognostic significance of these strokes. 
5	Acute epididymitis: why patient and consort must be investigated. In this prospective study of 49 patients under 35 years of age with clinically diagnosed epididymitis, detailed microbiological investigation identified an infective cause in 67%. Chlamydia trachomatis was the commonest agent, present in 25 patients, but in 12 of these detection was based solely on raised antibody titres; 20 of the 28 female consorts screened were partners of men with chlamydial epididymitis and 80% of them were also positive for this infection. Isolating the micro-organism from 14 of 16 consorts indicated active infection despite the negative swabs from the men. If this important infection is to be adequately treated we recommend that all patients in this age group with epididymitis and their partners should be referred to a specialist unit with access to full chlamydia laboratory facilities. 
5	Urovirulence determinants in Escherichia coli isolates causing first-episode and recurrent cystitis in women. To assess the prevalence of urovirulence determinants among Escherichia coli isolates from women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, 121 isolates from 87 women with first-episode or recurrent cystitis and 156 fecal isolates from 52 women without recent urinary tract infection were tested using DNA probes for P fimbriae, hemolysin, aerobactin, and diffuse adhesin and for expression of hemolysin and P and F adhesins. P fimbrial genotype (P = .002), hemolysin phenotype (P = .007), and the diffuse adhesin determinant (P = .03), but not aerobactin, were found more frequently in E. coli from women with acute cystitis, and expression of the F adhesin (41%) was more common than the P adhesin (24%; P = .001). E. coli isolates that caused cystitis in women using diaphragms had fewer virulence determinants than those from nonusers (P = .04), suggesting that diaphragm use may allow infection with less virulent E. coli. 
1	Endosonography in the localization of parathyroid tumors: a preliminary study. A preoperative transesophageal exploration of the parathyroids by endosonography was performed on 23 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. The system used was a 7.5 MHz transducer mounted on the tip of an endoscope with an external diameter of 13 mm. The field of visualization was 360 degrees. A retrograde exploration was done moving up from the aortic arch to the upper esophageal sphincter. All patients underwent surgery afterward, and adenomas were found. In 12 cases the adenoma was visualized. All 12 adenomas were posteriorly located on the right side (four cases) and left side (eight cases) of the esophagus. Nine of these 12 tumors were on the posterior face of the thyroid lobes, with six tumors in the middle one third of the thyroid lobe and three in the lower one third of the thyroid lobe. The other three tumors were located below the lower pole of the thyroid lobes in the upper posterior mediastinum. Mean tumor weight was 1165 mg. Of the 11 tumors that could not be visualized, eight tumors were anteriorly located; three of these tumors were on the anterior and lateral surface of the lower pole of the thyroid, and five were in the thyrothymic tracts. The remaining three tumors were located on the back of the thyroid lobes; two of these tumors were at the upper esophageal sphincter, and one was on the side of the pharynx. Mean tumor size was 1334 mg. Localization of parathyroid tumors by endosonography appears possible but only if lesions are located posteriorly, close to the esophagus. Endosonography is not indicated before routine cervical exploration for primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism. As in other such studies, endosonography could be useful in cases of persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism. 
4	Reversible cardiogenic shock due to chest tube compression of the right ventricle. A 62-year-old woman developed shock immediately after the insertion of a right-sided chest tube. A chest roentgenogram showed the chest tube to be overlying the heart and possibly compressing the right ventricle. An animal model was developed to replicate this clinical situation. Using a domestic goat model pulmonary artery, peripheral arterial catheters were inserted along with a right sided chest tube placed to suction. A second chest tube guided by a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope placed within its lumen was positioned between the right ventricle and the sternum of the animals. Thirteen paired measurements in three goats (average of 4.3 measurements per animal) of cardiac output, heart rate, and mean arterial blood pressure were made at baseline and after chest tube placement over the right ventricle. The data were analyzed using a paired t test statistic. Compared with baseline measurements, there was a significant decrease in cardiac output (p less than 0.001) and mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.001) as well as an increase in heart rate (p = 0.0056) after placement of the chest tube across the right ventricle. We conclude that a misplaced chest tube compressing the right ventricle can impede cardiac output and lead to a low cardiac output state. Physicians inserting chest tubes in patients should be aware of this potential complication as it is easily treated by withdrawal of the chest tube. 
1	Magnetic resonance in pediatric and adolescent neuroimaging. With improved availability and a practical understanding of the principles of utilization, MRI will continue to replace CT and US in pediatric neuroimaging, just as it has impacted upon the more invasive modalities. In general, US remains the procedure of choice for screening of fetal and infant CNS abnormalities, and CT continues as the principal screening modality beyond infancy and especially for acute, emergent presentations. MRI has now emerged as a primary option for screening as well as for more definitive assessment of many intracranial and most intraspinal conditions. 
5	Evidence for intraluminal Ca++ regulatory site defect in sarcoplasmic reticulum from malignant hyperthermia pig muscle. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disease of humans and various animal species that predisposes to a life-threatening, anesthetic agent-induced syndrome. MH is thought to be a consequence of abnormal, sustained increases in myoplasmic Ca++ and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes from MH muscle have been shown to have a Ca++ release channel defect. In the present study we have tested a hypothesis that the abnormal Ca++ release mechanism in MH can be expressed when Ca++ is loaded in the presence of pyrophosphate. SR membrane vesicles isolated from normal and MH pig muscle were loaded with Ca++ in the presence and absence of pyrophosphate until Ca(++)-induced Ca++ release occurred. Under both circumstances the threshold amount of Ca++ loaded until Ca++ release occurred was lower in the SR from MH pig skeletal muscle. This difference in amount of Ca++ preload is not explained by results obtained comparing rates of Ca++ uptake, number of ryanodine binding sites or the amounts of calsequestrin among SR vesicles from MH and normal muscle. We conclude from this study that use of pyrophosphate for Ca++ loading does not ablate the abnormal Ca++ release in SR from MH muscle, suggesting the study can be done on small amounts of SR from biopsied human muscle. The data also suggest that abnormality in an intraluminal, low affinity Ca++ binding site regulating Ca++ release occurs in the SR membrane of MH pig muscle. 
1	Unknown primary squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to the neck. We analyzed retrospectively 157 cases of metastatic neck squamous cell carcinoma from unknown primary sites, treated with surgery, radiotherapy, excisional biopsy, and combined modalities. Median follow-up was 74 months, and overall actuarial survival was 55% at 5 years. The surgery-treated group, despite a higher rate of manifesting primary tumors, had significantly better survival at 5 years compared with those receiving radiation therapy, of whom 23% had residual disease after treatment. Primary tumors were discovered during follow-up in 16% overall. Different treatments yielded comparable results in lower-staged neck disease (NX, N1, N2a), while surgery appeared more effective in controlling advanced disease (N2b, N3a). Factors that affected survival include neck stage, connective tissue invasion, and presence of recurrent or residual disease after treatment. 
2	Safety of same-day sequential extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and dissolution of gallstones by methyl tert-butyl ether in dogs. Passage of stone fragments after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of gallstones has resulted in biliary colic, duct obstruction, and pancreatitis in some patients. Rapid dissolution of these fragments with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) may prevent such side effects and achieve complete clearance of gallstones within hours rather than several months to a year or longer. This study examines the safety of same-day ESWL fragmentation and MTBE dissolution of surgically implanted human gallstones in 15 dogs. The animals were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups to assess MTBE absorption from the gallbladder and to observe hematology and chemistry profiles after 0, 400, and 1,200 shock waves from a lithotriptor followed by MTBE dissolution therapy. They were sacrificed either immediately after treatment (12 dogs) or 2 weeks later (3 dogs). The results demonstrated that although ESWL causes moderate trauma to the gallbladder, this did not result in increased MTBE absorption or histologic evidence of mucosal disruption. Blood profiles demonstrated an increase in only the level of aspartate aminotransferase. The three dogs that were sacrificed 2 weeks after the combined treatment had no residual evidence of gallbladder injury or remaining stone material. In all animals, severe injury occurred where shock waves passed through lung or air-filled colon. This study suggests that same-day sequential fragmentation of gallstones by ESWL followed by dissolution of stone fragments with use of MTBE may be associated with only mild to moderate and reversible gallbladder trauma and can rapidly achieve clearance of gallstones. 
5	Prognostic factors in gestational trophoblastic tumors: a proposed new scoring system based on multivariate analysis. All 1391 patients treated for gestational trophoblastic tumors (invasive mole and choriocarcinoma) at the John I. Brewer Trophoblastic Disease Center of Northwestern University between 1969 (when use of combination chemotherapy for initial treatment of high-risk disease came into general use) and 1988 were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the relative importance of prognostic factors with respect to survival. The overall cure rate was 93% (363/391): 100% for 223 patients with nonmetastatic disease and 83% for 168 patients with metastatic disease. The only patients who died had a clinicopathologic diagnosis of metastatic choriocarcinoma. In addition to presence of metastasis (83% vs 100%, p less than 0.0001) and diagnosis of choriocarcinoma (67% vs 100%, p less than 0.0001), number of metastases (47% if greater than 8 vs 92% if less than or equal to 8, p less than 0.0001), metastases to sites other than the lung or vagina (52% vs 91%, p = 0.0002), and previous failed chemotherapy (46% vs 84%, p = 0.0014) demonstrated independent significant effects on survival in patients with metastatic disease. A Brewer score, based on our multivariate analysis of survival in patients with metastatic disease, provided predictability of outcome (likelihood ratio chi 2 statistic, chi 2 = 49.8) comparable to that with the World Health Organization score (chi 2 = 45.3), both of which, in turn, were better predictors than either the traditional Hammond clinical classification system (chi 2 = 34.4) or the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (chi 2 = 22.9). 
1	Contamination of peripheral blood stem cell harvests by circulating neuroblastoma cells. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are being used as one alternative to autologous marrow rescue for patients with neuroblastoma and other solid malignancies. Some physicians prefer use of PBSC because less risk of tumor contamination is believed to exist. This hypothesis was evaluated by immunocytologic analysis of blood samples and concurrently drawn bone marrow (BM) samples and of PBSC harvests obtained from 31 patients with disseminated neuroblastoma. We found circulating neoplastic cells in 75% of specimens analyzed at diagnosis, in 36% during therapy, and in 14% of PBSC harvests. Tumor cells in blood obtained during therapy did not appear until 3 months after the time of diagnosis. Clearance of circulating neuroblastoma cells was documented after two courses of induction chemotherapy. Six of 13 patients with minimal or no BM disease had positive blood specimens. We conclude that substantial risk of tumor contamination of PB harvests exists and recommend that induction chemotherapy be administered before hematopoietic progenitor cells are collected from blood. 
1	Complete spontaneous regression of multiple basal cell carcinomas in the basal cell nevus syndrome: the possible role of transepithelial elimination. A 36-year-old Latin American man with the basal cell nevus syndrome had multiple, soft, hairless, depressed scars of the face, scalp, neck, and back, ranging in size from 0.3 x 0.5 cm to 3.5 x 3.9 cm. These areas had never been treated and previously were sites of basal cell carcinomas that underwent complete spontaneous regression 4-5 years from the date of onset. Pathology of these spontaneously regressed sites was consistent with the criteria established by Curson and Weedon (1979). Type III transepithelial elimination was demonstrated for a basal cell carcinoma. Type III transepithelial elimination may play a role in the spontaneous regression of basal cell carcinomas. 
5	Effect of Towne live virus vaccine on cytomegalovirus disease after renal transplant. A controlled trial OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of vaccination with the Towne live attenuated cytomegalovirus vaccine. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in candidates for renal transplantation. The cytomegalovirus serologic status of both recipients and donors were determined, and the recipients were followed for periods of 6 months to 7 years after transplant. SETTING: A university transplant center. PATIENTS: The analyses were made on 237 patients who were given either vaccine or placebo, received renal transplants, and were followed for at least 6 months. INTERVENTION: Subcutaneous inoculation with Towne live attenuated virus or with placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of cytomegalovirus infection was defined by virus isolation and antibody tests. If infection occurred, a prearranged scoring system for cytomegalovirus disease was used to objectify disease severity. RESULTS: The vaccine was well tolerated, and there were no discernible long-term adverse effects. Recipients who were originally seropositive did not clearly benefit from vaccination. Protective efficacy was analyzed in the group at highest risk for cytomegalovirus disease; recipients who were seronegative at the time of vaccination and who received a kidney from a seropositive donor. Compared with placebo recipients, vaccinated patients in this group had significantly less severe cytomegalovirus disease, with a significant reduction in disease scores (P = 0.03) and 85% decrease in the most severe disease (95% CI, 35% to 96%), although infection rates were similar. Graft survival at 36 months was improved in vaccinated recipients of cadaver kidneys (8 of 16) compared with unvaccinated recipients (4 of 16) (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Previous vaccination of seronegative renal transplant recipients with live cytomegalovirus results in reduction of disease severity mimicking the action of naturally derived immunity. 
5	Somatostatin prevents acute pancreatitis after pancreatic duct sphincter hydrostatic balloon dilation in patients with idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether prophylactic somatostatin infusion can prevent pancreatitis after hydrostatic balloon dilation of the pancreatic duct sphincter segment in 16 patients with idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis. This study demonstrated that prophylactic administration of somatostatin before, during, and after the procedure diminished the incidence and severity of acute pancreatitis. We recommend consideration of such prophylaxis in patients undergoing this procedure. 
1	Management of symptomatic lymphocele via percutaneous drainage and sclerotherapy with tetracycline. Lymph collections following pelvic surgery are usually asymptomatic, but may occasionally produce symptoms requiring invasive therapy. We have successfully obliterated a large lymphocele by employing percutaneous drainage and instilling tetracycline. 
1	Nasopalatine duct cyst: an analysis of 334 cases. The nasopalatine duct cyst (NPDC) is the most common cyst of nonodontogenic origin in the maxilla. However, the information reported about this lesion consists primarily of small surveys and isolated case reports. The purpose of this retrospective investigation was to gather demographic, clinical, and histologic data on a large series of NPDCs, and to compare the findings with those of previous studies. In this study, the overall mean age at diagnosis was 42.5 years, and there was a slight male predilection. The mean radiographic diameter was 17.1 mm, but 75% of the lesions were 20 mm or less in diameter. Symptoms were present in at least 70% of the cases. Only 28% of the specimens contained respiratory epithelium. There was no correlation between radiographic size, patient's age, presenting symptoms, or type of epithelium. Recurrence was noted in only 2% of the cases. 
1	Intramedullary spinal cord germinoma: case report. A case of intramedullary spinal cord germinoma within the conus medullaris, with lumbago and pain in the lower extremities, is presented. The intramedullary spinal cord germinoma was determined by a biopsy specimen. After local irradiation of 50 Gy, the tumor markedly decreased in size and clinical symptoms disappeared. 
3	Prolonged anginal perceptual threshold in diabetes: effects on exercise capacity and myocardial ischemia. Anginal perceptual threshold (the time from onset of 0.1 mV of ST segment depression to onset of angina during treadmill exercise) is prolonged in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease. In the present study, the functional significance of this perceptual abnormality was evaluated by analysis of its effect on exercise capacity and the severity of myocardial ischemia. Treadmill exercise in 32 diabetic patients and 36 nondiabetic control patients showed a close linear correlation between the time to onset of electrical ischemia (ST segment depression) and exercise capacity in both groups (r = 0.8 and 0.9, respectively; p less than 0.001). However, the slope of the relation was flatter in the diabetic group because prolongation of the anginal perceptual threshold permitted continued exercise as ischemia intensified. The anginal perceptual threshold itself showed a close linear correlation with exercise capacity in the diabetic group (r = 0.8, p less than 0.001), although in the nondiabetic group these variables were unrelated. The permissive effect of a prolonged anginal perceptual threshold on exercise capacity is undesirable as reflected by its correlation with ischemia at peak exercise (r = 0.6, p less than 0.001): the longer the threshold, the greater the exercise capacity and the more severe the ischemia. Indeed, the inverse relation between the severity of ischemia at peak exercise and exercise capacity in the nondiabetic group (r = 0.4, p less than 0.02) was completely lost in the diabetic group. Thus, in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease, anginal perceptual threshold is a major determinant of exercise capacity. 
1	Feasibility of intraoperative cytodiagnosis of lung cancer. Of 354 thoracotomies, 114 cases involved intraoperative cytopathologic evaluation. The study included 86 men and 28 women, and 184 specimens were examined. Smears were taken from the lung lesion or lymph node and the chest wall or bronchial stump by imprint or needle aspiration. Intraoperative evaluations were compared with histologic findings. In 85 cases not diagnosed as malignant preoperatively, malignancy was confirmed in 97.6 percent of cases and histologic type in 71.8 percent. In the 28 cases diagnosed as malignant preoperatively, there was only one false-negative. The most important finding during thoracotomy is whether a lesion is malignant or not. The time required to obtain a pathologic diagnosis also is important. We are able to obtain the results of a cytologic diagnosis within 10 min. Cytologic diagnosis of malignancy during thoractomy may be a feasible and convenient method of diagnosis, especially where malignancy is suspected. 
5	Continuous extracorporeal fluid removal in children with low cardiac output after cardiac operations. Eleven hypervolemic and oliguric children with low cardiac output after cardiac operations were treated by slow continuous ultrafiltration or continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration. A mean negative fluid balance of 1.63 +/- 0.37 ml/kg/hr (standard error of the mean [SEM]) significantly improved the hemodynamic status within 59 +/- 6.1 hours (SEM). Although the central venous pressure decreased significantly from 15.2 +/- 0.84 to 8.8 +/- 0.92 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001), the mean arterial pressure increased significantly from 41.5 +/- 2.54 to 53.5 +/- 2.21 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). In addition, pH increased significantly from 7.31 +/- 0.01 (SEM) to 7.43 +/- 0.001 (SEM) (p less than 0.001) and oxygenation index (arterial oxygen tension/inspired oxygen fraction) from 119 +/- 15.2 (SEM) to 214 +/- 27.0 (SEM) (p less than 0.001). Hemodynamic improvement during slow continuous extracorporeal fluid removal allowed a significant decrease of the catecholamine infusion rate. After normovolemia had been achieved, continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration had to be continued in four children because of persistent anuria. Eight patients could be weaned from artificial ventilation and vasopressor support. Two patients died without recovery of renal function and one with restored renal function. Slow continuous ultrafiltration and continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration improve the cardiovascular function in children with low cardiac output by optimizing the preload conditions of the failing heart. In addition, they improve acid-base balance and pulmonary gas exchange. 
3	Blood flow direction in the lumbar nerve root. The effect of clipping on lumbar nerve root blood flow rates in the region of the nerve root canal was studied experimentally in the hog. Blood flow rate was measured using the hydrogen washout technique. When the entrance zone was clipped with a microvascular clip, blood flow rate of the nerve root was decreased by 37% in comparison with the initial control rate; clipping at the exit zone reduced blood flow rate by 69%. Blood flow direction in the lumbar nerve root within the nerve root canal was found to be predominantly proximal. The current data indicate that the more lateral the impingement of the nerve root occurs, the more ischemic changes are induced. 
4	The tangled web of coronary risk factors. Although epidemiologic, genetic, and pathophysiologic studies have shown that low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are involved in the development of coronary artery disease, the standard measurement of LDL cholesterol comprises a number of separate components that may contribute in different ways to the disease process. Some of these components appear to be of particular pathologic importance. Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs) and lipoprotein (a) are highly atherogenic species that each normally account for up to 10% to 15% total LDL cholesterol but may be disproportionately elevated in pathologic states and may therefore contribute disproportionately to coronary disease risk in certain patients. Recently, another subclass of LDL, characterized by relatively small particle size and increased density, also has been found to be associated with relatively increased risk of coronary disease. Furthermore, levels of this subclass, designated LDL-III, are linked to a number of interrelated hormonal and metabolic factors, each of which have also been associated with risk of coronary artery disease. These include male gender, postmenopause, abdominal adiposity, elevated triglyceride levels, increased levels of apolipoprotein B, and reductions in high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), particularly in the HDL2 subclass. Other studies have demonstrated that many of these factors are also commonly associated with relative insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Thus, a lipoprotein profile characterized by a relative increase in LDL-III and a reduction in HDL2 is indicative of a constellation of metabolic features that defines a high-risk state and that makes it extremely difficult to single out one or more factors that are most directly involved in the disease process. Combinations of genetic and environmental factors acting on this "tangled web" of risk factors may account for much of the variation in coronary disease susceptibility found in the general population. 
5	Identification of viruses in a study of acute respiratory tract infection in children from Uruguay. For the purpose of identifying viral agents associated with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in children less than 5 years old, a longitudinal community study was undertaken in Montevideo, Uruguay, from May 1985 to December 1987. This report includes results obtained by cell culture and immunofluorescence techniques for detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza 1 and 3 viruses, and adenovirus. Two populations were studied: children visited at home by pediatricians (group 1) and children with an ARI episode who attended an outpatient clinic (group 2). Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained at the time of an ARI episode: 858 from group 1 and 488 from group 2. Viruses were identified in 15.3% of group 1 specimens and in 17.6% of group 2 specimens. RSV was the most frequently recovered agent, accounting for 67.9% and 58.1%, respectively, of all viruses detected. The sensitivity and specificity of RSV isolation by cell culture are compared with detection by indirect immunofluorescence. 
1	Correlation of ultrasound guided and digitally directed transrectal biopsies of palpable prostatic abnormalities. The authors evaluated 51 patients with palpable prostatic abnormalities detected during digital rectal examination. These findings consisted of a nodule or an area of induration. Each palpable abnormality was confined to 1 prostatic lobe and there was no suggestion of extracapsular extension of neoplasm or systemic metastatic disease. All patients underwent 7.0 MHz. sagittal ultrasound guided transrectal biopsy followed by digitally directed transrectal biopsy. Biopsies were obtained only from the area of interest. The procedure was performed in the outpatient clinic without use of sedation or anesthesia. Digitally directed biopsies were positive for adenocarcinoma in 9 lesions. Ultrasound guided biopsies detected adenocarcinoma in 23 lesions, including all those detected by the blind digitally directed technique. This study demonstrates greater diagnostic accuracy using 7.0 MHz. ultrasound guided techniques and its routine use is warranted in the evaluation of palpable prostatic abnormalities. 
1	High cardiac output as a paraneoplastic syndrome. A high cardiac output (17 1 min-1) was recorded in a young man suffering from lymphoplasmatocytotic lymphoma. The evolution of the blood disease was characterized by two relapses, during which clinical signs of heart failure were prominent but resolved with efficient blood chemotherapy. The known aetiologies of high cardiac output were excluded. The complete normalization of the cardiac parameters with blood remission suggests that the high cardiac output represented an unusual paraneoplastic syndrome, the pathogenesis of which still remains unknown, although several hypotheses were tested. 
3	Fungal pseudomeningitis superimposed on Escherichia coli meningitis. Pseudomeningitis is the demonstration of microorganisms from the cerebrospinal fluid by stain or culture in a patient with symptoms suggesting meningitis. This is a report of fungal pseudomeningitis superimposed on a case of nosocomial Escherichia coli meningitis resulting from a neurosurgical procedure. Critical care personnel need to be aware of the possibility of pseudomeningitis with or without associated meningitis in the appropriate setting. 
5	Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage associated with progressive systemic sclerosis. A 41 year old man with an eight year history of progressive systemic sclerosis developed severe diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and died. The importance of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage as a rare but potentially serious complication of connective tissue disease should not be overlooked. 
4	Unnecessary deaths from valvular aortic stenosis. The annual mortality from aortic valvular stenosis was calculated among potential candidates for surgical replacement of the aortic valve. From the Swedish Central Register of Causes of Death, 70 patients below the age of 80 years who had died from aortic stenosis during a 1-year period in the County of Stockholm (population 1.5 million), were identified. A retrospective analysis of their medical records showed that 37 individuals were suitable candidates for surgery. The presence of aortic stenosis had been verified at autopsy in 31 (84%) patients. The remaining six patients (16%) had their aortic stenosis diagnosis established by a thorough non-invasive investigation performed before death. Although typical signs and symptoms of aortic stenosis were recorded in all 37 patients, only six (16%) of them had been considered by their physicians to be suitable candidates for surgery prior to death. The deceased patients were compared with a group of 68 patients who had undergone aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis during the same period. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to symptoms and clinical findings, except for a higher incidence of syncope in the operated group. It is concluded that, of 105 (68 surgically treated and 37 deceased) eligible patients with aortic stenosis, 37 individuals did not receive surgical care in time. The reason for this was probably insufficient knowledge of the curability of the disease. 
5	The management of postoperative chylous ascites. A case report and literature review. Chylous ascites remains rare as a complication of surgical intervention. Although therapeutic manoeuvres to control chylous ascites have been developed over the past 20 years, its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Conservative approaches involving dietary restriction of long-chain triglycerides and salt, together with multiple paracenteses, are still the therapies of choice. Persistent chylous ascites may be treated surgically by ligation of leaking lymphatics or implantation of a peritoneovenous shunt once the lymphatic anatomy has been defined by preoperative investigations. We report a case of chylous ascites developing after laparotomy and duodenotomy for obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, which did not respond adequately to medical therapy and was successfully managed by the insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt. 
5	Recurrent renal cell carcinoma arising in Wilms' tumor. A 19-month-old black girl had a radical nephrectomy for a Wilms' tumor that contained areas of epithelium indistinguishable from renal cell carcinoma. She was treated with chemotherapy but subsequently had pulmonary metastases develop and massive abdominal recurrence. The recurrent tumor was histologically renal cell carcinoma with no identifiable Wilms' tumor elements. The child died with recurrent and metastatic tumor 13 months after nephrectomy. Pathologic, immunoperoxidase, and flow cytometric studies of this unusual case are presented. 
1	Stage A adenocarcinoma of the prostate: transrectal US and sonographic-pathologic correlation. Results of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) of the prostate and pathologic examination of specimens obtained at transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) were compared in 29 patients with clinical stage A adenocarcinoma. Ten specimens contained no residual tumors larger than 5 mm in diameter; in the remaining 19 glands, 20 discrete cancers were found. At TRUS, 30 peripheral hypoechoic lesions were demonstrated, of which 11 corresponded to carcinoma at pathologic examination. Other hypoechoic peripheral zone lesions included a focal area of dilated acinar glands in 10 cases, post-TURP scarring with fingerlike projections of fibrosis in seven, dysplasia in one, and no correlation in one. Of nine tumors that were not detected prospectively at TRUS, eight were predominantly in the anterior zone and one was in the posterior peripheral zone but was isoechoic. Overall, the sensitivity of TRUS in the evaluation of clinical stage A lesions was 55% and the specificity was 37%. Clinical stage A carcinomas may be difficult to detect at US, and findings are often nonspecific. Any suspicious peripheral zone lesion should undergo biopsy with TRUS guidance before being diagnosed as malignant. 
1	Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism causing subacute cor pulmonale: a difficult antemortem diagnosis [published erratum appears in Mayo Clin Proc 1991 Apr;66(4):439] Microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism is difficult to diagnose. The most common initial clinical symptom is subacute progressive dyspnea, and the initial laboratory evaluation typically shows hypoxemia in a patient with clear lung fields on a chest roentgenogram. Another distinguishing feature may be hepatic abnormalities. In general, pulmonary angiography discloses no evidence of emboli, but multiple subsegmental peripheral perfusion defects are noted on ventilation-perfusion lung scans. The diagnosis of microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism can be confirmed by open-lung or transbronchial lung biopsy or by microvascular pulmonary cytology, a less invasive procedure that could be performed at the time of pulmonary angiography. Herein we describe two patients with unsuspected microscopic pulmonary tumor embolism that eventuated in subacute cor pulmonale and death. These cases illustrate the characteristic findings of this entity and emphasize the need for early diagnosis. 
5	Urinary tract infection: economic considerations. Urinary tract infection results in significant morbidity and mortality while consuming large amounts of national resources. The prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infection produce both costs and benefits, and economic analysis provides a rational framework for looking at these effects. The goals and methods of economic analysis in medicine are summarized, and strategies to address uncomplicated cystitis, nosocomial urinary tract infection, and pyelonephritis are reviewed, with an emphasis on the economic trade-offs faced by decision makers. 
4	Effects of antihypertensive therapy on mechanics of cerebral arterioles in rats. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of antihypertensive treatment on structure and mechanics of cerebral arterioles and the incidence of stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Treatment of hypertension was begun at 3 months of age with cilazapril (45 mg/kg/day), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or with hydralazine (18 mg/kg/day). Cilazapril and hydralazine reduced systolic arterial pressure (from 195 +/- 8 to 125 +/- 5 and 148 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively [mean +/- SEM]; p less than 0.05). To examine structure and mechanics of cerebral arterioles, we measured pressure (servonull), external diameter, and cross-sectional area of the vessel wall (histologically) in pial arterioles of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHRSP that were untreated or that were treated for 3 months with cilazapril or with hydralazine. Arterioles were maximally dilated with EDTA. In WKY rats, cilazapril and hydralazine did not alter pial arteriolar pressure, external diameter, or cross-sectional area of the vessel wall. In SHRSP, both cilazapril and hydralazine reduced cross-sectional area of the vessel wall to levels not significantly different from WKY rats (from 1,911 +/- 155 to 1,244 +/- 101 and 1,388 +/- 59 microns 2, respectively, compared with 1,405 +/- 95 microns 2 for untreated WKY rats). Cilazapril was more effective than hydralazine in reducing pial arteriolar pressure (from 110 +/- 6 to 62 +/- 2 mm Hg with cilazapril versus 79 +/- 5 mm Hg for hydralazine compared with 60 +/- 4 mm Hg for untreated WKY rats). Cilazapril, but not hydralazine, attenuated reductions in external diameter of pial arterioles (from 91 +/- 4 to 100 +/- 4 microns for cilazapril versus 91 +/- 3 microns for hydralazine compared with 107 +/- 3 microns for untreated WKY rats). 
5	Coronary bypass surgery: is the operation different today? Patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting have undergone an evolution in recent years. To document this change, we analyzed two groups of patients in 1981 (n = 1586) and 1987 (n = 1513) to document preoperative and postoperative variables important in determining immediate morbidity and mortality after isolated coronary bypass. Between 1981 and 1987, patients were found to be older (greater than or equal to 70 years, 8.7% versus 21.8%, p less than 0.0001), more often diabetic (15% versus 24%, p less than 0.0001), have a greater prevalence of triple vessel disease (14.5% versus 46.1%, p less than 0.0001), and have more left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 0.60 +/- 14 versus 0.54 +/- 13, p less than 0.0001). To facilitate analysis and because of overlap between subgroups, we subdivided patients into three subgroups for statistical comparison of the years 1981 and 1987: subgroup I, no prior procedure (n = 1546 in 1981 and 1396 in 1987); subgroup II, optimal group (n = 503 in 1981 and 292 in 1987, and defined as no prior procedure, ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 and age less than 65 years); subgroup III, patients having reoperations (n = 40 in 1981 and 117 in 1987). Internal mammary artery grafting was infrequently used in 1981 but was used in 72.1% in 1987. Major postoperative morbidity between the 2 years for the total population increased significantly: need for intraaortic balloon pumping, 1.4% versus 4.7%, p less than 0.0001; myocardial infarction 3.5% versus 5.5%, p less than 0.008; stroke, 1.4% versus 2.8%, p less than 0.008; and wound infection, 1.0% versus 3.0%, p less than 0.001. Wound infection (all types) in 1987 was increased sevenfold in patients having a perioperative myocardial infarction (0.7% versus 5%, p less than 0.0001). For young patients with good left ventricular function (subgroup II), there was no increase in these morbid events between 1981 and 1987. Hospital mortality in the total population increased significantly between 1981 and 1987 from 1.2% to 3.1% (p less than 0.0002), respectively. It was lowest for the patients in optimal condition (subgroup II) in both years, 0.8% versus 1.1%, and highest for reoperative patients, 5.3% versus 4.3%. In 1981, 58% of patients (503/870) were in the optimal group compared with 35% (292/828) in 1987 (p less than 0.0001). The last six years have seen a progressive trend in surgically treating older, sicker patients who have more complex disease, with a significant reduction in the best candidate group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
1	CT and MR imaging in staging non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma: report of the Radiologic Diagnostic Oncology Group. The accuracies of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) in determining tumor classification and assessing mediastinal node metastases were compared in a prospective cooperative study of 170 patients with non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma. The sensitivity of CT in distinguishing T3-T4 tumors from T0-T2 tumors was 63%; specificity was 84%. These values for MR imaging were not significantly different (56% and 80%). With receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, no difference existed between the accuracies of CT and MR imaging in diagnosis of bronchial involvement or chest wall invasion, but MR imaging was significantly more accurate than CT (P = .047) in diagnosis of mediastinal invasion. Lymph node sampling was performed in 155 patients (642 node stations). Cancerous nodes were found in 14% of stations in 21% of patients. There was no significant difference between the accuracies of CT and MR imaging in detecting mediastinal node metastases (N2 or N3); the sensitivities were 52% and 48%, respectively, and specificities were 69% and 64%. ROC analysis also showed no difference between CT and MR imaging. 
2	Prospective randomized comparison of esophageal variceal sclerotherapy agents: sodium tetradecyl sulfate versus sodium morrhuate. We designed a prospective randomized study to evaluate differences in efficacy and complication rate between the two most commonly used sclerosing agents, sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STD) and sodium morrhuate (MOR). Of 41 patients with acute index variceal bleeding initially evaluated, 21 were randomized to receive 0.75% STD and 20 to receive 1.6% MOR diluted with 50% dextrose. Overall mortality for the STD group was 38% and that for the MOR group was 25% (NS). Control of acute bleeding was achieved in 86% of the STD patients and 90% of the MOR patients (NS). Overall, obliteration was achieved in only 33% of the STD group and 25% of the MOR group; but in those patients who remained in the study over 3 months, obliteration was achieved in 87 and 83%, respectively (NS). There was a trend toward higher rebleeding in the STD group compared with the MOR group (81% vs. 51%) (p = 0.078), but there was no significant difference between the STD and MOR patients with regard to transfusion requirements (8.4 units/patient vs. 8.7 units/patient), ulceration (53% vs. 40%), or stricture formation (9.5% vs. 0.0%). The results of this study suggest that STD and MOR are clinically equivalent sclerosing solutions, and that bias favoring use of one agent over the other may be unfounded. 
5	Life events and low birthweight--analysis by infants preterm and small for gestational age. Social stress was assessed in 92 women with low-birthweight babies and 92 controls using the detailed LEDS measure of life events and severe chronic difficulties. The low-birthweight group was divided into preterm delivery (n = 40), small for gestational age (SGA) (n = 40) and mixed groups. Multivariate analysis was performed using a binomial-logit model to examine whether social factors were independently and significantly associated with low birthweight once the effect of demographic factors, obstetric factors and smoking/drinking were taken into account. Comparison of preterm births with controls indicated that three factors were significantly associated: a previous low-birthweight baby, severe life event/difficulty and bleeding during pregnancy. For SGA babies the factors were: previous low-birthweight baby, low social support and smoking. By using a reliable measure of life events and adequate numbers of low-birthweight babies, this study overcame the potential inaccuracies of previous studies and indicates a more specific relation between social stress and low birthweight. 
1	The role of resection in the management of melanoma metastatic to the adrenal gland. Melanoma metastatic to the adrenal gland diagnosed before death was exceedingly rare before the development of computed tomographic (CT) scanning. The records of 28 patients with melanoma metastatic to the adrenal gland seen since 1975 were reviewed. Eighteen patients were men and 10 were women. Twenty-three patients had unilateral disease. Four patients were diagnosed only at autopsy, leaving 24 for analysis of treatment and survival. Twenty-one patients had received specific active immunotherapy, four had received chemotherapy (dacarbazine, lomustin, bleomycin, and vincristine), and three had received both before the diagnosis of their adrenal disease. Adrenal metastases were diagnosed by CT scanning in 14 patients with symptoms, 10 (91%) of whom had pain. Ten patients were diagnosed by CT before entry into a chemotherapy protocol. Of eight patients who underwent resection of all known disease, five underwent unilateral adrenalectomy, two underwent unilateral adrenalectomy and bowel resection, and one underwent bilateral adrenalectomy. Two patients underwent partial resection of large unilateral tumors. Fourteen patients with adrenal metastases and disease elsewhere were initiated or continued with chemotherapy or were treated symptomatically. Mean survival in the group that underwent resection for cure was 59 months (3 to 112 months), whereas survival in the group with unresectable tumors was 15 months (1.5 to 132 months). Four of eight patients who underwent resection for cure lived more than 5 years after detection of adrenal metastasis, whereas in only one of 14 patients with unresectable tumors was the same true. Patients with metastatic melanoma localized to one or both adrenal glands may benefit from early detection and surgical intervention. 
1	Large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) compared to carbon dioxide laser in the treatment of CIN: a superior mode of treatment. A series of 199 patients with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade II or III were allocated by hospital number to receive out-patient treatment by carbon dioxide laser vaporization or large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ). All patients received local anaesthesia. The women in the LLETZ group experienced less post operative haemorrhage, less discomfort, operative time was greatly reduced, and histological material was available for confirmation of the diagnosis. There was no significant difference in recurrence of CIN after treatment between the two groups. At 6 month follow-up, recurrence rates of 8.2% (CIN II) and 7.5% (CIN III) were observed in the laser-group and 5% (CIN II) and 5.3% (CIN III) in the LLETZ group. Further advantages of LLETZ are reduced capital expenditure and no hazard to the eyesight of the surgeon, but laser treatment is preferable in patients with widespread vaginal involvement. 
4	The changing clinical spectrum of thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease). Between 1970 and 1987, 112 patients were diagnosed as having thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO). The age was 42 +/- 11 years (mean +/- SD; range, 20-75 years); 23% were women, and 7% were more than 60 years old when they were first diagnosed. Ischemic ulcerations were present in 85 (76%) patients: 24 (28%) patients with upper-extremity, 39 (46%) patients with lower-extremity, and 22 (26%) patients with both upper- and lower-extremity lesions. Ninety-one (81%) patients had rest pain, 49 (44%) patients had Raynaud's phenomenon, and 43 (38%) patients had superficial thrombophlebitis. We were able to follow up 89 of the 112 (79%) patients for 1-460 months (mean follow-up time, 91.6 +/- 84 months). Sixty-five (73%) patients had no amputations, while 24 (27%) had one or more of the following amputations: finger, six (15%) patients; toe, 13 (33%) patients; transmetatarsal, four (10%) patients; below knee, 14 (36%) patients; and above knee, two (5%) patients. Forty-three (48%) patients stopped smoking for a mean of 80 +/- 105 months (median, 46.5 months; range, 1-420 months), and only two (5%) patients had amputations after they stopped smoking, while 22 (42%) patients had amputations while continuing to smoke (p less than 0.0001). The spectrum of patients with TAO is changing in that the male-to-female ratio is decreasing (3:1), more older patients are being diagnosed, and upper-extremity involvement is commonly present. In the 48% of patients who stopped smoking, amputations and continued disease activity were uncommon. 
4	Carotid-esophageal fistula following a penetrating neck injury: case report. Carotid arterial injuries frequently are associated with injuries to adjacent structure of the neck, particularly the esophagus and trachea. Complications from these repairs are common and fistula formation is herein described between the carotid artery and esophageal repair. 
1	Intraoperative decision making during thyroid surgery based on the results of preoperative needle biopsy and frozen section. Prognostic factors in well-differentiated thyroid cancer are age of the patient and grade, size, distant metastasis, and extracapsular spread of the disease. However, the surgeon is often not sure about the pathologic diagnosis of thyroid nodules. The accuracy of preoperative studies, such as ultrasonography and thyroid scanning, is limited. The most cost-effective test is fine-needle aspiration, the accuracy of which exceeds 80% in most series. However, a large group of nodules exist for which aspiration cytologic studies are considered to be either suspicious or indeterminate. The decision about the extent of thyroidectomy may be difficult in these patients. Intraoperative frozen section may help the surgeon to distinguish benign from malignant lesions, but as in fine-needle aspiration, the major problem is the distinction between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma. The frozen section diagnosis of follicular adenoma was changed to follicular carcinoma in one third of the cases (13 of 38 cases). The decision about the extent of thyroidectomy in patients with follicular adenomas was based on other prognostic factors, such as age and sex of the patient and the size of the nodule. The accuracy of frozen section diagnosis was 95%. Our experience suggests that decisions regarding the extent of thyroidectomy can best be made by preoperative fine-needle aspiration with confirmation by frozen section diagnosis in equivocal cases. 
4	Blood pressure reactivity predicts myocardial infarction among treated hypertensive patients. High blood pressure (BP) defines a prognostically heterogeneous group. Because BP varies according to time, setting and means of observation, it has been postulated that BP reactivity might better predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) than does unidimensional measurements. To assess BP reactivity, the difference between pretreatment nurse (RN) and physician (MD) diastolic BP (DBP)--systematically recorded in that order--or MD-RN DBP, was obtained in 1737 previously untreated patients with sustained, RN BP greater than or equal to 160 and/or 95 mmHg. Patients stratified by tertiles of MD-RN DBP [(I) less than or equal to - 3, (II) -2 to 3 and (III) greater than or equal to 4 mmHg] were similar by sex, race, age, body mass index, cholesterol, electrocardiography, prior CVD, smoking and pretreatment or attained in-treatment BPs. During 14 years of followup, myocardial infarction (MI) incidence per 1000/year were, tertile I (3.2), II (3.7), III (7.6) (relative risk = 2.4, III vs I + II, p less than 0.05), whereas stroke incidence and non-CVD mortality were evenly distributed. By Cox survival analysis, controlling for other entry characteristics only age, sex and DBP reactivity remained predictive (p less than or equal to 0.03) of MI or total CVD. Thus, BP reactivity, probably a centrally-mediated phenomenon, identifies a subgroup of hypertensives with an increased propensity for MI despite successful BP control. 
4	High urinary cAMP in hypertensives despite careful drug treatment--an epidemiological study from the Dalby population. The correlation between serum calcium (S-Ca), plasma parathyroid hormone (P-PTH) and hypertension was determined in a population-based, cross-sectional study of carefully treated hypertensives (n = 391; diastolic blood pressure 90.2 mmHg; 57 years) compared with normotensive controls (n = 328; diastolic blood pressure 82.1 mmHg; 57 years). Levels of urinary cyclic-adenosinemonophosphate (U-cAMP), but not of plasma cAMP (P-cAMP), were higher (P less than 0.001) in hypertensives than in controls. This was the case regardless of the type of drug treatment and the blood pressure level that was reached. U-cAMP correlated with adrenaline in multivariate analyses. S-Ca levels were higher (P less than 0.001) and S-Mg levels were lower (P less than 0.001) in hypertensives than in controls. This was not explained by thiazide treatment. Thus, despite 'adequate' blood pressure reduction, substantial differences in S-Ca, S-Mg and U-cAMP still exist between hypertensives and normotensive controls. 
1	Clinical and instrumental evaluation of sensory function before and after percutaneous anterolateral cordotomy at cervical level in man. Sensory perception thresholds were assessed by clinical testing and by quantitative instrumental testing before and after operation in 16 subjects for whom unilateral percutaneous cervical cordotomy was performed for the relief of pain due to malignant disease, and compared with clinical assessments of sensory function. We were able to confirm the association between deficit in pin-prick sensation and pain relief in the majority of instances, though the completeness or otherwise of pain relief does not correspond to absence of pin-prick sensation. There is no objective interference with low threshold mechanical sensation as measured instrumentally, although cordotomised subjects do not experience startle, tickle, or cutaneous erotic sensation when subjected to appropriate low intensity tactile sensation. Quantitative instrumental testing shows that the greatest deficits produced by cordotomy are in the sensations of skinfold pinch (? = tissue-damage pain) and skin cooling. The latter is transduced in the periphery by A delta fibres; sensations of warmth and hot pain, transduced by primary afferent C fibres, are much less significantly affected. Our findings thus fail to resolve the question as to whether chronic clinical pain is mainly an A delta- or a C fibre-mediated phenomenon. 
1	Germ line p53 mutations in a familial syndrome of breast cancer, sarcomas, and other neoplasms Familial cancer syndromes have helped to define the role of tumor suppressor genes in the development of cancer. The dominantly inherited Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is of particular interest because of the diversity of childhood and adult tumors that occur in affected individuals. The rarity and high mortality of LFS precluded formal linkage analysis. The alternative approach was to select the most plausible candidate gene. The tumor suppressor gene, p53, was studied because of previous indications that this gene is inactivated in the sporadic (nonfamilial) forms of most cancers that are associated with LFS. Germ line p53 mutations have been detected in all five LFS families analyzed. These mutations do not produce amounts of mutant p53 protein expected to exert a trans-dominant loss of function effect on wild-type p53 protein. The frequency of germ line p53 mutations can now be examined in additional families with LFS, and in other cancer patients and families with clinical features that might be attributed to the mutation. 
4	Myocardial imaging with Tc-99m teboroxime: technique and initial results. This study examined the results of Tc-99m teboroxime imaging in 22 patients aged 59 +/- 9 years and compared the results with those of thallium-201. The exercise and rest teboroxime studies were obtained within 3 hours of each other using a dose of 15 mCi/study. Because of the very short wash-out half-life of teboroxime, imaging was begun within 1 to 2 minutes after injection. Both SPECT and planar images were obtained; the SPECT protocol was modified by changing the number of frames, the time per frame, or the filters used for reconstruction of images. The planar images were obtained in the supine or upright position. Shorter acquisition time for SPECT (10 sec/frame) and the use of a Butterworth filter with a frequency cutoff of 0.3 cycle/cm and a power of 10 yielded best image quality. There was a close agreement with thallium results in identifying an abnormal or normal perfusion pattern in 89% of vascular territories. The scans were abnormal by both techniques in 12 patients, normal in nine patients, and discordant in only one patient. Thus Tc-99m teboroxime myocardial imaging is feasible at rest and during exercise using either SPECT or planar imaging. Shorter acquisition time and appropriate filtering for SPECT imaging and the upright position in planar imaging improve image quality and are convenient for the patient. 
5	Immune responses to allogeneic and xenogeneic implants of collagen and collagen derivatives. Whereas xenogeneic collagen has provided a safe and effective biomaterial for numerous medical applications, there are few instances in which data permit the correlation of the immunologic profile of well-defined devices with their clinical sequelae. A major exception is the use of injectable bovine dermal collagen for soft-tissue contour correction. The low incidence of hypersensitivity has been studied in the context of clinical efficacy and safety with several devices. The findings indicate that such immunity usually results in the manifestation of local symptoms of dermal inflammation at sites of treatment that resolve as the implant is resorbed by the host. In contrast, more immunogenic hemostatic agents may elicit a more frequent or vigorous immune response that is not clinically visible or relevant in that application. Recent experiences with collagen-based devices for the repair and regeneration of bone have also demonstrated that the presence of immunity to their collagenous or non-collagenous components does not necessarily predict adverse clinical sequelae. Indeed, numerous specific data indicate that this immunity can exist as an epiphenomenon with no effect on osteogenesis. To get a true composite picture of biocompatibility, significant steps must be taken to characterize biomaterials properly and to ensure that immunologic, clinical, histologic, and other pertinent laboratory data are viewed in relation to one another and not in isolation. 
3	Use of activated charcoal to reduce elevated serum phenobarbital concentration in a neonate. The course of a neonate administered activated charcoal orally for elevated phenobarbital concentration is described. The neonate required a serum concentration of phenobarbital eventually exceeding 80 micrograms/mL for seizure control. However, due to the severe CNS injury as a result of the asphyxia at birth, a diagnosis of cerebral death by electroencephalogram and apnea test was pursued. This required the phenobarbital concentration to be less than 30 micrograms/mL. Serial phenobarbital concentrations during this time indicated a 250 hour half-life, which would require two weeks for the phenobarbital to drop below 30 micrograms/mL. With the administration of six doses of activated charcoal at 0.7 g/kg/dose, the phenobarbital serum concentration decreased to 22 micrograms/mL, giving an estimated phenobarbital half-life of 22 hours. This, and two other subsequent cases, indicates repeated doses of activated charcoal are effective in augmenting the clearance of certain drugs in the neonatal age group. 
5	Reoperation for recurrent peptic ulcer disease. The patient with recurrent peptic ulcer evidences failure of an initial operation to control the ulcer diathesis. A trial of aggressive medical therapy is warranted in elective presentations and has a moderate chance of success. Failing this, we believe that reoperation should be tailored to the patient's physiologic status and previous operation (Table 5). Nevertheless, in most cases, we believe that the second operation should be the final operation and should consist of the procedure with the lowest recurrence rates. Therefore, we believe that the assurance of an adequate antrectomy and complete vagal section is the preferred procedure for most patients with recurrent peptic ulcer. 
3	Hyperglycemia presenting with occipital seizures. Seizures are common in hyperglycemia and are often the first manifestation, particularly in nonketotic hyperglycemia (NKH). Published reports emphasize partial motor seizures almost exclusively. In a 3-year period, we observed three patients in whom occipital seizures, documented by ictal EEG recording, were the initial symptom of hyperglycemia. One patient was mildly ketotic at first. Seizures were visual in two patients and visual and adversive in the third. Seizures regressed with correction of abnormal glucose levels and did not recur during follow-up of less than or equal to 1 year despite discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in two. Computed tomography (CT) scans did not show correlative abnormalities. Although published reports suggest that frontal lobe structures are particularly susceptible to the epileptogenic effects of NKH, our experience indicates that in NKH epileptic foci may originate in other cortical areas, such as occipital. 
4	Heart rate variability before and after myocardial infarction in conscious dogs at high and low risk of sudden death. Heart rate variability has been demonstrated both experimentally and clinically to be of prognostic importance in determining mortality after myocardial infarction. However, no paired studies have been reported to examine heart rate variability before and after myocardial infarction. The hypothesis was tested that low values of heart rate variability provided risk assessment both before and after myocardial infarction with use of an established canine model of sudden cardiac death. Risk for sudden death was assessed 1 month after myocardial infarction by a protocol in which exercise and myocardial ischemia were combined; dogs that developed ventricular fibrillation were classified at high risk for sudden death (susceptible) and the survivors were considered low risk (resistant). In resistant dogs, myocardial infarction did not affect any measure of heart rate variability: 1) mean RR interval, 2) standard deviation of the mean RR interval, and 3) the coefficient of variance (standard deviation/RR interval). By contrast, after myocardial infarction, susceptible dogs showed significant decrease in all measures of heart rate variability. Before myocardial infarction, no differences were seen between susceptible and resistant dogs. However, 30 days after infarction, epidemiologic analysis of the coefficient of variance showed high sensitivity and specificity (88% and 80%, respectively), predicting susceptibility. Therefore, results of analysis of 30 min of beat to beat heart period at rest 30 days after myocardial infarction are highly predictive for increased risk of sudden death. 
2	Ulcerative proctitis in central Sweden 1965-1983. A population-based epidemiological study. Ulcerative proctitis has by tradition been regarded as a subgroup of ulcerative colitis. Population-based epidemiological studies of ulcerative proctitis are, however, virtually nonexistent. In an epidemiological study of inflammatory bowel disease in the Uppsala Health Care Region, 1065 cases of ulcerative proctitis were diagnosed from 1965 through 1983. Males predominated, with the male to female ratio 1.4:1. Annual incidence rates were higher in urban than in rural areas. The annual incidence rates increased threefold from 2.8 per 10(5) to 6.6 per 10(5) during the period, affecting all age groups over 14 years of age, in both urban and rural areas and in both sexes. Differences in temporal trends and certain other epidemiological characteristics between ulcerative proctitis and extensive ulcerative colitis suggest that ulcerative proctitis is a specific disease whose etiology differs from that of extensive ulcerative colitis. 
4	Clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of ventricular tachycardia in children with normal hearts. Characteristics of 18 patients with clinical ventricular tachycardia (VT) and normal hearts documented by physical examination, echocardiography, and angiocardiography were analyzed. There were 13 males and 5 females, aged 1 to 16 years (mean +/- SD, 9.7 +/- 4.8 years). Six patients had hemodynamic instability during VT and the other 12 patients were hemodynamically stable. Two patients (11%) presented with sustained VT and 16 (89%) with episodes of nonsustained VT at varying intervals (3 of 16 with repetitive monomorphic VT). Among 14 patients on whom exercise tests were performed, seven had exercise-induced VT. During electrophysiologic studies, VT was induced in 16 of 18 (89%) (in 13 patients with morphology identical to clinical VT). VT was induced by programmed stimulation (single, double, and burst stimulation of the right atrium or right ventricular apex during sinus rhythm or during pacind for eight beats) in 5 of 18 (28%) patients; with isoproterenol, VT was aggravated spontaneously in 6 of 15 (40%) patients; and during stimulation VT was induced in 8 of 15 (53%) patients. Among patients whose VT was not induced during programmed stimulation, VT was induced with the addition of isoproterenol in 11 of 12 (92%). All 14 patients in follow-up are in stable condition, seven patients with medication and seven without medication. Pediatric patients with normal hearts and clinically detected VT usually have VT induced by programmed stimulation, either with or without isoproterenol stimulation. 
3	Anemia after traumatic spinal cord injury. The incidence and natural history of anemia in patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI) were investigated in a prospective study of 68 patients consecutively admitted to a regional acute SCI unit. Fifty had SCI and 18 had spine injuries (SI) without neurologic deficit. Thirty-six of 41 males (88%) and six of nine females (67%) with SCI were anemic on at least one occasion. In the first two weeks after injury, in females and in males, there was no significant difference in mean hemoglobin level between SI and SCI patients. At six weeks, no male with SI was anemic, and males with SCI had significantly lower mean hemoglobin levels than those with SI (121.6 g/L vs 145.4 g/L, p less than .001). Identified early causes of anemia were blood loss due to bony soft tissue or visceral injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, and surgery. In the postacute phase (more than six weeks after injury), anemia occurred in 25 of 41 male and three of nine female SCI patients, and its occurrence was associated with the presence of an identified chronic disease, especially urinary tract infection. 
5	Chronic neutropenia during childhood. A 13-year experience in a single institution. To evaluate the clinical course and characteristics of children with chronic neutropenia, we reviewed the charts of all such patients seen at our center during a 13-year period. A total of 50 patients with chronic neutropenia were identified. Three patients had documented congenital neutropenia, and two siblings had cyclic neutropenia. The remaining 45 children had chronic neutropenia of unknown origin. All children except two had a remarkably benign course despite markedly reduced granulocyte counts. Of six girls in this group who had abscess or cellulitis of the labia majora, it was a presenting manifestation in three. Resolution of neutropenia was documented in 23 (62%) of 37 patients for whom follow-up information was available, with a median duration of neutropenia of 19 months. No differences were evident between patients with positive antineutrophil antibody test results and those in whom the test yielded negative results or was not performed. Chronic neutropenia in childhood is a relatively uncommon entity, characterized by a benign course and eventual resolution in the majority of patients. 
5	Tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome Eight patients who became ill while taking tryptophan had myalgia, fatigue, rash, fever, edema, alopecia, arthralgias, diminished joint motion, skin tightening, muscle cramping, and distal paresthesias. Three had shortness of breath, and one had pulmonary hypertension. Laboratory abnormalities included peripheral eosinophilia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated serum levels of aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes. Of 4 chest radiographs, 3 were abnormal. Of 5 skin and muscle biopsies, 4 showed sclerosis or mixed inflammatory cell infiltration of the dermis, subcutis, and fascia. Eosinophils were often present, but vasculitis was absent. Muscle inflammation was minimal. We conclude that the "eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome" is related to the ingestion of tryptophan and that abnormalities in the secretion of lymphokines may be important in its pathogenesis. 
5	Effects of site-specific mutations on biologic activities of recombinant human IL-6. To examine structure-activity relationships of human IL-6, we have determined the effects of specific mutations on the biologic activity of a human rIL-6 expressed in bacteria. Three types of mutants were examined: 1) a variant that contains serines in place of the four naturally occurring cysteines; 2) a series of cysteine-containing deletion mutants, each having a single internal 20 amino acid deletion; and 3) a cysteine-free variant containing a single 20 amino acid deletion. The mutants of the second type constitute a set of nonoverlapping, adjacent deletions spanning amino acids 4 through 183 of the 184 amino acids in natural human IL-6. All of the mutants were expressed, along with the full length, cysteine-containing analogue, in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins, joined to beta-galactosidase through a collagen linker. This system allows microgram quantities of the rIL-6 variants to be partially purified from small bacterial cultures without chromatographic or refolding steps. Each of the rIL-6 variants was released from the beta-galactosidase fusion protein with collagenase, and the recovered rIL-6 was quantitated by laser densitometry of Coomassie-stained, SDS polyacrylamide gels. The sp. ac. of each of the rIL-6 variants was determined using four assays: induction of IgM secretion from an EBV transformed human B cell line, induction of fibrinogen secretion from a human hepatoma cell line, induction of fibrinogen secretion from a rat hepatoma cell line, and induction of proliferation of a murine hybridoma cell line. Replacement of cysteines with serines reduced activity relative to cysteine-containing rIL-6 to about 20% in the rat hepatoma assay and about 3% in the mouse hybridoma assay, whereas activity in both of the human cell lines was reduced to less than 0.1%. These data suggest that the murine and rat cell lines are less selective than the human cell lines in their requirements for recognition of biologically active IL-6. Each of the deletions, except that of amino acids 4 through 23, resulted in loss of activity in all four assays. These results suggest that the information necessary for activity is not contained within any one portion of the IL-6 molecule, but rather that multiple segments of the protein are required for each of the biologic activities that we tested. 
5	An interdisciplinary nutrition assessment and intervention protocol for children with disabilities. Because of the multifactorial nature of the nutrition problems associated with developmental disabilities, a well-organized, interdisciplinary effort is necessary to deal with such problems. A team composed of professional and support staff, the client, and the family needs to be involved in an integrated approach to service. The team members share their knowledge and expertise in developing an individual program plan to meet identified needs. This article describes the development and implementation of a prototype for interdisciplinary nutritional evaluation and intervention in an outpatient setting. In 1987, a Regional Nutrition and Feeding Diagnosis and Evaluation Clinic was established through a contractual agreement between the University of Georgia University Affiliated Program and St. Mary's Hospital in Athens, GA. The purposes of the clinic are twofold: to offer direct services to developmentally disabled infants and children who require outpatient services and to provide a unique community-based interdisciplinary training experience for graduate students in nutrition and other health disciplines. The interdisciplinary treatment protocol is based on current knowledge in the treatment of developmental disabilities. 
5	Granulomatous orchitis. Review of 15 cases. Granulomatous orchitis is a rare lesion of the testis which can clinically simulate malignancy. The clinical, radiological and pathological features of 15 patients are presented and discussed. 
5	Fatal sepsis following intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration for bladder cancer. Intravesical administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin has been shown to be highly effective treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Complications from bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy are usually minor but serious and even fatal reactions can occur. Five recent cases illustrate the gravity of bacillus Calmette-Guerin sepsis. One man with severe debility and the organic brain syndrome died acutely with a fever of 40 C. Two men had frank sepsis that progressed to multiorgan failure and death. Sepsis progressed despite the use of isoniazid, rifampin and streptomycin. Two men who had equally progressive sepsis with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin survived with the use of cycloserine for the first 72 hours of treatment. Triple antituberculous antibiotics, including cycloserine, may be lifesaving. Sepsis resulted from intravenous absorption through inflamed or disrupted urothelium. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment should not be administered in the presence of severe cystitis or after grossly traumatic catheterization. 
3	Characterization of descending inhibition and facilitation from the nuclei reticularis gigantocellularis and gigantocellularis pars alpha in the rat. Descending influences on the spinal nociceptive tail-flick (TF) reflex produced by focal electrical stimulation and glutamate microinjection in the nuclei reticularis gigantocellularis (NGC) and gigantocellularis pars alpha (NGC alpha) were examined and characterized in rats lightly anesthetized with pentobarbital. Both inhibition and facilitation of the TF reflex were produced by electrical stimulation at identical sites in the NGC/NGC alpha; glutamate microinjection only inhibited the TF reflex. The chronaxie of stimulation for inhibition of the TF reflex was 169 +/- 28 microseconds. Inhibition of the TF reflex by stimulation was produced throughout the NGC and NGC alpha; intensities of stimulation for inhibition were least in the ventral NGC and in the NGC alpha. At threshold intensities of stimulation, inhibition of the TF reflex did not outlast the period of stimulation. Facilitation of the TF reflex was produced at many of the same sites at which stimulation inhibited the TF reflex, but always at lesser intensities of stimulation (mean, 10 microA vs. 43 microA for inhibition, n = 25). Stimulation in the NGC/NGC alpha at threshold intensities for facilitation or inhibition of the TF reflex did not significantly affect blood pressure. Strength-duration characterization of electrical stimulation and microinjection of glutamate into identical sites in the NGC and NGC alpha suggest that descending inhibition of the TF reflex results from activation of cell bodies in the NGC and NGC alpha. 
3	Homocystinuria presenting as central retinal artery occlusion and longstanding thromboembolic disease. A case of central retinal artery occlusion in a patient with a 10-year history of unexplained thromboembolic disease due to a secondary hypercoagulable state is presented. Ophthalmological examination led to the final diagnosis. 
5	Beneficial effects of x-irradiation on recovery of lesioned mammalian central nervous tissue. We examined the potential of x-irradiation, at clinical dose levels, to manipulate the cellular constituents and thereby change the consequences of transection injury to adult mammalian central nervous tissue (rat olfactory bulb). Irradiation resulted in reduction or elimination of reactive astrocytes at the site of incision provided that it was delivered within a defined time window postinjury. Under conditions optimal for the elimination of gliosis (15-18 days postinjury), irradiation of severed olfactory bulbs averted some of the degenerative consequences of lesion. We observed that irradiation was accompanied by prevention of tissue degeneration around the site of lesion, structural healing with maintenance of the typical cell lamination, and rescue of some axotomized mitral cells (principal bulb neurons). Thus radiation resulted in partial preservation of normal tissue morphology. It is postulated that intrusive cell populations are generated in response to injury and reactive astrocytes are one such group. Our results suggest that selective elimination of these cells by irradiation enabled some of the regenerative processes that are necessary for full recovery to maintain their courses. The cellular targets of these cells, their modes of intervention in recovery, and the potential role of irradiation as a therapeutic modality for injured central nervous system are discussed. 
1	Embryonal carcinoma of the testis presenting as a left heart mass. A 31-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug abuse and tooth abscess was admitted for evaluation of possible infective endocarditis. Echocardiography showed that he had a left atrial mass. The mass removed from the left atrium had the same histology as the primary embryonal carcinoma discovered in the right testicle during hospitalization. The patient made a smooth recovery after surgical intervention and chemotherapy. This is believed to be the first reported case of metastasis from embryonal carcinoma of the testis to the left side of the heart that was successfully removed at surgery. 
3	Understanding dizziness. How to decipher this nonspecific symptom. Dizziness is a common but often nonspecific symptom. Through careful history taking and physical examination, primary care physicians can usually determine the type of sensation (vertigo or light-headedness) and its source. Although most causes of dizziness are benign, disorders of the central nervous system tend to be ominous and require immediate referral to a specialist. 
5	Treatment of craniomaxillofacial fibrous dysplasia: how early and how extensive? Twenty-eight craniomaxillofacial fibrous dysplasia patients were treated as early as the symptoms occurred. The principles of surgical treatment were based on the zones of involvement: total excision of dysplastic bone of fronto-orbital, zygoma, and upper maxillary origin (zone 1) and bone reconstruction primarily; conservative excision on hair-bearing skull (zone 2), central cranial base (zone 3), and tooth-bearing bones (zone 4); and optic canal decompression on patients with orbital dysplasia and decreasing visual acuity. Patients were followed for 1 to 11 years (average 5.3 years). No recurrence or invasion of the fibrous dysplasia into the grafted bone was seen. One patient had orthognathic maxillary osteotomy on the reconstructed maxilla 6 years after initial reconstruction. Five of 19 patients with alveolar dysplasia had a recurrence and were reshaped. One patient had mandibular sagittal osteotomies to set back the prognathic, fibrous dysplasic mandible after three attempts at conservative shaving. Another patient with mandibular fibrous dysplasia had recurrence with pain and a hemimandibulectomy with successful immediate free vascularized iliac bone graft reconstruction. 
4	Genetic determination of cytomegalovirus-induced and age-related cardiopathy in inbred mice. Characterization of infiltrating cells. Carditis developed 7 days after the administration of murine cytomegalovirus to neonatal, young adult or aged mice of varying sensitivity to lethal infection with this virus. The inflammation persisted for up to 80 days, but infected myocardial cells were rare and were not seen after day 10. The inflammatory cells comprised macrophages (up to 30%) and T cells (up to 80%), with a high ratio of Lyt2+ to L3T4+ cells throughout. Although the H-2 genotype affects murine cytomegalovirus replication at the level of individual cells, and hence resistance to lethal infection, it did not determine resistance to cardiopathy per se. However BALB/c, BALB.B, and BALB.K mice developed persistent myocarditis regardless of age at infection, and age-related cardiopathy was frequent and severe in infected and uninfected mice. B10 and B10.BR mice also developed myocarditis after neonatal infection, but inflammation resolved rapidly after adult infection and age-related cardiopathy was correspondingly mild. C3H mice exhibited minimal carditis after neonatal or adult infection. However neonatal infection appears to accelerate age-related cardiopathy, which is severe in retired breeders of this strain. 
5	mtDNA depletion with variable tissue expression: a novel genetic abnormality in mitochondrial diseases. We studied two related infants with a fatal mitochondrial disease, affecting muscle in one and liver in the other. Quantitative analysis revealed a severe depletion of mtDNA in affected tissues. This genetic abnormality was also observed in muscle of an unrelated infant with myopathy and in muscle and kidney of a fourth child with myopathy and nephropathy. Biochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization showed that the depletion of mtDNA in muscle fibers was correlated with a respiratory chain defect and with lack of mitochondrially translated proteins. Although the differential tissue involvement in these infants suggests mtDNA heteroplasmy, sequence analysis of mtDNA replication origins did not reveal any abnormality that could account for the low copy number. 
5	Genetic control of the immune response in mice to Leishmania mexicana surface protease. Congenic mouse strains were tested in the lymphocyte proliferation assay for their response to the purified surface protease of Leishmania mexicana (gp63). The data obtained allow us to distinguish three different patterns of response, influenced both by H-2 (class II) and non-H-2 genes. Mice of the C57BL/10 (B10) background carrying H-2 haplotypes b,q, and r were found to be high responders; those carrying H-2 haplotypes d, j, v, and z were low responders; and those with H-2a, H-2f, H-2k, H-2p, and H-2u haplotypes were intermediate responders. Studies with H-2 recombinant strains indicated that the high responsiveness on the B10 background was determined by the Ab allele and the low responsiveness influenced by the Ad allele. Other genes besides H-2 appear to have a role in the immune response as shown by the fact that some strains with BALB, DBA, or C3H background differed in their pattern of responsiveness from B10 background strains carrying the corresponding H-2 haplotypes. By using recombinant protein, the influence of the leishmanial surface lipophosphoglycan that might co-purify with gp63, on the MHC restriction of the response to gp63 was excluded. The immune response to gp63 did not correlate with susceptibility of mouse strains to cutaneous infection with L. mexicana promastigotes. 
5	Giardia lamblia infestation reveals underlying Whipple's disease in a patient with longstanding constipation. Whipple's disease is an uncommon disorder, generally associated with gastrointestinal symptoms; of these, diarrhea is a common feature. We report a case of Whipple's disease associated with chronic constipation which was not diagnosed until after Giardia lamblia infestation had caused diarrhea. To the best of our knowledge this association has not previously been reported. The clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, and manometric aspects are described and discussed. 
2	Reoperation for failed gastric bypass procedures for obesity. Reoperation is worthwhile when there is an obvious defect in the gastric reduction operation that has failed to control weight. Reoperation occasionally is necessary to correct a complication of gastric bypass. Vertical banded gastroplasty is the operation of choice for reoperations, as it provides weight control while eliminating the problems of bypass. Conversion of a horizontal to a vertical pouch is safe but requires careful attention to the technique to avoid injury to the other organs in the area and preservation of blood supply to the stomach. The gastrogastrostomy across the old horizontal staple line in the vertical pouch can be constructed in a way that will minimize the risk of obstruction. Vertical banded gastroplasty is now the only operation in use at UIHC for the treatment of obesity and is used not only as the primary operation but in all reoperations. Bypass of the stomach and duodenum is not necessary for weight control and adds some risk of malabsorption and duodenal and stomal ulcer plus a lifetime of inaccessibility of the excluded areas for diagnostic and therapeutic measures. 
4	Long-term evaluation of indobufen in peripheral vascular disease. Indobufen--an inhibitor of platelets aggregation--has been used in 306 patients with intermittent claudication due to peripheral vascular disease. Patients were treated and followed up for one year. One patient of every 3 treated with indobufen was treated with ASA, and a control group of patients receiving no treatment was also followed up. The authors studied by means of a treadmill exercise test the pain-free walking distance (PFWD), the global walking distance (GWD), and the recovery time after exercise. The treatment period was completed by 290 patients: 204 claudicants, 51 claudicants with diabetes, and 35 with a short PFWD and GWD (greater than 150 m). Indobufen was more effective than ASA in improving the PFWD and GWD in all groups. There were also fewer side effects with indobufen, and cardiac morbidity and mortality was also reduced. In conclusion indobufen showed its activity and safety in chronic treatment of patients with peripheral disease, and we suggest that it may be used for long periods without side effects. 
1	HBV-DNA sequences in tumor and nontumor tissue in a patient with the fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular carcinoma. One patient with the fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular carcinoma was found to be seropositive for HBsAg and anti-HBe. DNA from tumor and nontumor areas of the liver was examined by molecular hybridization for hepatitis B virus DNA sequences. Undigested DNA from the tumor gave a high-molecular-weight smear, and restriction-enzyme analysis indicated a single instance of integration. Nontumor liver tissue was analyzed from three separate areas. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in two of these; restriction-enzyme digestion suggested they contained different sites of viral integration. As with the typical hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma, analysis of hepatitis B virus DNA from nontumorous liver yielded a different pattern of high-molecular-weight bands, indicating that the virus genome had integrated at different chromosomal locations than that seen in the tumor. The finding of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA, especially in tumorous but also in nontumorous liver, would be consistent with an oncogenic role for hepatitis B virus in certain instances of fibrolamellar tumors and in the more typical hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma. 
1	The survivors of childhood solid tumors. With the improvement in cancer therapy in recent years, the number of cancer survivors is rapidly increasing. Potential late medical and psychosocial sequelae of cancer therapy are reviewed. A practical guide for the primary health care giver is provided. 
5	Magnetic resonance imaging of congenital heart disease in the pediatric patient. Current state-of-the-art MR imaging offers a high resolution evaluation of cardiac anatomy in the child with congenital heart disease. Although echocardiography remains the standard initial evaluation modality, MR imaging plays a key role in supplementing this information in the pediatric thorax. Although applications for this modality continue to be defined, some indications have become clear. The future of MR imaging promises better spatial resolution, faster image acquisition times, and in vivo spectroscopic capabilities. 
2	Cluster of fulminant hepatitis B in crack users. Fulminant hepatitis occurs in only 1% of acute hepatitis B patients, requiring hospitalization, but coinfection with delta virus increases the incidence. Hepatitis B and D infection are commonly associated with intravenous drug abuse, but there have been no previous reports of an association with nonparenteral cocaine. Crack use, via sexual promiscuity, is associated with an increased risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection, but has never been associated with viral hepatitis. We report four fatal cases of fulminant hepatitis B including, one with delta virus coinfection and one with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, in young, sexually active, heterosexual crack users. These patients denied a history of intravenous drug abuse. Our patients probably contracted hepatitis B infection via heterosexual contact. Chronic cocaine exposure may or may not have contributed to the fulminant outcome. Crack users may be at increased risk of developing hepatitis B and D infection. Epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate their risk of viral hepatitis and the effect of cocaine on its outcome. 
5	Cranial base hemorrhage. A technique for controlling the uncontrollable. In the management of trauma, control of life-threatening hemorrhage must be accomplished expeditiously if morbidity is to be decreased and mortality prevented. Hemorrhage from the inaccessible cranial base, especially when transected vessel stumps are not available for direct control, can be the most demanding, life-threatening, surgical emergency. We present our experience in utilizing an autologous bone grafting technique to successfully control severe hemorrhage from the base of the skull. In our review of the literature to date, we have been unable to ascertain whether this modality has been previously used. 
1	Critical analysis of neoadjuvant therapy for Stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer [corrected] [published erratum appears in Am Rev Respir Dis 1991 Jun;143(6):1473] Lung cancer is the major cause of cancer mortality. Locally advanced (Stage III) disease constitutes 30 to 40% of the entire group of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Surgical resection offers the best opportunity for cure, but resection of disease is possible in only a minority of patients with Stage IIIa disease. Even among patients who have "successful" surgery systemic relapse is common, and the 5-yr survival after complete resection is only 30%. Preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy is under investigation in an attempt to improve the bleak outcome of patients with Stage IIIa NSCLC. Preliminary trials have shown that this approach is feasible: neoadjuvant treatment can be administered with moderate toxicity and in most cases without compromising the possibility for surgical resection. In some instances, neoadjuvant treatment has produced pathologic complete responses, and in others it has decreased tumor bulk so that inoperable patients became surgical candidates. Whether this latter phenomenon has an impact on survival is unknown. Therefore, the role of neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced lung cancer will not be known until properly designed randomized trials are conducted. 
5	Results of coronary surgery after failed elective coronary angioplasty in patients with prior coronary surgery The results of coronary artery bypass surgery after failed elective coronary angioplasty in patients who have undergone prior coronary surgery are unknown. Coronary angioplasty may be performed to relieve angina after surgery either to the native coronary vessels or to grafts. Failure of attempted coronary angioplasty may mandate repeat coronary surgery, often in the setting of acute ischemia. From 1980 to 1989, 1,263 patients with prior coronary bypass surgery underwent angioplasty; of these patients, 46 (3.6%) underwent reoperation for failed angioplasty during the same hospital stay. Of the 46 patients who underwent reoperation, 33 had and 13 did not have acute ischemia. In the group with ischemia, 3 patients (9.1%) died and 14 (42.4%) died or had a Q wave myocardial infarction in the hospital compared with no deaths (p = NS) and no deaths or Q wave myocardial infarction (p = 0.005) in the group without ischemia. At 3 years, the actuarial survival rate was 88 +/- 6% in the group with ischemia, whereas there were no deaths in the group without ischemia (p = NS), and freedom from death or myocardial infarction was 51 +/- 10% in the group with ischemia, versus no events in the group without ischemia (p = 0.006). In most patients with prior coronary bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty was performed without the need for repeat coronary bypass surgery. Should coronary angioplasty fail, reoperation in patients without acute ischemia can be performed with overall patient survival comparable to that of elective reoperative coronary bypass without coronary angioplasty. 
3	Activation of coagulation in acute cardioembolic stroke. The hematologic disorders in patients with acute cardioembolic stroke are not fully understood, and no reliable measures are available to identify patients at high risk for recurrent embolism. We analyzed coagulation and fibrinolytic functions in 22 patients with cardiogenic cerebral embolism less than or equal to 24 hours after onset and in 25 age-matched controls. The levels of antithrombin III, protein C, and alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor were significantly lower in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.001, 0.02, and 0.05, respectively). In contrast, the plasma concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin III complex and crosslinked D-dimer were markedly higher in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.01 and 0.001, respectively). At the time of admission, the plasma concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin III complex and crosslinked D-dimer in the eight patients at high risk for recurrent embolization (one with prodromal embolism, three with intracardiac thrombi, and four with recurrent embolization) were 2.8 and 3.5 times, respectively, higher than those in the 14 patients without recurrence or thrombus formation. The lowest concentration of crosslinked D-dimer in the eight patients at high risk for recurrent embolization was 600 ng/ml on admission. Our results suggest that patients with acute cardioembolic stroke have various degrees of consumption coagulopathy and that the plasma concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin III complex and crosslinked D-dimer can be useful indicators of those who are prone to recurrent embolization during this stage. 
5	Cortical tremor: a variant of cortical reflex myoclonus. Two patients with action tremor that was thought to originate in the cerebral cortex showed fine shivering-like finger twitching provoked mainly by action and posture. Surface EMG showed relatively rhythmic discharge at a rate of about 9 Hz, which resembled essential tremor. However, electrophysiologic studies revealed giant somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with enhanced long-loop reflex and premovement cortical spike by the jerk-locked averaging method. Treatment with beta-blocker showed no effect, but anticonvulsants such as clonazepam, valproate, and primidone were effective to suppress the tremor and the amplitude of SEPs. We call this involuntary movement "cortical tremor," which is in fact a variant of cortical reflex myoclonus. 
5	How stressful is retirement? Findings from the Normative Aging Study. The stressfulness of retirement both as a transitional event experienced during the past year and as a life stage was investigated. Transitional stress was assessed using a life events approach, and stage stress using a "hassles" approach. Respondents were 1,516 male participants in the Normative Aging Study, 45% of whom were retired. Among those retiring in the past year, respondents' own and spouse's retirement were rated the least stressful from a list of 31 possible events. Only 30% found retirement stressful. Retirement hassles were also less frequently reported and were rated less stressful than the work hassles of men still in the labor force. The only consistent predictors of both transitional and stage retirement stress were poor health and family finances; personality did not predict retirement stress. 
2	The efficacy of palliative and definitive percutaneous versus surgical drainage of pancreatic abscesses and pseudocysts: a prospective study of 85 patients. We compared the efficacy of percutaneous to surgical drainage in a prospective study in 85 patients with pancreatic abscesses and pseudocysts. Percutaneous drainage of pancreatic abscesses in 18 patients cured three and palliated 12 who were eventually cured by elective surgical ablation; three patients died. This compares well to our 15 surgical patients, of whom four were cured by surgery alone and six were palliated. All were subsequently cured by additional computerized tomography-guided or ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage and medical management or surgery. Five of the 15 died. Percutaneous drainage cured 11 of 14 infected pseudocysts and palliated two, which were subsequently cured by surgery; one was palliated but the patient was lost to follow-up. Surgical drainage cured six of 12 infected pseudocysts and palliated the other six, of which four were cured by further surgery and the other two were cured by secondary percutaneous drainage. Nine of 12 noninfected pseudocysts were cured by percutaneous aspiration, and two were palliated and later cured. In one patient, disease progressed, and he was ultimately lost to follow-up. Thirteen of 14 noninfected pseudocysts were cured by surgical drainage. The other patient died of pulmonary embolus. In patients treated by percutaneous techniques, there were four major complications. Our study established distinct advantages of percutaneous drainage under computerized tomographic and ultrasonic guidance: (1) the procedures can be carried out under ultrasonic guidance in an intensive care unit on critically ill patients, (2) the technique proved highly effective for initial palliation, with defervescence and stabilization occurring in most critically ill patients within 48 hours, (3) findings from fine needle aspiration provided valuable information as to microorganisms and antibiotic sensitivities and differed in 29 of 85 patients from those of concomitant blood cultures, and (4) definitive eradication of the process (surgical ablation of residual necrotic material) can be elected after the patient's clinical condition stabilizes. 
1	CA72-4: a new tumour marker for gastric cancer. To date, tumour markers for gastric cancer have proved unreliable. In this study the value of a new serum marker, CA72-4, was compared with the serum activities of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA19-9 in a consecutive series of patients with gastric cancer. The results show that the CA72-4 assay is significantly better at separating stage I and II disease from normal controls (P less than 0.01) than CEA (n.s.) or CA19-9 (n.s.). CA72-4 also gave better differentiation between patients with positive and negative nodes (P less than 0.01) and between those who were serosa positive and negative (P less than 0.01). CEA differentiated between patients with positive and negative nodes (P less than 0.05) but CA19-9 could not. CA19-9 and CEA could not discriminate between patients who were serosa positive and negative. In this study, at a specificity of 95 per cent, the sensitivities of CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 were 0.25, 0.41 and 0.94 respectively. These preliminary findings indicate that CA72-4 is a reliable tumour marker of disease stage and activity in gastric cancer. Further longitudinal studies are required for full evaluation of its clinical utility. 
4	Relation of cardiac output at rest and during exercise to age in essential hypertension. It has been suggested that the decline of cardiac output with age is due to increased prevalence of disease, particularly occult coronary artery disease. Therefore, the relation of cardiac output (direct oxygen Fick method) to age was analyzed in 110 sixteen- to 64-year-old men with World Health Organization stage I or II essential hypertension at the time of the hemodynamic study, who were alive and free of cardiovascular complications 7 years later. At supine and seated rest, during upright bicycle exercise at 50 W and and at peak work load, cardiac output was inversely (p less than 0.01) related to age. These relations were independent of weight and mean intraarterial pressure. Stroke volume decreased with advancing age at supine rest, but not at rest and during exercise in the seated position. Heart rate was not affected by age in the supine position, but was slower in older patients during upright rest and at peak exercise. In conclusion, in patients with essential hypertension who remained free of cardiovascular complications for 7 years, cardiac output was independently and inversely related to age at various levels of activity. These findings suggest that occult cardiovascular disease does not explain the decline in cardiac output with age in patients with essential hypertension. 
5	Effects of the differentiating agent hexamethylene bisacetamide on normal and myelodysplastic hematopoietic progenitors. Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA; NSC 95580) is a potent polar-planar differentiating agent of leukemia and solid tumor cell lines in vitro at clinically achievable concentrations. HMBA is currently being studied in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. Previous phase I trials have demonstrated that HMBA produces hematologic toxicity in morphologically normal bone marrows of patients with solid tumors. Because of concern that HMBA may produce more severe myelotoxicity in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome since these patients have limited hematopoietic reserves, we studied the effects of HMBA on myelodysplastic and normal hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. HMBA concentrations that are optimal for differentiation in vitro (2 to 5 mmol/L) and HMBA concentrations that are being achieved in clinical trials (1 to 2 mmol/L) inhibited the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and erythroid burst-forming units from all 15 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and all 4 normal subjects, HMBA did not induce proliferation of myelodysplastic or normal progenitors at any concentration; rather, it produced nearly identical inhibition of normal and myelodysplastic hematopoietic progenitors. HMBA also produced quantitatively similar inhibition of clonogenic leukemic growth of two myeloid leukemia cell lines. For a differentiating agent to be effective, it will likely have to either produce both differentiation and proliferation of abnormal hematopoietic progenitors or show selective inhibitory effects on abnormal as compared with normal progenitors. Although the mechanisms responsible for the antiproliferative effects of HMBA cannot be determined from this study, similar inhibitory effects of HMBA on normal and abnormal hematopoietic progenitors suggest that HMBA may be of limited utility in producing and sustaining elevations of peripheral blood cell counts in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. 
5	Therapy for acute infectious diarrhea in children. This article reviews current recommendations of therapy with antidiarrheal compounds and antimicrobial agents for acute infectious diarrhea in children. In most infants and children with acute infectious diarrhea, treatment with antidiarrheal compounds is not indicated. Many of these compounds interfere with identification of enteropathogens in stool specimens, and the antimotility class has an overdose potential. Antimicrobial therapy is given to reduce symptoms and to prevent the spread of infection by decreasing fecal shedding of organisms. Although effective therapy is not available for patients with enteric viruses, Cryptosporidium, and Microsporidium, therapy is useful for children with amebiasis, antimicrobial-associated colitis, cholera, giardiasis, various forms of Escherichia coli diarrhea and Salmonella disease, isosporiasis, shigellosis, and strongyloidiasis. For several other conditions, antimicrobial therapy is of questionable benefit (infection with Campylobacter jejuni or Yersinia enterocolitica, intestinal salmonellosis and enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection). Compounds such as the fluoroquinolones, which are effective in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in adults, are not approved for use in children because of potential side effects. Many bacterial, viral, and parasitic organisms cause acute infectious diarrhea; appropriate antimicrobial therapy requires the accurate, rapid identification of the offending enteropathogen. In children with an underlying illness such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, manifestations may be prolonged, severe, and recurrent despite appropriate therapy. 
4	Essential hypertension, metabolic disorders, and insulin resistance. Essential hypertension is frequently associated with several metabolic abnormalities, of which obesity, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia are the most common. This report discusses the epidemiologic evidence for the coexistence of these risk factors and questions why hyperinsulinemia and essential hypertension cosegregate. The euglycemic insulin clamp and the insulin suppression test are documented with respect to the physiologic functions of insulin, and the mechanisms of insulin resistance in essential hypertension are discussed. Evidence to suggest that insulin resistance is a marker for an "atherogenic syndrome" is reviewed. It is concluded that all the hemodynamic and metabolic disorders of essential hypertension and insulin resistance are closely related. The clinical approach to the patient with any of the abnormalities in question should take into consideration the whole cluster, with therapy aimed at ameliorating the entire hemodynamic-metabolic profile. 
1	Survival with regional and distant metastases from cutaneous malignant melanoma. The clinical course of 312 consecutive patients after initial presentation with metastatic melanoma, 165 of whom presented with regional metastases at cutaneous or subcutaneous, or both, nodal sites and 147 with metastases at distant sites, was reviewed. The five year survival rate for regional metastases was 43.4 per cent compared with a five year survival rate for distant metastases of 4.9 per cent (p less than 0.0001). Favorable prognostic variables for survival from first regional metastases included primary melanoma sites on the extremities compared with the head, neck and trunk (p = 0.043) and a disease-free interval of more than one year from primary surgical treatment to regional metastases (p = 0.0058). Favorable prognostic variables for survival from the first distant metastasis included a disease-free interval of more than one year from primary surgical treatment to distant metastases (p = 0.0092), the type of resection of metastatic disease (p = 0.00027) and the addition of systemic immunotherapy (p = 0.0011). Forty-nine patients with totally resectable distant metastases had a five year survival rate from the treatment of the initial metastasis of 13.1 per cent, whereas 33 patients having palliative resections had a five year survival rate of 7.5 per cent. All 165 patients who did not have resection for distant metastases died within five years. The results of our experience support therapeutic efforts to ablate both regional and distant metastases of malignant melanoma when feasible. 
5	Atypical presentations of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients receiving inhaled pentamidine prophylaxis. Inhaled pentamidine is used commonly to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. Case reports indicate that PCP can recur in patients who receive inhaled pentamidine and that clinical features may be atypical. To determine the magnitude of this problem, we reviewed retrospectively the medical records of patients with proven PCP during a 30-month period at two hospitals. Four (31 percent) of 13 patients with previous PCP who received inhaled pentamidine prophylaxis had recurrent P carinii infection, including one patient with widely metastatic extrapulmonary disease. Chest roentgenographic findings included cavities, pneumothoraces, bilateral and upper lobe interstitial infiltrates, and pleural effusion. False-negative bronchoalveolar lavage and induced sputum examinations were frequent. We conclude that recurrent PCP in patients maintained on a regimen of inhaled pentamidine prophylaxis occurs frequently, causes chest roentgenographic abnormalities other than interstitial infiltrates, and may be difficult to diagnose. Clinicians who choose to use this effective and convenient mode of prophylaxis should be aware of the problems attendant to its use. 
5	Long-term follow-up in toxic solitary autonomous thyroid nodules treated with radioactive iodine The long-term effects of radioiodine treatment on thyroid function in patients with a toxic solitary autonomous thyroid nodule were evaluated. Fifty-two patients received a therapeutic dose of 20 mCi of iodine-131 (131I). Duration of follow-up was 10 +/- 4 yr. Follow-up data included a biochemical evaluation of thyroid function. The failure rate (recurrent hyperthyroidism) was 2%. The incidence of hypothyroidism was 6% and was not related to the dose per gram of nodular tissue. Oral administration of 20 mCi of radioiodine is a simple and highly effective method for the treatment of patients with a toxic autonomous thyroid nodule. The risk of development of hypothyroidism is low if extranodular uptake of 131I is prevented. This can be achieved by not treating euthyroid patients, by no longer using injections of exogenous thyroid stimulating hormone in the diagnostic work-up of the patients and by always performing radioiodine imaging shortly before treatment. 
2	Gallstone dissolution with methyl tert-butyl ether in 120 patients--efficacy and safety. Of 612 patients with cholesterol gallbladder stones, 120 were eligible for percutaneous transhepatic litholysis with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Puncture of the gallbladder was successful in 117/120 (97.5%). In 113/117 (96.6%) the stones dissolved. With solitary stones, treatment lasted for an average of 4 hr, with multiple stones 10 hr. Mean hospitalization was 3.6 days. In 3/117 (2.6%) patients a bile leakage developed; 33% reported mild complaints. After the end of treatment 34% had some residue in the gallbladder; two of these patients developed recurrent stones. MTBE is exhaled, is distributed in fatty tissue, and is excreted renally together with its metabolite tert-butanol. Methanol was found only in traces. Gallbladder histology of six patients showed chronic cholecystitis. Since these findings were independent of treatment time and the interval between treatment end and operation, they are most consistent with stone-related changes rather than caused by MTBE. 
1	Amplification by the polymerase chain reaction of hypervariable regions of the human genome for evaluation of chimerism after bone marrow transplantation. We combined the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotide hybridization as a novel and sensitive technique to evaluate posttransplant chimerism. Specific oligonucleotides for hybridization were synthesized homologous to tandemly repetitive core sequences of regions with a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs). Polymorphisms at such loci result from allelic differences in the number of repeats. Primers flanking the repeat region of each of the corresponding VNTRs were used for amplification. Recipient and donor pretransplant DNA and recipient posttransplant DNA were amplified. The resultant fragments were analyzed after gel electrophoresis either by hybridization in-gel or after Southern transfer. To confirm our findings, we also performed standard assays of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Evaluation of 13 selected cases indicated mixed chimerism (4), complete chimerism (5), recurrence of leukemia (2), and endogenous repopulation of hematopoiesis (2) after marrow transplantation. Sensitivity of the method was determined by mixing various proportions of recipient and donor DNA; the limit of detection of the minor component in a mixture was 0.1%. PCR data correlated with RFLP data in all cases except two in which PCR proved more sensitive than RFLP. PCR amplification of VNTRs combined with oligonucleotide hybridization is a novel technique for documenting posttransplant chimerism and has advantages over RFLP analysis: high sensitivity, use of small amounts of DNA (250 ng), ease of preparation of DNA, elimination of need for restriction enzymes, and the ability to complete studies in 2 days. 
1	Combined laminoplasty and posterolateral fusion for spinal canal surgery in children and adolescents. Spinal deformities, especially kyphosis and instability, after laminectomy for tumors and other diseases, are major clinical problems. Since 1981, combined laminoplasty and posterolateral fusion for the prevention of postlaminectomy spinal deformities was performed on eight male and two female patients aged two to 26 years (average, 13.9 years). The follow-up period was from six months to seven years and three months (average, three years and five months). Two patients died six and ten months postoperatively because of brain metastases (astrocytoma) and lung metastases (neuroblastoma), respectively. Good alignment with no instability of the cervical or thoracic spine was obtained for all patients, including the two who died. Laminoplasty combined with posterolateral fusion was found to be very effective in preventing the development of spinal deformities after spinal canal surgery for spinal cord tumors or other diseases in children and adolescents. 
2	Biliary sludge: a critical update. Biliary sludge has been for many years a poorly defined entity, usually with low amplitude, nonshadowing echoes within the most dependent part of the gallbladder, which shift under the influence of postural changes. From a sonographic point of view, the detection of sludge implies the coexistence of small-sized, solid components and of a gel-like embedding material. The chemical nature of biliary sludge has recently been recognized to be predominantly composed of a coaggregate of cholesterol monohydrate crystals and liquid crystalline droplets, and in some cases, such as obstructive jaundice or symptomatic liver diseases, by bilirubin granules, all embedded in a gel matrix of mucous glycoproteins. From a pathogenic point of view, biliary sludge is often associated with biliary stasis, or with conditions characterized by impaired gallbladder contraction, such as prolonged total parenteral nutrition, fasting, and pregnancy. Other causes include mucus hypersecretion, which may favor cholesterol nucleation and crystal growth, and bile infection. Sludge may be an intermediate step in the formation of different types of stones. From an epidemiological point of view, sludge is quite rare in the asymptomatic, free-living population, but may be common in selected series of symptomatic patients. From a clinical point of view, sludge often has a fluctuating course, including frequent disappearances and reappearances, suggesting that the early stages of gallstone formation are reversible. 
5	The management of chronic osteomyelitis. Chronic osteomyelitis of childhood is heterogeneous but it can be broadly classified into nonspecific or specific groups. Children with chronic osteomyelitis because of mycobacteria or mycoses are included within the specific group. The nonspecific group is the larger. It includes chronic osteomyelitis as a sequel to late acute osteomyelitis as well as chronic unifocal and chronic multifocal osteomyelitis. Whereas Staphylococcus aureus and other pyogenic organisms are commonly cultured from chronic lesions following late acute osteomyelitis, they are less frequently cultured from those with chronic unifocal osteomyelitis and rarely cultured from those with chronic multifocal osteomyelitis. The methods of treatment and the results also differ between these subgroups of nonspecific osteomyelitis. Lesions following late acute osteomyelitis are usually cured following surgery and antibiotics. Chronic unifocal osteomyelitis is usually cured with antibiotics only or with surgery and antibiotics. In contrast, surgery and antibiotics are largely ineffective in children with chronic multifocal osteomyelitis, but the disease appears to be self-limiting. 
3	Molecular genetic basis of maple syrup urine disease in a family with two defective alleles for branched chain acyltransferase and localization of the gene to human chromosome 1. Maple syrup urine disease in humans results from inherited defects in branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial multienzyme complex. A variety of genetic changes may produce this phenotype by affecting the function of any of the three complex-specific subunits. The varied clinical expression observed in patients may be partially explained by the defects in the involved subunit. Here we report localization of the gene for the branched chain acyltransferase component of the complex to human chromosome 1 and describe a proband who is a compound heterozygote at this locus. One allele, inherited from the father, produces transcripts with 124 nucleotides deleted from the coding region. The deletion is not found in the branched chain acyltransferase gene, implying that the deleted transcripts arise by an error in transcript processing. Cells from the patient's mother contain 50% of the normal amount of mRNA for the subunit, and the proband has inherited this nonexpressing allele from her. As a result, the proband produces no acyltransferase protein and therefore has greatly impaired complex activity. A phenotypically normal sibling is shown to be genetically similar to the mother having inherited the mother's nonexpressing allele and the father's normal allele. 
1	Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions with the inflatable expander: a critical appraisal. Breast reconstruction using inflatable expanders has become an established and preferred technique. Although our knowledge of the biomechanical changes occurring in expanded skin has increased greatly, little information is available regarding average aesthetic results achieved with this technique. In order to eliminate the bias of best case selection reports, this study of 60 consecutive patients undergoing skin-expansion breast reconstruction was undertaken. Results of the study demonstrated a significant frequency and diversity of complications. In particular, immediate breast reconstruction with skin expanders was identified as a high-risk procedure because of its association with skin necrosis and delayed wound healing. Although two procedures--insertion and replacement--had been anticipated, patients from both the Boston and New York groups required approximately three operations to complete the expansion process. Average aesthetic results, often characterized by problems of symmetry, ptosis, and contour, need to be recognized and improved. 
5	A deletion in the gene for glycoprotein IIb associated with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. The platelet fibrinogen receptor is composed of a complex of glycoproteins (GP) IIb and IIIa on the surface of platelets. Deficient function of this receptor prevents normal platelet aggregation, resulting in Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (GT). In this paper, we describe a black thrombasthenic patient who is either homozygous or hemizygous for a deletion within the GPIIb gene. Initial Western blot analysis of platelet proteins from this patient did not detect any GPIIb, but did detect small amounts of GPIIIa of normal mobility. Quantitation of vitronectin receptor (VNR) demonstrated that this thrombasthenic patient had approximately 1.5-2 times the number of these receptors per platelet compared with controls, a finding that has previously been noted in other thrombasthenic patients with defects in GPIIb. Genomic Southern blot studies demonstrated a deletion in the GPIIb gene of approximately 4.5 kilobasepairs (kb). Analysis of the isolated GPIIb gene demonstrated that the deletion begins between two Alu repeats within intron 1 and ends in intron 9. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies using platelet RNA and oligonucleotides directed to both the 5' and 3' ends of the GPIIb cDNA sequence easily detected GPIIb transcript, suggesting that the genomic deletion of exons 2-9 does not significantly decrease the level of the GPIIb mRNA. Sequence analysis of PCR-generated GPIIb cDNA showed that a cryptic AG splice acceptor sequence was being utilized, resulting in a transcript that contained a portion of introns 1 and 9, as well as having a deletion of exons 2-9. Unlike the GPIIb gene, the GPIIIa gene appears to be intact by Southern blot analysis. PCR studies using platelet RNA and oligonucleotides directed to the GPIIIa cDNA sequence demonstrated the presence of GPIIIa mRNA. In summary, the thrombasthenic state in this patient appears to be due to a GPIIb gene deletion resulting in an abnormal transcript and no detectable platelet GPIIb. Platelet GPIIIa levels were secondarily low presumably due to the known instability of GPIIIa in the absence of GPIIb. 
3	Phenytoin toxicity due to interaction with clobazam. The benzodiazepine antiepileptic drug clobazam can be added to existing AED treatment, usually without clinical toxicity. We report 3 patients in whom the addition of clobazam led within several weeks to clinically obvious phenytoin (PHT) intoxication in patients who had been taking maximum tolerable PHT doses. Symptoms and high PHT levels resolved with lowering the PHT dose. Clobazam and norclobazam levels were not elevated. This interaction is probably related to interference with hepatic degradation of PHT. Clinicians should be aware of possible PHT intoxication in patients starting clobazam. 
5	The effect of ambulation on recovery from postoperative ileus. To determine whether ambulation hastens recovery from ileus following laparotomy, 34 patients were studied, 10 of whom followed an ambulatory regimen beginning on postoperative day 1 (group A). The other 24 patients (group C) did not become ambulatory until postoperative day 4. All patients underwent placement of seromuscular bipolar recording electrodes on the Roux limb, if present, stomach, jejunum, and colon at laparotomy. Group A was recorded before and after ambulation so comparisons could be made to determine if ambulation had an acute effect on myoelectric activity. Group A preambulation and group C recordings were compared to judge whether there was an over-all effect of ambulation on myoelectric recovery. No effect on slow wave frequency or percentage of slow waves with associated spike potentials was noted acutely or overall in the stomach, colon, or jejunum in continuity with the duodenal pacemaker. Transient increases in phase II spike activity in patients having a Roux limb and their jejunum distal to the enteroenterostomy were noted on postoperative days 1 to 2, but these differences resolved by postoperative days 3 or 4. The data suggest that ambulation as a means to help resolve postoperative ileus and its accompanying cramps and bloating may be more perceived than real. 
1	Chemotherapy of brain metastases from lung carcinoma: a controlled randomized study. A controlled randomized study was carried out to evaluate the effects of chemotherapy in patients with brain metastases from lung carcinoma. One hundred patients were randomly divided into three groups at the time of diagnosis or after surgery for metastases. Group A received radiotherapy alone; Group B received radiotherapy and chloroethylnitrosoureas (methyl-CCNU, 100-120 mg/m2, or ACNU 80-100 mg/m2, every 6-8 weeks), and Group C received radiotherapy and a combination of chloroethylnitrosoureas and tegafur (300 mg/m2, daily). Of the 100 patients, 88 could be evaluated. The reduction rates of the tumors of the patients in whom tumor was not surgically removed or not totally removed were compared. Complete resolution of the tumor was noted in 29, 69, and 63% of the patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. Tumor regression of greater than or equal to 50% was seen in 36, 69, and 74% of the patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. The difference in the response rates of Groups A and C was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). Median survival after the start of treatment for brain metastasis was 27, 30.5, and 29 weeks in Groups A, B and C, respectively. There was 1 long-term survivor (more than 5 years) in Group A, 3 in Group B, and 1 in Group C. The main cause of death was deterioration attributable to the primary lesion or systemic metastasis, and no statistical difference was noted in survival time among the groups. 
2	Endoscopic transpapillary therapy for disrupted pancreatic duct and peripancreatic fluid collections. Eighteen patients with active pancreatic ductal disruptions, including 14 with definable fluid collections, were treated with transpapillary pancreatic duct drains or stents. Twelve of these patients had undergone a previous percutaneous or surgical pancreatic drainage procedure or both, and 8 had long-term drainage tubes in chronic fistulous tracts. Transpapillary catheters could be placed across the ductal disruption or directly into the fluid collection in each case, and 16 of 18 patients had resolution of the disrupted pancreatic duct. Twelve of 14 fluid collections resolved. Complications were limited to mild exacerbation of pancreatitis symptoms in 2 patients and 2 patients who developed subsequent stent occlusion leading to recurrent pancreatitis (1 patient) or recurrent duct blowout with pseudocyst (1 patient). Nine patients had variably significant ductal changes attributable to pancreatic duct stents. At a median follow-up of 16 months, 7 patients ultimately required surgery for ongoing pancreatic pain or residual/recurrent fluid collection. The transpapillary treatment of ongoing pancreatic ductal disruption with or without fluid collection has the potential to obviate surgery in some patients, change an urgent surgical procedure into an elective one, or even assist the surgeon in the performance of intraoperative pancreatography. Further study of this technique appears warranted and must be placed into the perspective of current therapies. 
5	Use of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms to predict future vulnerability to side effects. OBJECTIVE: Susceptibility to neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes varies widely, even within age and sex subgroups. Individual vulnerability to extrapyramidal syndromes has been assumed to explain this, but the utility of past history for predicting future occurrence of extrapyramidal syndromes has not been studied extensively. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether patients' previous histories of extrapyramidal syndromes predict future episodes of extrapyramidal syndromes and to compare the importance of this predictive factor with patient age, sex, neuroleptic dose, and anticholinergic dose as predictors of extrapyramidal syndromes. METHODS: The charts of 62 schizophrenic patients with multiple neuroleptic treatment episodes were reviewed. Extrapyramidal syndromes, neuroleptic drug doses, and anticholinergic drug doses during the first 21 days of each treatment episode were recorded. RESULTS: Previous extrapyramidal syndromes correctly predicted extrapyramidal syndromes in subsequent treatments for 84% of the patients. Variations in neuroleptic potency, neuroleptic dose, and anticholinergic dose partially explained incorrect predictions. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that patients with a history of extrapyramidal syndromes are at greater risk for future extrapyramidal syndromes. If confirmed, these results strongly support individual susceptibility as a major predictor of extrapyramidal syndromes and indicate that prophylaxis of extrapyramidal syndromes should be considered for patients who have previously suffered extrapyramidal syndromes from similarly prescribed neuroleptic therapy. 
4	Arteriographically determined occlusive disease within the hypogastric-cavernous bed in impotent patients following blunt perineal and pelvic trauma. To determine the presence, location and pattern of arterial occlusive disease within the hypogastric-cavernous arterial bed in impotent men following blunt perineal and pelvic trauma, we reviewed the selective internal pudendal arteriograms of 20 patients with a history of blunt perineal and 7 with blunt pelvic trauma who had immediate development of impotence. Arteriographic studies of 104 other impotent patients also were reviewed and compared. Patients with persistent impotence immediately after blunt pelvic and perineal trauma had significantly different patterns of arteriographically demonstrated occlusive disease within the distal hypogastric-cavernous arterial bed consistent with the site of the traumatic injury. Those who sustained blunt pelvic trauma and complained of immediate impotence revealed arterial occlusive lesions mainly in the internal pudendal, common penile, cavernous and dorsal arteries. The incidence of arterial lesions in the distal internal pudendal or common penile artery was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in patients with blunt pelvic trauma (92%) than in those with blunt perineal trauma (35%). Patients who sustained blunt perineal trauma and complained of immediate impotence demonstrated a more focal pattern of pathological arterial occlusion primarily in the cavernous and dorsal arteries. The incidence of a solitary arterial lesion in the cavernous artery without proximal disease was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in patients with blunt perineal trauma (48%) than in those with blunt pelvic trauma (8%). It is hypothesized that blunt trauma without immediate impotence may be a potential risk factor for later development of arterial vasculogenic impotence, and that unrecognized or seemingly innocuous trauma may be a factor in cases of idiopathic impotence. Patients without trauma and with vascular risk factors have a more diffuse pattern of arteriographically demonstrated arterial lesions. 
3	Central nervous system magnesium deficiency. The central nervous system concentration of magnesium (Mg++) appears to have a critical level below which neurologic dysfunction occurs. Observations presented suggest that the interchange of the Mg++ ion between the cerebrospinal fluid, extracellular fluid, and bone is more rapid and dynamic than is usually believed. This is especially so when the hypertrophied parathyroid gland is associated with significant skeletal depletion of Mg++ as judged by history rather than serum level. Magnesium, much like calcium, has a large presence in bone and has a negative feedback relationship with the parathyroid gland. A decline in central nervous system Mg++ may occur when the skeletal buffer system orchestrated largely by the parathyroid glands is activated by an increase in serum calcium. Observations in veterinary medicine and obstetrics suggest that the transfer of Mg++ from the extracellular fluid into bone during mineralization processes may be extensive. If the inhibition of the hypertrophied parathyroid gland is prolonged and the skeletal depletion of Mg++ extreme, serious neurologic symptoms, including seizures, coma, and death, may occur. Noise, excitement, and bodily contact appear to precipitate neurologic symptoms in Mg+(+)-deficient human subjects as it has been documented to occur in Mg+(+)-deficient experimental animals. The similarity of the acute central nervous system demyelinating syndromes with reactive central nervous system Mg++ deficiency is reviewed. 
1	Strategy for lymphadenectomy in lung cancer three centimeters or less in diameter We have surgically treated 221 patients with a primary lung cancer 3.0 cm or less in diameter. There were 8 patients with a tumor 1.0 cm or less in diameter (group A), 84 with a tumor 1.1 to 2.0 cm in diameter (group B), and 129 with a tumor 2.1 to 3.0 cm in diameter (group C). The incidence of N0, N1, and N2 disease was 100%, 0%, and 0%, respectively, for patients in group A; 83%, 5%, and 12% in group B; and 62%, 12%, and 25% in group C (N0 versus N2, p less than 0.01). For the 63 patients with regional lymph node involvement, "skipping" metastasis was present in 28.6%. The 5-year survival rate was 80% for group A, 74% for group B, and 51% for group C (group B versus group C, p less than 0.01). Of the 121 patients who underwent complete resection and were followed up for 5 years, 41% had recurrence, 8% with local recurrence and 33% with distant metastasis. Therefore, it is important to do as complete a resection as possible together with mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Efforts to detect systemic spread should be made at the time of preoperative evaluation, even when the lung tumor is small. 
2	Fulminant hepatitis B: induction by hepatitis B virus mutants defective in the precore region and incapable of encoding e antigen. Clones of hepatitis B virus were propagated from 10 cases of fulminant hepatitis B after amplification by polymerase chain reaction and their nucleotide sequences of the precore region were determined. All 113 clones from 9 cases had a point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 83 in the precore region, which converted codon 28 for tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG) and prohibited the synthesis and secretion of hepatitis B e antigen. Precore-region defects were not detected in any of 23 clones from the remaining 1 case. By contrast, precore-region defects were not found in any of 180 clones from 8 cases of acute hepatitis B without hepatic failure serving as controls. The source of infection was traceable in 3 cases. The same precore-region defect, along with the sequence identity of 435 nucleotides, was observed in clones from the case of a baby and his grandmother, who carried the virus and was implicated in the transmission, and also in clones from two pediatricians and the carrier patients they attended. These findings support the hypothesis that precore-defective mutants have stronger activity to induce fulminant hepatitis than nondefective viruses. 
4	Upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. A prospective study. We prospectively evaluated the prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in 30 consecutive patients with proved deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the upper extremity. Ten patients (seven male and three female; mean age, 43 years) had primary DVT, and 20 patients (14 male and six female; mean age, 52 years) had catheter-related DVT. Ventilation-perfusion lung scans were routinely performed at the time of hospital admission to all but one patient (one patient was critically ill, and he died four days after DVT diagnosis because of massive PE). Lung scan findings were normal in nine of ten patients with primary DVT, and they were indetermine in the remaining patient. By contrast, perfusion defects were considered highly suggestive of PE in four patients with catheter-related DVT; two patients had indeterminate lung scans, and 13 patients had normal scans. We conclude that PE is not a rare complication in upper extremity DVT, and that patients with catheter-related DVT seem to be at a higher risk. 
1	Spinal glioblastomas: report of seven cases and review of the literature. Intramedullary glioblastomas are uncommon tumors. They occur chiefly in the cervicothoracic segments, have a slight tendency to occur in the early decades of life, and have a short clinical history before diagnosis. We report seven cases and discuss the salient features of these tumors, particularly the pathological features and treatment, in light of the relevant literature. 
4	Pregnancy associated with Gorlin's syndrome. A pregnant woman with Gorlin's syndrome presented for the removal of malignant ovarian tumours. The main problem encountered by the anaesthetists was an unexpected increase in arterial blood pressure. This was most probably associated with surgical manipulation of the ovaries with an increase in prorenin/renin production. 
3	Keratin subsets in spindle cell sarcomas. Keratins are widespread but synovial sarcoma contains a distinctive keratin polypeptide pattern and desmoplakins. The presence of individual keratin polypeptides and desmoplakins was immunohistochemically studied in 25 spindle cell sarcomas of different types using acetone-fixed frozen sections. Results revealed that keratins 8 and 18 were present in a high number of tumors: 9 of 9 synovial sarcomas, 5 of 7 leiomyosarcomas, 5 of 5 malignant schwannomas, and 1 of 4 undifferentiated spindle cell sarcomas. In addition to keratins 8 and 18, the glandular component of synovial sarcoma showed prominent reactivity with antibodies to keratins 7 and 19. Also the glandular epithelial cells in synovial sarcoma showed desmoplakin immunoreactivity preferentially in a luminal distribution, but desmoplakin was absent in other spindle cell sarcomas. Furthermore keratin 13 was seen focally in 4 of 9 synovial sarcomas. In contrast, keratins 7, 13, and 19 were practically absent in leiomyosarcomas, malignant schwannomas, and undifferentiated spindle cell sarcomas. The widespread presence of keratins 8 and 18 in various spindle cell sarcomas may reflect aberrant keratin expression in mesenchymal cells, previously described in cultured transformed fibroblasts. The presence of keratins 7 and 19 and desmoplakin is highly associated with morphologically observable epithelial differentiation restricted to synovial sarcoma among spindle cell sarcomas. 
5	Poloxamer 407 as an intraperitoneal barrier material for the prevention of postsurgical adhesion formation and reformation in rodent models for reproductive surgery. Comtemporary adhesion-prevention regimens for infertility surgery emphasize the use of barrier materials to effect physical separation of injured surfaces before reperitonealization. Poloxamer 407 is a biocompatible polymer that displays reverse thermal gelation characteristics; that is, the material exists as a liquid at room temperature and as a solid at body temperature. These properties make it an ideal material for use in laparoscopic surgery. The antiadhesion properties of poloxamer 407 were evaluated in two models. In the first experiment, Golden hamsters were subjected to a standardized adhesion-producing lesion in the left uterine horn. Poloxamer solutions in concentrations ranging from 15-35% were applied to the injured horn. Location, thickness, and extent of adhesion formation were assessed 14 days later. Significant reduction in post-traumatic adhesion formation was observed following treatment with the 30-35% solutions. The second experiment was designed as a paradigm of the typical situation encountered in infertility surgery: prevention of adhesion reformation after lysis of established adhesions. New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to three laparotomies at 14-day intervals for placement of the adhesion-producing lesion, evaluation (prescore) and surgical lysis of induced adhesions, and subsequent evaluation of adhesion reformation (post-score). The effect of applying poloxamer 407 after adhesiotomy was compared with controls (no treatment). Adhesion reformation (post-score) was markedly reduced by poloxamer-407 treatment. Further trials of this material in the clinical setting are indicated. 
1	Iatrogenic saphenous neuralgia: successful therapy with neuroma resection. We report the case of a patient with saphenous neuralgia secondary to iatrogenic trauma resulting from bypass surgery in the femoral-popliteal region. Early symptoms of this condition were medial calf and ankle pain, with no findings of motor and reflex abnormalities. Exploration of the thigh 2 years later revealed a neuroma of the nerve in the distal dissection site, medial to the knee. Resection of the neuroma alleviated this condition. It is noted that saphenous neuropathy is seen as a spontaneous entrapment syndrome as well as a complication of orthopedic and vascular procedures performed on the medial area of the knee. Saphenous neuralgia is often not recognized by neurosurgeons. If the condition is intractable, it does respond to surgical therapy. 
4	Prostacyclin production in myocardial infarction in the acute phase and during follow-up. Twenty-five patients with myocardial infarction were monitored in the acute phase and during follow-up with regard to the in vivo production of prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane (TxA2), by measurement of their major urinary metabolites, 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-TxB2, respectively. In 22 of these patients PGI2 and TxA2 production were also assessed before, during and after an exercise test performed 6 weeks after discharge. In approximately 24% of patients the in vivo production of prostacyclin did not increase during the acute phase of the infarction process. This inability was usually associated with a decrease in the release of heart muscle enzymes, and was mostly frequently observed in women. During the exercise tolerance test, none of the patients showed any increase in prostacyclin production, in contrast to healthy volunteers, in whom a significant increase was seen. There were no differences between patients with and without an increase in prostacyclin production during the acute phase. At the follow-up 2 years after the myocardial infarction, eight cardiac events had occurred, all of which were noted among patients who exhibited an expected increase in prostacyclin production in association with the infarction. This would seem reasonable, since most of the patients in this group had larger primary infarctions. 
2	Success of a program of routine prenatal screening for hepatitis B surface antigen: the first 2 years. Prenatal screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) restricted to women with defined risk factors for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection fails to identify many carriers. A centralized program of routine HBsAg screening for all pregnant women in Alberta was introduced in 1985. We collected and analysed data for the first 2 years of the program in Edmonton to determine the frequency of risk factors for HBsAg positivity, the proportion of multiparous HBsAg-positive women not identified in previous pregnancies, the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of providing immunoprophylaxis to infants at risk of HBV infection and the degree of success in inducing adequate protection. A total of 149 women (158 pregnancies) were found to be HBsAg positive. Risk factors were readily ascertainable for 85% of the women; the remaining 15% would not have been identified through risk-selective screening. The most common risk factors were Oriental ethnic origin, history of hepatitis, jaundice or multiple transfusions of blood or blood products, and occupational exposure to blood. Although 86% of the multiparous HBsAg-positive women had risk factors, only 7% had been identified in previous pregnancies. The Alberta program appears to be cost-effective. We conclude that only routine prenatal screening will identify all infants at risk of perinatal HBV infection and that a comprehensive public health program involving central laboratories, private physicians and public health staff can be highly effective and efficient in protecting infants against hepatitis B. 
1	Minute squamous cell carcinoma arising in the wall of a congenital lung cyst. A case of minute squamous cell carcinoma arising in a congenital lung cyst is reported. Two aspects of this case were notable. First, we were able to make the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma by bronchial lavage at an early stage. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first case of probable de novo origin of squamous cell carcinoma in a congenital lung cyst. 
3	Embolization with particles in thoracic intramedullary arteriovenous malformations: long-term angiographic and clinical results. To evaluate the long-term results of endovascular treatment with particles in the management of thoracic intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the authors retrospectively reviewed the angiographic and clinical findings in 35 patients. Follow-up was 1-15 years (mean, 6 years) in 28 patients and 6-10 months (mean, 7 months) in seven. A total of 158 embolization procedures were performed in 35 patients. Revascularization occurred frequently, necessitating multiple endovascular sessions. Long-term clinical evaluation showed clinical improvement, compared with the initial status before treatment, in 63% of the patients. Clinical aggravation due to embolization was observed in seven patients (20%) after 12 of the 158 endovascular sessions (8%). These results are better than those reported after surgery and indicate that embolization with particles is an efficient and safe tool in the treatment of thoracic intramedullary AVMs. 
3	Beneficial effects of x-irradiation on recovery of lesioned mammalian central nervous tissue. We examined the potential of x-irradiation, at clinical dose levels, to manipulate the cellular constituents and thereby change the consequences of transection injury to adult mammalian central nervous tissue (rat olfactory bulb). Irradiation resulted in reduction or elimination of reactive astrocytes at the site of incision provided that it was delivered within a defined time window postinjury. Under conditions optimal for the elimination of gliosis (15-18 days postinjury), irradiation of severed olfactory bulbs averted some of the degenerative consequences of lesion. We observed that irradiation was accompanied by prevention of tissue degeneration around the site of lesion, structural healing with maintenance of the typical cell lamination, and rescue of some axotomized mitral cells (principal bulb neurons). Thus radiation resulted in partial preservation of normal tissue morphology. It is postulated that intrusive cell populations are generated in response to injury and reactive astrocytes are one such group. Our results suggest that selective elimination of these cells by irradiation enabled some of the regenerative processes that are necessary for full recovery to maintain their courses. The cellular targets of these cells, their modes of intervention in recovery, and the potential role of irradiation as a therapeutic modality for injured central nervous system are discussed. 
4	Thrombolytic therapy for noncoronary diseases. Thrombolytic therapy has been used fairly extensively in the management of acute proximal deep-vein thrombophlebitis of the extremities, acute pulmonary embolism, and acute peripheral arterial thrombosis and embolism in addition to acute thrombotic coronary events. In the presence of acceptable indications and a favorable benefit to risk ratio, this form of therapy, when successful, has served as a useful adjunct in the management of these disorders. In deep-vein thrombophlebitis, lysis of the thrombus before permanent pathological changes (eg, organization, scarring) have occurred can prevent venous valvular dysfunction and postural venous hypertension and its complications, especially the postphlebitic syndrome. In the more severe forms of acute pulmonary embolism, thrombolytic therapy, when applied early after symptom onset, decreases morbidity and is likely to prevent a chronic increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and persistent pulmonary hypertension. In peripheral arterial thrombo-occlusive events, early restoration of flow through thrombolysis has been shown to limit ischemic damage and serve as a useful supplement to angioplasty or surgery. Thrombolytic therapy has been used less extensively in acute strokes. Here the danger of reperfusion causing bleeding into a softened area of brain undergoing infarction has slowed its evaluation for this disorder; its application to stroke remains experimental. 
2	Gastrointestinal side-effects of octreotide during long-term treatment of acromegaly. Gastrointestinal side-effects of prolonged therapy (greater than 2 yr) with the long-acting somatostatin analog octreotide were studied in 10 acromegalic patients. After 2 yr of therapy, 6 of 10 patients had newly developed gallstones, complicated by cholangitis and jaundice in 1. Serum vitamin B-12 concentrations declined in all 10 patients [from 380 +/- 32 to 172 +/- 21 pmol/L (mean +/- SE); P = 0.023] and became abnormally low in 4. Gastric biopsy specimens, obtained during gastroscopy (9 patients), showed moderate to severe active gastritis, with damage to the superficial and deeper layers of the mucosa in 9 of 9 and focal atrophy in 7 of 9 patients. Campylobacter pylori was found in the antral mucosa in 8 of 9 patients. Although information is lacking on similar studies in untreated acromegalic patients, we suggest that patients receiving chronic octreotide therapy be closely monitored for these and possible other side-effects related to gastrointestinal actions of octreotide. 
1	Leiomyosarcoma of the sinonasal tract. A clinicopathologic study of nine cases. The clinicopathologic features of nine cases of sinonasal tract leiomyosarcoma (SNTL) referred to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC, during the period from 1970 through 1988 are described. This report represents the largest study to date on SNTL, and our results are compared with the 21 previously reported cases of SNTL. Of the nine cases described, patients ranged in age from 22 to 86 years (mean, 55 years). The most frequent clinical presentation was nasal obstruction unilaterally. The neoplasms were limited solely to the nasal cavity in four cases (44%) and involved both the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses in the remaining five cases. Light microscopic, immunocytochemical, and ultrastructural features served to characterize these tumors as malignant neoplasms of smooth-muscle origin. In contrast with previous studies, immunocytochemistry was employed to differentiate SNTL from other spindle cell malignancies of the region, using newly available monoclonal antibodies to smooth-muscle antigens. Treatment was surgical. Radiotherapy or chemotherapy did not appear to affect the progression of the disease. Furthermore, no relationship was found between the aggressiveness of SNTL and morphologic parameters (eg, mitotic count and tumor size). Instead, prognosis was dependent on the distribution of disease at presentation. Of all 30 patients with SNTL described to date, 10 had the neoplasm confined solely to the nasal cavity. The 10 neoplasms did not recur. We conclude that SNTL may best be regarded as a locally aggressive neoplasm with only limited metastatic potential and that it could be curable by complete surgical excision. 
2	A valved hepatic portoduodenal intestinal conduit for biliary atresia. Forty-six consecutive patients with biliary atresia were operated on at our institution during the 11-year period between 1978 and 1989. Their ages at operation ranged from 18 to 153 days (mean, 59 days). After dissecting the porta hepatis structures by Kasai operation, a biliointestinal anastomosis was constructed with a valved hepatic portoduodenal intestinal conduit in all cases. The intestinal valve is an intussuscepted muscular valve. Valvular function was examined radiologically. The upper gastrointestinal series demonstrated no reflux of contrast material into the conduit proximal to the valve and liver scintigraphy demonstrated that radioactive isotope drained readily into the duodenum through the valve. Thirty-nine of the forty-six patients (85%) had bile drainage after initial operation. At present 30 patients (65%) are alive without jaundice, 6 (13%) are alive with jaundice, and 10 (22%) are dead. The 5-year jaundice-free survival rate was 64%. Cholangitis occurred in 9 of 39 patients (23%) who had obtained apparent bile drainage: 5 had tractable cholangitis and 4 had refractory cholangitis. Reoperation restored bile flow in 2 of 8 patients who abruptly ceased to have bile drainage without cholangitis. In conclusion, with a valved hepatic portoduodenal intestinal conduit, the incidence of cholangitis was decreased, its medical control became easier, and the survival rate was improved. 
4	The effects of cyclosporin A on eicosanoid excretion in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Alterations in renal eicosanoid levels have been postulated as a factor in cyclosporin A (CSA) nephrotoxicity. The effects of CSA on renal eicosanoid excretion in rheumatoid arthritis were studied over a 24-week period, during which treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was discontinued. The initial dosage of CSA was 4 mg/kg/day; at week 24, the mean dosage of CSA was 3.9 mg/kg/day. At week 24, the mean (+/- SD) serum creatinine level (1.04 +/- 0.24 mg/dl) was 32% above the baseline value; renal blood flow had decreased by 21% (P less than 0.03) and the glomerular filtration rate had decreased by 16%. There was a significant increase (P less than 0.03) in the 2,3-dinor thromboxane B2 level at week 2, but there was no significant change in the levels of the other eicosanoids. This study demonstrates that after CSA treatment, there is a selective increase in a thromboxane metabolite that parallels an increase in renal vascular resistance, even in the absence of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and with unimpaired formation of other vasodilator eicosanoids. 
4	Steroid anabolic drugs and arterial complications in an athlete--a case history. Serious side effects and complications have been attributed to anabolic and androgenic steroids when used for medical reasons or when taken in sports in hopes of increasing strength and, hence, performance. The author presents a case of an athlete who experienced two metachronous arterial complications after taking these drugs: a cerebrovascular accident caused by a carotid artery thrombus that partially embolized to the brain and, later, a severe ischemic episode in a lower limb caused by a diffused distal arterial thrombosis. This patient represents the first reported case of vascular events in an otherwise healthy athlete taking androgens to increase his skeletal muscle mass. 
2	Interferon-alpha receptor expression and regulation in chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Interferon-alpha elicits antiviral and immunoregulatory activities by binding to specific receptors on the cell surface. In this study, binding characteristics of interferon-alpha to peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection were studied using radioiodinated recombinant interferon-alpha 2b to determine interferon-alpha receptor numbers and dissociation constants. A single class of interferon-alpha receptor was demonstrated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mononuclear subsets. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (n = 20) and controls (n = 16) expressed a similar number of interferon-alpha receptors (484 +/- 175 vs. 511 +/- 168 sites/cell respectively, p = NS) with a similar dissociation constant (dissociation constant approximately 0.2 to 0.7 nmol/L). Expression of interferon-alpha receptors was similar in monocyte-enriched and lymphocyte-enriched fractions in both groups. Similar changes were observed in patients receiving alpha-interferon therapy. There was no correlation between interferon-alpha receptors expression and serum transaminase, serum HBsAg, serum HBV DNA, liver histological findings or the response to interferon-alpha therapy. After incubation of lymphocytes in vitro with interferon-alpha 2b (10 to 1,000 U/ml), interferon-alpha receptors number dropped by 42% to 80%, but this was associated with an increase in binding affinity (dissociation constant approximately 0.05 to 0.15 nmol/L) in both patients and controls. There was significant delay in the initial phase of receptor recovery in the patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection compared with normal controls (days 1 and 2, p less than 0.05). 
1	Gynecologic cancer in patients with subacute cerebellar degeneration predicted by anti-Purkinje cell antibodies and limited in metastatic volume. Between 1982 and 1989, 19 patients with gynecologic carcinoma, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, and seropositivity for anti-Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibodies were identified at our institution. Seven of the patients had no clinical, computed tomographic, or magnetic resonance imaging evidence of cancer but had undergone laparotomy solely because anti-Purkinje cell antibodies were found in their serum; all had high-grade adenocarcinoma. Cerebellar symptoms preceded or coincided with the initial cancer diagnosis in 15 patients and preceded the diagnosis of recurrent cancer in 4 patients. The cancers were 14 ovarian, 2 fallopian tube, 2 surface papillary, and 1 poorly differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma in a periaortic lymph node. Two remarkable surgical observations in patients with high-grade ovarian and tubal cancers were the conspicuous lack of peritoneal implants and the small metastatic volume. A comparison of the 8 patients who had primary stage III cancer with 24 matched control patients without paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration revealed no difference in primary tumor volume but a significantly smaller volume of metastatic tumor in the seropositive group (P = 0.05). Anti-Purkinje cell antibodies were not detected in 111 neurologically normal patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The small metastatic volume in the face of high-grade and advanced stage malignancy in seropositive patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration suggests that an immune response to the tumor (presumably cross-reactive with cerebellar cells) may impair the metastatic process. Earlier diagnosis and treatment of cancer, based on prompt serologic testing, may offer an improved neurologic and oncologic prognosis. 
1	Expression of the human papillomavirus E7 oncogene during cell transformation is sufficient to induce susceptibility to lysis by activated macrophages. Human papillomaviruses (HPV), and in particular HPV type 16, are etiologic agents in the development of cervical cancer, which is the second most common form of cancer in women worldwide. Mammalian cells are susceptible to transformation in vitro by the E6 and E7 oncogenes derived from the HPV-16 genome. NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the HPV-16 E7 oncogene were found to exhibit cytolytic susceptibility to murine-activated macrophages. In comparison, E6 oncogene-expressing cells were not susceptible to lysis by activated macrophages. The E7 oncoprotein is multifunctional, being capable of complexing with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (anti-oncogene) product, stimulating DNA synthesis, and causing cell transformation in vitro. Macrophage killing assays performed on cell lines expressing E7 mutants revealed that the ability to complex the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product and stimulate DNA synthesis did not induce susceptibility to activated macrophages, whereas the ability of E7 to cause transformation was required to induce susceptibility to activated macrophages. These data suggest that cell transformation is a more important prerequisite for inducing susceptibility to activated macrophages than is the loss of tumor suppressor gene function. This study also provides an initial link between HPV-16 oncogene expression and the ability of activated macrophages to selectively recognize and destroy HPV-16-associated neoplastic cells. 
4	Research and policy directions. Salt and blood pressure. The relation between dietary intake of sodium chloride and blood pressure levels remains controversial. The critical questions concern whether there is a susceptible subgroup at risk of elevated blood pressure because of sodium chloride consumption. If there is such a subgroup, what is its size and how can it be identified? Further clinical trials are needed to determine the long-term effects of sodium chloride reduction on blood pressure. The risk of disease, including stroke and coronary heart disease, is linear with blood pressure levels. A small change in blood pressure can have a relatively large impact on disease, even within the normal range of blood pressure. 
4	Effect of halothane and isoflurane on postischemic "stunned" myocardium in the dog. Short periods of coronary artery occlusion are known to produce prolonged periods of ventricular dysfunction. The effects of halothane or isoflurane on contractility and metabolism in postischemic "stunned" myocardium were studied in an open-chest canine model in which the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was occluded for 15 min and then reperfused. Regional function in the LAD and circumflex artery (CIRC) areas were measured with sonomicrometry, and metabolic data were determined from simultaneous arterial and venous measurements of oxygen and lactate. Halothane and isoflurane produced equivalent decreases in systolic shortening in both normal (CIRC) and stunned (LAD) areas of the heart. Furthermore, the amount of depression was similar with either halothane or isoflurane. Halothane 0.75 MAC significantly decreased systolic shortening in both the LAD region (from 38.8 +/- 25.9% to 11.0 +/- 21.8%) and in the CIRC region (from 116.7 +/- 24.7% to 87.5 +/- 23.3%). At equivalent MAC concentrations of isoflurane, the values were 42.5 +/- 45.7 to -7.0 +/- 49.9% in the LAD region and 91.5 +/- 11.9% to 66.9 +/- 23.9% in the CIRC area. At 1.5-MAC halothane, systolic shortening in the LAD region decreased from 47.9 +/- 47.2% to -0.6 +/- 20.3% and in the CIRC area from 114.6 +/- 16.8% to 76.0 +/- 18.7%. Isoflurane at 1.5 MAC produced significant decreases, from 23.4 +/- 54.5% to -15.6 +/- 27.1% in the LAD region and from 94.4 +/- 33.2% to 61.3 +/- 28.2 in the CIRC area. 
1	A case of amnesia after excision of the septum pellucidum. Tumours of the septum pellucidum (SP) are rare and seldom associated with memory impairment either before or after operation. A patient is described who developed amnesia after transcallosal excision of a tumour of the SP. Radiology did not show any major lesion of the brain areas traditionally associated with amnesia. Because septal nuclei could have been damaged during surgery their possible role in memory functions is discussed. 
5	Opiates suppress carrageenan-induced edema and hyperthermia at doses that inhibit hyperalgesia. This study determined whether opiates alter vascular components of inflammation (hyperthermia, edema and plasma extravasation) in addition to the suppression of hyperalgesia. Rats were administered carrageenan into one hind paw and saline into the other hind paw, followed by i.p. injection of morphine (0.2-5.0 mg/kg) or saline at 60 min, and testing at 90 min after hind paw injections. Morphine produced a dose-dependent reduction in carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia (17-53%), hyperthermia (39-53%) and edema (24-36%). Morphine treatment did not alter the temperatures of the contralateral saline-injected paws, indicating that opiate suppression of hyperthermia was not confounded by alterations in systemic body temperature or blood flow. The opiate effects on inflammation were stereospecific since levorphanol (1 mg/kg), but not dextrorphan (1 mg/kg), suppressed carrageenan-evoked hyperalgesia, hyperthermia and edema. Pre-treatment with naltrexone (1.5 mg/kg) blocked the effects of a 5 mg/kg dose of morphine sulfate on hyperalgesia, hyperthermia and edema. In a separate study, i.v. injection of morphine sulfate (2 mg/kg) reduced plasma extravasation by 41% (P less than 0.01). Morphine administration resulted in significantly greater increases in paw withdrawal latencies in the inflamed (38-139%) than the contralateral, saline-treated paws (4-19%). The results indicate that opiates exert a moderate, though significant, reduction in the vascular signs of inflammation in addition to their reduction of hyperalgesia. The mechanisms for this vascular effect involve inhibition of both vasodilation (as indicated by a decrease in hyperthermia) and inhibition of vascular permeability. In addition, opiates exhibit enhanced antinociceptive effects in inflamed paws, even when compared to uninjured paws in the same animal. 
5	Recurrent or metastatic disease in select patients with adrenocortical carcinoma. Aggressive resection vs chemotherapy. In a retrospective, nonrandomized comparison of patients with first recurrence of adrenocortical cancer, 18 patients were treated with chemotherapy (primarily mitotane) and 15 patients were treated with surgical resection plus similar chemotherapy. Surgical resection of recurrent adrenocortical cancer was often extensive, with morbidity in 20% of patients and no mortality. Mitotane therapy was ineffective at controlling tumor growth. Median survival from the time of diagnosis for all patients was only 23 months and no patient was cured. Disease-free interval greater than 12 months was associated with prolonged survival, but it only occurred in six patients (18%), with a similar frequency in both treatment groups. Surgical resection of recurrent disease was associated with prolonged survival from the time of first recurrence. The potential benefit of this resection was evident in the 5 patients (33%) who were able to live greater than 5 years from the time of first recurrence with improvement in symptoms and signs of hypercortisolism. Although no patient with recurrent adrenal cancer could be cured, resection of recurrent disease was associated with a slight prolongation of survival and good palliation of Cushing's syndrome. 
2	Hepatic metabolism of cholesterol in Crohn's disease. Effect of partial resection of ileum. To study cholesterol metabolism in Crohn's disease and especially the effect of ileum resection, liver biopsy specimens were obtained from patients undergoing partial ileal resection because of Crohn's disease (n = 17) and patients with Crohn's colitis undergoing colectomy (n = 3). Gallstone-free patients (n = 16) undergoing cholecystectomy because of adenomyomas or polyps of the gallbladder served as controls. The mean levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, rate-determining enzymes in bile acid, and cholesterol synthesis, respectively, were twofold to threefold higher in the ileum-resected patients than in the controls. Significant positive correlations were obtained between length of resected ileum and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Provided patients who had received total parenteral nutrition preoperatively were excluded from analysis, a significant correlation was also observed between length of resected ileum and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity. Significant positive correlations were also obtained between length of resected ileum and serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol (a marker for bile acid biosynthesis) and lathosterol (a marker for cholesterol synthesis). The plasma levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were negatively correlated to the length of resected ileum. The expression of hepatic low-density lipoprotein-receptor binding activity was determined in five of the patients and in three of the controls. A significant positive correlation was observed between 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and low-density lipoprotein-receptor binding activity. The results show that malabsorption of bile acids leads to parallel stimulation of cholesterol synthesis, cholesterol degradation, and low-density lipoprotein-receptor expression in human liver. The resulting effect in the present patients was a significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. 
5	Acute respiratory tract infections among a birth cohort of children from Cali, Colombia, who were studied through 17 months of age. For this study, 340 children less than 18 months old from a low-income, urban neighborhood in Cali, Colombia, were observed from birth by means of weekly home visits to detect cases of acute respiratory tract infection. All suspected cases were confirmed by trained doctors in a special clinic. Information on symptoms, signs, and potential risk factors was documented prospectively. Etiologic agents were identified in cases of lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). The overall incidence of acute respiratory tract infection was 6.6 cases per child-year at risk. The incidence of upper respiratory tract infection was 4.9 cases per child-year at risk and that of LRI was 1.7 cases per child-year at risk. Crowding in the home was found to be significantly associated with an increased incidence of LRI. Respiratory syncytial virus was the viral agent most frequently isolated from cultures of nasopharyngeal aspirates of children with LRI. Staphylococcus aureus was the bacterial agent most frequently isolated from the blood of patients with LRI. 
5	Increased fatigue of isovelocity vs. isometric contractions of canine diaphragm. A comparison of fatigue as a loss of force with repeated contractions over time was performed in canine respiratory muscle by isometric (nonshortening) and isovelocity (shortening) contractions. In situ diaphragm muscle strips were attached to a linear ergometer and electrically stimulated (30 or 40 Hz) via the left phrenic nerve to produce either isometric (n = 12) or isovelocity (n = 12) contractions (1.5 s) from optimal muscle length (Lo = 8.8 cm). Similar velocities of shortening between isovelocity experiments [0.19 +/- 0.02 (SD) Lo/S] were produced by maximizing the mean power output (Wmax = 210 +/- 27 mW/cm2) that could be developed over 1.5 s when displacement was approximately 0.30 Lo. Initial peak isometric tension was 1.98 kg/cm2, whereas initial peak isovelocity tension was 1.84 kg/mc2 (P less than 0.01) or 93% of initial isometric tension. Fatigue trials of 5 min were conducted on muscles contracting at a constant duty cycle (0.43). At the end of the trials, peak isovelocity tension had fallen to 50% of initial isometric tension (P less than 0.01), whereas peak isometric tension had only fallen by 27%. These results indicate that muscle shortening during force production has a significant influence on diaphragm muscle fatigue. We conclude that the effects of shortening on fatigue must be considered in models of respiratory muscle function, because these muscles typically shorten during breathing. 
5	Comparison of DNA and karyotype aneuploidy in malignant lymphomas. Tumors from 48 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were examined for flow cytometric DNA ploidy and chromosome constitution to determine the degree of concordance of these two methods. Histologically, there were 24 low-grade, 19 intermediate, and 5 high-grade lymphomas. Flow cytometry revealed an aneuploid cell population in 19% of the cases. The mean DNA index of the aneuploid tumors was 1.58 +/- 0.71. The frequency of DNA aneuploidy was only slightly higher (23%) in intermediate than in low-grade lymphomas (17%). None of the five high-grade lymphomas showed DNA aneuploidy. The chromosome study was successful in 81% of cases (39 of 48), and clonal chromosome abnormalities were observed in 92% of these (36 of 39). In most of the chromosomally abnormal clones the chromosome number was in the diploid range. Most tumors with pseudodiploid (46 chromosomes), hypodiploid (45-44 chromosomes), or hyperdiploid (47-49 chromosomes) clones were DNA diploid by flow cytometry. On the other hand, all specimens with a chromosome number exceeding 50 were DNA aneuploid by flow cytometry. Therefore, flow cytometric DNA analysis appears to be a rather coarse method that will detect aneuploidy only when there is a major increase in chromosome material. 
4	Dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy: the experience with its application in one hundred seventy patients with known or suspected unstable angina. We evaluated the safety, accuracy, and potential clinical utility of intravenous dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy with thallium-201 in 170 patients, 78 with suspected and 92 with known unstable angina. All had coronary angiography. Noncardiac side effects (26%), induced chest discomfort (44%), and ST segment changes (12%) were similar in the two groups. No significant arrhythmias occurred. Two patients had prolonged chest pain, both with extensive reversible image abnormalities and associated creatinine kinase-MB release. Both had elective bypass surgery. Twenty-eight patients had normal coronary arteries, and 35 had single-vessel disease. Scintigraphic per patient sensitivity and specificity were 91% and 79% with a per vessel sensitivity of 74% and a per vessel specificity of 78% without between-group differences. During a brief follow-up period, 62 patients with image abnormalities had coronary revascularization, and there were seven deaths without intergroup differences. In a similar patient group that did not have angiography, scintigraphic defects were less frequent and less extensive, revascularization was not performed, and subsequent deaths occurred less often. Dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy is an accurate alternative to exercise testing in the evaluation of patients with unstable angina pectoris. Although not without risk, the method appears relatively safe and should be considered as a guide to diagnosis, and probably to prognosis and management. 
2	The gastrin hypothesis. Implications for antisecretory drug selection. Newer potent and long-acting inhibitors of acid secretion, such as the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, are becoming available for general use. These drugs promise to control acid-peptic disease effectively in patients who do not respond adequately to conventional short-acting H2-receptor antagonists. The safety of chronic administration of these drugs has come into question, however. Lifelong profound inhibition of acid secretion in rats induced by superpotent inhibitors of acid secretion or subtotal fundectomy is associated with the development of carcinoid tumors of enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the gastric corpus. Available evidence supports a role of gastrin, which becomes chronically elevated in animals subjected to prolonged and profound hypochlorhydria. In humans, hypergastrinemic states such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and atrophic gastritis are associated with an increased risk of ECL-cell carcinoid tumors. Such observations have raised concern that humans may also be susceptible to carcinoid tumor formation in response to potent inhibitors of acid secretion. To date, however, no cases of carcinoid tumor have been attributed to the use of omeprazole in humans. If achlorhydric doses are not used, significant hypergastrinemia can be avoided while effectiveness of treatment is maintained. Such measures should minimize any risk of ECL-cell carcinoid tumors in humans taking potent long-term antisecretory drugs. 
3	Intracranial pressure in African children with cerebral malaria Opening lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was measured with a paediatric spinal fluid manometer in 26 of 61 Kenyan children (mean age 39 months) with cerebral malaria. In all cases pressure was above normal (mean [SD]22.6 [7.4] cm CSF, range 10.5-36). Clinical features of our patients suggest that intracranial hypertension is important in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria in children, especially as a cause of death. We suggest that raised intracranial pressure is secondary to increased cerebral blood volume. Lowering intracranial pressure may significantly reduce the mortality and morbidity of cerebral malaria. The potential risks and benefits of lumbar puncture should be considered carefully in patients with suspected cerebral malaria. 
1	Laser therapy for vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia after hysterectomy. In recent years there has been a marked increase in the number of reported cases of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) after hysterectomy. Until about 10 years ago radiation or surgery had been the therapeutic modality mostly used for this disease. More recently, topical drugs, such as bleomycin and 5-fluorouracil cream, have been used, but they are often ineffective and poorly tolerated. For the last 14 years we have used the CO2 laser for the treatment of VAIN and have treated a total of 143 patients. Our use of a combination of wire sutures through the vaginal mucosa and the introduction of fluids into the underlying submucosal areas allows retraction and ballooning of the recesses and scars and permits us to place the vaginal mucosa at right angles to the laser beam to allow complete treatment. 
2	Suboptimal response to hepatitis B vaccine in drug users. Fifty-five drug users institutionalized in a community for drug detoxification were vaccinated against hepatitis B virus (HBV) with a recombinant yeast-derived vaccine (Engerix B, Smith Kline Biologicals, Belgium). At 0, 1, and 6 months, 20 micrograms of vaccine was given in the deltoid to these patients, of whom 17 had no serum HBV markers, 15 had only the antibody to core antigen (anti-HBc), and 23 had anti-HBc and antibody to the surface antigen (anti-HBs) values lower than the allegedly "protective" value of 10 mIU/mL. Forty-one healthy controls were vaccinated in parallel. At month 7 (ie, 1 month after the third dose of vaccine), in 76% (13/17) of drug users with no HBV markers, 6% (1/15) of those with isolated anti-HBc, and 69% (16/23) of those with anti-HBc and nonprotective anti-HBs, protective anti-HBs titers (greater than or equal to 10 mIU/mL) developed, compared with 97% (40/41) of controls. At month 24, these rates fell to 43% for drug users with no HBV marker, 0% for those with anti-HBc, 31% for those with anti-HBc and anti-HBs, and 86% for controls. The drug users who did not respond to vaccination were more likely to be those with evidence of prior HBV infection and anergy to skin tests. This indicates that unresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccine in drug users may be due to altered immunity. 
5	Differential histopathology of primary atherosclerotic and restenotic lesions in coronary arteries and saphenous vein bypass grafts: analysis of tissue obtained from 73 patients by directional atherectomy. Vascular tissue obtained using a directional percutaneous atherectomy device was examined microscopically. Tissue was obtained from coronary arteries without prior instrumentation (primary lesions, n = 31), aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass grafts with primary lesions (n = 8), coronary arteries with lesions developing after prior balloon angioplasty or mechanical atherectomy (restenotic lesions, n = 30) and vein bypass grafts with restenotic lesions (n = 4). Primary lesions were characterized by dense intimal fibrosis with necrotic debris (83% of intimal tissue) and foam cells typical of atherosclerosis. These lesions frequently contained cholesterol crystals (45% of coronary arteries, 50% of vein grafts) and calcium deposits (65% of coronary arteries, 38% of vein grafts). Restenotic lesions were characterized by an increased proportion of loose fibroproliferative tissue (45% of coronary artery intima, 35% of vein graft intima). Immunohistochemical stains confirmed this proliferative tissue to be primarily smooth muscle cells. Thrombus was rarely observed. Comparison of resected tissues indicated that dense fibrosis and necrosis are significantly more common in primary than in restenotic lesions (83% versus 56% of intimal tissue, p = 0.0005), whereas smooth muscle cell hyperplasia is more common in restenotic than in primary lesions (44% versus 17% of intimal tissue, p less than 0.0005). Partial-thickness resection of medial tissue or full-thickness resection of media with associated adventitial tissue occurred in 27 (56%) of 39 primary atheromatous lesions and 16 (47%) of 34 restenotic lesions; subintimal tissue obtained from primary lesions appeared identical to that obtained from restenotic lesions. These data indicate that the histopathologic characteristics of the neointimal layer of restenotic lesions differ from those of the intimal layer of primary atherosclerotic lesions. 
1	Accelerated fractionation for high-grade cerebral astrocytomas. Preliminary treatment results. A Phase I/II accelerated fractionation study for high-grade cerebral astrocytomas began in October 1987. Forty-two patients, 25 men and 17 women, were entered in the study. Median age was 58.5 years of age (range, 32 to 78 years). Performance status was 0, 1, 2, and 3 on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale for 13, 19, 9, and 1 patients, respectively. Thirty-six patients had undergone partial resection, and six had stereotactic biopsy only. All patients had histologically proven astrocytomas (6 Grade 3, and 36 Grade 4). Treatment consisted of radiation therapy doses of 4400 cGy in 22 daily fractions to the whole brain plus a boost of 1600 cGy in 8 fractions given concomitantly with the last 8 whole-brain treatments using a twice daily schedule with an interfraction interval of 8 hours. Median survival time was 57 weeks from the date of starting irradiation. Survival was 50% and 28% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Alopecia and scalp erythema were seen in all patients; nine patients had localized areas of moist desquamation in the retroauricular region. Decreased hearing and serous otitis media were seen in five patients within 1 to 2 months from the end of treatment. Increasing somnolence was marked in eight patients with progressive deterioration of performance status; computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan studies in all eight patients showed evidence of disease recurrence with associated brain edema and mass effect. Three patients had a second resection for a recurrent tumor with no evidence of brain necrosis at craniotomy. To date, the accelerated fractionation schedule appears to be well tolerated with valuable shortening of overall treatment time. The preliminary results are encouraging, and longer follow-up time is required to evaluate tumor control and toxicity. 
5	Improved survival after Hemopump insertion in patients experiencing postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock during cardiopulmonary bypass. Immediate placement of a Hemopump (HP) ventricular assist device was undertaken in nine patients (seven men, two women) after other attempts at weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) after coronary bypass surgery had failed. All nine patients (100%) were successfully weaned from CPB, and six (63.3%) gradually improved enough to permit removal of HP support. Five (83.3%) of the six who were weaned from CPB survived beyond hospital discharge. HP support was evaluated in terms of vital organ function, incidence of complications, and clinical outcome. In both survivors (S) and nonsurvivors (NS), serial hemodynamic measurements were taken. Although there were few differences in hemodynamic parameters between groups at 4 hr, by 24 hr the S group had markedly improved cardiac index, Glasgow Coma Scale, urinary output, and pulse pressure and required far less inotropic support than did the NS group. All four patients who required high dose inotropic agents to maintain acceptable end-organ perfusion on HP support died; three were unable to tolerate weaning from the HP, and all died within 72 hr of surgery because of ineffective myocardial recovery. None of the survivors required additional early inotropic augmentation. Renal perfusion appeared to be well maintained, even with mean arterial pressures below 60 mmHg during HP support. There were no episodes of hemolysis, infection, or limb ischemia in either group. Thus, the Hemopump provided excellent circulatory support for those patients who could not be weaned from CPB by traditional methods. 
5	Prevention of hypotension following spinal anaesthesia for elective caesarean section by wrapping of the legs. Twenty-four parturients undergoing elective Caesarean section were allocated randomly to have the legs wrapped with elasticated Esmarch bandages immediately following spinal anaesthesia or to serve as controls. Significant hypotension (systolic arterial pressure less than 100 mm Hg and less than 80% of baseline value) was treated with i.v. ephedrine in 5-mg boluses. Leg wrapped patients had a significantly (P = 0.0033) lower incidence (16.7%) of hypotension than controls (83.3%). Only two patients in the leg wrapped group required ephedrine compared with 10 in the control group. Systolic arterial pressure was significantly (P less than 0.05) less in control subjects at 4, 5 and 6 min following spinal injection. No patient in the leg wrapped group became hypotensive following removal of the elasticated bandages. 
5	Prolonged indomethacin therapy for the prevention of recurrences of patent ductus arteriosus. We tested the hypothesis that prolonged maintenance indomethacin therapy would allow more effective closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and thereby decrease the recurrence rate. Thirty-nine low birthweight neonates (less than 1500 gm) with confirmed PDA were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive standard indomethacin therapy (three doses), followed either by maintenance indomethacin therapy (0.2 mg/kg/day) for 5 days or by an equivalent volume of placebo for 5 days. Of the 20 infants who received maintenance indomethacin therapy, two (10%) required additional therapy and one of these required surgical ligation. Of the 19 infants who received only the first three indomethacin doses, nine (47%) required additional therapy for PDA (p less than 0.05) and seven of these had a ligation (p less than 0.05). We conclude that maintenance indomethacin therapy, in comparison with short-term indomethacin therapy, decreases the incidence of surgical PDA ligations, eliminates most PDA recurrences, and does not increase toxic effects of indomethacin in the low birth weight infant with PDA. 
5	Intrathecal anaesthesia for day-care surgery. A retrospective study of 160 cases using 25- and 26-gauge spinal needles. The records of 160 day-care surgical patients who received intrathecal anaesthesia were reviewed. No major complications were recorded. The incidence of postspinal headache after puncture with a 25-gauge spinal needle was nearly four times more frequent compared to a 26-gauge needle. The occurrence of postspinal headache in patients over the age of 45 years was significantly less frequent (p less than 0.05) than in younger patients. Intrathecal anaesthesia was acceptable to 91% of outpatients in this group. 
2	Long-term versus short-term treatment with recombinant interferon alfa-2a in patients with chronic hepatitis B: a prospective, randomized treatment trial. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial to study the efficacy and tolerance of long-term versus short-term treatment with recombinant interferon alfa-2a in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Ten patients were randomly assigned to a 6-month interferon regimen, and 10 patients were assigned to a 3-week interferon trial. Eleven patients (five assigned to long-term treatment and six to short-term treatment) did not complete interferon therapy: eight had either severe thrombocytopenia or neutropenia; one had pronounced fatigue in relationship to administration of interferon; one had spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and sepsis and died; and one had a massive fatal variceal hemorrhage during interferon therapy. Most of the serious hematologic complications occurred in patients with cirrhosis and hypersplenism. In one patient, seroconversion to hepatitis B virus DNA negativity occurred before the onset of treatment. Four of the five patients able to complete the 6-month interferon regimen and only one of four patients able to complete the 3-week trial had seroconversion to hepatitis B virus DNA negativity. Thus, we conclude that the therapeutic response was better among patients who were able to complete a 6-month interferon trial. In patients with cirrhosis and hypersplenism, development of either severe thrombocytopenia or leukopenia associated with interferon therapy precluded completion of treatment. 
5	Characterization of rat hyperplastic bile ductular epithelial cells in culture and in vivo. A novel intrahepatic biliary cell culture/in vivo transplantation system has been developed with an essentially pure population of bile ductular epithelial cells isolated from rat liver 6-12 weeks after bile duct ligation. In primary culture, these cells retain staining strongly for gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and glutathione S-transferase P. The cytoplasm of cultured bile ductular cells reacts with an anti-laminin antibody, but loses immunoreactivity with a monoclonal anti-cytokeratin 19 antibody. Semiconservative DNA synthesis in the cultured cells was dependent upon the continued presence of 10% fetal calf serum in the medium. Replicating bile ductular cells could be subcultured for a finite number of passages. In addition, freshly isolated bile ductular epithelial cells gave rise to well differentiated bile ductular structures when transplanted into the interscapular fat pads of syngeneic recipient rats. 
5	Pathogenesis of antigen-induced arthritis in mice deficient in neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. The contribution of neutrophil-derived elastase and cathepsin G to joint pathology has been examined in immune arthritis in the mouse. Neutrophils from beige mice are genetically deficient in lysosomal elastase and cathepsin G, but have normal levels of the acid hydrolases, beta-glucuronidase, and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. The development of antigen-induced arthritis in normal mice has been compared with that in beige mice. The pattern of synovitis (both leukocyte accumulation and plasma leakage) were indistinguishable in normal and beige mice. Cartilage proteoglycan depletion was quantified by measuring the decrease in safranin O staining intensity, and this, too, was unaltered in mice lacking elastase and cathepsin G. These results suggest that neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G do not contribute to these aspects of joint pathology in antigen-induced arthritis in the mouse. 
5	Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with L-tryptophan ingestion. Analysis of four patients and implications for differential diagnosis and pathogenesis Four patients fulfilling the case definition for eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome are described, including one whose disease began in 1986. Each displayed a variety of symptoms: one suffered principally from myalgia and recovered spontaneously on discontinuation of L-tryptophan therapy; one exhibited progressive sclerodermiform skin changes, neuropathy, and myopathy; a third had prominent neuromuscular disease and sclerodermiform skin changes; and the fourth experienced profound weight loss, an axonal polyneuropathy, and perivascular lymphoid infiltrates simulating a lymphoma. Evidence of T-cell activation was present in peripheral blood and affected tissues during the clinically active progressive phase of disease. Among other manifestations pleural effusion, cutaneous vasculitis, joint contractures, and bloody diarrhea were observed. A history of L-tryptophan ingestion should be sought in patients with myalgia, fatigue, or the above outlined symptoms. 
1	Detection of human papillomavirus-genomic DNA in oral epithelial dysplasias, oral smokeless tobacco-associated leukoplakias, and epithelial malignancies. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an infectious agent that is increasingly associated with mucosal cancers, in particular cancer of the cervix. The present investigation was undertaken in an attempt to determine whether HPV could be easily detected in biopsies of oral tissues, specifically oral squamous cell carcinomas, oral epithelial dysplasias, smokeless tobacco keratoses, verrucous hyperplasia, and verrucous carcinoma. In situ DNA hybridization methods were used to isolate specific HPV genomes. Among 100 instances of benign leukoplakia, only 4% of non-tobacco-related and 10% of smokeless tobacco-related lesions harbored viral sequences. We were able to detect viral sequences in dysplastic lesions 3% of the time. Alternatively, 17% and 20% of the verrucous hyperplasias and verrucous carcinomas were positive for viral nucleic acids. Six percent of the squamous cell carcinomas harbored HPV. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that HPV of known genotype can be identified in oral premalignant and malignant neoplasms. 
4	Changes in circulating norepinephrine with hemofiltration in advanced congestive heart failure. In congestive heart failure (CHF), hemofiltration is associated with an obvious decrease in circulating norepinephrine. This method was used for investigating the mechanisms whereby plasma norepinephrine is increased in chronic CHF. In 23 cases of advanced CHF, hemofiltration (2,983 +/- 1,228 ml) lowered plasma norepinephrine by 515 +/- 444 pg/ml. This effect was prompt, persisted or became greater in the next 24 hours. It was not associated with significant changes in cardiac output, aortic pressure or systemic vascular resistance. It did not appear to depend on variations in parameters related to the sympathetic activity, such as plasma renin, right atrial, wedge pulmonary artery and renal perfusion pressures, and was independent of duration and amount of hemofiltration. These observations did not support the concept that the norepinephrine decrease was the main consequence of a neural sympathetic inhibition. Hemofiltration increased diuresis by 606 +/- 415 ml; changes were prompt and correlated inversely (r = -0.7; p less than 0.01) with those in plasma norepinephrine. The same unknown mechanism of the increased urinary output might potentiate the norepinephrine removal from the blood by the kidney, or hemofiltration and the augmented diuresis might result in a regression of congestion of lungs and kidneys, leading to an improved extraction of norepinephrine. In CHF, a relation may exist between fluid retention and norepinephrine and in advanced stages, circulating norepinephrine, although strikingly increased, is devoid of important cardiovascular effects. At these stages, plasma norepinephrine is probably unreliable as an index of the sympathetic neural activity. 
1	src expression in small-cell lung carcinoma and other neuroendocrine malignancies. The proto-oncogene c-src codes for two tyrosine kinases, pp60c-src and pp60c-srcN. The latter protein appears to be exclusively expressed in neurons and neuronally differentiated tumors. In cell lines derived from neuroblastoma and small-cell lung carcinoma, src expression correlates positively with neuroendocrine differentiation. However, pp60c-srcN is expressed only in highly differentiated neuroblastomas. Although c-src expression in neuroendocrine tumors probably reflects and is the result of the differentiation stage at which the tumors have been arrested, high c-src expression and kinase activities in non-neuroectodermal tumors, e.g., colon carcinoma, breast carcinoma, might instead be a part of the malignant phenotype and contribute to the development of these tumors. 
1	Quantitation of G0 and G1 phase cells in primary carcinomas. Antibody to M1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase shows G1 phase restriction point block. Human cancers have an apparent low growth fraction, the bulk of cells presumed to being out of cycle in a G0 quiescent state due to the inability in the past to distinguish G0 from G1 cells. The allosteric M1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (M1-RR) is constitutively expressed by cycling cells (i.e., G1, S, G2-M). It is acquired during transition from G0 to G1, lost during exit to G0 and thus distinguishes G0 from G1 cells. To estimate the proportion of G0 and G1 cells in primary human breast (n = 5) and colorectal (n = 12) adenocarcinomas, we used both analytical DNA flow cytometry (ADFC) and immunoperoxidase staining of sections with the monoclonal antibody to M1-RR (MAb M1-RR). ADFC of fresh tumors revealed a low percentage of cells in the S phase (4.0 +/- 3.4%) but immunoperoxidase staining for M1-RR revealed an unexpectedly high proportion of positive cells (52.4 +/- 12.7%) in the G1, S, G2-M phases indicating a high G1 content of primary human tumors. Thus, human cancers are blocked in transition in G1 and are not predominantly in a G0 or quiescent differentiated state. This block was interpreted to mean that human cancers are responding to putative regulatory events at a restriction point in the G1 phase, such as relative growth factor deficiency, density inhibition, antiproliferative cytokines, or gene products. Using flow cytometry for both DNA and M1-RR content we found that human colon cancer cell lines arrest in the G1 but not G0 phase upon serum deprivation or density inhibition. Similarly, human breast cancer cell lines are arrested in G1 but not G0 phase by medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) or tamoxifen exposure. These findings match our in situ observations, and support the concept of a restriction point block in primary human tumors. 
4	Myocardial perfusion-contraction matching. Implications for coronary heart disease and hibernation. Experimental studies demonstrate that short-term regional perfusion-contraction matching, in which the energy demands of regional myocardial contraction are reduced to match the diminished myocardial substrate supply, occurs during states of low coronary blood flow under resting conditions and during exercise-induced ischemia. This phenomenon is rapidly reversible and appears to occur in several clinical settings. Sustained perfusion-contraction matching is observed in states of partial experimental ischemia of intermediate duration lasting several hours. This condition might be called short-term hibernation and resembles clinical conditions such as unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction with some residual perfusion in which the contractile defect can be improved by reperfusion provided the ischemia is not severe enough to cause transmural necrosis. Such experimental and clinical observations may or may not relate to the setting of regional dysfunction at rest in patients with chronic coronary heart disease, in whom manifestations of acute ischemia may be absent but improvement of wall motion abnormalities occurs after CABG or balloon angioplasty. This condition may constitute the hypothetical state of chronic myocardial hibernation, for which tentative evidence exists from metabolic and perfusion studies using PET. Whether such a condition of prolonged perfusion-contraction matching might be associated with adaptive processes that could allow its persistence for long periods without manifest ischemia remains to be investigated. 
2	Mechanical lithotripsy of common duct stones. Over the past 8 years we have utilized various types of mechanical lithotriptors to crush common bile duct stones. The procedure was performed in 93 patients with an overall success rate of 94%. However, because many accessories were in a developmental stage, entrapment of stones was not always possible on the first attempt, and the procedure was repeated in some patients a second or third time. During the interim, while awaiting another attempt at lithotripsy, cholangitis was prevented by leaving a prosthesis in place. A variety of lithotriptor models from different manufacturers have proven effective. We recommend that endoscopists use these devices to rid the bile duct of retained stones. 
4	Accelerated non-muscle contraction after subarachnoid hemorrhage: cerebrospinal fluid testing in a culture model. The cause of chronic cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage has been studied intensively, but it is still controversial whether the observable luminal narrowing should be attributed to the contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells or whether it results from some organic change in the wall. A proliferation of myointimal cells, accompanied by increased deposition of collagen, as well as myonecrosis, have been frequently observed several days after aneurysm rupture. Studies from our laboratory showed that these myointimal cells had characteristics identical to myofibroblasts. In this study, we quantitatively and morphologically examined the effect of cerebrospinal fluid on the ability of myofibroblasts to alter collagen matrices using an in vitro model. Myofibroblasts contract the collagen matrix by rearranging or compacting the framework of collagen fibers. Cerebrospinal fluid obtained from patients with recently ruptured aneurysms significantly accelerated lattice contraction, especially when the patient developed symptomatic vasospasm. This study suggests that myofibroblasts in the spastic artery can produce a contractile force that contributes to chronic vasospasm, tightening the proliferated collagen. Some unknown agent present in bloody cerebrospinal fluid accelerates the rearrangement of the collagen lattice by myofibroblasts, both of which have, until now, been considered non-contractile components. 
1	Long-term survival after chest-wall reconstruction with musculocutaneous flaps. Reconstruction of chest-wall defects with musculocutaneous flaps permits resection of advanced chest-wall tumors and of tissues severely damaged by radiotherapy in patients who in a previous era were not surgically treatable. To determine the long-term outcome from this surgery, the records of 96 patients who had undergone chest-wall resection with musculocutaneous flap reconstruction were reviewed. Median survival for the entire group was 20.5 months, but a more accurate prediction of outcome could be obtained by dividing the patients into three groups. In group I, patients free of known malignancy and undergoing resection of radionecrotic tissues, median survival was 60.0 months. In group II, patients with resectable disease and free of tumor following surgery, median survival was 31.1 months. In group III, patients incompletely resected or known to have metastatic disease following surgery, median survival was only 12.5 months. Even in group III, however, some individuals achieved prolonged survival and lasting benefits from the surgery, so these data should not be used to exclude patients from undergoing necessary palliative procedures. 
4	Ablation of the atrioventricular junction with radiofrequency energy using a new electrode catheter. Percutaneous catheter ablation using radiofrequency energy can be used to interrupt atrioventricular (AV) conduction in patients with supraventricular tachycardia refractory to drugs. Results of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction using a custom-designed catheter with a large, 3-mm-long distal electrode, 2-mm interelectrode spacing, and a shaft with increased torsional rigidity were compared with those using a standard quadripolar electrode catheter (Bard EP). An electrocoagulator (Microvasive Bicap 4005) supplied unmodulated radiofrequency current at 550 kHz, which was applied between the distal electrode of the ablation catheter and a large skin electrode. With use of the modified catheter, 12 of 13 patients (92%) had persistent complete AV block induced with 7 +/- 5 applications of 18 +/- 6 W of radiofrequency power. In contrast, complete AV block was produced in only 9 of 18 (50%) historical control patients treated with the standard catheter, despite a similar number of applications (7 +/- 5) and power output (16 +/- 4 W). A rise in impedance, due to desiccation of tissue and coagulum formation, occurred earlier (28 +/- 18 vs 52 +/- 24 seconds, p less than 0.001) and more frequently (54 vs 40% of applications, p = 0.047) in patients treated with the standard catheter than in patients treated with the modified catheter. The use of a catheter designed to increase the surface area of electrode-tissue contact allows more radiofrequency energy to be delivered before a rise in impedance occurs and appears to increase the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation of the AV junction. 
5	Peritoneal blastomycosis. Blastomycosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis. Involvement of the peritoneum is unusual, with only two previously reported cases that occurred in association with disseminated disease. A single case of histopathologically proven blastomycosis involving the peritoneum is presented, as well as a short overview of previously published cases on gastrointestinal and peritoneal blastomycosis. The case is unique in that chronic peritonitis was the only manifestation of disease. The diagnosis was made by laparoscopy. 
2	Experimental study of starch-induced intraperitoneal adhesions The effects of starch on the development of postoperative adhesions were examined in 144 Sprague Dawley rats. Groups of rats were injected intraperitoneally with suspensions of washings from starched gloves, starch-free gloves and starch-poor washed gloves, and after operative manipulation of the bowel. The incidence of adhesions was greatest (78 per cent) after laparotomy and injections of starch-rich washings and least when starch-poor (33 per cent) or starch-free glove suspensions (37 per cent) were used, confirming an advantage for washing gloves or switching to starch-free products. 
5	Intrahepatic cholestasis due to hypersensitivity reaction to procainamide. Hypersensitivity reactions to procainamide involving liver dysfunction are rare. We describe a patient who developed liver dysfunction after procainamide administration, manifested by fever, jaundice, elevated bilirubin concentration, and alkaline phosphatase concentration. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy demonstrated good hepatic uptake of the radionuclide without movement from hepatic parenchyma. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of procainamide-induced intrahepatic cholestasis as demonstrated by radionuclide hepatobiliary scintigraphy. 
5	Adult phosphorylase b kinase deficiency. Phosphorylase b kinase deficiency affecting muscle has been observed infrequently in children with weakness and hepatomegaly, and in 2 adults with cramps on exertion. We observed 2 additional adults with phosphorylase b kinase deficiency: Patient 1, aged 58, had progressive, predominantly distal weakness since age 46 but no cramps on exertion; Patient 2, aged 26, had cramps on exertion since age 6 but no weakness. Lactate production on ischemic exercise was impaired only in Patient 1. The serum creatine kinase level was elevated in both. Muscle specimens showed focal glycogen excess in both, and a necrotizing myopathy and mild denervation atrophy in Patient 1. Muscle phosphorylase b kinase activity was 0.5% and 8.9% of the lowest control value in Patients 1 and 2, respectively; erythrocyte phosphorylase b kinase activity was normal in both; liver phosphorylase b kinase activity, measured in Patient 1, was also normal. Other glycolytic enzymes in muscle were preserved in both. 
1	Bilateral breast cancer. A second primary breast cancer in the opposite breast can be either synchronous or metachronous. The majority are metachronous. A woman who has had breast cancer has a fivefold increase in risk for a second breast cancer. Additional risk factors include multifocal cancer, lobular carcinoma in situ, and an original cancer at an early age with long survival. Lobular carcinoma in situ is predominantly a marker for the subsequent development of a second primary breast cancer. The incidence of synchronous bilateral cancer is approximately 1% to 2% and that of metachronous cancer 5% to 6%. The cancer can be invasive or noninvasive. Mammography has increased the number of synchronous cancers found but not the overall incidence. The incidence of invasive cancer detected by random biopsy of the opposite breast is not high enough to justify routine adoption of this procedure. The remaining breast must be followed for the remainder of the patient's life by physical examination and annual mammography. The treatment of the secondary primary breast cancer should be that appropriate for the stage of the disease. The prognosis for the woman with a second primary breast cancer is quite favorable and is dependent on the stage of both the first and the second cancer. 
5	Morphological changes in unmyelinated nerve fibres in the sural nerve with age. Quantitative changes in unmyelinated nerve fibres in sural nerves obtained at autopsy were evaluated in 28 normal adults. The following conclusions were reached. (1) The density of unmyelinated axons showed no significant correlation with age, but the densities of (2) Schwann cell subunits with axons, (3) Schwann cell subunits without axons, (4) single protrusions of Schwann cells and (5) collagen pockets, and (6) the mean number of Schwann cell profiles per axon, all showed positive correlations with age. Additionally, (7) the percentage of subunits containing unmyelinated axons and (8) the mean number of axons in single axon-containing Schwann cell subunits demonstrated negative correlations with age. The density of Schwann cell nuclei related to unmyelinated fibres did not show a significant change with age. The age-dependent changes in unmyelinated nerve fibres thus mainly consist of an increased production of processes by Schwann cells in the absence of cell multiplication. A decrease in unmyelinated nerve fibre density or a compensatory increase of small unmyelinated axons did not occur in these normal adults. In terms of relative sensitivity for the detection of the earliest changes in unmyelinated fibres, the indices (6) and (7) are considered to be useful and superior to the conventional assessment of unmyelinated axon density and diameter distribution. These two indices are not influenced by postmortem swelling of the axons and Schwann cells. Measurements of unmyelinated axon density and size distribution will continue to be useful in the assessment of more advanced pathological conditions. 
5	Tinnitus severity measured by a subjective scale, audiometry and clinical judgement. Tinnitus is discussed, with particular reference to the problem of assessing severity. The authors argue that tinnitus severity can only usefully be determined by measuring the impact of tinnitus on an individual, and therefore propose a scale to estimate severity in these terms. Data presented on 112 members of a tinnitus self-help group, demonstrated the reliability of a Subjective Tinnitus Severity Scale (S.T.S.S.), with a coefficient alpha of 0.84. This indicates a high degree of internal consistency, i.e.: statistically this scale is measuring aspects of a single dimension. The validity was established in a separate sample of 30 clinic attenders, where mean S.T.S.S. scores were found to correlate highly with two independent clinical ratings of severity (r2 = 0.76, p less than 0.001, and r2 = 0.73, p less than 0.001). Additionally, in these patients S.T.S.S. scores were significantly associated with several audiometric variables, although the correlations were of low magnitude. 
2	Surgical complications of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Surgical experience with 260 consecutive patients with chronic renal failure receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) at one medical center from 1980 to 1989 is reviewed. Patients received CAPD for a mean of 24.2 months (range: 3 days to 91 months). Catheter longevity consistently improved in all but 1 year from 1984 to 1989, as did exit-site and tunnel infections. Of 311 catheters inserted, 151 (49%) required removal, of which 111 (74%) were attributed to peritonitis. Cumulative patient survival was 80%, 60%, and 53% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Diabetic patients had statistically significant lower survival rates. Additional complications including catheter leakage, catheter malposition, catheter obstruction, and abdominal wall hernias were negligible. Although CAPD is not free from serious complications, our data show remarkable improvement since 1980 in catheter longevity, hospital stay, and infection rates. 
5	A double-blind study of deflazacort and prednisone in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders. Deflazacort and prednisone were given to 26 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, or other chronic inflammatory diseases, in a double-blind study. Deflazacort rapidly and effectively suppressed disease activity in a manner supporting its assumed therapeutic potency of 83% that of prednisone. Prednisone induced a rapid increase in the level of daily calcium excretion that was not evident with deflazacort. Cortisol secretion was acutely inhibited by prednisone, but not by deflazacort. Neither corticosteroid had a significant effect on glucose metabolism, at the doses studied. Treatment with deflazacort may be an effective alternative to prednisone treatment, with fewer adverse effects on levels of calcium and cortisol, in patients with severe inflammatory conditions warranting the use of glucocorticoids. 
4	Restricted dose and duration of corticosteroid treatment in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis. To analyze whether corticosteroids in low doses during limited time periods could be safely used in the treatment of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) or temporal arteritis (TA) the records of 91 patients diagnosed between 1980 and 1987 were reviewed. The mean initial prednisolone dose was in patients with PMR 18 mg/day and the mean duration of treatment was 17 months. In patients with TA the mean initial dose was 31 mg/day and the mean duration of treatment 16 months, and in all the corticosteroid treatment was terminated within 24 months. Patients with coexisting TA and PMR demanded longer treatment compared to patients with either TA or PMR and thus 18/91 patients were treated for more than 2 years. No visual or neurological complications occurred after treatment with corticosteroids had been initiated. Our study indicates that most patients with PMR or TA can be treated safely with an initial prednisolone dose of 10 mg given twice daily. With few exceptions corticosteroid treatment can be terminated within 24 months. 
1	The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in solitary adult laryngeal papillomas demonstrated by in-situ DNA hybridization with sulphonated probes. Human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11 have been repeatedly demonstrated in multiple laryngeal papillomas, and there is little doubt that these lesions are caused by HPV. It has been clearly demonstrated in recent reports that the clinical course of solitary adult onset laryngeal papillomas is entirely different from that of multiple papillomas of juvenile as well as of adult onset. We here report the presence of HPV types 6 and 11 in 19 out of 20 solitary papillomas from 16 patients, while HPV types 16 and 18 were totally absent. We conclude that the milder clinical course in such patients is most likely to be due to host factors, rather than to viral factors. 
5	A clinical pilot study combining surgery with intraoperative pelvic hyperthermochemotherapy to prevent the local recurrence of rectal cancer. Intraoperative pelvic hyperthermochemotherapy (IOPHC) with mitomycin C (MMC) was prescribed for 14 patients with resectable advanced rectal cancer in an attempt to prevent a postoperative local recurrence. Immediately after rectal amputation and extended lymphadenectomy, IOPHC was performed using physiologic saline containing 40 micrograms/mL of MMC at 45.5 +/- 0.6 C for 90 minutes, with an apparatus devised for IOPHC. At the end of IOPHC, the esophageal temperature was 37.2 +/- 0.8 C and cooling was not required. Antitumor efficacy and complications in the IOPHC group were compared with findings in 12 rectal cancer patients who underwent surgery only within the same period of time. Operation time was not prolonged with IOPHC treatment. In cytologic examinations of the pelvic lavage just before IOPHC treatment, viable cancer cells were detected in 6 of the 14 patients but were never detected in the postoperative exudate drained from the pelvic cavity. Of the 12 patients in the control group, 2 had a local recurrence, while in the IOPHC group there was no local recurrence for 16.9 +/- 9.7 months at this writing. Postoperative complications did not differ between the groups. This IOPHC treatment is a favorable method in eradicating cancer cells for postoperative local recurrence of rectal cancer. 
1	Hyperthermia alone in the treatment of recurrences of malignant tumors. Experience with 60 lesions. Localized hyperthermia alone has been used for the treatment of cancer recurrences in which previous conventional therapies have failed. Since 1983 and 1988, 57 patients with 60 lesions have been heated by means of a microwave and radiofrequency system. Treatment protocol provided 45 minutes of heating at the intratumor temperature of at least 42 degrees C, twice a week, for a total number of six, eight, or ten heating sessions. Invasive intratumor thermometry was performed for all lesions. Complete response (CR) was obtained in ten cases (16.6%) and partial response (PR) in 14 (23.4%). Higher rates of CR were observed in the chest wall (38.5%) compared with the head and neck area (11.4%), trunk (10%), and limbs (none). Adenocarcinoma was the most responsive histologic type (40%). Squamous cells carcinoma had 7.7% CR. The only case of undifferentiated carcinoma showed CR; there were none on five sarcomas. Long-term local control (24 months) was approximately 7%. The multivariate analysis showed the statistical significance of the histologic variety (adenocarcinoma versus others, P less than 0.0001). Side effects and complications of the treatment were minimal. 
5	Prognostic value of reduced heart rate variability after myocardial infarction: clinical evaluation of a new analysis method. The relation between heart rate variability, measured from standard 24 hour electrocardiogram recordings in patients convalescent after a myocardial infarction, and the occurrence of sudden death and spontaneous, symptomatic, sustained ventricular tachycardia were assessed in a consecutive series of 177 patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction and surviving to 7 days. In addition to the analysis of heart rate variability, the occurrence of non-sustained arrhythmias on 24 hour electrocardiographic monitoring, and the results of clinical assessment, signal averaged electrocardiography and ejection fraction were analysed and were related to outcome. During a median of 16 months of follow up (range 10-30 months) there were 17 end point events (11 (6.2%) sudden deaths) and six (3.4%) episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia. An index of the width of the frequency distribution curve for the duration of individual RR intervals was used to measure heart rate variability. This mean (SD) index was significantly smaller in those with end point events (16.8 (8.0)) than in those without events (29.0 (11.2)). The relative risk of the occurrence of an end point event in those with a heart rate variability index less than 25 was 7.0. Multivariate analysis showed that of all the variables examined a reduced heart rate variability index was the single most powerful predictor of end point events. Measurement of heart rate variability by this simple, automated, operator-independent method provided useful information on the arrhythmic propensity in patients convalescent after myocardial infarction. 
3	Radiosurgery of acoustic neurinomas. Eighty-five patients with acoustic neurinomas underwent stereotactic radiosurgery with the gamma unit at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA) during its first 30 months of operation. Neuroimaging studies performed in 40 patients with more than 1 year follow-up showed that tumors were smaller in 22 (55%), unchanged in 17 (43%), and larger in one (2%). The 2-year actuarial rates for preservation of useful hearing and any hearing were 46% and 62%, respectively. Previously undetected neuropathies of the trigeminal (n = 12) and facial nerves (n = 14) occurred 1 week to 1 year after radiosurgery (median, 7 and 6 months, respectively), and improved at median intervals of 13 and 8 months, respectively, after onset. Hearing loss was significantly associated with increasing average tumor diameter (P = 0.04). No deterioration of any cranial nerve function has yet developed in seven patients with average tumor diameters less than 10 mm. Radiosurgery is an important treatment alternative for selected acoustic neurinoma patients. 
5	Enteroliths causing intermittent obstruction in a patient with Crohn's disease. Calcified enteroliths as a cause of intermittent small bowel obstruction is an uncommon clinical entity. The pathophysiological mechanism involves stasis of intestinal contents and has been associated with Meckel's diverticulum, tuberculosis, and regional enteritis. This case describes prophylactic operative intervention in a symptomatic patient with enteroliths as a result of Crohn's disease. 
4	Emboli in infective endocarditis: the prognostic value of echocardiography. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether vegetations visualized on two-dimensional echocardiography are an independent risk factor for the development of subsequent emboli in patients with infective endocarditis and to assess the timing of emboli relative to the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. DESIGN: Investigator-blinded, retrospective incidence cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Patients with left-sided native valve infective endocarditis who had two-dimensional echocardiography within 72 hours of beginning antimicrobial therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The crude incidence rate of first embolic events in patients receiving antimicrobial therapy was 6.2 per 1000 patient-days (95% CI, 4.2 to 9.2). The rates in patients with and without vegetations were 7.1 and 4.9 per 1000 patient-days, respectively (incidence rate ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.6 to 3.3). The relation between vegetations and risk for emboli was microorganism-dependent: Stratified incidence rate ratios were 6.9 (95% CI, 1.1 to 42.5; P less than 0.05) and 1.0 (95% CI, 0.2 to 3.9) for viridans streptococcal and Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, respectively. The rate of first embolic events diminished over time (P less than 0.001), falling from 13 per 1000 patient-days during the first week of therapy to less than 1.2 per 1000 patient-days after completion of the second week of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the presence of vegetations on echocardiography was not associated with a significantly higher risk for embolus in patients with left-sided native valve infective endocarditis. The relative risk for embolic events associated with echocardiographically visualized vegetations may be microorganism-dependent, with a significantly increased risk seen only in patients with viridans streptococcal infection. The rate of embolic events declines with time after initiation of antimicrobial treatment. 
4	Regurgitation of fat and marrow emboli into coronary veins during resuscitation. Three groups of patients were examined at autopsy for the presence of fat and marrow emboli in the lungs, heart, and other organs. Group 1 was composed of patients with massive pulmonary thromboembolism and attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation; group 2, patients with pulmonary thromboembolism and without attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and group 3, patients without pulmonary thromboembolism and with attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The results confirm that pulmonary fat and marrow emboli are frequent in those patients who are resuscitated. A novel observation is the finding of multiple coexistent cardiac venous emboli in those resuscitated patients who have pulmonary artery obstruction with pulmonary thromboemboli. These findings suggest that these emboli regurgitate from the right side of the heart to the coronary sinus and cardiac veins in cases of pulmonary artery hypertension. 
5	Late onset adrenal hyperplasia: mutation at codon 282 of the functional 21-hydroxylase gene is not ubiquitous. Ten patients affected with 21-hydroxylase (21-OH) deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia were studied to determine the prevalence of a mutation at codon 281 of the functional 21-OH gene (CYP21B) that results in a valine to leucine amino acid shift. This mutation has been reported in eight unrelated late-onset adrenal hyperplasia patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent possessing the human leukocyte antigen-B14,DR1 haplotype. Normally, there are two 21-OH genes; a pseudogene (CYP21A) and a functional gene (CYP21B). The aberrant codon 281 sequence is normally present only in CYP21A. In all of our late-onset adrenal hyperplasia patients, hybridization of an oligonucleotide probe specific for this mutation was demonstrated to CYP21A but not to CYP21B. The mutation at codon 281 of CYP21B does not appear to be a ubiquitous genetic marker for 21-OH deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia, suggesting that this disorder may demonstrate the same molecular heterogeneity as congenital adrenal hyperplasia. 
5	Hemifacial spasm caused by a spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the vertebral artery. Case report. The authors describe the first reported case of dissecting aneurysm presenting with hemifacial spasm. The patient was a 58-year-old woman with left hemifacial spasm of 2 years' duration. Cranial nerve examination was otherwise normal and no other clinical symptoms were observed. Vertebral angiography revealed a fusiform enlargement of the left vertebral artery and contrast medium remaining in the intramural false lumen in the venous phase. Microvascular decompression of the facial nerve with wrapping of the aneurysm resulted in complete relief of the hemifacial spasm. 
1	Incorporation of 12-methoxydodecanoate into the human immunodeficiency virus 1 gag polyprotein precursor inhibits its proteolytic processing and virus production in a chronically infected human lymphoid cell line. Covalent linkage of myristate (tetradecanoate; 14:0) to the NH2-terminal glycine residue of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) 55-kDa gag polyprotein precursor (Pr55gag) is necessary for its proteolytic processing and viral assembly. We have shown recently that several analogs of myristate in which a methylene group is replaced by a single oxygen or sulfur atom are substrates for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.97; NMT) despite their reduced hydrophobicity. Some inhibit HIV-1 replication in acutely infected CD4+H9 cells without accompanying cellular toxicity. To examine the mechanism of their antiviral effects, we performed labeling studies with two analogs, 12-methoxydodecanoate (13-oxamyristate; 13-OxaMyr) and 5-octyloxypentanoate (6-oxamyristate; 6-OxaMyr), the former being much more effective than the latter in blocking virus production. [3H]Myristate and [3H]13-OxaMyr were incorporated into Pr55gag with comparable efficiency when it was coexpressed with S. cerevisiae NMT in Escherichia coli. [3H]6-OxaMyr was not incorporated, even though its substrate properties in vitro were similar to those of 13-OxaMyr and myristate. [3H]13-OxaMyr, but not [3H]6-OxaMyr, was also efficiently incorporated into HIV-1 Pr55gag and nef (negative factor) in chronically infected H9 cells. Analog incorporation produced a redistribution of Pr55gag from membrane to cytosolic fractions and markedly decreased its proteolytic processing by viral protease. 13-OxaMyr and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) act synergistically to reduce virus production in acutely infected H9 cells. Unlike AZT, the analog is able to inhibit virus production (up to 70%) in chronically infected H9 cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effect lasts 6-8 days. These results suggest that (i) its mechanism of action is distinct from that of AZT and involves a late step in virus assembly; (ii) the analog may allow reduction in the dose of AZT required to affect viral replication; and (iii) combinations of analog and HIV-1 protease inhibitors may have synergistic effects on the processing of Pr55gag. 
5	Cells derived from omental fat tissue and used for seeding vascular prostheses are not endothelial in origin. A study on the origin of epitheloid cells derived from omentum. The use of microvascular endothelial cells derived from omental tissue has been advocated to seed vascular grafts with autologous endothelial cells in high density. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the precise origin of these cells. Therefore we have compared cellular characteristics of these cells with those of endothelial cells isolated by collagenase treatment of human umbilical veins. The omental cells were isolated from from omental tissue from four different patients by incubation in a collagenase-dispase solution. Part of the material was processed by Percoll density gradient centrifugation in an attempt to purify the isolates. Cellular characteristics of both types of cells were determined by studying the morphologic features of the cells and by determining the presence of von Willebrand factor, antigens EN-4 and PAL-E specific for endothelial cells, cytokeratins 8 and 18, vimentin and desmin, and uptake of diI-acetylated low-density lipoprotein. Epitheloid cells from omental tissue, isolated after collagenase treatment and either purified or nonpurified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, differed from human umbilical vein endothelial cells with respect to the presence of surface microvilli, the expression of von Willebrand factor, EN-4 and PAL-E, and the presence of cytokeratins 8 and 18 and desmin. von Willebrand factor (in a granular staining pattern) and the presence of EN-4 and PAL-E were only detected in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Vimentin was present in both cell types, whereas cytokeratins 8 and 18 and desmin were only present in cells derived from omentum. From these data we conclude that the so called microvascular endothelial cells from omentum are not endothelial but mesothelial in nature. 
1	Doppler ultrasonography of malignant melanomas of the uvea. Doppler shifts were detected using duplex and color Doppler scanning in 41 of 42 patients with malignant melanomas of the uvea. Mean maximum tumor systolic velocity was 18.8 +/- 7.6 cm/s. Time-averaged maximum velocity in the tumor vessels was 12.3 +/- 5.3 cm/s. Maximum tumor velocity increased in four of eight tumors and was unchanged or had diminished in the other four 2 to 3 days after ruthenium plaque irradiation. Doppler shifts were undetectable in three tumors, markedly reduced in three tumors, and unchanged in one tumor 1 to 4 months after treatment. We detected minimal non-pulse-synchronized Doppler shifts in one of three tumors, and no shifts in the remaining two tumors 1 1/2 to 4 years after therapy. Color duplex scanning allowed a rapid overview of tumor vasculature and facilitated study of individual vessels. 
5	Ultrastructural study of Norrie's disease. We studied the clinicopathologic and ultrastructural features of a full-term infant with Norrie's disease. The infant had bilateral retrolental fibrous vascular masses and retinal detachment with no other apparent physical abnormalities and no family history of ocular defects. A vitrectomy and a membrane peeling were attempted, and specimens of the retina, the retrolental membrane, and a vascularized epiretinal peripheral mass were examined by light and electron microscopy. The retrolental membrane was composed of layered collagenous tissue and contained structures resembling blood vessels. Inner and outer neuroblastic layers were identified in the retinal tissue, but no vessels were present. In the epiretinal mass, portions of retina and cortical vitreous were seen along with primitive vascular structures. The histologic appearance of these specimens suggests that the major pathologic event of Norrie's disease occurs in the retina in the third to fourth gestational month. We believe the subsequent ocular abnormalities found in this patient were secondary to this early retinal malformation and did not represent a progressive ocular disorder. 
1	Use of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements to show clonal lymphoproliferation in hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly In Africa, hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS), which is also known as tropical splenomegaly syndrome, can be associated with a prominent lymphocytosis in blood and bone marrow that is difficult to distinguish clinically from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). The observation that some patients with HMS become resistant to treatment with anti-malarial drugs has led to the suggestion that HMS may evolve into a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder. To test this hypothesis, 22 Ghanaian patients with HMS and/or lymphocytosis were categorised by degree of response to proguanil according to standard clinical criteria, and DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells and screened for rearrangements of the Jh region of the immunoglobulin gene with a DNA probe. Clonal rearrangements of the Jh region were found in all 3 patients with no response, in none of 13 patients with sustained response, and in 2 of 6 patients with moderate response or relapse on proguanil therapy. The detection of such rearrangements, and hence clonal lymphoproliferation in individuals with clinical features intermediate between HMS and CLL, supports the hypothesis that HMS may evolve into a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder. 
4	Sustained reduction in valvular regurgitation and atrial volumes with tailored vasodilator therapy in advanced congestive heart failure secondary to dilated (ischemic or idiopathic) cardiomyopathy. Afterload reduction therapy can acutely improve hemodynamic function in patients with advanced heart failure; however, it is unknown if initial reductions in mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and atrial volumes can be sustained with oral therapy. Atrial volumes and atrioventricular valve regurgitation were measured using 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography with color-flow imaging in 14 patients with dilated heart failure (ejection fraction 17 +/- 4%) before and after 3 +/- 1 days of intensive vasodilator and diuretic therapy tailored to hemodynamic goals. Echocardiography was repeated again after 6 +/- 2 months on oral vasodilators and a flexible diuretic regimen. Acute therapy reduced systemic vascular resistance from 1,760 +/- 460 to 1,010 +/- 310 dynes.s.cm-5, pulmonary artery wedge pressure from 30 +/- 5 to 17 +/- 4 mm Hg, and right atrial pressure from 13 +/- 5 to 7 +/- 3 mm Hg, and led to a 61% increase in stroke volume (from 36 +/- 10 to 58 +/- 14 ml) (p less than 0.01). Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, determined by color-flow fraction, initially decreased from 0.34 +/- 0.17 to 0.20 +/- 0.20 and from 0.33 +/- 0.15 to 0.13 +/- 0.13, respectively (p less than 0.001). This reduction was sustained at 6 months. Significant decreases occurred with acute therapy, with further reductions at 6 months in both mean left atrial volume (from 100 +/- 25 to 80 +/- 19 to 65 +/- 15 cm3) and right atrial volume (from 85 +/- 23 to 64 +/- 23 to 52 +/- 14 cm3) (p less than 0.001). 
4	Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: the Harborview experience. During the last decade (1980 to 1989) 186 patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm were admitted to a single urban hospital. Ninety-six percent of these patients had a prehospital systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. Management included paramedic field resuscitation and transport, an emergency department diagnostic protocol completed in an average of 12 minutes, rapid transport to a dedicated emergency operating room, aneurysmorrhaphy by general surgery chief residents under the supervision of specialist vascular surgeons, and skilled postoperative intensive care unit care. Nevertheless, 130 (70%) patients died in the first 30 postoperative days--3% in the emergency department, 13% in the operating room, 51% in the intensive care unit, and 3% on the ward or at home. Certain features--age greater than 80 years, female gender, persistent preoperative hypotension despite aggressive crystalloid and blood replacement, admission hematocrit less than 25, transfusion requirements exceeding 15 units--were associated with a greater than 90% likelihood of death. No patient with preoperative cardiac arrest survived more than 24 hours. From this experience we conclude that, although "optimal" prehospital, emergency department, operating room, and postoperative care can improve the outcome of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in shock, most such patients will die. Certain clinical features predict such excessive mortality rates after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms that withholding operation may be reasonable. Screening of patients at high risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm, followed by elective aneurysmorrhaphy, is clearly indicated. 
5	Fetal choroid plexus cysts: a prospective study and review of the literature. To determine the incidence and significance of fetal choroid plexus cysts, a prospective study was carried out at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham. The incidence of cysts was found to be 0.42% and the size of cysts varied from 3 to 13 mm with a mean diameter of 6.2 mm. Choroid plexus cysts were associated with other fetal abnormalities in three cases, two of which were subsequently found to have a chromosomal abnormality, one Trisomy 18 and one Trisomy 21. A review of the reported cases of choroid plexus cysts reveals an overall incidence of 5.8% for Trisomy 18. We therefore recommend that in patients with choroid plexus cysts a detailed scan should be carried out to look for the ultrasound markers of Trisomy 18. If there is an associated abnormality or cysts are large (13 mm or greater in diameter) and bilateral then a karyotyping should be carried out. 
3	Cerebrospinal fluid as a reflector of central cholinergic and amino acid neurotransmitter activity in cerebellar ataxia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amino acid neurotransmitters, related compounds, and their precursors, choline levels, and acetylcholinesterase activity were measured in the CSF of patients with cerebellar ataxia during a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial of physostigmine salicylate. The CSF gamma-aminobutyric acid, methionine, and choline levels, adjusted for age, were significantly lower in patients with cerebellar ataxia compared with controls. Physostigmine selectively reduced the level of CSF isoleucine and elevated the levels of phosphoethanolamine. No change occurred in CSF acetylcholinesterase activity and in the levels of plasma amino compounds in patients with cerebellar ataxia when compared with controls. Median ataxia scores did not statistically differ between placebo and physostigmine nor did functional improvement occur in any of the patients. 
5	Hexamethonium and midazolam terminate dysrhythmias and hypertension caused by intracerebroventricular bupivacaine in rabbits. Previous studies have demonstrated that bupivacaine administered directly into the central nervous system (CNS) is capable of producing signs of bupivacaine cardiovascular toxicity. To investigate the mechanisms by which bupivacaine may act within the CNS to produce cardiovascular toxicity, we studied four groups of halothane-anesthetized rabbits in which infusion of intracerebroventricular (icv) bupivacaine or intravenous (iv) phenylephrine resulted in dysrhythmias and hypertension. In group 1 (n = 5), icv bupivacaine (500 +/- 79 micrograms [mean +/- SEM]) produced dysrhythmias lasting 73 +/- 13 min, whereas icv saline caused no dysrhythmias or hypertension. In group 2 (n = 9), icv bupivacaine-induced hypertension and dysrhythmias were abolished by icv midazolam in 4.4 +/- 0.6 min, and when dysrhythmias and hypertension recurred (22 +/- 0.9 min), hexamethonium (10 mg/kg iv) promptly terminated dysrhythmias and hypertension (14 +/- 1 s). In group 3 (n = 10), icv bupivacaine-induced dysrhythmias and hypertension were not affected by increasing the inspired halothane concentration from 0.8 to 1.6%. In group 4 (n = 6), iv phenylephrine-induced dysrhythmias and hypertension were not affected by icv midazolam. These results suggest that icv bupivacaine produces dysrhythmias and hypertension by increasing autonomic nervous system (ANS) outflow from the brain stem. The finding that peripheral autonomic blockade by hexamethonium rapidly terminated dysrhythmias and hypertension supports this mechanism. We speculate that icv bupivacaine produces an increase in autonomic outflow by blockade of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons that are known to be the principal tonic inhibitors of the ANS. 
2	Primary adrenal insufficiency: a new cause of reversible gastric stasis. Primary adrenal insufficiency is known to cause a wide spectrum of sometimes severe upper gastrointestinal symptoms; however, it has not previously been shown to be the cause of reversible gastric stasis. We have documented such a case in which the symptoms and physiologic abnormalities associated with gastric stasis were reversed by steroid replacement. A follow-up radionuclide gastric-emptying study after physiologic steroid replacement showed complete normalization of gastric emptying. Although gastric stasis has long been suspected of being present with primary adrenal insufficiency, this represents the first case in which it has been documented, and so should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic nausea and vomiting. 
5	Follow-up recatheterization after balloon aortic valvuloplasty. Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry Investigators. The results of recatheterization were assessed in a select group of 95 patients enrolled in the Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry to determine whether any procedural or patient-related variables at baseline predicted either initial immediate or follow-up (6.2 +/- 3.3 months) results. At the follow-up catheterization, 39 (41%) of the patients were in improved condition and 56 patients (59%) had recurrence of symptoms, allowing for analysis of the effect of the procedure in two symptomatic patient subsets. In the total group the aortic valve area increased initially from 0.56 +/- 0.16 to 0.87 +/- 0.27 cm2 but partial return to the baseline valve area was evident at follow-up (0.63 +/- 0.25 cm2). Similarly, the mean aortic gradient initially decreased from 72 +/- 30 to 35 +/- 16 mm Hg but then increased to 55 +/- 25 mm Hg at follow-up. Neither the initial nor the late hemodynamic results appeared affected by any definable procedural variable at the time of valvuloplasty, including the maximal diameter of balloons, number of balloons simultaneously used, mean inflation time or total number of inflations. Such technical concerns also did not seem to affect short- or long-term outcome. Similarly, no baseline hemodynamic variable clearly separated those who became increasingly symptomatic from those whose condition was improved at the 6 month interval. At recatheterization, a reduction in the aortic valve area toward baseline was observed in 24 (62%) of the 39 improved patients and in 45 (80%) of the 56 who were symptomatic. 
4	Dilated and contracted forms of primary endocardial fibroelastosis: a single fetal disease with two stages of development. Left ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis was diagnosed by echocardiographic scanning in a fetus at 20 weeks' gestation. Repeated prenatal examination over the next 20 weeks' gestation showed the development of the left ventricle from a chamber with a dilated cavity to a small cavity with a very thick wall. These findings were confirmed at necropsy and by the absence of other morphological anomalies. The contracted form of primary fibroelastosis in the fetus must have followed an insult that prevented any further increase in the size of the left ventricular cavity. 
1	The influence of autologous lymphokine-activated killer cell infusions on the toxicity and antitumor effect of repetitive cycles of interleukin-2. Twenty patients with refractory malignancies were treated with a protocol evaluating the addition of ex vivo-activated autologous lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells to a clinically tolerable interleukin-2 (IL-2) regimen (four weekly cycles of human recombinant IL-2 at 3 x 10(6) U/m2/day by continuous infusion for 4 days/week). Sixteen patients completed their induction month of therapy, two had a partial response, six had stable disease, and eight had progressive disease. Four patients had clinical toxicity preventing completion of the induction month of therapy, and one of these patients died during therapy. Significant clinical toxicities included decreased performance status, weight gain, catheter-related thromboses, infectious complications, fever, hypotension, and dyspnea or hypoxemia requiring oxygen. Thus, the addition of LAK cell infusions to this IL-2 regimen did not cause a noticeable change in antitumor response rate but did not cause more severe toxicity. 
5	Angioscopic coronary macromorphology in patients with acute coronary disorders. To investigate the pathogenesis of acute coronary disorders and to clarify what type of plaque precedes these disorders, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioscopy, by means of a new angioscope, was carried out during catheterisation in 100 consecutive patients anatomically suitable for such investigations. The quality of the angioscopic image was good enough for analysis in 84 patients (14 with acute myocardial infarction [within 8 h of onset], 16 with recent myocardial infarction [3 days-2 months since onset], 24 with old myocardial infarctions, 10 with unstable angina, and 20 with stable angina). Thrombi were observed in most patients with acute coronary disorders (all 14 with acute myocardial infarction, 9 of 10 with unstable angina). Occlusive thrombi were more common in patients with acute myocardial infarction than in those with unstable angina (11 [79%] vs 1 [10%]; p less than 0.001), whereas mural (non-occlusive) thrombi were more common in the unstable angina than in the acute myocardial infarction group (8 [80%] vs 3 [21%]; p less than 0.001). Xanthomatous ulcerated plaques or ragged irregular surfaces were seen in patients with acute coronary disorders and in those with recent myocardial infarction. Xanthomatous plaques were more common in patients with acute coronary disorders (50%) than in those with stable angina (15%) or old myocardial infarction (8%). By contrast white and smooth plaques were seen in cases of stable angina and old myocardial infarction. Angioscopy could display the intracoronary lumen more precisely than could coronary arteriography. This angioscopic study suggested that, although a thrombus overlying a rupture in the lining of the plaque was common in both unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction, the character of the thrombus may differ between these disorders, and lipid-rich xanthomatous plaque may precede rupture. 
4	Comparison of pre- and postoperative conduction patterns in patients surgically cured of atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia. Patients with atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia characteristically have short and constant retrograde His-atrium conduction times (H2A2 intervals) during the introduction of ventricular extrastimuli. It has therefore been suggested that the tachycardia circuit involves retrograde conduction up an accessory pathway located in perinodal tissue. If the mechanism of surgical cure of AV node reentrant tachycardia is interruption of this accessory pathway, postoperative changes in retrograde conduction would be expected. Thirteen patients with drug-refractory AV node reentrant tachycardia underwent surgery. Preoperatively, H2A2 intervals were short and constant. During AV node reentrant tachycardia, earliest atrial activation was seen near the His bundle and was 0 to 25 ms before ventricular activation in all patients except one. Surgery consisted of dissection of right atrial septal and anterior inputs to the AV node and central fibrous body. Postoperatively, the H2A2 interval remained short and constant compared with preoperative values although it was slightly prolonged (74 +/- 18 versus 61 +/- 21 ms, p less than 0.005). Twelve of the 13 patients are free of tachycardia after 28 +/- 13 months and no patient has had evidence of AV node block. Thus, surgical cure of AV node reentrant tachycardia is highly successful; however, there is no reason to postulate an accessory pathway or use of perinodal tissue as part of the tachycardia circuit and the mechanism of surgical success remains obscure. 
2	Defective jejunal brush border membrane sodium/proton exchange in association with lethal familial protracted diarrhoea. The spectrum of clinical disease associated with specific defects in jejunal brush border membrane sodium/proton exchange is poorly defined and only two patients have been described so far. Jejunal brush border membrane transport studies were performed in a boy who presented with lethal familial protracted diarrhoea in the first few days of life. Using jejunal brush border membrane vesicles prepared from conventional jejunal biopsy specimens, initial sodium uptake under H+ gradient conditions was found to be only 6% of the mean control value. In contrast, sodium stimulated glucose uptake was normal. Our data confirm the importance of a congenital defect in this exchanger as a cause of severe sodium-losing diarrhoea and extend the spectrum of disorders characterised by a specific defect in brush border membrane Na+/H+ exchange to include some forms of lethal familial protracted diarrhoea. 
4	On the inheritance of abdominal aortic aneurysm. To determine the mode of inheritance of abdominal aortic aneurysm, data on first-degree relatives of 91 probands were collected. Results of segregation analysis performed on these data are reported. Many models, including nongenetic and genetic models, were compared using likelihood methods. The nongenetic model was rejected; statistically significant evidence in favor of a genetic model was found. Among the many genetic models compared, the most parsimonious genetic model was that susceptibility to abdominal aortic aneurysm is determined by a recessive gene at an autosomal diallelic major locus. A multifactorial component in addition to the major locus does not increase the likelihood of the data significantly. 
4	Experimental isobaric subarachnoid hemorrhage: regional mitochondrial function during the acute and late phase. Patients treated for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage show, in the long-term follow up, an elevated rate of cognitive disturbances that are mainly related to the impact of the initial bleeding: the neurotoxic effects of blood deposition in subarachnoidal spaces may result in a diffuse encephalopathy, but the intrinsic mechanism and the biochemical correlates are not known. In the present study we have evaluated mitochondrial function after experimental induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Mitochondrial function was evaluated in four different rat brain areas (frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus, and brain stem) after experimental isobaric subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced by injecting 0.07 mL of arterial autologous blood into the cisterna magna. Intracranial pressure did not significantly increase. The nonsynaptic mitochondrial fraction was isolated from different rat brain areas, and the maximal rate of enzymatic reactions of some key enzymatic activities related to the Krebs cycle [nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD+)-isocitrate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase] and of the electron transfer chain (cytochrome oxidase) were evaluated. The nonsynaptic mitochondrial fraction was utilized also to check parameters related to the mitochondrial respiration: state 3, state 4, uncoupled state, respiratory control ratio, and adenosine 5'-diphosphate/oxygen ratio. The biochemical parameters were measured at 1 and 72 hours after the subarachnoidal injection of blood. Subarachnoid hemorrhage did not affect the mitochondrial enzymatic activities both at 1 and 72 hours, while the mitochondrial enzymatic activities parameters were significantly affected: in particular, a significant decrease of respiratory control ratio in all tested brain areas was demonstrated. The increased mitochondrial vulnerability in the delayed phases could be one of the biochemical correlates of post-hemorrhagic encephalopathy. 
4	Cerebral venous thrombosis due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. A patient with polycythemia vera who was treated with heparin for superficial septic thrombophlebitis developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and cerebral venous thrombosis with superior sagittal sinus occlusion 11 days after the institution of heparin therapy. We suggest that the severe thrombotic response to the heparin-induced platelet disorder in this patient occurred because the polycythemia vera and the purulent infection enhanced the thrombophilia caused by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. This condition can be avoided in most instances if heparin is used for no longer than 5 days. 
5	Critical review of gangliosides and thyrotropin-releasing hormone in peripheral neuromuscular diseases. The lack of effective therapy for many of the chronic neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), spinocerebellar degenerations and idiopathic polyneuropathy has led to a search for substances that may stimulate peripheral nerve regeneration. Two such agents that have been proposed are gangliosides (mixed purified bovine brain gangliosides, Cronassial) and thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH). Studies on both of these agents were initially reported with enthusiasm to be successful, but later double-blind controlled studies have failed to confirm these findings. This review provides critical analysis of the designs of studies of potentially effective agents in chronic neuromuscular diseases, and emphasizes the power of the placebo response, and the importance of designing placebos which are indistinguishable from the trial medication other than in the active effect. 
1	Cellular and molecular basis of the asbestos-related diseases. Asbestosis is an inflammatory and fibrotic process of the alveolar structures mediated, at least in part, by cytokines released by "activated" alveolar macrophages. The process of phagocytosis and "activation" of alveolar macrophages is poorly understood. Are all macrophages activated or only subpopulations? Which cytokines are up-regulated? How does the local milieu modulate profibrotic and antifibrotic mediators? Is protein release accompanied by up-regulation of gene transcription? Is there an ordered sequence of cytokine activity? What roles do neutrophils and lymphocytes play? How can disease progression best be quantified absent further exposure? Answers to these questions are important to direct rational strategies at interdicting the fibrotic process. The question of cancer and asbestos is more vexing. The processes of inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis appear to be closely intertwined. For example, proto-oncogenes such as c-sis (PDGF B-chain) are up-regulated in activated alveolar macrophages from fibrotic lungs; these and possibly others may play an important role in asbestos carcinogenesis. Second, asbestos can transfect DNA into cells. Furthermore, DNA can adhere to asbestos fibers, and these fibers are capable of direct transmigration into cells. The questions of the mechanisms of cigarette smoke cocarcinogenicity and latency remain. Lastly, if the bronchial epithelium is highly metaplastic throughout from cigarette smoking, what triggers a single (or several) nidus of cells to transform into carcinoma? Malignant mesothelioma poses the most challenging questions because of association with brief asbestos exposure by history. Mesothelial cells are susceptible to minute environmental manipulations, and changes occur after exposure to all fiber types. Yet epidemiologic studies point toward long amphiboles as having greater mesothelioma risk. To test this hypothesis, experimental data must be generated differentiating tumorigenesis risk from short, chrysotile fibers that can migrate to the parietal pleura from the associations of long amphiboles persisting in lung tissue. Despite the future decreasing numbers of clinical cases of asbestos-related disease, solving the important mechanistic questions remaining will contribute significantly to our understanding of fibrosis and cancer. 
3	Clinical, radiographic, and pathological features of symptomatic Rathke's cleft cysts. The clinical, radiographic, and pathological findings in 155 patients with symptomatic Rathke's cleft cysts are discussed. Eight patients were treated by the authors and 147 were collected in a review of the literature. This lesion occurred more often in female than male patients by a 2:1 margin, and the mean age at presentation was 38 years. The average patient had been symptomatic for nearly 3 years at the time of treatment, with the most common symptoms and signs being pituitary dysfunction, visual disturbances, and headaches. Affected children generally were pituitary dwarfs. The sella was enlarged in 80% of cases, and the cyst was situated in both an intrasellar and a suprasellar location in 71%. Computerized tomography revealed a low-density cystic mass with capsular enhancement in one-half of the cases. A variable appearance was seen with magnetic resonance imaging. Partial excision and drainage of the cyst by the transsphenoidal approach is the recommended treatment, as the recurrence rate is low. Most symptoms and signs improved or resolved following surgery with the exception of hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. The cyst lining was usually composed of ciliated cuboidal or columnar epithelium. Theories as to the origin of Rathke's cleft cysts are also discussed. 
5	Papillary endothelial hyperplasia in the thyroid following fine-needle aspiration. A 74-year-old woman was found to have exuberant papillary endothelial hyperplasia within her thyroid gland subsequent to multiple fine-needle aspiration biopsies of a Hurthle cell neoplasm. To our knowledge, this histologic alteration in the thyroid has not been previously reported. We describe this unusual complication following fine-needle aspiration, and we delineate the clinicopathologic and differential diagnostic features. 
5	Disseminated human malignant melanoma in congenitally immune-deficient (bg/nu/xid) mice. Congenitally immune-deficient bg/nu/xid (BNX) mice are severely compromised in their ability to mount T-cell, B-cell, and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell responses. Successful engraftment of BNX mice with human hematopoietic stem cells has been demonstrated recently. We have investigated the potential use of BNX mice for studies relating to the biology and immunotherapy of human malignant melanoma. The intravenous injection of fresh single-cell suspensions of human malignant melanomas into mice resulted in widely disseminated disease. Metastatic spread of human melanoma in BNX mice mimicked that observed in patients: eg, there were numerous tumor nodules identified in the subcutaneous tissues as well as in a variety of visceral organs, including spleen, kidneys, thyroid, adrenals, lungs, heart, and brain. BNX mouse lymph nodes were replaced consistently by human malignant melanoma cells. The presence of human tumor cells in these mice was confirmed by histologic analysis and microcytofluorometry analyses using human melanoma-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Moreover, human melanoma cells passaged in BNX mice remained lysable in vitro by specifically cytolytic, autologous human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The capacity of fresh human malignant melanoma to disseminate widely in BNX mice may prove valuable not only for study of the biology of metastatic spread but also for studies of the immunotherapy of human melanoma using melanoma-specific MAbs and chemotherapeutic agents, as well as human TILs and LAK cells with or without retrovirus-mediated gene transfer modification. 
4	Evidence of hibernating myocardium by a new transesophageal echocardiographic technique. Reversal of resting wall motion abnormalities after successful coronary angioplasty were documented in a patient with the use of a novel approach to stress testing. Transesophageal stress echocardiography utilizes transesophageal atrial pacing to provoke myocardial ischemia while the left ventricular contractility is being monitored by means of transesophageal echocardiography. The potential use of this technique is illustrated in this report. 
5	Bleeding ectatic vascular lesion involving the sigmoid colon, endoscopically indistinguishable from angiodysplasia, in an 8-yr-old boy. An 8-yr-old Japanese boy was hospitalized, complaining of active hematochezia. He was shown to have a cherry-red, blood-oozing area of vascular dilation with mucosal prominence in the sigmoid colon by endoscopy, but had no other mucocutaneous vascular abnormalities. A family history was noncontributory. Under the clinical diagnosis of angiodysplasia of the sigmoid colon, he underwent an elliptical resection of the part, based on the intraoperative endoscopic findings. However, histological examination of the surgical specimen revealed a totally different picture from that seen in angiodysplasia: the thin-walled, markedly ectatic, nontortuous veins with hemorrhage were seen only just below the muscularis mucosae, around which the normal ones were shown to coexist. He has had no rebleeding for the past 3 yr. This lesion is considered to be an isolated congenital visceral telangiectasia involving veins. 
3	Pre-trigeminal neuralgia. Eighteen patients who subsequently developed typical trigeminal neuralgia experienced a prodromal pain termed "pre-trigeminal neuralgia." These patients described their prodromal pain as a toothache or sinusitis-like pain lasting up to several hours, sometimes triggered by jaw movements or by drinking hot or cold liquids. Typical trigeminal neuralgia developed a few days to 12 years later, and in all cases affected the same division of the trigeminal nerve. Six additional patients experiencing what appeared to be pre-trigeminal neuralgia became pain-free when taking carbamazepine or baclofen. Recognition of pretrigeminal neuralgia makes it possible to relieve the pain with appropriate medications and avoid unnecessary irreversible dental procedures. 
2	Ten years' experience with an elemental diet in the management of Crohn's disease. The immediate and longterm outcome of treating patients with acute Crohn's disease with an elemental diet was studied retrospectively. Successful diet induced remission was achieved in 96 of 113 patients (85%) regardless of age, sex, site or severity of disease, or associated complications of strictures, fistula, or perianal disease. Treatment was unsuccessful in 17 patients (15%), but there were no features at the outset of treatment that distinguished these patients from those who had successful remission. The longterm outcome of treatment was assessed over a five year period by analysis of life tables and survival curves. Twenty two per cent of the patients relapsed within six months of treatment and thereafter the annual relapse rate was 8-10%. Patients with disease complicated by fistula or perianal involvement had early relapse, approaching 100% for the latter. A further retrospective comparison of longterm outcome of diet v steroid induced remissions showed no significant difference in the relapse rates between the two groups at one, three, and five years. 
1	Ocular melanoma in families with dysplastic nevus syndrome. Five families with the dysplastic nevus syndrome, in each of which one member had ocular melanoma, are reported. These five families were examined within a 3-year period in one medical center. To date only five other families with such a combination have been reported. We suggest a causal relation between ocular melanoma and the familial dysplastic nevus syndrome. 
1	Chromogranin A storage and secretion: sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Chromogranin A, co-stored and co-released with catecholamines from adrenal medullary and sympathetic neuronal vesicles, is elevated in the plasma of patients with pheochromocytoma. The usefulness of the hormone in the differential diagnosis of hypertension is examined. An elevated level of chromogranin A had comparable diagnostic sensitivity (83%, 24/29) to, but greater diagnostic specificity (96%, 86/90) than the level of plasma catecholamines when subjects with pheochromocytoma (n = 29) were evaluated in comparison to several reference groups, including normotensive controls (n = 49), subjects with essential hypertension (n = 28), subjects with renovascular hypertension (n = 5), and subjects with primary aldosteronism (n = 3). Subjects with signs or symptoms suggesting pheochromocytoma, but in whom the diagnosis was ultimately ruled out (n = 5) had normal plasma levels of chromogranin A. A modest rise in chromogranin A in those with essential hypertension, and correlation of chromogranin A with diastolic blood pressure in normotensive patients and patients with essential hypertension did not impair the diagnostic usefulness of chromogranin A for pheochromocytoma. Renal failure was associated with an elevated plasma chromogranin A independently of blood pressure. Plasma chromogranin A correlated with tumor mass, tumor chromogranin A content, tumor norepinephrine content, and urinary vanillylmandelic acid excretion; it did not correlate with plasma or urinary catecholamines, nor with blood pressure in patients with pheochromocytoma. Plasma chromogranin A levels did not differ in subjects with pheochromocytoma when stratified by age, sex, tumor location, or tumor pathology. Several drugs used in the diagnosis or treatment of pheochromocytoma (clonidine, metoprolol, phentolamine, and tyramine) had little effect on plasma chromogranin A concentration. Within the pheochromocytoma, chromogranin A was localized along with catecholamines to the soluble core of chromaffin granules, where it accounted for 18 +/- 5% of vesicle soluble protein. We conclude that 1) chromogranin A emerges along with catecholamines from pheochromocytoma chromaffin granules; 2) plasma chromogranin A is a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool in evaluation of actual or suspected pheochromocytoma; 3) plasma chromogranin A predicts pheochromocytoma tumor size and overall catecholamine production; and 4) drugs commonly employed in the diagnosis or treatment of pheochromocytoma have little effect on plasma chromogranin A level, preserving the usefulness of chromogranin A in evaluating pheochromocytoma. Thus, measurement of chromogranin A provides a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. 
1	Antigen-induced cross-linking of the IgE receptor leads to an association with the detergent-insoluble membrane skeleton of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. Cross-linking of the IgE receptor on the surface of rat basophilic leukemia cells by multivalent Ag (DNP-BSA) causes a rapid conversion to a detergent-insoluble form. There is a concurrent increase in the amount of filamentous actin associated with the plasma membrane. Both the degree of receptor detergent insolubility and the rise in F-actin content are rapid with a half-maximal response of less than 1 min and can be rapidly reversed by the addition of monovalent Ag (DNP-lysine). These two early steps in the triggering of rat basophilic leukemia cells can be dissociated from each other by pretreatment of the cells with either cytochalasin or sodium azide. These reagents block the increase in F-actin but have no effect on receptor detergent insolubility. This indicates that microfilaments are not responsible for detergent insolubility of the receptor and that it may be the membrane skeleton that is interacting with the complex. This was further confirmed by the finding that cross-linking of the IgE receptors on the surface of purified plasma membranes also leads to detergent insolubility of the receptor. Therefore, all of the components necessary for detergent insolubility of the receptor are present in the plasma membrane, and cytoplasmic components are not needed. These results suggest that detergent insolubility and immobility of the cross-linked receptors are caused by multivalent interaction with the membrane skeleton. Actin filaments may then interact with these receptor-membrane skeletal complexes in order to produce large scale clustering and capping. The membrane skeleton may therefore be acting as an intermediate structure between the cell-surface receptors and microfilaments. 
1	Dimerization of mammalian progesterone receptors occurs in the absence of DNA and is related to the release of the 90-kDa heat shock protein. In this study we have demonstrated that dimerization of mammalian progesterone receptors (PR) occurs in the absence of DNA. A specific immune coisolation assay was performed on extracts of T-47D human breast cancer cells with a monoclonal antibody specific for the full-length B form of progesterone receptor (PR-B). This resulted in coisolation of significant amounts of truncated form-A receptors (PR-A), indicating the presence of stable PR-A.PR-B dimers in solution. A positive correlation was observed between the ability of different receptor forms to oligomerize in solution and their ability to bind to specific DNA sequences. The ability to form stable PR-A.PR-B oligomers in the absence of DNA was also found to correlate with release of 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) from the unactivated PR complex. These results support the hypothesis that dimerization in the absence of DNA is an important mechanism controlling receptor DNA-binding function and that hsp90 release may be a key step regulating dimerization. This suggests that hsp90 may function to repress DNA-binding activity indirectly by blocking receptor dimerization. 
1	Functional results of facial nerve suture after removal of acoustic neurinoma: analysis of 25 cases. The facial nerve is sometimes severed during the removal of acoustic neurinomas, either intentionally to ensure complete removal, or unintentionally because of difficulties in identification. In such cases we have, if possible, sutured the nerve stumps microsurgically, either end to end or by use of an intervening nerve graft. We analyzed the outcome of 25 instances of facial nerve suturing in a series of 219 patients operated on for acoustic neurinoma from 1979 to 1987. The first signs of recovery appeared at an average of 12 months, and there was continued improvement for several years. Recovery was graded from 1 to 6. The anastomosis was successful in 24 of the 25 sutured nerves, in that at least some facial movement and tone were restored (Grade 5 or higher). In 11 of the 25 cases, facial appearance at rest and with movement was moderately good (Grade 2 or 3). A Grade 1 result, with no perceivable facial dysfunction, was never achieved. Typically, oral muscles showed the most improvement and frontal muscles the least. Facial appearance was better at rest than with movement, which was always complicated by some degree of synkinesis. Closure of the eye was so good in 13 of the 25 cases that neither tarsorrhaphy nor an eyelid spring was necessary. When the facial nerve is severed, intraoperative suture is recommended, because it provides a chance for moderately good restoration of facial appearance. 
4	Essential hypertension: a sign in search of a disease. The concept of disease is of cardinal importance in medical practice. The current definition has developed over more than 200 years. It includes a distinctive natural history and identifiable cellular changes. Pickering proposed a fundamental alteration to the definition when he suggested that essential hypertension is a quantitative disease without causative cellular change distinguishing normal from abnormal. The nature of essential hypertension has been confused from the beginning because of a category error. Injury is conceptually distinguished from disease. Essential hypertension, defined as elevated blood pressure together with its cardiovascular consequences, is found to be neither an injury nor a disease according to current definitions. Instead, essential hypertension refers to a treatment group just as "the fevers" did in an earlier century. One effect on patients of the failure to resolve this diagnostic paradox is the burden of suffering from the label of "disease" rather than from a state that may be substantially due to their own behavior. A theoretical consequence of importance for psychiatric theory is that the disease status of functional disorders can no longer be defended by an appeal to the existence of a quantitative disease of blood pressure. 
5	Acute silicosis due to inhalation of a domestic product. A 20-yr-old woman with no history of pulmonary disease presented with acute dyspnea and fever. After various investigations and treatments the symptoms persisted and a lung biopsy was performed. Pathologic analysis disclosed the presence of silicotic crystals within lung tissue and mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient admitted having repeatedly inhaled a domestic scouring powder rich in silica during the preceding 6 months. This is the first report of acute pulmonary silicosis developing after exposure to a common household product. 
1	Transurethral-resection zone prostate cancer detected at cystoprostatectomy. A detailed histologic analysis and clinical implications. The authors identified incidental adenocarcinoma of the prostate in serial cross-sections of prostates from 61 of 100 patients having cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer. In 20 patients, cancer foci were in the prostatic region accessible to transurethral resection (TUR). Eight of these 20 patients had stage A1 disease (less than or equal to 3 foci); in six of these patients all foci were located at or within the transition-zone boundary only. Twelve patients had stage A2 disease (greater than 3 foci); in none were more than three foci at or within the transition-zone boundary. Among the 20 patients, 84 tumor foci were distributed as follows: 62% in the peripheral zone, 10% in the transition zone, 3% in the central zone, and 25% in the transition zone boundary. The authors' data suggest that Stage A prostate cancer, like larger clinically detectable cancers, is multifocal, multizonal, and similarly distributed with respect to the urethra. No case of Stage A1 disease would have been reclassified as Stage A2 by repeat TUR of the entire transition zone and transition zone boundary. The authors' results confirm those of previous studies that report a high incidence of residual carcinoma in regions not accessible to TUR in patients with presumptive Stage A1 disease and suggest that ultrasonography and ultrasonographically guided biopsies, rather than repeat TUR, may more accurately define the extent of Stage A disease in some patients. 
5	Fasciculations due to verapamil in a patient with neuropathy. A patient with pre-existing peripheral neuropathy developed generalized fasciculations under verapamil which ceased after discontinuation of the drug. It is suggested that the increase in acetylcholine (ACh) release at the neuromuscular junction by verapamil may trigger fasciculation in the state of regeneration at ACh-sensitive sites of axon terminals and immature axon sprouts. 
3	Persistent neutrophilic meningitis. Persistent neutrophilic meningitis is an unusual but distinct clinical variant of chronic meningitis characterized by CSF neutrophilia with hypoglycorrhachia which persists for more than 1 week on serial CSF studies. Documented etiologies include selected bacteria and higher bacteria such as Brucella, Nocardia and Actinomyces as well as "opportunistic" fungi such as Candida, Aspergillus, the Zygomycetes, and Pseudallescheria. Recognition of the syndrome is important, as empiric therapy (e.g., cotrimoxazole and amphotericin B) may differ significantly from that used for classic chronic meningitis. 
5	Microsurgical epididymovasostomy by tubule intussusception: a new technique in rat model. This experimental study on 15 adult male rats with bilateral epididymovasostomies evaluates a new technique of tubule intussusception as an improved form of end-to-end anastomosis. This paper describes in detail the steps in this technique and offers physiological, anatomical, and histological follow-up after 3 months. With this technique there is a 97% patency rate and a 23.3% incidence of macroscopic spermatic granuloma. Complications are discussed in detail. 
5	Long-term efficacy of Al3+ for prevention of bioprosthetic heart valve calcification. AI3+ preincubation has been shown in 21 and 60 day implants to inhibit calcification of glutaraldehyde preserved bovine pericardium (GPBP) in the rat subdermal model. This study was designed to assess the long-term anticalcification efficacy of GPBP AI3+ preincubation. Rat (50-60 gm, male, CD Sprague-Dawley) subdermal implants of GPBP, pretreated with 0.01 M or 0.1 M AICI3, were carried out for 21, 60, 90, and 120 days. Each explanted GPBP was analyzed for Ca2+ by atomic absorption spectroscopy and for AI3+ by atomic absorption spectroscopy or neutron activation irradiation. Results showed profound long-term (implant duration 120 days) inhibition of calcification after GPBP preincubation in 0.1 M AICI3 (Ca2+ = 21.8 +/- 12.6 micrograms/mg), compared to control (Ca2+ = 329.0 +/- 20.3 micrograms/mg). After preincubation in 0.1 M AICI3 and 21 day rat subdermal implantation, GPBP AI3+ levels declined from 9033 +/- 680 micrograms/g (control = 6.3 +/- 3.7 micrograms/g) to 2700 +/- 156 micrograms/g; however, there was no further significant decline in GPBP AI3+ levels after long-term implantation of 120 days (2618.4 +/- 349 micrograms/g). The authors conclude that GPBP preincubation in 0.1 M AICI3 markedly inhibited pathologic calcification to 7% of control values in the rat model after long-term (120 day) subdermal implantation. 
4	Peripheral vascular disorders. Assessment and intervention. Peripheral vascular diseases are being seen with increased frequency in the health care setting today. It is imperative that nurses have a clear understanding of arterial, venous, and lymphatic circulatory mechanisms as well as the pathophysiologic changes that accompany common diseases of these systems. Providing the ongoing assessment to obtain a diagnosis, establish the acute versus chronic nature of findings, monitor progression, plan care, and assess the response to treatment is an important role for the nurse in order to preserve function, life, and limb in these patients. 
1	Phase I clinical trial with floxuridine and high-dose continuous infusion of leucovorin calcium. Sixty-two patients with metastatic disease were treated with continuous infusion folinic acid (leucovorin calcium; Lv) and 2-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (floxuridine; FUDR). Lv was given by constant intravenous (IV) infusion at 500 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 6, while FUDR was given by IV push, days 2 to 6, at 3:00 PM daily with doses ranging from 294 to 1,214 mg/m2/d. This program was well tolerated with dose-limiting toxicities of diarrhea and stomatitis, while hematologic toxicity was minimal. Eighty-two percent of the assessable patients (46 of 56) had failed at least one chemotherapy regimen. One complete remission lasting 9 months and 10 partial remissions ranging from 5 to 10 months were observed in this heavily pretreated patient population for an overall response rate of 20%. These data suggest that the combination therapy with Lv and FUDR may have clinical use. Because of differing patient sensitivity to this drug combination, the recommended dose of FUDR for the initial therapy cycle is 500 mg/m2/d, days 2 to 6, with subsequent escalation to 900 mg/m2/d in those patients without extreme sensitivity. Phase II studies are now in progress with these doses. 
1	Osteoma of the middle ear. Report of a case. Osteomas of the middle ear are rare. We report a case of a 7-year-old boy with osteoma originating from the pyramidal eminence, combined with congenital cholesteatoma. The osteoma and cholesteatoma were successfully removed by tympanomastoidectomy. The long process of the incus and the superstructure of the stapes disappeared. The body of the incus was sculpted and used as a columella. Histopathologically, the osteoma was much the same as an external auditory canal osteoma. The possibility of a primary congenital origin of this neoplasm is suggested. 
5	Prospective, randomized comparison of ringed and nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypass grafts: a preliminary report. Kinking and compression with knee flexion are thought to be one cause of failure of below-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypass. To prevent this problem polytetrafluoroethylene grafts externally supported with rigid rings have been developed. The present randomized, prospective study compared ringed and nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in 122 patients who underwent femoropopliteal bypass for severe limb ischemia. Patients were well matched for surgical indications and risk factors. There was no significant difference in the 3-year graft patency rate of ringed versus nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses (74% vs 68%, p = 0.5). Similarly, no significant differences were found in the 3-year graft patency rates of ringed versus non-ringed above-knee (82% vs 74%, p = 0.5) or below-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses (68% vs 59%, p = 0.5). The 3-year graft patency rate of all above-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses was slightly greater than that of below-knee polytetrafluoroethylene femoropopliteal bypasses (76% vs 62%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.25). The 3-year limb salvage rate with ringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts was 92% compared with 79% for nonringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.25). Data to date from this study fail to support the recommendation that ringed polytetrafluoroethylene grafts be used preferentially over conventional polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in patients who require femoropopliteal bypass with a synthetic graft. 
5	Emergency aortocoronary bypass after failed angioplasty. One thousand two hundred fourteen percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties were performed over a 38-month period. Sixty patients required immediate emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after angioplasty failure; 7 of these had evidence of acute myocardial infarction before angioplasty and were excluded from the study. Of the 53 patients remaining, 27 (51%) had electrocardiographic and enzyme evidence of postoperative myocardial infarction. Two patients died (4%), and 10 had postoperative complications (19%). No statistical significance was noted comparing age, sex, incidence of prior myocardial infarction or myocardial dysfunction, time for revascularization, or average number of grafts completed in those with single-vessel (n = 21) versus multiple-vessel (n = 32) coronary artery disease. Postoperatively, those with multiple-vessel disease required intraaortic balloon pump support (p = 0.06) and antiarrhythmic medications more frequently than single-vessel patients (p less than 0.01) and had a higher complication rate (p less than 0.05). Although not reaching statistical significance, the data also suggest a higher death and postoperative myocardial infarction rate in patients with multiple-vessel disease. Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty carries a higher morbidity and mortality than elective coronary artery bypass grafting, particularly for patients with multiple-vessel coronary artery disease. 
1	A downstream initiation element required for efficient TATA box binding and in vitro function of TFIID. The gfa gene encodes glial fibrillary acidic protein, an intermediate filament protein expressed in glial cells. In vitro transcription analysis has shown that the human gfa promoter contains two initiation elements that can independently specify the transcription startpoint. One of the elements is a TATA box 25 base pairs (bp) upstream from the transcription startpoint; the other is located between 10 and 50 bp downstream from the transcription initiation site. We have now shown by transfection that both elements are required for efficient transcription in cultured cells. A partially purified natural human TATA box-binding factor (TFIID) from HeLa cells gave footprints that extended from upstream of the TATA box through the downstream initiator. Deletion of the downstream initiator inhibited both TFIID binding to the TATA box and transcription in vitro. In contrast to natural human TFIID, clone human and yeast TFIIDs expressed in bacteria gave footprints covering only the TATA box region, although hypersensitive sites were observed in the downstream region. The cloned TFIIDs also showed less dependence than natural human TFIID on the downstream initiator for both TATA box binding and in vitro transcription. These results suggest that natural human TFIID contains an additional component(s) that contribute(s) to stable TFIID binding and effective transcription by interacting with the downstream initiator. 
1	A dose-intensive regimen of 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was delivered in a dose-intensive schedule to 23 patients with metastatic or unresectable colorectal carcinoma. The schedule consisted of bolus single-dose 5-FU therapy 400 to 500 mg followed by 4-day infusion of 5-FU, 600 to 800 mg/m2/day, followed by a 17-day to 24-day infusion of 200 to 250 mg/m2/day. Partial remissions were seen in 22% of all eligible patients. Significant toxicity, including mucositis, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome, necessitated dose reductions in most patients. The authors conclude that 5-FU given in this moderately intensive schedule is associated with a moderate level of response, as easily achieved with more conventional schedules or with 5-FU-leucovorin combinations. Tumor responsiveness to dose intensive 5-FU regimens may be limited. 
4	Fibrocellular tissue response after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. An immunocytochemical analysis of the cellular composition. BACKGROUND. Restenosis after initial, successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is due to fibrocellular proliferation. METHODS AND RESULTS. The present study focused on the nature of fibrocellular tissue in humans by use of immunocytochemical techniques. Four hearts (five coronary arteries) were investigated; time lapse between PTCA and death varied between 20 days (two arteries) and 1 year 7 months. Proliferating cells stained positive with smooth muscle cell-specific monoclonal antibodies. Cells from early proliferative lesions (20 days) have a phenotypic expression different from cells in "old" lesions. Proliferating cells stained positive with vimentin but were negative with desmin, irrespective of the lesion's age. CONCLUSIONS. The findings indicate a change in actin isoform expression of smooth muscle cells while adapting to a pathological state. 
1	Tumor factors predicting for prognosis in metastatic breast cancer. The presence of P24 predicts for response to treatment and duration of survival. Fifty-one patients with metastatic breast cancer were investigated to determine tumor parameters with prognostic significance. Investigations included determinations of P24 content by immunocytochemical means using a monoclonal antibody to P24 protein; immunocytochemical analysis of estrogen and progesterone receptors; ploidy analysis by flow cytometry, and histologic grading. There were significant correlations between the presence of P24 and estrogen receptor, between histologic grade and P24 expression, and between estrogen and progesterone receptors. Of the tumor factors investigated only P24 protein was, however, of prognostic significance. Patients with P24-positive tumors had a significantly higher rate of response to treatment as well as more prolonged duration of response and duration of survival from diagnosis of metastatic disease. None of the other variables investigated were significantly predictive of outcome. P24 protein may be a useful predictor of prognosis in metastatic breast cancer. 
1	Pheochromocytoma and acute myocardial infarction. When a pheochromocytoma is manifested as an acute myocardial illness, diagnosis may be difficult to make. If the tumor is suspected early enough, a workup can be done while the complications of the myocardial illness are being controlled (as in our case). The tumor can then be expeditiously removed before any further problems develop. The case presented here underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for a pheochromocytoma in any patient who has an unexpected myocardial event. 
1	Mechanism of nonresponsiveness to AKR/Gross leukemia virus in AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice. An analysis of precursor cytotoxic T lymphocyte frequencies in young versus moderately aged mice. As young adult AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice reach about 9 wk of age, they begin to develop a nonresponsiveness to AKR/Gross leukemia virus. Unlike young mice that are responders, moderately aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice, after immunization and secondary in vitro restimulation in bulk culture with AKR/Gross virus induced tumors, can not generate anti-AKR/Gross virus-specific CTL. The mechanism of conversion to nonresponsiveness in moderately aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice is not understood, but it is correlated with increased expression of endogenous ecotropic viral antigens. Our present investigation focuses on determining the frequency of anti-AKR/Gross virus precursor CTL in AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice as a function of age. This was achieved by performing limiting dilution cultures of immune spleen cells obtained from young and moderately aged AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice. Although spleen cells obtained from immune moderately aged mice can not differentiate in bulk cultures into anti-AKR/Gross virus-specific CTL, there was no evidence of substantially decreased frequencies of virus-specific precursor CTL, relative to precursor CTL frequencies observed in young responder AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice. 
2	Regulation of collagen production in freshly isolated cell populations from normal and cirrhotic rat liver: effect of lactate. Previous work has shown that lactic acid, and to a lesser extent pyruvic acid, is able to increase collagen synthesis significantly in liver slices of CCl4-treated rats but not normal rats. The purpose of this report is to document which cells in the cirrhotic liver are responsible for the lactate-stimulated increase in collagen synthesis. It was found that (a) incorporation of 3H-proline into protein-bound 3H-hydroxyproline is increased threefold to fourfold in hepatocytes from CCl4-treated rats as compared with normal rat hepatocytes; (b) neither the hepatocytes from normal nor those from CCl4-treated rats modify their collagen synthesizing capacity when 30 mmol/L lactic acid was added to the incubation medium; (c) nonparenchymal cells obtained from livers of CCl4-treated rats synthesize much less collagen than hepatocytes, but their synthesis is stimulated twofold by lactic acid; (d) from the different nonparenchymal cells, only fat-storing (Ito) cells increase collagen synthesis when lactic acid is present in the incubation medium. These results suggest that the increased lactic acid levels observed in patients with alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis may play an important role in the development of fibrosis by stimulating collagen production by fat-storing (Ito) cells. 
3	Wilson's disease: 35 years' experience. Thirty-seven Chinese patients fulfilling the criteria for Wilson's disease seen during a 35-year period were reviewed. Males and females were equally affected. Twenty-two patients were symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic; most of them presented before the third decade. Thirty-one per cent of the relatives screened showed evidence of disease, and parents were rarely affected (13 per cent). Half of the adult symptomatic females presented with primary amenorrhoea. Liver laboratory tests were abnormal in only 50 per cent of patients, with gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase being the most sensitive index. Renal disease was infrequent. Serum caeruloplasmin level was the single biochemical parameter of prognostic significance (p = 0.0001). Seventy per cent of the symptomatic patients showed an improvement after treatment with penicillamine. 
5	Events associated with rupture of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation devices. Nineteen intra-aortic balloon (IAB) ruptures occurred in sixteen patients during a three-year period. Perforation occurred secondary to abrasion with material failure or mishandling of the device during insertion. To avoid serious sequelae, it is important to be aware of the possibility of IAB rupture and to remove any defective device immediately upon recognition of an event. 
5	A randomized clinical trial of scatter photocoagulation of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy. A randomized prospective clinical trial of argon laser scatter photocoagulation therapy for proliferative sickle cell retinopathy was performed on 116 patients (174 eyes) in Kingston, Jamaica. Ninety-nine eyes were treated with scatter photocoagulation and 75 eyes served as controls. The average length of follow-up was 42 months for the control eyes and 47 months for the treated eyes. Prolonged loss of visual acuity was statistically significantly reduced in the treated eyes. The incidence of vitreous hemorrhage was also significantly reduced in the treated eyes after controlling for the previously defined risk factors of vitreous hemorrhage and extent of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy at entry into the study. There were no complications associated with argon laser scatter photocoagulation. Scatter photocoagulation of proliferative sickle cell retinopathy is currently the most effective and safe way to treat patients with sea fan neovascularization. 
5	Direct monitoring of capillary perfusion following normovolemic hemodilution in an experimental skin-flap model. The effects of normovolemic hemodilution on skin flap survival are studied in a recently developed skin-flap model (homozygous hairless mouse ear) in which nutritional capillary flow is monitored directly by means of intravital microscopy from the time of flap creation throughout the establishment of necrosis. Two diluting agents (dextran 60 and hydroxyethyl starch 200) are utilized. Our quantitative findings demonstrate that the amount of nonperfused tissue following flap creation in both the dextran (n = 23) and starch (n = 13) groups was significantly decreased as compared with controls (n = 19). Our qualitative observations suggest that improved hemorrheologic properties at the microcirculatory level are responsible for the observed decreased necrosis. Various mechanisms by which hemodilution may act to prevent necrosis are discussed. 
4	Postoperative myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. S.P.I. Research Group. Cardiac morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery continue to be significant problems. To determine the prevalence, characteristics, and prognostic importance of postoperative myocardial ischemia after CABG surgery, the authors monitored 50 patients continuously for 10 perioperative days with the use of two-lead electrocardiography (ECG). ECG changes consistent with ischemia were defined as a reversible ST depression of 1 mm or greater or an elevation of 2 mm or greater from baseline, lasting at least 1 min. Baseline was adjusted for positional changes and temporal drift. All episodes were verified, with the use of the ECG monitor printout (ECG complexes), by two independent blinded investigators. Clinical care was not controlled by study protocol, and clinicians were unaware of the research data collected. Twenty-six of 50 patients (52%) had 207 episodes of perioperative ischemia (3,409 ischemic minutes). Postoperatively, ischemia developed in 48% of patients, compared with 12% preoperatively and 10% intraoperatively before bypass. Postoperative ischemia was most common in the early period (postoperative days [PODs] 0-2; 38% of patients), peaking during the first 2 h after revascularization, and less common during the late postoperative period (PODs 3-7; 24% of patients). Almost all (120 of 122; 98%) postoperative episodes (after tracheal extubation) were asymptomatic: only 9 of 70 (13%) early episodes were detected by clinical ECG monitoring. Postoperative ischemia did not appear to be related to acute changes in myocardial oxygen demand: only 39% of the postoperative episodes were preceded by a greater than 20% increase in heart rate. However, tachycardia persisted throughout the postoperative week (22-33% of all heart rates greater than 100 beats per min), and patients with postoperative ischemia (POD 0) more frequently had tachycardia (median 43% vs. 12% of the time; P less than 0.01). Five adverse cardiac outcomes occurred on the day of surgery; all five were preceded by postoperative ischemia, three by intraoperative ischemia before bypass, and none by preoperative ischemia. Patients with late postoperative ischemia did not have an adverse cardiac outcome. The authors conclude the following: 1) ischemia is more prevalent postoperatively than preoperatively or intraoperatively before bypass; 2) the incidence of postoperative ischemia peaks shortly after revascularization, during which time it is symptomatically silent, difficult to detect, and related to adverse cardiac outcome; 3) late postoperative ischemia also is silent, but it is less prevalent and not associated with in-hospital adverse cardiac outcome; and 4) a relationship between ischemia and persistently elevated postoperative heart rate may exist and warrants additional investigation. 
1	Variations in sensitivity after sectioning the intercostobrachial nerve. The authors present a prospective study of the variations in sensitivity that appear in the armpit and arm after the intercostobrachial nerve has been sectioned in a modified radical mastectomy. Of a total of 208 patients studied between 1978 and 1987, the intercostobrachial nerve was sectioned in 139 patients, whereas in 30 it remained intact; in 39 patients only peripheral branches of the nerve were sectioned. The patients were examined at regular postoperative intervals in order to evaluate their sensitivity both to touch and to pain in the axilla and arm. Four hundred thirty-three examinations were carried out and the 3 operative groups were assessed accordingly. After the nerve was sectioned, there was increasing anesthesia in the armpit and hypoesthesia on the posterointernal face of the arm, while for the patients in whom the intercostobrachial nerve remained intact, these alterations were less intense and long-lasting. Significant statistical differences between the two groups also exist. In the absence of axillary lymphatic ganglia infiltrated by the tumor, the conservation of the intercostobrachial nerve is recommended. 
5	Late deaths after treatment for childhood cancer. An investigation of 749 deaths occurring among 4082 patients surviving at least five years after the diagnosis of childhood cancer in Britain before 1971 has been undertaken. Of the 738 with sufficient information the numbers of deaths attributable to the following causes were: recurrent tumour, 550 (74%), a second primary tumour, 61 (8%), a medical condition related to treatment of the tumour, 49 (7%), an traumatic death unrelated to the tumour or its treatment, 34 (5%), finally, any other cause unrelated to the tumour or its treatment, 44 (6%). Less than 10% of five year survivors of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, Wilms' tumour, or a soft tissue sarcoma died of recurrent tumour during the next 15 years, while more than 25% of five year survivors of Hodgkin's disease, ependymoma, medulloblastoma, and Ewing's tumour died of recurrent tumour during the corresponding period. Almost 50% of five year survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia died of recurrent disease during the corresponding 15 years, a large proportion of deaths being due to central nervous system relapse in an era before central nervous system prophylaxis was routinely given. Comparison of the mortality observed with that expected from mortality rates in the general population indicated three times the expected number of deaths from non-neoplastic causes. Five times the expected number of deaths from cardiovascular causes were observed, these were predominantly myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents. There was no evidence of an excess in the number of suicides observed, but there were three times the expected number of deaths from accidents observed after central nervous system tumours. 
4	Acute reduction of mitral valve area after percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty: assessment with Doppler continuity equation method. Mitral valve areas before and after balloon mitral valvuloplasty were serially determined by the Doppler continuity equation method in 16 patients. Ultrasound examinations were performed before and immediately after balloon inflation and 24 hours, 1 week, and 1 month after valvuloplasty. Mitral valve area determined by the Doppler continuity equation method correlated well with that determined at catheterization by the Gorlin formula, not only before but also immediately after balloon inflation (y = 0.87 x + 0.05, standard error of estimate = 0.22 cm2, r = 0.90). Serial calculation of mitral valve area by the Doppler continuity equation method showed a slight but significant decrease in the valve area at 24 hours after balloon mitral valvuloplasty but no change after that. We conclude that the Doppler continuity equation method provides an accurate estimation of mitral valve area before and even after balloon valvuloplasty. Mitral valve area dilated by balloon inflation is decreased slightly within 24 hours after the procedure, which corroborates valve stretch as one mechanism for increasing mitral valve area with balloon valvuloplasty. Estimation of mitral valve area immediately after balloon mitral valvuloplasty may overestimate the long-term efficacy of the procedure. 
3	Laser placement in noncontact Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation. We treated 40 eyes of 40 patients by using noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation to determine whether treatment 1.5 or 3.0 mm posterior to the corneoscleral lumbus was preferable. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups, and all other variables, including power, number, and distribution of laser applications, were kept constant. Six months postoperatively, those treated 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus had a lower intraocular pressure (P = .0047) than those treated 3.0 mm from the corneoscleral limbus. The 1.5-mm group also required fewer retreatment (P = .017) and had a slightly lower occurrence of visual acuity loss after this procedure. We believe it may be advantageous to locate the laser application approximately 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus, rather than further posteriorly, when performing noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation. 
5	Deletion of Alu sequences in the fifth c-sis intron in individuals with meningiomas. An abnormality in the c-sis protooncogene was identified in leukocyte DNA from members of a family predisposed to the development of meningioma, and was found to be associated with the development of the tumor in those individuals. Molecular analysis of this abnormality demonstrated a deletion within the fifth intron of the c-sis gene. The normal c-sis gene has an Alu sequence in this region which includes two perfect 130 nucleotide repeated sequences separated by 5 bp. The deleted c-sis allele is missing precisely one copy of the 130 bp repeat and the intervening 5 bp. An identical deletion was also found in DNA from 1 of 13 sporadic meningiomas. 
4	New technique for the arterial switch operation in difficult situations. The technique described here, a modification of the Aubert operation, avoids coronary reimplantation and also eliminates the need to use artificial material to transfer coronary circulation. 
4	Exacerbation of acute platelet thrombus formation in stenosed dog coronary arteries with smoke from a non-tobacco-burning cigarette. The tobacco industry proposes to release a "new" cigarette with a burning charcoal tip, which heats the tobacco as air is drawn through it and into the lungs of the smoker. It is claimed to be safer because the tobacco does not burn. Using our established canine model of coronary artery stenosis with moderate intimal damage, we compared this new cigarette (0.4 mg nicotine) with a regular cigarette by ventilating dogs (n = 10) with room air and then either new or regular smoke (two cigarettes over about 10 minutes). In our dog model, periodic acute platelet thrombus formation followed by embolization produced cyclical flow reductions in coronary blood flow where the rate of flow decline was proportional to the degree of in vivo platelet-vessel wall interaction. The rate of flow decline increased from -4.81 +/- 1.29 ml/min2 to -9.60 +/- 2.29 ml/min2 after ventilation with the new-type smoke (p less than 0.01). Similarly, the rate of flow decline increased from -5.43 +/- 1.28 ml/min2 to -9.28 +/- 2.31 ml/min2 after ventilation with regular cigarette smoke (p less than 0.01). Despite the lack of a clear causal link between cigarette smoking and the acute manifestations of cardiovascular disease, the data presented here indicate that the new cigarette is just as potent as regular cigarettes at increasing in vivo platelet activity and exacerbating acute platelet thrombus formation in the dog. We conclude that the new proposed non-tobacco-burning cigarette has deleterious effects similar to those of conventional cigarettes, and thus does not eliminate smoking as a risk factor in cardiovascular disease in human beings. 
4	Severity of single-vessel coronary arterial stenosis and duration of angina as determinants of recruitable collateral vessels during balloon angioplasty occlusion. To determine the factors that influence the presence of collateral vessels during coronary occlusion, we performed standardized contrast injection of the contralateral coronary artery in 58 consecutive patients, without previous myocardial infarction, undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for 1-vessel disease (left anterior descending artery in 45, right coronary artery: in 10 and left circumflex artery in 3). The presence of collateral vessels during coronary occlusion, defined as partial or complete epicardial opacification by collateral vessels of the vessel dilated, was related to clinical, angiographic and electrocardiographic parameters. The angiographic appearance of collateral vessels during balloon inflation showed a weak, although statistically significant, correlation to the percent diameter stenosis before angioplasty (r = 0.28; p = 0.03) and the duration of angina (r = 0.37; p = 0.004). By combining lesion severity with the duration of angina, collateral vessels during coronary occlusion were particularly related to a lesion severity greater than or equal to 70% and duration of angina greater than or equal to 3 months (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, the presence of collateral vessels was associated with an absence of ST-segment shift (greater than or equal to 1 mm) during 1 minute of coronary occlusion (p less than 0.001). 
1	Carcinoid tumors. The authors carried out a retrospective study of 32 patients (23 M, 9 F) with carcinoid tumors who were diagnosed and treated at Harlem Hospital Center, New York, from 1967 to 1988. All the patients were black and the commonest sites were the ileum (28.1%), rectosigmoid and rectum (21.9%), and the appendix and lung (15.6% each). Metastasis correlated with site, size, and depth of the primary tumor and occurred in 12 patients (38%), most frequently to the regional lymph nodes and liver. Carcinoid syndrome developed in 12.5% (3 F, 1 M). Surgical resection for cure or palliation was the mainstay of treatment. Overall 5 year survival rate was 66%, and for those with metastases was 0%. The poorer survival rates are probably related to the socioeconomic status of our patient population. The only observed racial difference compared to other series is the preponderance of males, and the disproportionately higher ratio of females with the carcinoid syndrome. 
5	An eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with an L-tryptophan containing product. A syndrome of eosinophilia and myalgias associated with the usage of L-tryptophan containing products has been recently described by the Centers for Disease Control. We report a case of this new clinical entity, highlighted by severe myositis, and compare this illness with similar reported syndromes. 
1	Etoposide in the management of non-small cell lung cancer. Etoposide is a phase-specific, schedule-dependent derivative of podophyllotoxin that appears to act by inhibiting DNA-topoisomerase II. Early preclinical work demonstrated sharp activity in mouse leukemias and possible synergy with cisplatin. As a single agent (either orally or intravenously), it demonstrated limited benefit in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with response rates around 10%. In combination with cisplatin, it has become a mainstay of chemotherapeutic efforts, either as primary therapy or in conjunction with radiation. Response rates in advanced disease average around 30%, climbing to more than 50% in patients with Stage IIIA or IIIB disease. More recent work suggests that the issue of the true synergy of etoposide with cisplatin in NSCLC needs reassessment. The relative roles of etoposide and cisplatin in the combination are unclear, as several studies conflict. Pharmacokinetic data suggest that multiple daily fractions of etoposide are superior to prolonged infusions, warranting several future trials. The current major role for etoposide plus cisplatin would appear to be in multimodality therapy where the combination can be readily combined with radiation and/or surgery. Several other agents have been studied with etoposide or etoposide plus cisplatin (mitomycin, vindesine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin), but it is unclear whether the addition of any of them offers any response or survival advantage. 
3	Treatment of phenobarbital poisoning with multiple dose activated charcoal in an infant. A 28-day-old infant developed lethargy, hypotonia, and hypothermia following a phenobarbital overdose secondary to a pharmacist's error. He was treated with multiple dose activated charcoal (MDAC) and alkalinization of the urine, which resulted in prompt recovery with rapid elimination of the drug (t1/2-11.2 hours, expected 45 to 118 hours). The use of MDAC in this newborn was safe and effective. We suggest that age should not pose a barrier to the use of MDAC, when indicated. 
4	Power of oesophageal peristalsis can be controlled voluntarily. The hypothesis that oesophageal peristalsis can be modified voluntarily was explored. Six healthy male volunteers and eight female patients with angina like chest pain underwent oesophageal manometry. Each was asked to take a series of swallows, and to vary their size, in random order, by taking either a big gulp or a little swallow. None of the subjects experienced difficulty in doing so. In both groups the amplitude of oesophageal contractions were significantly greater after big gulps than little swallows (p less than 0.01) and this was true for wet (82.0 v 68.9 mmHg) and dry swallows (52.3 v 43.3 mmHg). For the patients' wet swallows the mean values were 73.0 and 56.0 mmHg. Thus, the amplitude of oesophageal peristalsis can be controlled voluntarily. This effect may account for some of the within subject variation in the amplitude of oesophageal contractions. During oesophageal manometry subjects should be encouraged to standardise the size of their swallows whenever possible. Patients with symptoms related to abnormal oesophageal peristalsis such as dysphagia, heartburn, and chest pain may benefit from biofeedback training. 
4	Intractable complex partial seizures associated with occult temporal lobe encephalocele and meningoangiomatosis: a case report. Occult congenital temporal lobe encephalocele has rarely been reported in association with medically intractable complex partial seizures. The four previously reported cases were unsuspected preoperatively. We present the case of an 18-year-old woman with intractable complex partial seizures since age 13. Seizure onset was electrically localized to the right temporal lobe. Preoperative neuroimaging studies revealed a middle fossa defect and inferior herniation of the right temporal lobe. Pathologic examination of the resected encephalocele revealed prominent features of meningoangiomatosis. We believe this to be the first case of temporal lobe encephalocele and epilepsy to be diagnosed preoperatively, and the first case also to be associated with meningoangiomatosis. The relevant literature on meningoangiomatosis and on temporal lobe encephalocele as a cause of epilepsy is reviewed. 
5	Induction of RNA-stabilized DNA conformers by transcription of an immunoglobulin switch region A deletion DNA rearrangement is associated with immunoglobulin class switching from IgM to IgG, IgA or IgE This recombination occurs in immunoglobulin switch regions, which are complex, highly repetitive regions of DNA. As switch regions become transcriptionally active just before switch recombination, analysis of the behaviour of these sequences during transcription could elucidate the mechanism of switch recombination. Here, we report that transcription of a supercoiled plasmid containing the murine IgA switch region (S alpha) leads to a loss of superhelical turns. The resulting series of less supercoiled plasmids is stabilized by RNA-DNA hybrids formed by the nascent RNA transcripts, which remain base-paired with their DNA templates. 
1	Human papillomavirus type 1-associated squamous cell carcinoma in a heart transplant recipient. The occurrence of squamous cell carcinomas in organ transplant recipients with warts represents a good model to study viral carcinogenesis. Most of the cases were reported in renal transplant recipients. We present the case of a heart transplant recipient in whom multiple common warts, preepitheliomatous keratoses, and squamous cell carcinomas developed. The warts began 4 years after the transplantation and the first carcinoma occurred 2 years after the warts, all the lesions being on sun-exposed areas. Histologic signs of human papillomavirus infection were seen in all premalignant and malignant lesions. Furthermore, human papillomavirus type 1 DNA was detected by in situ molecular hybridization within one of the carcinomas. Human papillomaviruses, along with other carcinogenic factors, play an important role in the development of carcinomas, and benign types could be implicated. Further studies are required to evaluate the frequency of cutaneous malignant neoplasms in heart transplant recipients as compared with renal transplant recipients. 
1	Computed tomography of metastatic cervical lymph nodes. A clinical, computed tomographic, pathologic correlative study. A retrospective comparative study of 63 neck dissections was undertaken to evaluate further the accuracy of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) in the detection of nodal metastases, as previous studies have indicated a trend toward the superiority of CT scanning over palpation. The respective values of neck examination, CT scanning, and histopathologic examination were assessed in 51 patients with head and neck cancer who underwent a total of 63 neck dissections. The overall agreement between clinical examination findings and histopathologic findings was 92% vs 81% for CT scanning. A retrospective analysis of the CT findings failed to reveal greater accuracy. We found nodes measuring 10 mm or more with central low density always to be malignant. Because CT scanning seems to offer little advantage over palpation in the nonirradiated neck, it should not be regarded as an essential tool in the staging of nodal disease. After radiation therapy, as neck dissection is only performed because of clinical or radiologic suspicion, CT scanning is of utmost importance. 
5	The noncatalytic src homology region 2 segment of abl tyrosine kinase binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular proteins with high affinity. Several proteins implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation contain a common noncatalytic domain, src homology region 2 (SH2). We have used the bacterially expressed SH2 domain of abl protein-tyrosine kinase to evaluate the ability of this domain to bind to cellular proteins. ablSH2 specifically bound to a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from cells transformed by tyrosine kinase oncogenes in a filter-binding assay and to a subset of those proteins in solution. The SH2 probe bound almost exclusively to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, and binding was eliminated by dephosphorylation of cell proteins. Free phosphotyrosine could partially disrupt SH2 binding, suggesting that phosphotyrosine is directly involved in the binding interaction. These results demonstrate that an SH2 domain is sufficient to confer direct, high-affinity phosphotyrosine-dependent binding to proteins and suggest a general role for SH2 domains in cellular signaling pathways. 
5	Late recurrence of a hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with incomplete Alagille syndrome. In this study, the case of a patient presenting a second hepatocellular carcinoma 13 years after resection of a first tumor of the same type is reported. In this case, etiological investigations remained negative, but an incomplete form of syndromatic Alagille syndrome with paucity of bile ducts in the nontumoral tissue was detected and associated with nodular regenerative hyperplasia and foci of dysplasia. Malignant transformation in Alagille syndrome seems to be extremely rare. The fact that such tumors evolve very slowly could be an argument for partial hepatectomy and, if necessary, liver transplantation. 
1	Cerebrospinal fluid neopterin in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neopterin, a putative marker of activated macrophages, in 97 subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 who had a spectrum of neurological complications. The highest CSF neopterin concentrations occurred in those with neurological opportunistic infections, primary central nervous systems lymphoma, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. In general, the CSF concentration of neopterin was independent of CSF cell count and blood-brain barrier disruption to albumin. In the patients with AIDS dementia complex, CSF neopterin concentrations correlated with severity of disease and decreased in conjunction with clinical improvement following treatment with zidovudine. These results suggest that CSF neopterin, although not disease-specific, may be useful as a surrogate marker for the presence of AIDS dementia complex and its response to antiviral therapy. 
5	Diagnosis and treatment of cytomegalovirus disease in transplant patients based on gastrointestinal tract manifestations. Infection due to cytomegalovirus is a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. In particular, cytomegalovirus infection has been associated with a significant detrimental effect on patient and allograft survival after solid-organ transplantation. We are evaluating a new antiviral agent, ganciclovir 9-[1,3-dihydroxy-2-2 propoxymethyl] guanine (DHPG), used in solid-organ transplant recipients who developed life-threatening cytomegalovirus infections. Between March 1, 1987, and June 30, 1989, we treated 93 solid-organ transplant patients who developed tissue-invasive cytomegalovirus disease. From this group of patients we have identified 14 patients with primary gastrointestinal cytomegalovirus disease who received treatment with DHPG. Tissue diagnosis was made by endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract (11 patients) or colonoscopy (three patients). Invasive cytomegalovirus disease was identified prior to severe complications of the gastrointestinal tract in all but one patient, who suffered colonic perforation prior to treatment with DHPG and subsequently died of bacterial sepsis. While 13 of the 14 patients improved after treatment with DHPG, four patients required additional treatments for recurrent cytomegalovirus disease and recovered. No DHPG toxicity was observed. We believe treatment with DHPG is indicated in this patient population, but that further studies are indicated to fully define the impact of this recommendation on both patient and allograft survival after solid-organ transplantation. 
4	Weight reduction in obese hypertensive patients. This study tested the feasibility of a low-technology office-based approach to weight reduction in obese hypertensive patients. Family practice residents were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group. Physicians in the experimental group were instructed in methods of weight reduction, which they then passed on to their patients. Patients of experimental physicians were seen monthly, their diets were discussed, and improvements were suggested. The control group patients received their usual care. After six months the experimental patients had lost significantly more weight than the controls and had significantly reduced the number of antihypertensive drugs while maintaining blood pressure control. After 12 months there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to weight loss, blood pressure, or number of antihypertensive drugs. Experimental and control patients who lost weight had visited their physicians more frequently than those who did not and had reduced the number of antihypertensive medications they were taking. This educationally oriented intervention trial is an example of the type of research that is practical to perform in a family practice center and is applicable in family physicians' offices. 
4	Comparison of medical and surgical therapy for uncomplicated descending aortic dissection. To guide the choice of medical versus surgical therapy for patients with descending (type B) aortic dissection (tear in the descending aorta without involvement of the ascending aorta), multivariate survival analysis was applied to 136 patients admitted to two medical centers between 1975 and 1988 with acute (n = 89) or chronic (n = 47) descending dissection: group 1, all 136 patients; group 2, 106 patients without rupture, pulse loss, or visceral organ compromise; and group 3, 56 patients from group 2 without major cardiac or renal disease (23 surgical and 33 medical). Group 3 medical and surgical subgroups were well matched for baseline characteristics and were potential candidates for either mode of therapy. By Cox model analysis, significant predictors of mortality were pleural rupture, other dissection complications, increasing age, and cardiac disease (all p less than 0.01). Surgical versus medical therapy was not an independent determinant of survival in any of the three groups for acute or chronic dissection. Survival probabilities for all group 3 patients at 1, 5, and 10 years were 0.94, 0.87, and 0.32 (medical) and 0.90, 0.80, and 0.50 (surgical). Despite the limitations of this retrospective study (including the possibility of undefined treatment selection biases), these data suggest that medical or early surgical therapy is associated with equivalent outcome in selected patients with uncomplicated acute or chronic descending aortic dissection. 
5	Molecular methods to detect the Philadelphia chromosome. The Ph1 chromosome has two molecular subtypes: a bcr-positive seen in CML and some cases of ALL, and the bcr-negative subtype mainly seen in ALL. In CML, because of the restriction of chromosome 22 breakpoints to the bcr, Southern analysis to detect bcr rearrangements also can be used to detect the Ph1 chromosome. In contrast, the translocation breakpoints on the Ph1 chromosome are scattered in ALL, so that other methods such as PFGE and PCR are necessary to detect the Ph1 chromosome. In both CML and ALL, use of these methods to detect molecular abnormalities may be superior to cytogenetics in detecting chromosomal abnormalities. Southern analysis also can be used in CML to map breakpoint locations within the bcr. This may offer prognostic information as to the length of chronic phase, but there is conflicting information as to the validity of this approach. The modified PCR (using cDNA from mRNA) can be used to detect the Ph1 chromosome and to define which of the molecular subtypes are present. The exquisite sensitivity of this method, which is capable of detecting as little as a single abnormal molecule of RNA or DNA, makes it suited for the detection of minimal residual disease in both CML and ALL. This is particularly useful after intensive therapies, such as bone marrow transplantation. Whether these low levels of fusion gene expression are of prognostic significance is still unclear. 
5	L-tryptophan associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Environmental chemicals are increasingly incriminated in the pathogenesis of several disease states. The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a recently described entity attributed to the ingestion of the normal dietary amino acid L-tryptophan. We describe a patient who fulfills criteria for the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and who was ingesting supplemental L-tryptophan. Exhaustive investigations failed to reveal other causes for her eosinophilia or her myalgic/neuropathic complaints, and she improved dramatically when she discontinued the L-tryptophan supplements. The mechanisms whereby this chemical may induce this syndrome are discussed. 
4	Tricuspid valve disease with significant tricuspid insufficiency in the fetus: diagnosis and outcome. The echocardiographic studies and clinical course of 27 fetuses (mean gestational age 26.9 weeks) diagnosed in utero with tricuspid valve disease and significant tricuspid regurgitation were reviewed. The diagnosis of Ebstein's anomaly was made in 17 of the fetuses, 7 had tricuspid valve dysplasia with poorly developed but normally attached leaflets and 2 had an unguarded tricuspid valve orifice with little or no identifiable tricuspid tissue. One fetus was excluded from data analysis because a more complex heart lesion was documented at autopsy. All fetuses had massive right atrial dilation and most who were serially studied had progressive right-sided cardiomegaly. Hydrops fetalis was found in six cases and atrial flutter in five. Associated cardiac lesions included pulmonary stenosis in five cases and pulmonary atresia in six. Four fetuses with normal forward pulmonary artery flow at the initial examination were found at subsequent study to have retrograde pulmonary artery and ductal flow in association with the development of pulmonary stenosis (n = 1) and pulmonary atresia (n = 3). On review of the clinical course of the 23 fetuses (excluding 3 with elective abortion), 48% of the fetuses died in utero and 35% who were liveborn died despite vigorous medical and, when necessary, surgical management, many of whom had severe congestive heart failure. Of the four infants who survived the neonatal period, three had a benign neonatal course, all of whom were diagnosed with mild to moderate Ebstein's anomaly; only one had pulmonary outflow obstruction. An additional finding at autopsy was significant lung hypoplasia documented in 10 of 19 autopsy reports. 
5	Lack of prognostic value of syncope in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Syncope in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome may be considered a premonitory event heralding the future development of sudden death. Therefore, the clinical and electrophysiologic data of 101 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome referred for invasive evaluation of known arrhythmias were reviewed to assess the incidence and clinical relevance of syncope. Thirty-six patients reported the occurrence of one or more syncopal episodes (group 1) and 65 patients had no syncope (group 2). These two groups did not differ significantly with regard to age, gender, incidence and characteristics of arrhythmia, clinical history, frequency of arrhythmic events and presence of associated cardiac disease. There were 10 patients in group 1 and 12 in group 2 who had ventricular fibrillation. There were no statistical differences between the two groups with respect to the effective refractory period of the right atrium, atrioventricular node, accessory pathway and right ventricle. Furthermore, no differences between the two groups were noted with respect to cycle length of circus movement tachycardia, mean heart rate during atrial fibrillation, and minimum RR interval during atrial fibrillation. In addition, the accessory pathway location was not significantly different between group 1 and group 2. The occurrence of syncope could not be predicted from any electrophysiologic finding and this symptom had a low sensitivity and specificity for recognition of dangerous rapid heart rates. Furthermore, the prognostic value of syncope was less accurate and predictive than the shortest RR interval during atrial fibrillation and the anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway for aborted sudden death occurrence. 
5	Effects of inflammatory mediators on the responsiveness of isolated human airways to methacholine. Several studies have suggested that in asthmatics the quantities of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, thromboxane A2 (TxA2), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) that are present in the airway lumen are related to the degree of bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine (MCh). Therefore, we studied the effect of these mediators on the cholinergic responsiveness of isolated human airway segments. Lung tissue collected at thoracotomy from 30 patients was studied. Dose-response curves to MCh were obtained from bronchial segments before, during, and after incubation with either a subthreshold or a threshold concentration of histamine (10(-10) or 10(-8) M), the stable TxA2 analogue U46619 (10(-11) or 10(-9) M), PGD2 (5 x 10(-9) or 5 x 10(-7) M), PGF2 alpha (10(-9) or 10(-7) M), or LTC4 (10(-11) or 10(-9) M). With the exception of LTC4, the presence of any of these mediators at either concentration increased the sensitivity to MCh by a factor of 1.1 to 2 (p less than 0.05, ANOVA). This increase did not depend on the dose of the mediator (p greater than 0.05, ANOVA). These data indicate that mediator-induced muscle hypersensitivity can explain a small part of the leftward shift of the dose-response curve to inhaled MCh as observed in asthma. 
3	Cervicogenic headache: diagnostic criteria. Criteria for the diagnosis of cervicogenic headache are proposed, which include unilateral head pain, symptoms and signs of neck involvement, non-clustering episodic moderate pain originating in the neck then spreading to the head, and response to root or nerve blockade; plus rarer and non-obligatory features such as autonomic disturbances, dizziness, phonophotophobia, monocular visual blurring, and difficulty swallowing. 
5	Thyroarytenoid muscle activity during hypoxia in awake lambs. It is generally accepted that hypoxia in early life results in active laryngeal braking of expiratory airflow via the recruitment of glottic adductor muscles. We examined the electromyogram expiratory activity of the thyroarytenoid muscle in seven 11- to 18-day-old awake nonsedated lambs exposed to an inspired O2 fraction of 0.08 for 18 min. The lambs breathed through a face mask and a pneumotachograph. During baseline prehypoxic breathing, the thyroarytenoid muscle was largely inactive in each awake lamb. Unexpectedly, no recruitment of the thyroarytenoid muscle was recorded during hypoxia in any of the seven lambs; simultaneous examination of the flow-volume curves revealed an absence of expiratory airflow braking. Also unexpectedly, marked expiratory activity of the thyroarytenoid muscle was recorded, with each expiration occurring within less than 10 s after the return to room air. The resulting delay of expiration was apparent in the flow-volume loops. Thus, in awake 11- to 18-day-old lambs, 1) active expiratory glottic adduction is absent during hypoxia and 2) a return from hypoxia to room air results in prolonged expiration as well as active glottic adduction that controls end-expiratory lung volume. 
2	Collis gastroplasty: origin and evolution. In 1957 J. Leigh Collis published his innovative operation for treating the difficult problem of the irreducible hiatal hernia, esophagitis, and stricture. The design of the operation was based on the relatively primitive understanding of hiatal hernia and the newly emerging concept of reflux esophagitis. A variety of antireflux operations by different surgeons emerged over the years to follow. The original Collis gastroplasty has been subsequently modified with the addition of both partial and complete fundoplication procedures. The place of the modified Collis gastroplasty-fundoplication operations in today's approach to the problems of hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease remains unsettled. 
4	Liver transplantation with atrioatrial anastomosis for Budd-Chiari syndrome. We report the case of a young woman with Budd-Chiari syndrome in whom mesentericoval shunt was first performed, followed by transcaval liver resection and hepatoatrial anatomosis 3 years later. Liver transplantation became necessary 5 years later because of deterioarating liver function with portal hypertension and bleeding. Successful transplantation was performed with atrioatrial anastomosis with help of cardiopulmonary bypass, simplifying considerably the technical procedure and reducing dramatically blood loss. 
4	The validity of health risk appraisals for coronary heart disease: results from a randomized field trial. BACKGROUND: While health risk appraisals (HRAs) are becoming increasingly popular as tools for health assessment and health education, comparatively little is known about the accuracy of these risk estimates. METHODS: A field trial among 732 randomly selected adults ages 25 to 65 years was conducted to assess the validity of the risk scores produced by four widely used HRAs. RESULTS: Self-reported HRA risk scores for cigarette smoking and relative weight were generally accurate, but correlations between physiological measurements and scores for blood pressure, cholesterol, and physical activity were always lower than .51. Correlations between epidemiologic estimates of the probability of CHD death and HRA total risk scores ranged from .13 to .75; partial correlations adjusting for age, race, and gender ranged from .12 to .47. CONCLUSIONS: The HRAs chosen for the field trial exhibited modest correlations with the CHD mortality risk predicted by the epidemiologic model. Mathematical errors made by respondents completing self-scored instruments and lack of knowledge regarding physiologic status decrease the accuracy of HRA risk estimates. 
1	Thoracoscopic treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax using carbon dioxide laser. In an effort to improve the success rate of the previously described thoracoscopic electrocautery ablation technique of spontaneous pneumothorax, the carbon dioxide laser was evaluated in 12 patients. The recurrent (5 patients) or persistent (7 patients) spontaneous pneumothoraces were caused by rupture of (1) blebs in 6 patients, (2) intrapulmonary apical type II bullae in 3 patients, and (3) diffuse bullous emphysema, type III, in 3. The air leaks were successfully sealed in all but 1 patient with ruptured type II bulla. Surgical specimen from this single failure suggested that the entire inner lining of the bullae must be thermocoagulated. This technical modification led to successful outcome in 2 subsequent cases. With the use of carbon dioxide laser, it was possible to treat not only small blebs but all types of bullae causing spontaneous pneumothorax. Laser thoracoscopy is effective and safe in treating spontaneous pneumothorax. 
5	Plasma therapy for severe hemolytic-uremic syndrome in children in Atlantic Canada. Clinical reports have suggested that therapy with fresh frozen plasma is a useful adjunct in the management of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). We reviewed the charts of 36 children with severe HUS who were treated at the Izaac Walton Killam Hospital for Children, Halifax, over 10 years to assess the effectiveness of plasma therapy. All children who required specific supportive therapy for renal dysfunction, hemolysis or serious extrarenal complications were included. We compared the outcome of 18 children who received plasma therapy from 1982 to 1987 with that of 18 children who did not. The two groups were similar with regard to the severity of HUS, the length of hospital stay, the duration of renal dysfunction and the incidence of disease-related complications, such as seizures, enterocolitis and cardiomyopathy. At discharge the prevalence of hypertension was higher in the plasma therapy group than in the control group. Plasma therapy did not demonstrate any benefit that would outweigh the risk of fluid overload, hyperproteinemia and transmission of viral infection. 
4	Salt blocks the renal benefits of ramipril in diabetic hypertensive rats. To establish if the benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in retarding progressive diabetic renal injury is due to a specific intrarenal effect of the systemic hypotensive effect, we studied the effect of long-term ramipril treatment on blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary protein excretion in streptozotocin-diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats. The hypotensive effect of ramipril was prevented by a high salt diet, which did not alter the degree of renal angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Three weeks after uninephrectomy and induction of diabetes, rats were allocated to three groups. Groups 1 and 2 were given 1% NaCl, whereas group 3 was given water as drinking solution. One week later, groups 2 and 3 received 0.4 mg/kg/day ramipril in their drinking solution, which was continued over a 2-month period. Ramipril produced a blood pressure fall only in water-drinking rats (group 3) despite a similar reduction in plasma and renal angiotensin converting enzyme activity in groups 2 and 3. Salt-loaded rats had a progressive increase in urinary protein excretion over the duration of study. Ramipril treatment prevented an increase in protein excretion only in animals given water and with a reduced systolic blood pressure. Glomerular filtration rate was similar in all three groups. Ramipril treatment improved animal survival independently of a reduction in blood pressure or an effect on proteinuria. Although it is possible that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have specific intrarenal effects reducing progression of diabetic proteinuria, concomitant control of systemic blood pressure appears to be necessary to demonstrate a benefit. 
3	Giant cell arteritis. A case with unusual neurologic manifestations and a normal sedimentation rate. Giant cell (temporal) arteritis is a serious inflammatory condition that can lead to blindness, stroke, or other adverse sequelae if not properly treated. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate has traditionally been emphasized as a criterion for making this diagnosis. Delays in diagnosis and unnecessary testing may occur when a patient presents with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a clinical history consistent with this condition. We describe a patient with giant cell arteritis who presented with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and who subsequently developed devastating central nervous system complications. 
1	An analysis of abnormalities of the retinoblastoma gene in human ovarian and endometrial carcinoma. The altered expression of the human retinoblastoma (RB) gene has been demonstrated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of RB and other tumors. To determine whether the RB gene might be involved in the pathogenesis of human ovarian and endometrial cancer, DNA from 24 human ovarian tumors, 3 normal ovaries, 3 endometrial carcinomas, and 1 endometrial hyperplasia was examined with an RB complementary DNA probe. Evidence for homozygous deletion of the RB gene was observed in only one specimen. Interestingly, the specimen was an endometrioid tumor of the ovary of low malignant potential (LMP). This patient experienced rapid progression of the tumor and died 8 months after diagnosis. Abnormalities of the RB gene may be involved in the aggressive biologic behavior of certain forms of ovarian carcinoma, particularly those of LMP. 
5	Magnetic resonance imaging in idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis: measurement of T1 relaxation time. Magnetic resonance imaging at 0.08 Tesla was performed in nine patients with proven idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis. A total of 11 scans was performed. Three patients were scanned before diagnosis; one of these also had two follow-up scans. A further six patients were scanned a variable time after diagnosis and treatment. On each scan, a periaortic soft-tissue mass was readily identified, the distribution corresponding to that seen on computed tomography. There was no difference in the mean T1 relaxation time of the mass between patients scanned before diagnosis and those scanned after treatment. However, the patient followed with serial scans showed a progressive reduction in the T1 value of the mass with time. Comparison with results obtained in patients with lymphoma suggests that the T1 values in retroperitoneal fibrosis are lower than in lymphoma, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
2	In vitro anticolon antibody production by mucosal or peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with ulcerative colitis [published erratum appears in Gut 1991 Apr;32(4):460] Serum anticolon antibody and in vitro anti-colon antibody production by peripheral blood and mucosal lymphocytes was investigated in patients with ulcerative colitis. The frequency of serum anticolon antibody was 71% in 41 patients with ulcerative colitis, estimated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using isolated rat colon epithelial cells. This finding confirms our previous report on the frequency of serum anticolon antibody detected by flow cytometry analysis. The estimated frequencies of IgG anticolon antibody secreting cells were 1.5-12.5/10(6) cells in the colonic mucosa and 0.1-0.5/10(6) cells in peripheral blood, from patients with ulcerative colitis when Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was used as a B cell polyclonal activator. Poisson analysis of limiting dilution culture showed that about one per 140 IgG cells in the colonic mucosa synthesised anticolon antibody. Two monoclonal IgG antibodies were obtained from EBV transformed anticolon antibody secreting cells by limiting dilution method. One reacted with goblet cells in the intestine, and the other reacted mainly with colonic epithelial cells. These results suggest that heterogeneous anticolon antibodies are present in patients with ulcerative colitis and that colonic mucosa may be the main source of anticolon antibody. Local autoimmune reaction might have an important role in causing the inflammation of colonic mucosa in this disease. 
2	Evaluation of portal-systemic shunting in rats from mesenteric and splenic beds. In rats with partial portal vein ligation, 95 +/- 0.9% of the splenic blood flow is shunted from the portal to the systemic circulation when an intrasplenic injection of microspheres is used to determine the degree of shunting. Despite this magnitude of portal-systemic shunting, several biochemical and endocrine consequences of portal-systemic shunting occur at levels below what is expected for the degree of shunting found. In an effort to resolve these discordant findings, shunting from both the splenic and the mesenteric bed was studied in anesthetized portal hypertensive rats with various degrees and/or duration of portal vein stenosis. The shunting from the mesenteric bed averaged 66.7 +/- 29.9% (range 5.1-99.1%) and was influenced both by the degree and duration of portal vein stenosis. In contrast, shunting from the splenic bed averaged 97.3 +/- 4.0% (range 79-99.9%) and demonstrated no variation between groups determined by the degree of portal vein stenosis. The shunting from the splenic bed was consistently greater than that found from the mesenteric bed. Mesenteric but not splenic shunting correlated with serum bile acid levels. Mesenteric shunting was related inversely to the weight-adjusted liver mass and to serum testosterone levels. Based upon these data obtained in portal hypertensive rats, it is concluded that splenic injections of microspheres overestimate portal-systemic shunting. In contrast, mesenteric injections of microspheres yield values for shunting that correlate well with independently determined biochemical and endocrine consequences of shunting. These observations support the validity of the mesenteric shunting measurements obtained. 
3	Adult peripheral neuroepithelioma in Meckel's cave. A case of peripheral neuroepithelioma arising from the trigeminal nerve in Meckel's cave is presented. The discussion emphasizes the pathological criteria for the diagnosis of a peripheral neuroepithelioma and the current controversy about the classification of this and related tumors. 
3	Brain pH in head injury: an image-guided 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy study. It has been suggested that brain acidosis may follow head trauma, and therapies aimed at correcting acidosis have been proposed. Direct measurements of intracellular pH, however, have thus far not been possible in clinical situations. We have studied the intracellular brain pH in 22 patients after head injury (mean Glasgow Coma Score 6.1). Patients were investigated by a combined approach of phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (overall examination time 50-75 min) at a mean time of 11 days after injury (36 hours to 24 days). 31P spectra were obtained in 11 patients on assisted ventilation and in 11 patients on spontaneous ventilation. These spectra were analyzed to yield the pH in the regions studied in all the patients. All pH values were in the normal or alkalotic range when compared with 6 age-matched normal controls. No differences were found between patients on assisted ventilation and patients on spontaneous ventilation. When analyzed as a group, the brain pH in the focal lesions appeared to increase in the first days, to reach a peak in the alkalotic range in the second week, and to return toward normal within 3 weeks from acute injury. Our results suggest that there is no evidence of posttraumatic intracellular brain acidosis in recent human head injury, and therefore, therapies aimed at alkalinizing brain cells need to be reconsidered. 
4	Lower extremity venography with iohexol: results and complications. The frequency of side effects of a nonionic contrast agent (iohexol) was studied in 463 consecutive patients who underwent venography for clinically suspected deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and compared with the frequency of adverse reactions of another series in which patients received either the same contrast material or a high-osmolar ionic compound. Minor side effects, including local pain and discomfort, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, skin reactions, superficial phlebitis, and edema, occurred in 83 patients (17.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15%-22%). The only serious adverse reaction (bronchospasm) was seen in two patients (0.4%; 95% CI, 0.1%-1.4%). Postvenographic thrombosis confirmed by means of repeat venography occurred in one of 41 consecutive patients with a previous normal venogram (incidence, 2%; 95% CI, 0%-13%). The frequency of side effects appears to be significantly less than when conventional high-osmolar contrast agents are used. Use of iohexol for venography is associated with minor side effects in approximately one-fifth of patients, and serious adverse reactions necessitating therapy are rare. 
2	Diagnostic value of brush cytology in the diagnosis of bile duct carcinoma: a study in 65 patients with bile duct strictures. Malignant strictures of the extrahepatic bile ducts are difficult to distinguish from benign strictures, particularly in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Because attempts at diagnosing small cancers with fine-needle aspiration biopsy are not possible in the absence of an associated mass lesion and because the sensitivity of exfoliative biliary cytology is controversial, brush cytology has been used as a potential means of establishing a specific diagnosis of bile duct carcinoma. Herein we report our experience with this technique when performed on 65 patients over a 5-yr period. Each had at least one brushing. Thirty-seven were found to have bile duct carcinoma and 28 were found to have benign strictures. Of these 37, the first brushing was positive for malignancy in 15 (40%), whereas four (11%) had cells suspected but not diagnostic of malignancy. Thirteen patients with bile duct carcinoma whose initial brushings were negative for malignancy had second brushings. Of these, five (38%) had malignant cells, whereas three (24%) yielded suspicious cells. Three of the eight whose first two brushings were negative for malignancy were found to have malignant cells on the third brushing. In contrast, of the 28 patients with benign strictures, malignant cells were never found. However, in two patients, suspicious cells were reported with the first but not the second brushing. A single negative or suspicious cytological finding decreased the probability of bile duct carcinoma to 43%. Two and three sequential negative tests reduced the probability to 32% and 0%, respectively. 
5	Aggressive granulomatous lesions in cementless total hip arthroplasty. We describe six patients with aggressive granulomatous lesions around cementless total hip prostheses. Two patients previously had a cemented prosthesis in the same hip. The Lord prosthesis was used in five patients, the PCA in one. Both prostheses were made of chrome-cobalt alloy. Pain on weight-bearing occurred on average 3.2 years after the cementless arthroplasty, and at that time radiography revealed aggressive granulomatosis around the proximal femoral stem and the acetabular component in five of the patients; one had a large solitary granuloma in the proximal femur. Revision was performed on average 4.8 years after the cementless arthroplasty. At that time all granulomas had grown large in size; while waiting for revision operation, two femoral stem components fractured. All the granulomas showed a uniform histopathology, which included histiocytosis; the cause for these lesions was thought to be plastic debris from the acetabular socket. 
5	Role of small calibre chest tube drainage for iatrogenic pneumothorax. A 2 mm Teflon catheter was used as a chest tube in 28 patients with iatrogenic pneumothorax. Frequent aspirations through the catheter were performed in 16 of the patients. In the remaining 12 patients the catheter was connected to a one way flutter valve. The treatment was successful in 27 of the 28 patients--one patient required a large calibre chest tube. The mean drainage time was 48 hours. The small catheter technique is superior to the use of a large intercostal drain as it is much less traumatic and troublesome. The small calibre chest tube with a one way valve is recommended as a safe and easy technique. 
3	Erythromycin failure with subsequent Pasteurella multocida meningitis and septic arthritis in a cat-bite victim. We report the case of a 75-year-old woman who developed Pasteurella multocida meningitis and septic arthritis while being treated for a cat-bite wound infection with erythromycin. Review of the literature revealed that erythromycin has poor in vitro activity against this bacterium and has been associated with serious clinical failures. We recommend that erythromycin not be prescribed for empiric therapy of established animal-bite infections. Suggestions for optimal empiric therapy of animal-bite infections and the differential diagnosis of severe cat-bite-associated sepsis are discussed. 
4	Bradyarrhythmia after heart transplantation. Incidence, time course, and outcome. From June 1980 to April 1989, 72 of 401 (18%) adult recipients of orthotopic heart transplantation developed prolonged (greater than 24 hours) bradyarrhythmias (less than 60 beats/min) within 5 days after transplantation. Junctional bradycardia occurred in 50 (69%) recipients, sinus bradycardia in 18 (25%), and slow ventricular response during atrial fibrillation in four (6%). Fifty-five of 72 (76%) patients had bradyarrhythmias of less than 20 days' duration (less than 7 days, 50 patients; 7-20 days, five patients). Fifty patients returned to sinus rhythm (greater than 60 beats/min) by the time of discharge. Five patients expired within 20 days. Seventeen of 72 (24%) patients had bradyarrhythmia for more than 20 days, which was symptomatic in 11. All 17 patients (junctional bradycardia, 13 patients; sinus bradycardia, four patients) received a permanent pacemaker within 40 days after transplantation. Between 1 and 12 months (mean, 4 +/- 3 months) after pacemaker implantation, 12 patients recovered sinus rhythm (greater than 70 beats/min). The other five patients had intrinsic rates of 32-57 beats/min (mean, 48 +/- 10 beats/min) during 1-9 months (mean, 4 +/- 3 months) of follow-up. The donor ischemic time in bradyarrhythmia patients was 202 +/- 34 minutes, which was significantly longer (p less than 0.01) than the 173 +/- 43 minutes for those patients without bradyarrhythmia. Conclusively, the incidence of posttransplantation bradyarrhythmia is relatively high. It is usually temporary, however, even in patients with a prolonged duration of bradyarrhythmia. A relation appears to exist between donor ischemic time and the incidence of bradyarrhythmia. 
1	Survey of histologic specimens of human cancer for human papillomavirus types 6/11/16/18 by filter in situ hybridization. Histologic specimens (317) of genital and nongenital cancers and normal tissue were analyzed for the presence of the DNA of human papillomavirus (HPV) 6, 11, 16, and 18 by filter in situ hybridization performed on paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissue (HISTOFISH). HPV DNA was found in 73 of 172 (42%) anogenital lesions and 17 of 116 (15%) nonanogenital carcinomas. No HPV DNA was found in normal mouse skin (five samples), human autopsy liver (two samples), or kidney (eight samples), or in carcinomas of the breast (three samples), bladder (five samples), or colon (nine samples). Of the nongenital tumors, HPV DNA was found in the carcinomas of the lung (2 of 5), anus (7 of 18), esophagus (9 of 39), buccal cavity (1 of 5), and larynx (5 of 50). HPV DNA was also detected in 2 of 11 histologically normal specimens of the cervix and 1 of 3 human skin lesions. The detection of HPV DNA in carcinomas of the lung, larynx, and esophagus as well as in the anogenital region confirms recent suggestions that HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 have a wider association with different types of cancer than previously believed. The study also shows that HISTOFISH is a useful method for detecting HPV-DNA in histologic specimens. 
5	Interpleural analgesia [published erratum appears in Heart Lung 1991 Jul;20(4):413] Postoperative pain relief is necessary not only for patient comfort, but also to facilitate ventilation and ambulation. The use of opioid analgesia, either intravenously, intramuscularly, or intraspinally, may be ineffective and can cause respiratory depression. The administration of local anesthetics into the pleural space is a technique of providing analgesia of rapid onset and long duration. This analgesia is accomplished without causing the respiratory depression or sedation associated with the use of opioids. Because innovative analgesic methods are often selected for critically ill patients presenting after surgery in the intensive care setting, critical care nurses may encounter patients receiving local anesthetics administered via interpleural catheter. 
4	Electrocardiographic markers of ischemia during mental stress testing in postinfarction patients. Role of body surface mapping. In patients with coronary artery disease, radionuclide investigations have documented a high incidence of mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia in the absence of significant electrocardiographic changes and/or angina. To investigate the causes of the low electrocardiographic sensitivity, we recorded body surface maps during mental arithmetic in 22 normal volunteers and 37 postinfarction patients with residual exercise ischemia. Myocardial perfusion was studied with thallium-201 or technetium-99 (SESTAMIBI) planar scans. In 14 patients, body surface maps were also recorded during atrial pacing at the heart rate values achieved during mental stress. While taking the body surface maps, the area from J point to 80 msec after this point (ST-80) was analyzed by integral maps, difference maps, and departure maps (the difference between each patient's difference map and the mean difference map for normal subjects). The body surface mapping criteria for ischemia were a new negative area on the integral maps, a negative potential of more than 2 SD from mean normal values on the difference maps, and a negative departure index of more than 2. Scintigraphy showed asymptomatic myocardial hypoperfusion in 33 patients. Eight patients had significant ST segment depression. The ST-80 integral and difference maps identified 17 ischemic patients. Twenty-four patients presented abnormal departure maps. One patient presented ST depression and abnormal body surface maps without reversible tracer defect. In 14 of 14 patients, atrial pacing did not reproduce the body surface map abnormalities. The analyses of the other electrocardiographic variables showed that in patients with mental stress-induced perfusion defects, only changes of T apex-T offset (aT-eT) interval in Frank leads and changes of maximum negative potential value of aT-eT integral maps significantly differed from those of normal subjects. Our results confirm the low electrocardiographic sensitivity for detecting mental stress-induced myocardial hypoperfusion in postinfarction patients. ST analysis in the body surface map increases the information content of the electrocardiographic signal. T wave analysis appears to offer fewer diagnostic advantages. 
5	The metabolic consequences of a "washed" cardiopulmonary bypass pump-priming fluid in children undergoing cardiac operations. The substrate load of the pump-priming fluid, especially glucose and lactate, has a major influence on the metabolic response of children during cardiac operations and may be detrimental neurologically. It is possible to cleanse the priming fluid of these excess substrates by ultrafiltration followed by the addition of a balanced electrolyte solution. We have used this technique in the bypass management of nine children over 1 year of age and weighing less than 18 kg who were studied from induction of anesthesia to 6 hours postoperatively. Frequent blood samples were taken for measurement of electrolytes, intermediary metabolites, and stress-related hormones. Throughout the study period electrolyte concentrations were maintained within the physiologic range and changes in blood glucose and lactate were minimized compared with those of matched historical controls from previous studies. During the period of cardiopulmonary bypass mean serum glucose concentrations varied between 4.4 and 7.7 mmol/L and peaked at 10.7 mmol/L just before skin closure. The mean serum lactate concentration did not exceed 2.3 mmol/L during the period studied. Thus ultrafiltration of the priming fluid and replacement with a balanced electrolyte solution results in the delivery to the patient of a reasonably physiologic substrate load, which is reflected in improved control of mean plasma intermediary metabolite concentrations. The method may form the basis of further clinical studies to determine specific aspects of the metabolic stress response in children. 
4	Effects of dietary calcium on nimodipine-sensitive calcium channel function in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. We studied the effects of dietary Ca2+ on blood pressure, survival, and calcium channel function to investigate cardiovascular disease mechanisms in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. Beginning at 3 weeks of age, rats were fed high sodium chloride diets (8.0%) in combination with either high (2.0%) or low (0.2%) Ca2+ diets for 8 weeks. At 12 weeks of age, survival was 90% in the high Ca2+ group and 30% in the low Ca2+ group. The higher blood pressure and lower survival in the low Ca2+ group suggest an intensification of altered vascular muscle cell mechanisms by a dietary Ca2+ deficit. Nimodipine (1-10 nM) effectively blocked L-type Ca2+ currents in isolated vascular muscle cells from both groups. Contraction of isolated cells that were not patch clamped to high potassium solutions were also blocked by 1 nM nimodipine. Disappearance of the L-type Ca2+ channel current was accelerated by holding at depolarizing potentials (positive to -50 mV) and by depolarizing steps to 0 mV. Nimodipine block of the L-type Ca2+ currents in vascular muscle is believed to contribute substantially to antihypertensive properties and stroke prevention, actions that may develop fully only in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats on a diet of at least normal Ca2+. 
1	Second primary tumours of the larynx following bronchial carcinoma. The occurrence of multiple primary malignancies in patients with laryngeal cancer is well known. The possibility that lung cancer patients may be at risk of subsequent laryngeal cancer is less well recognized. The possibility of laryngeal cancer developing later has implications for the follow-up of lung cancer patients. Three cases of subsequent laryngeal primary cancer occurring in survivors of bronchial cancer are presented and the implications are discussed. 
4	In vitro colony culture and chromosomal studies in hepatic and portal vein thrombosis--possible evidence of an occult myeloproliferative state. We have studied the prevalence of an underlying myeloproliferative state in 20 patients with either hepatic or portal vein thrombosis. Using conventional clinical and laboratory criteria, an underlying myeloproliferative state was identified as the cause of the thrombosis in five patients (25%). A further 10 of the remaining 15 cases were found to have characteristic in vitro bone marrow culture studies and cytogenetic abnormalities suggestive of an underlying myeloproliferative disorder. Although none of these 10 cases have developed overt clinical and laboratory features of such a myeloproliferative disorder after a median observation period of two years, the presence of clonal karyotypic abnormalities in three cases, increased megakaryocyte colony growth in three cases and endogenous erythropoietin independent colony growth of the marrow erythroid progenitors in seven cases, argues strongly in favour of a primary haematological disorder. This has important therapeutic implications, particularly in cases being considered for orthotopic liver transplantation. 
5	Tethered cord syndrome from a choristoma of mullerian origin. Case report. The authors report a case of tethered cord syndrome due to a choristoma of mullerian origin located in the spinal cord at the lumbosacral junction. Two similar cases were found upon review of the literature. The embryology of this lesion is discussed. 
2	Limitation of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization using iodized oil for small hepatocellular carcinoma. A study in resected cases. The radiologic and histologic findings are presented of the resection of 14 small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), less than 2 cm in maximum diameter, after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TCE) using iodized oil. The effect of TCE on small HCC depended on the morphologic type of the tumors. When no extracapsular invasion of tumor cells occurred, TCE was extremely effective against encapsulated tumors. However, in nine of the 14 resected specimens, viable tumor cells remained in or around the tumor. The authors suggest that small HCC are not always curable with TCE alone and that a multi-disciplinary approach is necessary for patients with small HCC. 
3	General principles of therapy of pyogenic meningitis. In bacterial meningitis, several pharmacodynamic factors determine therapeutic success-when defined as sterilization of the CSF: (1) Local host defense deficits in the CNS require the use of bactericidal antibiotics to sterilize the CSF. (2) CSF antibiotic concentrations that are at least 10-fold above the MBC are necessary for maximal bactericidal activity. Protein binding, low pH, and slow bacterial growth rates are among the factors that may explain the high antibiotic concentrations necessary in vivo. (3) High CSF peak concentrations that lead to rapid bacterial killing appear more important than prolonged suprainhibitory concentrations, probably because very low residual levels in the CSF prevent bacterial regrowth, even during relatively long dosing intervals. (4) Penetration of antibiotics into the CSF is significantly impaired by the blood-brain barrier and thus, very high serum levels are necessary to achieve the CSF concentrations required for optimal bactericidal activity. Beyond these principles, recent data suggests that rapid lytic killing of bacteria in the CSF may have harmful effects on the brain because of the release of biologically active products from the lysed bacteria. Since rapid CSF sterilization remains a key therapeutic goal, the harmful consequences of bacterial lysis present a major challenge in the therapy of bacterial meningitis. Currently, dexamethasone represents that only clinically beneficial approach to reduce the harmful effects of bacterial lysis, and novel approaches are required to improve the outcome of this serious infection. 
3	Availability of transplantable organs from brain stem dead donors in intensive care units. OBJECTIVE--By audit from January to June 1989 to quantify, separately for hearts, kidneys, liver, lungs and corneas, the possible increases in transplantable organs from brain stem dead potential donors in intensive care units and to compare them with the increases achieved in October-November 1989, during intense, national publicity about transplantation. DESIGN--Prospective audit of all deaths in intensive care units in England from 1 January to 30 June 1989 and subsequent case study of the impact of publicity on offers and donations during October-November 1989. SETTING--15 regional and special health authorities in England. PATIENTS--5803 patients dying in intensive care units, of whom 497 were confirmed as brain stem dead and had no general medical contraindication to organ donation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Organ specific suitability for transplantation (as reported by intensive care units); consent for donation of specific suitable organs; and procurement of specific organs reported as suitable for transplantation and offered. RESULTS--In the 497 (8.6%) brain stem dead potential donors were estimated the organ specific suitability for heart as 63%, kidneys 95%, liver 70%, lungs 29%, and corneas 91%. Refusal of relatives (30%) accounted for major losses of suitable organs of all types. For kidneys the loss was equivalent to 44% of brain stem dead actual kidney donors. No discussion of organ donation was the second most important reason for missed kidney donors, the loss being equivalent to 10% of brain stem dead actual donors. Non-procurement or difficulties with allocating organs was the second most notable cause of missed suitable liver and lung donors; 29% (55) of the offered total of 189 liver donors and 27% (21) of 78 offered suitable lung donors in six months. Non-procurement of suitable, offered organs was rare for kidneys and modest, of the order of 13% and 10% respectively, for heart and corneas. Corneal donation from brain stem dead potential donors might be improved nearly as much (that is, a 78% increase in brain stem dead actual corneal donors) by specific measures to promote corneal donation when other organs are offered as by reducing the overall refusal rate. Restricted offers, non-procurement, and no discussion of donation accounted for nearly equal numbers of lost donations of hearts (each equivalent to 15% of donated hearts). During October-November 1989 when there was intense, positive publicity about transplantation the rates of refusal and non-discussion fell compared with during January-June (22%, 36/163 v 30%, 138/460; 7%, 33/497 v 2%, 4/167 respectively). Offers of suitable donors increased significantly (p less than 0.02) compared with the first six months of 1989, most notably for heart donors (80 v 60.1 expected) and kidney donors (122 v 102.1 expected) but only for kidneys was there a noticeable 17% increase in actual donors (118 actual audited donors v 100.8 expected donors; p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS--Four strategies to increase the supply of transplantable organs from brain stem dead potential donors in intensive care units were identified: (a) reducing refusal of relatives (b) avoiding non-procurement of actually suitable organs (by logistical initiatives) and deterioration of initially suitable organs (by donor care initiatives); (c) converting restricted offers to unrestricted offers; and (d) ensuring discussion with families. Early referral to the transplant team or coordinator gives time for discussion about donor care and agreement on medical suitability for donation of specific organs. Solving some of the logistical problems of non-procurement may be a prerequisite for increased offers to be translated into increased donations. The impact of publicity therefore needs to be measured on offers of suitable donors as well as by actual donations. 
1	Mechanism of fibrous capsule formation surrounding hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunohistochemical study. In 14 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma with capsule, we studied the mechanism of capsule formation by the immunoperoxidase technique using antibodies to types I, III, and IV collagen, antilaminin antibody, and anti-prolyl hydroxylase antibody. Marked round cell infiltration was observed in the noncancerous side of the capsule and around compressed hepatocytes near the capsule. Thin capsules were composed primarily of type III collagen produced by an increased number of fibroblasts, transitional Ito cells, and hepatocytes near the capsule. In thickened capsules, the noncancerous side consisted primarily of type III collagen and the cancerous side of types I and III collagen. Type I as well as type III collagen was produced by fibroblasts, transitional Ito cells, and hepatocytes. The capsule thus formed is suggested to be part of the defense mechanisms against the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
5	Rural obstetrics: a 5-year prospective study of the outcomes of all pregnancies in a remote northern community. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a small, isolated hospital that has no facilities to perform cesarean section and handles fewer than 50 deliveries annually can provide acceptably safe obstetric and perinatal care. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Southern region of the Queen Charlotte Islands, BC, served by a 21-bed hospital and medical clinic in Queen Charlotte City. The hospital and clinic are staffed by five family practitioners without local obstetric, pediatric, anesthetic or surgical support. PATIENTS: All women beyond 20 weeks' gestation who gave birth from Jan. 1, 1984, to Dec. 31, 1988; 33% were primiparous and 20% native. Of the 286 women 192 (67%) delivered locally, 33 (12%) were transferred after admission because of antepartum or intrapartum complications, and 61 (21%) delivered elsewhere by choice or on their physician's recommendation. OUTCOME MEASURES: Perinatal mortality rate and adverse perinatal outcome (death, birth weight of less than 2500 g, neonatal transfer or Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes). MAIN RESULTS: There were six perinatal deaths, for a perinatal mortality rate of 20.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4 to 37.2). The hospital-based rate of adverse perinatal outcome was 6.2% (12 of 193 newborns) (95% CI 2.8% to 9.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The perinatal mortality rate is not a meaningful way to assess small populations; about 85 years of data would be required to decrease the 95% CIs from within 16 to within 4. The rate of adverse perinatal outcome in our study was consistent with the rate in other studies. Collaboration of small, rural hospitals is required to increase cohort size so that the correlation between the currently accepted standard, the perinatal mortality rate, and other outcome measures can be determined. 
1	Serum trace elements and Cu/Zn ratio in breast cancer patients. Serum copper, zinc, and the Cu/Zn ratio were measured in 55 patients with breast disease (20 with benign breast diseases and 35 patients with breast cancer) and 30 controls. The mean serum copper levels were higher in breast cancer than in benign breast diseases (167.3 micrograms/dl vs. 117.6 micrograms/dl) (P less than 0.001) and controls (167.3 micrograms/dl vs. 98.8 micrograms/dl) (P less than 0.001). Patients with advanced breast cancer had higher serum copper levels than did patients with early breast cancer (177.9 micrograms/dl vs. 130.4 micrograms/dl) (P less than 0.001). The mean serum zinc levels were lowered only in patients with advanced breast cancer as compared with controls (88.6 micrograms/dl vs. 115.1 micrograms/dl) (P less than 0.001). Serum zinc levels were not decreased in patients with early breast cancer and benign breast diseases. The Cu/Zn ratio was increased in breast cancer patients (1.91 vs. 0.86) (P less than 0.001) but not in patients with benign breast diseases. The precise mechanisms responsible for the alterations in trace element levels in breast cancer patients are still unclear and require further evaluation. However, the serum copper levels and the Cu/Zn ratio may be used as biochemical markers in these patients. 
4	Impact of field-transmitted electrocardiography on time to in-hospital thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. To assess the impact of a field-transmitted electrocardiogram (ECG) on patients with possible acute myocardial infarction, randomized and open trials were performed with a portable electrocardiographic system coupled with a cellular phone programmed to automatically transmit ECGs to the base hospital. Consecutive patients served by the 6 units of the Salt Lake City Emergency Rescue System were studied; 71 patients were randomized to in-field ECG (n = 34) versus no ECG (n = 37). Time on scene was 16.4 +/- 9.7 minutes for the ECG group versus 16.1 +/- 7.0 minutes for the non ECG group (difference not significant). Time of transport averaged 18.2 +/- 9.9 and 17.6 +/- 13.1 minutes, respectively (difference not significant). Six of 34 patients with in-field ECG showed acute myocardial infarction, qualified for and received thrombolytic therapy at 48 +/- 12 minutes after hospital arrival (range 30 to 60) compared with 103 +/- 44 minutes (p less than 0.01) for 51 historical control patients and 68 +/- 29 minutes for 6 concurrent control patients without in-field ECG. Thus, in-field ECG causes negligible delays in paramedic time, leads to significant decreases in time to in-hospital thrombolysis and may make in-field therapy feasible. In-field ECG may be an important addition to reperfusion strategies. 
4	Simplified method for estimating true aortic valve mean gradient from simultaneous left ventricular and peripheral arterial pressure recordings. Estimation of the aortic valve gradient by simultaneous recording of left ventricular and peripheral arterial pressures is subject to error due to delay and modulation of the arterial pressure contour as it propagates from the ascending aorta. This error can be corrected by averaging the mean gradients derived from unaltered and temporally aligned simultaneous left ventricular-peripheral arterial pressure tracings. In 26 patients with aortic stenosis and simultaneous recordings of ascending aortic and femoral arterial pressure we compared this method with a simplified approach in which the peripheral arterial pressure is partially aligned by advancing it against the left ventricular pressure by 50% of the time delay of the simultaneously recorded upstrokes. Gradients measured this way predicted the true aortic valve gradients (left ventricular-ascending aortic) with a mean difference of +1.1 mm Hg (range = +10 to -5 mm Hg). We recommend use of this simplified method of correction because it predicts true aortic valve gradient equally well as the averaging technique (r = 0.977 vs. 0.979) and requires half the time and effort. 
1	Testicular relapse in children with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. The clinical course and other distinctive features of five children who developed a testicular relapse 4 months to 25 months after the diagnosis of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) are described. The chief presenting feature at relapse was painless testicular enlargement, as is also seen in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who relapse in the testes. By French-American-British convention, the malignant cells were classified as M4 (myelomonoblastic) in four cases and M2 (myeloblastic) in one. All children received a course of multiagent reinduction chemotherapy and all but one received local irradiation to the testes. Only one of these children, whose relapse was a late event after elective cessation of therapy, is a long-term survivor. A comparison with six previously published cases shows similar clinical characteristics and outcome. Given the poor responses of such patients to conventional treatment, it seems worthwhile to consider the use of intensive reinduction chemotherapy with concomitant bilateral testicular irradiation followed by remission intensification and an autologous or allogenic marrow transplant. 
3	Growth factor expression after stroke. Fibroblast growth factors are polypeptides with potent trophic effects on central nervous system cells. Both acidic and basic forms of fibroblast growth factor are found in the mammalian brain. We have examined the expression of these factors after focal brain injury or stroke. After infarction of the lateral cerebral cortex in the mature rat brain, we found a twofold to threefold increase during the first 3 weeks after stroke in levels of fibroblast growth factors in tissue surrounding infarcts. This increase persisted for at least 2 months and appeared mainly to be due to increased levels of basic, but not acidic, fibroblast growth factor. Because of its gliotrophic, angiogenic, and neuronotrophic properties, basic fibroblast growth factor may play an important role in the cascade of cellular reactions that contributes to wound healing and functional recovery after stroke. 
5	Late rupture of a superior intercostal artery following repair of aortic coarctation. Having had surgical repair of aortic coarctation at the age of 12 years, and re-operation at the age of 19 years for stenosis at the site of the previous repair, a 29 years old man presented as an emergency with a 24 hour history of interscapular pain, haemoptysis and collapse. At thoracotomy he was found to have a ruptured superior intercostal artery which was ligated. Spontaneous rupture of an intercostal artery has not been previously recorded. 
1	A clinicopathologic study of the eyes in familial adenomatous polyposis with extracolonic manifestations (Gardner's syndrome). The eyes of a 51-year-old woman with familial adenomatous polyposis and extracolonic manifestations (Gardner's syndrome) were obtained postmortem and studied by light microscopy and by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. We found a generalized abnormality in melanogenesis of the retinal pigment epithelium and at least three types of pigmented lesions. The histologic findings in one type of lesion were consistent with congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium or benign pigmented nevus of the retinal pigment epithelium. The other two types of lesion were most consistent with hamartomatous malformations of the retinal pigment epithelium featuring cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and rarely retinal invasion and formation of a minute mushroom-shaped tumor. These histopathologic findings indicate a generalized effect of the familial adenomatous polyposis gene on the retinal pigment epithelium. This oncogene, which is responsible for tumor formation in the gastrointestinal tract, soft tissues, bone, and other locations in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, also leads to a generalized defect in melanogenesis and focal lesions of the retinal pigment epithelium. 
1	Intrapleural cisplatin and cytarabine in the management of malignant pleural effusions: a Lung Cancer Study Group trial. Malignant pleural effusions are a common and significant problem in patients with advanced malignancies. Pleurodesis with tetracycline or other sclerosing agents is the usual treatment for malignant pleural effusions. In contrast to this approach, intrapleural chemotherapy has the potential advantage of treating the underlying malignancy in addition to controlling the effusion. Intracavitary cisplatin-based chemotherapy, which is cytotoxic rather than sclerosing, has proven safe and effective via the intraperitoneal route in ovarian cancer and malignant mesothelioma. There has been little previous experience, however, with intrapleural cisplatin-based chemotherapy. As part of a planned series of trials in malignant mesothelioma, the Lung Cancer Study Group first evaluated intrapleural cisplatin and cytarabine in patients with malignant pleural effusions from a variety of solid tumors. From April 1986 to November 1987, 46 patients with cytologically proven, symptomatic, and previously untreated malignant pleural effusions were entered on study. A single dose of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 plus cytarabine 1,200 mg was instilled into the pleural space via a chest tube, which was then immediately removed. Patients were evaluated for toxicity and response at 24 hours; 1, 2, and 3 weeks; and then monthly. No recurrence of the effusion was considered a complete response (CR). Partial response (PR) was defined as a 75% or greater decrease in the amount of the effusion on serial chest radiographs. One patient experienced reversible grade 4 renal toxicity, four patients had grade 3 hematologic toxicity, and five patients had grade 3 cardiopulmonary toxicity. The overall response rate (CR plus PR) at 3 weeks was 49% (18 of 37 patients). The median length of response was 9 months for a CR and 5.1 months for a PR. The outcome of this trial was sufficiently encouraging that this regimen has been incorporated into subsequent trials for malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
1	Patterns of epidermal growth factor receptors in basal and squamous cell carcinoma. The presence of immunoreactive epidermal growth factor receptors in human skin tumors was investigated using the indirect immunoperoxidase technique. Sixteen basal cell carcinomas and 11 squamous cell carcinomas were evaluated. All of the specimens studied were receptor positive. In 70% of the specimens there was prominent staining of the cell membranes. In 54% of the nodular basal cell carcinoma specimens there was increased staining at the periphery of the tumor cell masses. 
4	Sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: results of a nationwide survey. A postal questionnaire inquiring about routine sedation and premedication practice for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was sent to 1048 doctors. Of 665 appropriate returns, 81% were from consultant physicians and surgeons. Most endoscopists (90%) reported using an intravenous benzodiazepine for at least three quarters of endoscopies and 54% of physicians and 69% of surgeons always did so. Midazolam was the intravenous sedative used by a third of all respondents and 13% also used an additional intravenous agent, usually pethidine. Over the previous two years a total of 119 respiratory arrests, 37 cardiac arrests, and 52 deaths were identified. Adverse outcomes were reported more frequently by consultant physicians, by those who 'titrated' the intravenous sedative, and by those who used an additional intravenous agent, but were reported equally frequently by endoscopists using midazolam and endoscopists using diazepam. There is an urgent need for a prospective study to identify the circumstances and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes related to endoscopy. 
2	Prospective study of the frequency and size distribution of polyps missed by colonoscopy. An important determinant in interpreting the results of colorectal polyp chemoprevention trials is the rate of polyps missed during colonscopic examination. We prospectively examined 90 patients by tandem colonoscopy performed by two alternating examiners. In 69 (76.7%) patients, 221 neoplastic lesions were documented histologically. Of a total of 58 lesions detected in 31 patients, no neoplastic lesion greater than or equal to 10 mm in size was missed; 16% of diminutive (less than or equal to 5 mm) neoplastic polyps and 12.3% of medium-sized (6-9 mm) neoplastic polyps were missed by the first examiner. We conclude that an experienced colonoscopist will miss about 15% of colorectal neoplastic polyps less than 10 mm in size in the setting of adequate bowel preparation. Large (greater than or equal to 10 mm) polyps were rarely missed, however, with the "miss" rate in our study equal to 0, with a 95% confidence limit of 4.64%. 
3	Fasciculations due to verapamil in a patient with neuropathy. A patient with pre-existing peripheral neuropathy developed generalized fasciculations under verapamil which ceased after discontinuation of the drug. It is suggested that the increase in acetylcholine (ACh) release at the neuromuscular junction by verapamil may trigger fasciculation in the state of regeneration at ACh-sensitive sites of axon terminals and immature axon sprouts. 
5	Dynamic cardiomyoplasty in chronic Chagas' heart disease: clinicopathological data. We report a 44-year-old man with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy who underwent latissimus dorsi dynamic cardiomyoplasty and died 4 months later. The clinicopathological findings are discussed, and the literature is reviewed. 
2	Increased cholecystectomy rates in Saudi Arabia Gallstones have become increasingly prevalent in Saudi Arabia, where cholecystectomy is now one of the commonest major abdominal operations. 2854 people underwent cholecystectomy in the 14 hospitals of the country's Eastern Province in the years 1977 to 1986. During this period the overall frequency of cholecystectomy increased by 978%, a finding not explained by the 67% increase in population or the 87% increase in other operations. Simultaneously, the average daily individual consumption of total calories, fat, and sugar increased by 81%, 197%, and 164%, respectively, and consumption of high-fibre grain fell by 75%. This striking increase in the frequency of cholecystectomy, which presumably reflects the incidence of gallstones, cannot be explained by demographic changes and seems more closely linked to the concomitant changes in dietary habits. 
5	Perianal abscess and fistula-in-ano in children. The authors present a retrospective review of 40 pediatric patients with perianal abscess and/or fistula-in-ano. The total patient population could be divided clinically into 2 broad groups. The first group consisted of 22 infants younger than 2 years of age, all of whom were males, and 10 of whom presented with recurrences after previous incision and drainage. Of the 14 infants presenting with an abscess, in 12 (85.7 percent), a fistula-in-ano was discovered at surgery. In contrast, in the group of 18 children older than 2 years of age, there were 7 females and 11 males, and fistulas were identified in only 7 of 13 patients (54.8 percent) who presented with abscesses. Surgical treatment consisted of examination under anesthesia and a diligent search for a fistulous tract. Abscesses were primarily saucerized and fistulotomy and cryptotomy of the confluent crypt was performed if a fistulous tract was identified. The only recurrences with this form of treatment occurred in the two immunocompromised patients. 
1	Incidence of polymyositis-dermatomyositis: a 20-year study of hospital diagnosed cases in Allegheny County, PA 1963-1982. The incidence of hospital diagnosed polymyositis-dermatomyositis (PM-DM) among residents of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, PA was determined from 1963 to 1982. Medical records of all Allegheny County hospitals were searched for patients diagnosed PM-DM, and each accepted case was reviewed and verified by a physician, according to specified criteria. Direct age adjusted incidence rates were computed for race and sex, as new cases/million population/year, with the 1970 Allegheny County population as the standard. One hundred seventy-seven cases were identified during this 20-year survey for a total annual incidence of 5.5/million population. Incidence more than tripled during 1973-1982 compared to the first decade of study, with the greatest increase occurring in black women. Overall, the female to male incidence ratio was 2.2:1, but during the childbearing years (ages 15-44) this ratio increased to greater than 5:1 in both races. Detection of PM-DM is increasing, as shown by temporal trends. Although our series has significantly more adult PM and less DM and overlap cases than other published studies, annual incidence is similar to that reported in other locales. 
4	Intraoperative coronary artery endarterectomy with excimer laser. Compared with continuous-wave lasers, excimer lasers exhibit several in vitro advantages: nonthermal ablation process and linear relation between the number of pulses and the depth of the crater. A 308 nm, 20 nsec pulse duration, 1 to 5 repetition rate laser was specifically designed for clinical application. At the time of cardiopulmonary bypass in 10 symptomatic patients, before bypass grafting, a 1 mm diameter core specifically ultraviolet-tipped fiberoptic scope was introduced via the coronary arteriotomy and placed upstream (seven patients) and downstream (three patients) in contact with the stenosis. Laser power was increasingly delivered up to the clearing of the stenosis or occlusion. Quality of angioplasty was controlled by calibration of the neolumen, cardioplegic solution output through the laser-treated segment, and an eighth day or sixth month coronary arteriogram. In the first three patients studied on the eighth day, all laser-treated coronary artery segments showed an early parallel-linked patent neolumen despite competitive bypass graft flow. In the patients studied after 6 months, all recanalized segments were patent except one; in one patient the venous graft was occluded, but the upstream laser angioplasty was patent. The main limitation of the method lies in the fact that laser coronary recanalization is confined to the fiber core diameter. We conclude that (1) excimer laser angioplasty may be safe and efficient during surgical procedure and (2) as catheter flexibility remains the most critical problem, we are now assuming an appropriate tool with a multifiber system that is suitable for intraoperative as well as percutaneous routes. 
4	Calcium entry blockade and adrenergic vascular reactivity in hypertensives: differences between nicardipine and diltiazem. The interference of nicardipine and diltiazem infused into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates, with the forearm vascular response to graded exogenous norepinephrine, was evaluated in hypertensive patients. Nicardipine (1 and 3 micrograms/dl forearm tissue/min in both absence and presence of propranolol) increased forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography) and antagonized dose dependently the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine, suggesting that functional alpha-antagonism may participate in the vasodilating and possibly the antihypertensive effect of the drug. On the contrary, no antagonism but rather potentiation of the responses to norepinephrine occurred after diltiazem (0.5 and 1 microgram/dl forearm tissue/min). Because intra-arterial propranolol abolished that potentiating action of the drug, whereas the local vasodilation to isoproterenol was clearly reduced, diltiazem probably interfered with beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasorelaxing mechanisms in human forearm arterioles. The data further stress the heterogeneity of calcium entry blockers in humans. 
2	Impact of active immunisation against enteritis necroticans in Papua New Guinea. Enteritis necroticans, known locally as pigbel, has been a major cause of illness and death among children in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. After a successful trial of active immunisation against the beta toxin of the causative organism, Clostridium perfringens type C, immunisation of children was begun in 1980. The effects of the immunisation programme on pigbel admissions in 3 of the 5 major highland hospitals were assessed. In each of the centres studied the proportion of admissions due to enteritis necroticans dropped significantly after immunisation was introduced (p less than 0.001) and hospital admissions for pigbel in 1984-86, when immunisation was well established, were less than one fifth of previous figures. 
5	Intrarectal ultrasonography in rectal cancer staging and in the evaluation of pelvic disease. Clinical uses of intrarectal ultrasound. Accurate preoperative staging of a rectal cancer patient may impact heavily on subsequent management. This study attempts to evaluate the accuracy of intrarectal ultrasonography (IRUS) in staging rectal cancers compared to clinical and pathologic examination. In addition the accuracy of IRUS was assessed in a group of patients with uncertain pelvic-perirectal disease after a negative physical examination. In a prospective manner, 52 cancer patients were staged with digital exam and IRUS. Accuracy rates were 48% and 83%, respectively, compared to pathologic evaluation in assessing wall penetration, and IRUS identified positive lymph nodes in 12 of 17 cases. In patients with pelvic disease, IRUS corresponded with pathologic diagnosis in 15 of 17 cases and revealed new information in 6 patients. Intrarectal ultrasonography appears to be the most accurate imaging technique for staging rectal cancers and demonstrates promise in the evaluation of perirectal-pelvic disease. 
3	Phenotypic variability in glutaric aciduria type I: Report of fourteen cases in five Canadian Indian kindreds. We describe 14 patients with glutaric aciduria type 1 in five Canadian Indian kindreds living in Manitoba and northwest Ontario. The patients had marked clinical variability of the disease, even within families. Eight followed the typical clinical course of normal early growth and development until the onset of neurologic abnormalities, often precipitated by infection, between 6 weeks and 7 1/2 months of age. Five patients had early developmental delay; one was thought to be normal until 8 years of age. Three patients died, seven are severely mentally and physically handicapped, and four have only mild mental retardation or incoordination. Six patients had macrocephaly in the neonatal period. Computed tomography was done for 12 patients, and findings were abnormal in 11. Glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid were detected in increased amounts in the urine of all patients, but the concentrations were much lower than those in most other reported patients. Glutaryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase activity in skin fibroblasts, interleukin-2-dependent lymphocytes, or both, ranged from 0% to 13% of control values. There was no correlation between clinical severity and urine glutaric acid concentration or level of residual enzyme activity. We recommend that organic acid analysis of the urine be done in patients with unexplained cerebral palsy-like disorders, especially if the computed tomographic scan is abnormal. If there is suspicion of glutaric aciduria, glutaryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase should be measured in fibroblasts or lymphocytes even if glutaric acid is not increased in the urine. 
5	Acceleration of luteinizing hormone pulse frequency in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea by dopaminergic blockade. A constellation of neuroendocrine secretory aberrations, including reduced LH pulse frequency and PRL concentrations, has been documented in women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). As pituitary function was preserved, these aberrations were attributed to an alteration in hypothalamic neuromodulation. To investigate the participation of the dopaminergic system in the genesis of the reduced LH pulse frequency and suppressed PRL levels in FHA, we studied six women with FHA and six cyclic women in the early follicular phase by obtaining blood samples at 15-min intervals for 48 h during sequential 24-h infusions of saline and a dopamine receptor blocker, metoclopramide (MCP). A hypothalamic vs. pituitary site of action was inferred from the pulsatility characteristics. MCP consistently elicited an increase in the LH pulse frequency in the women with FHA [7.3 +/- 1.2 (+/- SE) to 10.5 +/- 1.3 pulses/24 h; P less than 0.005]. In contrast, the eumenorrheic women did not show a significant change in LH pulse frequency in response to MCP (15.2 +/- 1.0 to 14.3 +/- 0.9 pulses/24 h). While the PRL concentrations were significantly lower in the FHA group during the infusion of saline (P less than 0.001) and MCP (P less than 0.005), the relative increases in PRL during MCP were similar in both groups. The acceleration of LH pulse frequency by blockade of dopamine receptors implies that there is increased hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition of GnRH pulse frequency in women with FHA. 
4	Clustering of atherogenic behaviors in coffee drinkers. We studied the clustering of coffee consumption and selected atherogenic behaviors in older adults living in a southern California community. Men were somewhat more likely to drink caffeinated coffee while women were more likely to drink decaffeinated coffee. In men, but not women, caffeinated coffee drinking decreased with age and decaffeinated coffee drinking increased. Caffeinated coffee drinkers drank more alcohol, consumed more dietary saturated fats and cholesterol, were more likely to be current smokers and less likely to be current exercisers than were non-coffee drinkers. Smoking and exercise also showed a dose-response relationship to the amount of caffeinated coffee consumed. Risk factor levels among drinkers of decaffeinated coffee were more like those of caffeinated coffee than non-drinkers. These data illustrate the clustering of atherogenic behaviors with coffee drinking and highlight their potential importance in interpreting the growing body of literature about coffee and health. 
1	Congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system: a new clinical classification. The numerous clinical presentations of congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system in children and the confusing terminology used to describe their pathologic diagnoses impede the physician's understanding of the condition. The clinical classification based on the actual symptoms of the congenital problems we have presented here should help the physician identify the specific abnormality and a potential treatment. Future research should concentrate on the specific causes and the treatment of these congenital abnormalities. 
3	The neuroradiology of visual disturbances. The neuroradiology of visual deficits has advanced dramatically in recent years. Plain film evaluation of the orbit and face remains useful in the emergency room for the evaluation of trauma. High-resolution coronal CT remains the method of choice in the assessment of serious injury to the orbit and in cases of penetrating metallic foreign body. The contrast-enhanced orbital CT provides useful information in cases of tumor and infection and when the bones of the face or skull are involved. MRI has largely replaced CT in the search for brain infarct, brain tumor, and cerebral inflammatory and demyelinating processes. MRI is the study of choice in all cases of sellar and parasellar disease. It offers high-resolution images in any plane. GTPA enhancement has provided additional information from MRI without significant risk. The final selection of an imaging modality should be based upon the clinical presentation and any physical limitations of the patient. 
3	Alterations in brain phosphate metabolite concentrations in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals often demonstrate neuropsychiatric impairment; however, it is unclear how brain metabolism may be altered in such patients. We used in vivo phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy to noninvasively assess brain energy and phospholipid metabolism by measuring brain concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), and inorganic phosphate (Pi), as well as phospholipid compounds and intracellular pH. In study 1, 17 HIV-seropositive men with varying degrees of neuropsychiatric impairment and six control subjects were studied. Localized spectra were obtained from a heterogeneous 5 x 5 x 5-cm volume of interest (VOI). Patients with HIV infection had a significantly lower ATP/Pi ratio and a trend for a lower PCr/Pi ratio than did the control group. In addition, the ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi ratios were both significantly negatively correlated with overall severity of neuropsychiatric impairment. In study 2, three HIV-seropositive men with neuropsychiatric impairment were compared with 11 HIV-seronegative men. Localized phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectra were obtained from two relatively homogeneous VOIs: (1) a predominantly white matter VOI, and (2) a predominantly subcortical gray matter VOI. The three HIV-infected patients demonstrated significantly decreased ATP and PCr concentrations in the white matter VOI. These results suggest that HIV infection of the brain may impair brain cellular oxidative metabolism and that the degree of metabolic compromise may be related to the severity of neuropsychiatric impairment. 
5	Management of aortic insufficiency in chronic aortic dissection. From January 1980 to December 1988, 44 patients with chronic aortic dissection and aortic insufficiency underwent operation. This group of patients was analyzed to evaluate the outcome of those in whom the aortic valve was preserved compared with those having valve replacement. The overall preoperative characteristics of the two groups were similar except for the incidence of Marfan's syndrome. Valve replacement was the elected procedure in patients with valve degeneration or annuloaortic ectasia. In patients with leaflet prolapse with or without an enlarged annulus, a plastic procedure was used. In 48% of the patients, it was possible to preserve the valve. There were five hospital deaths (11%): three were due to low-output syndrome, one was due to bleeding, and one was due to neurological complications. There were two late deaths (5%). Follow-up of the 37 surviving patients ranged from 2 to 108 months (mean follow-up, 18 months). Seventy-eight percent of the survivors were in functional class I and the others were in class II. Two patients in whom the aortic valve was preserved had mild aortic insufficiency. Three patients with bioprostheses underwent reoperation because of prosthetic valve dysfunction. One patient who had aortoplasty and an aortic valve plastic procedure was seen with redissection and aortic insufficiency after 60 months and was reoperated on using the Bentall technique. The actuarial survival curves showed that patients who underwent valvoplasty had higher, but not significantly higher, survival rates than the valve replacement patients. 
1	Enhanced expression of c-myc and H-ras oncogenes in Letterer-Siwe disease. A sequential study using colorimetric in situ hybridization. Tissues from two patients with disseminated histiocytosis X (Letterer-Siwe disease) in which histiocytosis X cells exhibited histologic and cytologic features of malignancy were evaluated by in situ hybridization with the use of biotinylated nucleic acid probes to c-myc and H-ras oncogenes. Enhanced expression of these oncogenes was observed in mononucleated and multinucleated cells of histiocytosis X in the terminal proliferative phase but not in the early quiescent phase of Letterer-Siwe disease in both patients. Our findings indicate that deregulation of c-myc and H-ras in histiocytosis X are late events that likely confer a selective growth advantage to histiocytosis X cells.

5	Interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy. It has been estimated that 20 million people in the United States have gallstone disease. The choice of the optimal management strategy for a patient with symptomatic gallstones in the 1990s will take into account the clinical status of the patient, the characteristics of the gallstones, and the patient's preference. Only patients whose doctors understand the advantages and disadvantages of the newer methods can make properly informed choices. When interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy are being contemplated, one approach is to first consider the patient's clinical presentation (acute or nonacute) and then their risk of death after cholecystectomy (low or high). Figure 5 shows an algorithmic approach to the management of gallbladder stones based on this concept. This algorithm also can be used as a framework for discussion of treatment options with any individual patient.
