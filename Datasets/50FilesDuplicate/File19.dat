5	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without hypertrophy: two families with myocardial disarray in the absence of increased myocardial mass Two families are described in which individuals showed widespread myocardial disarray at histological examination, in the absence of macroscopic cardiac hypertrophy. In one family the clinical presentation was that of sudden unexpected cardiac death in four family members; members of the other family presented with electrocardiographic repolarisation changes and abnormalities of left ventricular diastolic function. The finding of myocardial disarray, the characteristic histological abnormality of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in the absence of increased cardiac mass suggests a wider range of abnormality in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than is currently recognised. 
2	Broad spectrum penicillin as an adequate therapy for acute cholangitis. In a previous study of patients with acute cholecystitis, we demonstrated equal efficacy with a broad spectrum penicillin (piperacillin) and a penicillin plus amino-glycoside combination. Whether a single agent broad spectrum penicillin is adequate treatment for more severe infections, such as acute cholangitis, however, is still unclear. We, therefore, conducted a three center, prospective, randomized trial to determine whether or not a broad spectrum penicillin alone is adequate therapy for patients with acute cholangitis. During a 36 month period, 96 patients with sepsis and biliary obstruction were randomly assigned to receive either piperacillin (n = 49) or ampicillin plus tobramycin (n = 47). The two groups receiving antibiotics were similar with respect to all clinical and laboratory parameters. The incidence of blood cultures with positive results (20 versus 21 per cent) and underlying malignant lesions (51 versus 62 per cent) was also similar between the two groups. The percentage of patients with a clinical cure or significant improvement was the same in the two groups (69 versus 70 per cent). However, there was a significant difference in the cure rate between patients with benign and malignant biliary obstructions (83 versus 59 per cent, p less than 0.01). No significant differences were noted between the two antibiotic groups with respect to drug toxicity, but patients with malignant conditions were more prone to antibiotic related toxicities (2 versus 19 per cent, p less than 0.05). These data suggest that outcome of treatment in patients with acute cholangitis is similar with either a broad spectrum penicillin or a penicillin plus aminoglycoside combination and is dependent upon the nature of the biliary obstruction. 
5	Evaluation of antral mast cells in nonulcer dyspepsia. Two hundred twenty-five patients with the symptoms of nonulcer dyspepsia underwent clinical and endoscopic evaluation including histologic assessment of endoscopic biopsies. Mast cells were counted after special staining with low pH Alcian blue. Of 225 patients, 31 (13%) were found to have 11 or greater mast cells per high-power field. Endoscopic and routine histologic findings were similar between the subset of 31 patients with 11 or more mast cells and the entire group of 225. The 31 patients with increased antral mast cells had failed treatment with standard drug used for peptic ulcer disease. H1-antagonists improved symptoms in the majority of patients (79%) in whom we had adequate follow-up. Patients with increased mast cells on antral biopsy appear to be subset of patients with nonulcer dyspepsia amenable specific treatment with H1-antagonists. 
1	Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia associated with a left cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia is characterized by the presence of spasms of the orbicularis oculi (blepharospasm) and of the lower facial or oromandibular muscles. A patient with this syndrome is presented in which a left cerebellopontine angle meningioma appeared to act as a triggering mechanism for the development of this disorder. On the basis of this report, we recommend that physicians search for this tumor in patients with this disorder. 
4	Management of asymptomatic chronic aortic regurgitation with left ventricular dysfunction: a decision analysis STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal strategy for the timing of aortic valve replacement in patients with chronic, severe aortic regurgitation with left ventricular dysfunction. DESIGN: Decision analysis comparing early surgery (timed at the onset of left ventricular dysfunction) with delayed surgery (timed at the onset of symptoms) using data from the literature and expert opinion for variables in a representative case scenario (40-year-old man with bicuspid aortic valve disease). SETTING: Tertiary care center doing valve replacement surgery. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The early-surgery approach was preferred based on quality-adjusted life years. Sensitivity analysis showed that the result was not affected by the following variables within their derived ranges: rate of symptom development after onset of left ventricular dysfunction for the delayed-surgery approach, perioperative mortality for both approaches, and occurrence of major nonfatal stroke or congestive heart failure for both approaches. Although the decision was sensitive to the yearly postoperative mortality rates, the delayed-surgery operative mortality rate had to be almost as low as the early-surgery rate to change the preference to the delayed-surgery approach. The preference could also change if survival were much more important to the patient in the first five years than after five years or if the patient disliked living on anticoagulants enough to value a year on anticoagulants as worth only 80% of a year not on anticoagulants. CONCLUSION: This decision analysis provides quantitative support for the impression that patients similar to the case scenario do better with surgery timed at the onset of ventricular dysfunction than with surgery delayed until symptoms develop. It thus supports the practice of following these patients noninvasively in order to time surgery. 
3	Angiographic localization of spinal cord blood supply and its relationship to postoperative paraplegia. Forty-seven patients underwent selective catheterization of middle and lower thoracic intercostal and upper lumbar arteries to define the origin of the artery of Adamkiewicz. One patient had significant atheroembolism, and a second had transient lower extremity paresthesias. No other complications occurred. The origin was found in 26 (55%), and 21 patients underwent thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair with this knowledge. When the critical lumbar or intercostal artery could be included as part of a long proximal or distal anastomosis, all 12 patients could be included as part of a long proximal or distal anastomosis, all 12 patients survived, and one was paralyzed. However, if the aneurysm repair mandated a midgraft anastomosis to intercostal arteries critical to spinal cord perfusion, seven of nine patients either died or were paralyzed (p less than 0.05). In the group of 19 patients operated on in whom spinal cord blood supply was not identified three patients had a technically unsuccessful operation; two died, and one was paralyzed. Twelve of 16 patients who had an adequate, but unsuccessful attempt at localization were treated by intercostal "neglect" and survived. Late paresis developed in two patients, but they are walking now. One of the patients who died had multiple systems failure and awakened paraplegic. She had a patent, enlarged, thoracic radicular artery at T-5 which probably supplied to spinal cord and which was missed angiographically. Paralysis was associated with aneurysm extent (group 2 and III B, dissections vs group 1 & 3, p less than 0.05). Selective intercostal angiography requires further refinement, but it is safe and offers the promise of understanding the mechanisms and risks of spinal cord complications after repair of extensive thoracoabdominal aneurysms. 
4	Cerebral infarction and release of platelet thromboxane after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate and the release of thromboxane B2 were studied in 68 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage during the second week after the hemorrhage, when delayed ischemic deterioration most often occurs. Follow-up computed tomographic scans were performed later than 1 month after subarachnoid hemorrhage to reveal permanent hypodense areas consistent with cerebral infarction. Occurrence of hypodense lesions on the follow-up computed tomographic scan was significantly associated with the presence of delayed ischemic deterioration (DID) (P less than 0.01). Patients with subcortical or cortical cerebral infarctions due to DID released more platelet thromboxane B2 than those with no evidence of a hypodense lesion on the computed tomographic scan (P less than 0.05). Hypodense areas caused by an intracerebral hematoma or small, deep-seated infarcts due to DID were not associated with significantly elevated release of thromboxane B2, but the lacunar type infarcts were associated with increased aggregation of platelets. The results suggest that augmented platelet function may be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction due to DID. 
1	Complications of percutaneous abdominal fine-needle biopsy. Review. To determine whether the increasing use of percutaneous fine-needle biopsy of abdominal lesions is associated with an increase in serious complications, the author updated a literature search and evaluated a questionnaire (distributed among selected hospitals in the United States in 1986 and 1987) that followed up a questionnaire distributed in 1983. The updated literature review revealed a total of 24 deaths and 20 needle tract seedings. The updated questionnaire revealed five deaths after 16,381 biopsies (0.031%), whereas the previous questionnaire had shown four deaths after 63,108 biopsies (0.006%). Two similar European questionnaires revealed mortality rates of 0.008% and 0.018%, respectively. Of the total of 33 deaths, 21 involved biopsies of liver lesions; six involved pancreatic biopsies. Seventeen of the 21 deaths after liver biopsies were secondary to hemorrhage; five of the six deaths after pancreatic biopsies were due to pancreatitis. Of the 23 instances of needle tract seeding, 10 occurred after biopsies of pancreatic malignancies. The frequencies of needle tract seeding in the four questionnaires were 0.005%, 0.006%, 0.003%, and 0.009%, respectively. Although infrequent, serious complications may be associated with this procedure. The author makes suggestions that may help minimize them. 
5	Melanoma in pregnancy. The clinical course of malignant melanoma in pregnancy has been a subject of controversy, but current evidence indicates that it is similar to the clinical course in non-pregnant patients. Early detection and biopsy of localized disease is crucial because early treatment provides an excellent prognosis. Surgical excision is the primary therapy for this disease. As the primary care provider for many women in the reproductive age group, obstetrician-gynecologists have an opportunity to detect these lesions at their earliest stages when they are amenable to cure. Overall, maternal metastases to the fetus and placenta are very rare events and do not warrant elective termination based on the maternal diagnosis. However, a thorough examination of the infant and placenta should be done in all cases of melanoma complicating pregnancy. After treatment, long-term follow-up is recommended. Since most recurrences develop within 3 years after the diagnosis, it remains prudent to recommend that these patients avoid a subsequent pregnancy during this interval. 
4	Psychophysiological stress testing in postinfarction patients. Psychological correlates of cardiovascular arousal and abnormal cardiac responses. The psychophysiological responses to two mental stress tests (mental arithmetic and an interactive concentration task) were assessed in 168 unmedicated, male, postinfarction patients 36-69 years old. Patients also completed a standard battery of psychological tests. Psychophysiological responses were generally unrelated to age and education. Comparison of patients scoring high (more than 75%) and low (less than 25%) relative to the normal population on psychological measures indicated that heart rate and blood pressure responses to mental stress tests were significantly greater in those reporting low than in those reporting high neuroticism. The study population was subsequently divided into high, medium, and low cardiovascular responders on the basis of rate-pressure product reactions to the two stress tests. The three cardiovascular response groups did not differ in age, interval between myocardial infarction and stress testing, ejection fraction, incidence of exercise-induced ischemia, or ischemic signs during Holter monitoring. However, the high cardiovascular responders were more likely to manifest possible or definite electrocardiographic signs of ischemia or significant arrhythmia during mental stress testing than were the medium or low cardiovascular responders (50% versus 19.6% and 7%, respectively). High cardiovascular responders also reported lower levels of trait anxiety, neuroticism, psychophysiological symptoms, and depression. 
5	The chest radiograph appearances seen following high dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation for resistant malignant lymphoma. The objective of this study was to review and analyse the chest radiograph (CXR) appearances seen following high dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), and to identify any characteristic patterns. Thirty-one patients underwent ABMT between 1984 and 1989 for high grade lymphoma resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Their case notes and CXRs were reviewed in conjunction with the clinicians. In this small sample of patients, an acute interstitial pattern was seen with pulmonary oedema following bone marrow reinfusion in two cases of the 13 patients showing CXR changes (15%). Otherwise, the CXR changes following ABMT were not specific, although they did alert the clinician to the possibilities of recurrent lymphoma or opportunistic infection, enabling appropriate investigations and treatment to be instituted at an early stage. The complications and CXR changes did not differ greatly from those seen following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. 
1	The 1989 presidential address. International Society for the Study of Vulvar Disease. Major changes in the terminology for vulvar disease have taken place in the past 20 years under the influence of the members of the International Society for the Study of Vulvar Disease. Major terminology changes have been made for vulvar nonneoplastic disorders, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia and superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma. 
3	Glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy prevention by exercise in fast-twitch fibers. Exercise has been shown to be effective in preventing glucocorticoid-induced atrophy in muscles containing high proportions of type II or fast-twitch fibers. This investigation was undertaken to further evaluate this response in type IIa and IIb fibers, determined by histochemical staining for myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase with alkaline and acid preincubation. Steroid [cortisol acetate (CA), 100 mg/kg body wt] and exercise (running 90 min/day, 29 m/min) treatments were initiated simultaneously for 11 consecutive days in female rats. Fiber distribution and area measurements were performed in a deep and superficial region of plantaris muscle. The exercise regimen spared approximately 40% of the CA-induced plantaris muscle atrophy. In the deep region, the fiber population, which contained approximately 13% type I (slow-twitch), 24% type IIa, and 63% IIb fibers, was not affected by either treatment. In the superficial section, which consisted solely of type II fibers, the proportion of type IIa fibers was higher (27 vs. 9%, P less than 0.01) in the steroid- than in the vehicle-treated groups. Within each region, type IIa fibers were less susceptible to atrophy than type IIb fibers, and within each fiber type, the deep region had less atrophy than the superficial region. Type I fibers were unchanged by steroid treatment. For type IIa fibers, exercise prevented 100% of the atrophy in the deep region and 50% in the superficial region. For type IIb fibers, the activity spared 67 and 40% of the atrophy in these same regions, respectively. These results show that glucocorticoids are capable of changing the myosin phenotype. 
4	Combined internal mammary artery graft for coronary artery revascularization. Five patients with multiple-vessel coronary artery disease underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting with a technique involving both internal mammary arteries and a small piece of interposed saphenous vein. The combined internal mammary artery grafts were used for sequential grafting. A total of 20 anastomoses were performed (average number, 4 anastomoses per patient). There were no operative deaths. Postoperative complications included reoperation for bleeding in 1 patient and diaphragmatic dysfunction in another. Postoperative coronary angiography 2 days before discharge (mean time, 10 days postoperatively) revealed that all the sequential anastomoses with the combined IMA graft were patent. Exercise tolerance tests performed 3 and 11 months postoperatively indicated excellent results and no ischemia. Based on this experience, we conclude that this method appears promising for multivessel coronary artery bypass grafting. 
3	Vector short-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials after median nerve stimulation. A new method has been developed for recording short-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials after median nerve stimulation. Negative electrical forces recorded with three orthodiagonal bipolar electrodes in the neck had a direction opposite to that of impulse conduction in the proximal peripheral and cervical somatosensory pathway. Sequential tracings of vectors opposite the electrical forces were made in three-dimensional display, thus reproducing the actual time sequence of electrical events in those structures. Fixed generators such as the subcortical nuclei were also analyzed with this technique, and multiple generators of N13 potential (N13a and N13b) were visualized. This technique may be useful in the functional evaluation of the somatosensory pathway in the cervical cord. 
5	Closure of a bronchopleural fistula with bronchoscopic instillation of tetracycline. Persistent bronchopleural fistulas (BPF) due to infection, trauma, or thoracic surgical procedures are often difficult to manage. We report a patient with fulminant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia complicated by chronic BPF formation which prevented weaning from mechanical ventilation due to severe air leak. Fistula closure was obtained by instillation of tetracycline into the fistula via a fiberoptic bronchoscope using a balloon catheter and blood clot occlusion technique. This closed the BPF and allowed successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. 
3	Relationship of laparoscopic findings to self-report of pelvic pain. An assessment battery including standardized measures of behavioral and psychosocial factors associated with other chronic pain conditions was administered to 102 women scheduled for laparoscopic surgery. Surgeons who were blinded to the patient's self-reported pain data completed the American Fertility Society classification for endometriosis and adhesions on the basis of observed physical disease. Although American Fertility Society classification scores were significantly related to self-assignment into pain or no-pain groups, the extent of physical disease evaluated by this procedure was not significantly correlated with ratings of pain levels or a number of indexes of impairment. The group of patients with laparoscopically diagnosed pathologic conditions reported higher pain levels and greater interference than the group who reported pain and had negative laparoscopic results; however, some women with observable pathologic conditions reported no pain symptoms. 
5	Skin manifestations in congenital deficiency of leucocyte-adherence glycoproteins (CDLG). In congenital deficiency of leucocyte-adherence glycoproteins (CDLG) there is an immunodeficiency with impaired leucocyte function and cutaneous and extracutaneous infections occur. In more than 30% of cases the condition has a fatal course. We report the skin manifestations of three siblings with CDLG in which areas of skin necrosis occurred that resembled pyoderma gangrenosum. 
1	Detection of Ki-67 proliferation rate in breast cancer. Correlation with clinical and pathologic features. In situ determination of proliferative activity was performed on 203 breast cancers by use of Ki-67 monoclonal antibody and immunohistochemical methods. Tumor proliferation rate was analyzed and correlated to tumor size and nodal status. The relationship between Ki-67 proliferative activity and nuclear estrogen receptor content was also investigated on adjacent tissue sections. Ki-67 values ranged from 1 to 75%, with a median value of 10%. Premenopausal patients had greater Ki-67 values (median value, 14.1%) than postmenopausal ones (median value, 9.8%). The authors observed no correlation with lymph nodal involvement, whereas a statistically significant relationship with tumor size was found (P less than 0.01). An inverse correlation (Spearman's coefficient = -0.56; P less than 0.001) was seen between Ki-67 values and nuclear estrogen receptor content. These results, similar to those reported for other kinetic measurements, suggest that in situ detection of Ki-67 proliferation rate is a useful method for obtaining cell cycle information. Follow-up studies will be needed to assess an eventual prognostic relevance. 
5	Anorectal function in incontinent patients with cerebrospinal disease. Anorectal manometry and the electrical activity of the external anal sphincter were measured in 20 patients with well-defined, incomplete spinal lesions who were referred because of fecal incontinence and in 30 normal subjects. Six patients had a high spinal lesion, 11 had a low spinal lesion, and 3 had mixed high and low spinal lesions. Patients with high spinal lesions had normal basal pressures but abnormally low squeeze pressures and impaired rectal sensation. Unlike normal subjects, there was no relationship between the depth of sphincter relaxation and the distention volumes. The external sphincter responses to rectal distention and increases in intraabdominal pressure were enhanced, and leakage of perfusion fluid was uncommon. Patients with low spinal lesions had abnormally low basal and squeeze pressures, blunted rectal sensation, and showed impaired external anal sphincter responses to rectal distention or increases in intraabdominal pressures. Most of these patients leaked the infused fluid during these maneuvers. Sphincter function in patients with mixed lesions was more severely impaired than in patients with low and high spinal lesions. Patients with mixed lesions showed abnormally low basal and squeeze pressures, impaired rectal sensation, and no external anal sphincter responses to either rectal distention or increases in intraabdominal pressure. Leakage occurred during these maneuvers in all patients with mixed lesions. 
4	Active drainage of cardiac lymph in relation to reduction in size of myocardial infarction: an experimental study. Active drainage of cardiac lymph using hyaluronidase was attempted in dogs. The results were satisfactory and the ischemic myocardium was salvaged. The infarct risk area (I/R) ratio decreased after drainage. Regional myocardial ischemia and infarction were provided by means of ligature of the left coronary artery for 120 and 240 minutes respectively. Cardiac lymph was collected by conventional procedures. Enzymes released from the myocardium increased significantly in the cardiac lymph. The volume of cardiac lymph gradually increased after ligature of the coronary artery. Administration of hyaluronidase further increased the cardiac lymph flow and significantly decreased the I/R ratio as determined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and methylene blue staining. Drainage of the cardiac lymph salvaged the ischemic myocardium. Reduction of interstitial edema and augmentation of cardiac lymph flow with the hyaluronidase prevented the development of the infarction. This is the first documentation of the effect of active drainage of cardiac lymph on the development of infarction through observation of the I/R ratio. 
1	Hepatic cyst associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. A solitary hepatic cyst, associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, is described. To our knowledge, this association has not been previously reported. A developmental anomaly or hamartomatous nature of this lesion is suggested. Knowledge of this association may be helpful in the clinical diagnosis of this benign entity. 
5	Molecular localization of the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation of Ewing sarcoma by chromosomal in situ suppression hybridization. Chromosome translocations are associated with a variety of human leukemias, lymphomas, and solid tumors. To localize molecular markers flanking the t(11;22) (q24;q12) breakpoint that occurs in virtually all cases of Ewing sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma, high-resolution chromosomal in situ suppression hybridization was carried out using a panel of cosmid clones localized and ordered on chromosome 11q. The location of the Ewing sarcoma translocation breakpoint was determined relative to the nearest two cosmid markers on 11q, clones 23.2 and 5.8, through the analysis of metaphase chromosome hybridization. By in situ hybridization to interphase nuclei, the approximate physical separation of these two markers was determined. In both Ewing sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma, cosmid clone 5.8 is translocated from chromosome 11q24 to the derivative chromosome 22 and a portion of chromosome 22q12 carrying the leukemia inhibitory factor gene is translocated to the derivative chromosome 11. The physical distance between the flanking cosmid markers on chromosome 11 was determined to be in the range of 1000 kilobases, and genomic analysis using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed no abnormalities over a region of 650 kilobases in the vicinity of the leukemia inhibitory factor gene on chromosome 22. This approach localizes the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint to a small region on chromosome 11q24 and provides a rapid and precise technique for the molecular characterization of chromosomal aberrations. 
5	Limitation of myocardial infarct size by a right ventricular assist device. To evaluate the effects of an RVAD on myocardial ischemic injury during right coronary artery (RCA) ligation, a pneumatically driven pusher plate pump was inserted between the right atrium and pulmonary artery, and the RCA was ligated at its origin for two hr. There were 18 sheep, of which nine each served as the control and RVAD groups. Hemodynamic parameters and blood samples were collected from the coronary sinus. Area at risk and area of infarct were detected by gentian violet injection and triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) staining. Hemodynamic parameters (left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), cardiac output (CO], and creatine kinase levels in coronary sinus blood tended to be beneficial, to some degree, in the RVAD group. Electron microscopic examination revealed chromatin clumping and mitochondrial destruction, however this ultrastructural damage was more severe in the control group. The ratio of area of infarct to area at risk in the RVAD group was significantly less than that in the control group, being 20.25 +/- 6.93% vs. 47.24 +/- 10.53% (p less than 0.05). The infarct size induced by RCA occlusion was significantly reduced by the RVAD, due to the right ventricular unloading via reduced myocardial oxygen demand. 
4	Preliminary experience with 5 and 6 French diagnostic catheters as guiding catheters for coronary angioplasty. With the reduction in profile of balloon dilation catheters, until recently, it has been the internal dimensions and performance of the guiding catheter that has mandated the use of 7, 8 or 9 French (F) systems for the performance of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). A new 5F catheter design (Sherwood Medical Co., St. Louis, MO) provided a large inner lumen (0.4") permitting use of 0.20-0.22" fixed-wire PTCA balloon catheters with good coronary visualization. Potential advantages include reduced coronary artery ostial trauma and catheter induced damping and enhanced patient comfort. We report our initial experience in 14 patients undergoing PTCA with a 5 and 6F guide/fixed-wire system. Mean age was 63 +/- 10 (43-78 years). PTCA indications: Cardiogenic shock (1), post-myocardial infarction angina pectoris (2), grade III angina (5) and unstable angina pectoris (6). Vessel attempted: Left anterior descending (3), circumflex (4), obtuse marginal (2), diagonal (1), right coronary artery (3), and internal thoracic artery (1). Twelve patients had femoral approach; two brachial approach. The USCI Probe (USCI Division, Billerica, MA) was used in 8 lesions and SCIMED ACE (SCIMED Life Systems, Maplegrove, MN) catheter in 7 lesions. Successful 5 or 6F guide/fixed-wire dilations reduced the stenosis (77 +/- 14 to 37 +/- 30%) and were successfully performed in 79% (11/14). One 5F patient required 8F guiding catheter and was dilated with 2.0 fixed-wire balloon. A second failed 5F PTCA could not be dilated with any larger conventional system. A third total occlusion could not be crossed with a guidewire or fixed wire balloon. No patient had a complication. 
4	Role of enhanced glomerular synthesis of thromboxane A2 in progressive kidney disease. Normotensive rats of the Milan strain (MNS) spontaneously develop focal glomerulosclerosis. In order to explore the contribution of glomerular thromboxane (TX) A2 synthesis to the development of the disease, we have characterized the time course of renal functional and biochemical changes, and their modification by long-term treatment with a TX-synthase inhibitor. Oral administration (150 mg.kg-1 from 1 to 14 months of age) of FCE 22178 suppressed enhanced glomerular TXB2 production at all experimental times (mean inhibition 80%) and proteinuria (varying between 27.1 and 73.0%) while preserving renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. These effects of TX-synthase inhibition were seen in the absence of any statistically significant changes in systemic blood pressure. Moreover, FCE 22178 had no antihypertensive effects in hypertensive rats of the Milan strain (MHS) nor in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Treatment also prevented the age-related hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidemia observed in control MNS and significantly (P less than 0.01) reduced glomerular histologic damage, as demonstrated by light microscopy studies and measurement of sclerotic area. We conclude that: 1) MNS rats provide an animal model of long-lasting proteinuria characterized by an age-related increase in glomerular TXB2 production paralleled by progressive loss of renal structural integrity and function and by a secondary dyslipidemia; 2) pharmacological inhibition of glomerular TX-synthase attenuates the structural as well as the functional expression of kidney disease, without a primary effect on systemic blood pressure. These data are suggestive of an important modulating role of TXA2 in the progression of MNS renal disease. 
5	Clinical evaluation of an algorithm for the interpretation of hyperamylasemia. Total amylase concentration in serum continues to be widely determined in the diagnosis of acute pancreatic disease. Accumulated experience has made clear, however, that this determination has distinct limitations. Consequently, the knowledge of the origin of hyperamylasemia may have an important influence on treatment, hospitalization, and extent of clinical investigations. We undertook a logical and systematic approach to the interpretation of hyperamylasemia through the use of an algorithm that can be applied in clinical situations without the need for the integration of radiologic procedures or clinical data. The proposed algorithm was tested for effectiveness in 97 consecutive hospitalized patients with hyperamylasemia (amylase level greater than twice the upper reference limit) for a 2-year period. The majority (52.5%) of these patients had acute pancreatitis. The algorithm assigned the correct diagnostic categories in 95.8% of cases, with a disagreement between patient diagnosis and algorithm-generated diagnosis in only four cases. These four patients (two with acute biliary disease, one with bacterial peritonitis, and one with chronic renal failure) had pancreatic lipase values greater than five times the upper reference limit, so that the algorithm classified their condition as acute pancreatitis. The clinical trial indicated that the proposed decision tree, which requires only knowledge of biochemical data that are readily available, is useful in the evaluation of elevated amylase activity and facilitates arrival at a definitive diagnosis. 
1	Effectiveness of periodic checkup by ultrasonography for the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Periodic checkup by ultrasonography was conducted on patients with chronic liver diseases for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma. In 19 months, a total of 2004 examinations were performed on a total of 660 cases (179 cases with liver cirrhosis in the compensatory stage, younger than 70 years; 481 cases with chronic hepatitis, aged 40 to 70 years for men and 50 to 70 years for women). Of the 660 cases, 22 HCC cases (3.3%) were detected and finally diagnosed by angiography and/or histologic examination. Four of those cases (18%) had a single nodule smaller than 1 cm in diameter, and 11 cases (50%) had a single nodule smaller than 2 cm. Surgical resection was performed on 12 cases (55%). In comparison with the control group (83 HCC cases not receiving any periodic checkup), the frequency of small liver cancer and the surgical resection rate in the study group were significantly higher. This examination system by periodic ultrasonography checkup of patients with chronic hepatic diseases was effective for early detection and permitted aggressive therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
5	Effective doses of epidural morphine for relief of postcholecystectomy pain. Having previously established the effective dose of intrathecal morphine for relief of postcholecystectomy pain, we determined in this study the effective dose of epidural morphine for relief of postcholecystectomy pain in 154 patients given epidural injections of a placebo (group 1, n = 49), 2 mg morphine (group 2, n = 54), or 4 mg morphine (group 3, n = 51) intraoperatively mixed in 1.5% lidocaine. The percentage of patients who did not request an analgesic, 30 mg IM pentazocine, for relief of pain during the first 24 postoperative hours was significantly greater in groups 2 and 3 than in group 1. In patients who did need 30 mg IM pentazocine postoperatively, the number of times pentazocine was administered was also significantly greater in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. The percentage of patients developing respiratory depression or vomiting in the first 48 postoperative hours was similar in the three groups. Based on the present data and those we previously reported for intrathecal morphine, we conclude that an epidural morphine dose of 2-4 mg and an intrathecal morphine dose of 0.06-0.12 mg are equipotent for relief of postcholecystectomy pain. 
1	Mechanism of surgical stress impairment of human perioperative natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Natural killer (NK) cells are an important defense against intravascular tumor dissemination. Tumor embolization can occur at surgery, so we tested whether surgical stress decreased perioperative NK cell cytotoxicity, and examined the underlying mechanism of suppression. Patients with solid tumors underwent NK cell cytotoxicity assay just before and 24 hours after surgery in a 3-hour chromium 51 release assay. The NK cell cytotoxicity was significantly decreased postoperatively. We considered that surgical NK cell impairment might be due to (1) NK cell redistribution, (2) presence of suppressor cells, or (3) direct "toxic" effects on NK cells. Impaired NK cell cytotoxicity was not due to NK cell redistribution, because differential counts showed no significant changes in the percentage of large granular lymphocyte NK morphology. To isolate possible suppressor cells, postoperative cells from patients were selectively depleted of NK cells using anti-Leu-11b monoclonal antibody plus complement; these cells were then mixed with autologous preoperative cells. Postoperative NK cell cytotoxicity was markedly impaired, but the postoperative NK depleted cells did not suppress preoperative NK cells. We conclude that NK cell functional impairment from surgical stress is due to direct "toxic" effects on NK cells rather than either NK cell redistribution or the generation of NK-directed suppressor cells. 
3	Quantifying language development from birth to 3 years using the Early Language Milestone Scale. A point-scoring technique for the Early Language Milestone Scale is described. Normative data based on the original 1982 cross-sectional sample and validation data based on a separate longitudinal sample are presented. Mean Early Language Milestone Scale point scores, standard deviations, and percentile equivalents for raw point scores are presented for all ages from birth to 36 months. Correlations between point scores on the Early Language Milestone Scale and scores on other standardized developmental tests such as the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities are presented. The clinical and research advantages of this point-scoring technique are presented and compared with the original pass/fail scoring method. 
1	Improved access to lesions of the central skull base by mobilization of the zygoma: experience with 54 cases. Improved access to lesions at the medial end of the sphenoid wing or in the interpeduncular cistern after mobilization of the zygoma has been a subject of growing interest in recent years. This study describes the operative technique we have adopted and records our experience with 55 operations in 54 patients who underwent the procedure in the past 3 years. Seven patients had vascular lesions, 44 had tumors, and 3 had miscellaneous lesions. The majority of the tumors were medial meningiomas, and particular note is made of those arising from the cavernous sinus with respect to their resectability. Sixteen of these tumors were encountered, and total excision was possible in 11 cases. Access to the infratemporal fossa is facilitated, and in 2 cases we were able to excise completely trigeminal neuromas that had extended there. The extra maneuver adds little to the overall operating time, and complications relating to it are uncommon, mild in degree, and usually self-limiting. We conclude that the operation is extremely valuable in appropriate circumstances. 
5	Short course chemotherapy for childhood tuberculosis A prospective study, with an attempted 24-month-post-treatment follow-up, of children with tuberculosis (TB) treated with short course chemotherapy (SCC) for 6 months was carried out because published experience of SCC in childhood TB was limited. All children in Port Moresby diagnosed as having TB between November, 1984, and November, 1986, entered the trial. Of the 639 children 165 (26%) were younger than 2 years old. Of these, 227 (35%) had extrapulmonary TB (peripheral lymph node, 110; central nervous system, 43; abdominal, 27; miliary, 16; bone and joint, 11; pleural, 11; polyserositis, 9). Clinical response to SCC was rapid. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 15 (2%), mainly to streptomycin. Twelve (2%) died, 38 (6%) transferred out and 145 (28% of the 518 who did not die, transfer or live too far from a treatment centre) defaulted. Three hundred seventy-three (58%) completed a 2-month course of daily rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and streptomycin followed by a 4-month course of twice weekly rifampin and isoniazid. A further 71 (11%) had their treatment modified because of their distance from a treatment center. Only 70 (19%) of the 373 children available for post-treatment follow-up attended the every-3-month follow-up visits for 24 months, although 223 (60%) attended one or more of the follow-up visits. Seven of the 373 children relapsed, mostly within 3 months. Five of these children had been irregular with their treatment. SCC for childhood TB is safe and effective for pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease. 
4	Overview: renal physiology and pathophysiology of aging. Cross-sectional studies in humans have suggested that there is a progressive decline of renal function with age after 40 years. The decline in various functions (eg, tubular maximums, concentrating and diluting abilities, and acidification) tend to parallel the decreases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood (plasma) flow (RPF). Recent observations from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging suggest that not all individuals follow this pattern, and that, indeed, many show no decline and some even an increase in their renal function over time. Whether the observed decreases in renal function with aging are the results of intervening pathologic processes, eg, immunologic, infectious, and toxic injury and ischemia, or can be related to hyperperfusion and hyperfiltration with resultant glomerulosclerosis, or to some other relentless involutional process, remains unclear. The purpose of this report is to review the descriptive studies documenting the changes in renal morphology and physiology with age and to discuss what is known about mechanisms involved in these losses of renal substance and function. 
3	Efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation in patients with complex partial seizures. A clinical trial of chronic intermittent vagal stimulation in five patients suggests that the procedure may be safe and effective as adjunctive treatment of medically intractable seizures of partial onset. Patients tolerated well the implantation of the neurocybernetic prosthesis and the vagal stimulation without serious physiological or lifestyle changes. Stimulation of the vagus nerve either reduced the seizure frequency or decreased the duration or intensity of seizures. Adverse side effects were limited to a tingling sensation in the throat and hoarseness during stimulation. A major complication was mechanical interruption of the wire-electrode circuitry, with consequent cessation of stimulation. The small number of patients and the relatively short follow-up period make this a pilot study, but the results are promising. 
4	Hemodynamic benefit of maintaining atrioventricular synchrony during cardiac pacing in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the hemodynamic effects of maintaining atrioventricular synchrony during emergency cardiac pacing in critically ill patients. DESIGN: Prospective, within patient double-blind study. SETTING: ICU or coronary care unit patients in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty (23 cardiac surgery, ten acute myocardial infarction, and seven general intensive care) seriously ill patients with severe symptomatic bradycardia. INTERVENTION: Initial randomization of patients to receive either a pacing mode where atrioventricular synchronization was maintained (atrioventricular pacing: atrial demand, atrioventricular sequential, atrioventricular universal) or a mode of pacing where atrioventricular synchrony was not preserved (ventricular demand pacing). MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: The cardiac output increased from a mean of 4.5 +/- 1.7 L/min (95% confidence intervals: 4.0 to 5.0 L/min) during ventricular demand pacing to 5.3 +/- 1.7 L/min (95% confidence intervals: 4.9 to 5.9 L/min) during atrioventricular pacing (p less than .0001) despite trivial decreases in CVP from 14 +/- 4 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 13 to 15 mm Hg) to 13 +/- 5 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 12 to 15 mm Hg) and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure from 18 +/- 5 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 16 to 20 mm Hg) to 17 +/- 5 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 15 to 18 mm Hg). At the same time, mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased from 74 +/- 15 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 64 to 79 mm Hg) to 83 +/- 15 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals: 80 to 88 mm Hg) and left ventricular stroke work index from 22 +/- 10 g.m/m2 (95% confidence intervals: 19 to 25 g.m/m2) to 30 +/- 11 g.m/m2 (95% confidence intervals: 26 to 33 g.m/m2). There was no significant change in mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance index, or systemic vascular resistance index. CONCLUSION: When cardiac pacing is required in critically ill patients, maintaining atrioventricular synchrony increases stroke volume, cardiac output, and MAP apparently with minimal effects on preload and afterload. 
3	Transcranial electrical stimulation with high frequency intermittent current (Limoge's) potentiates opiate-induced analgesia: blind studies. Transcutaneous cranial electrical stimulation (TCES) with high frequency (166 kHz) intermittent current (100 Hz: Limoge current) has been used for several years in cardiac, thoracic, abdominal, urological and micro-surgery. The main benefits are a reduced requirement for analgesic drugs, especially opiates, and a long-lasting postoperative analgesia. We have confirmed these clinical observations in rats using the tail-flick latency (TFL) test to measure pain threshold. TCES was not found to modify the pain threshold in drug-free rats, but it potentiated morphine-induced analgesia (systemic injection). To obtain a maximal effect, the stimulation must be initiated 3 h before the drug injection and be maintained throughout the duration of its pharmacological action. TCES potentitation was found to depend on the dose of the drug, the intensity of the current and the polarity of electrodes. These findings were confirmed by blind tests of the efficiency of TCES on several opiate analgesic drugs currently used in human surgery (morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil and dextromoramide). The analgesic effect of these 4 opiates (TFL as % of baseline without or with TCES) were respectively: 174%, 306%; 176%, 336%; 160%, 215%; and 267%, 392%. The results were obtained not only after systemic opiate treatment, but also after intracerebroventricular injection of morphine (10 micrograms; analgesic effect 152%, 207% with TCES) suggesting that TCES potentiation of opiate-induced analgesia is centrally mediated. 
5	Valve and great vessel stenosis: assessment with MR jet velocity mapping. For measurement of poststenotic jet velocities with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, the authors reduced the echo time (TE) of the field even-echo rephasing (FEER) velocity mapping sequence from 14.0 to 3.6 msec, so minimizing the problem of MR signal loss from turbulent fluid. In vitro use of rotating disk and stenotic flow phantoms confirmed that the 3.6-msec TE sequence enables accurate measurement of jet velocities of up to 6.0 m/sec (r = .996). Peak jet velocity measurements were made with MR imaging in 36 patients with stenosis of native heart valves (n = 9), conduits (n = 19), or Fontan connections (n = 2) or with aortic coarctation (n = 6). Peak velocity measurements made with MR imaging agreed well with measurements made with Doppler ultrasound (US), which were available in 18 cases (standard deviation = 0.2 m/sec). Velocity mapping with fast-echo MR imaging is likely to have considerable importance as a noninvasive means of locating and evaluating stenoses, particularly at sites inaccessible to US, but care must be taken to prevent errors caused by malalignment, signal loss, phase wrap, or partial-volume effects. 
2	Variceal sclerosis in schistosomotic patients: a 5-year follow-up study. To assess the therapeutic possibilities of injection sclerosis in schistosomotic portal hypertension, a 5-year prospective study was conducted in northeast Brazil, where this parasitosis is endemic. Fifty patients undergoing endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage from rupture of esophageal varices from July through December 1981 were chosen for the study. The 32 consenting patients were submitted to injection sclerotherapy paravariceally, using ethanolamine oleate; the 18 refusing to participate were assigned to the control group. The incidence of rebleeding was 28.1% in the former and 44.5% in the latter, a difference which was not statistically significant (Fisher's test, p = 0.375). Mortality from rupture of esophageal varices was 3.1% in the sclerotherapy group and 27.7% in the control group, a statistically significant difference (Fischer's test, p = 0.017). Since sclerotherapy markedly improved the long-term survival rate of the patients, this procedure is advocated for the treatment of esophageal varices in cases of portal hypertension due to schistosomiasis. 
3	Changes in the basal dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells from alcoholic patients--a quantitative Golgi study. Although a variety of pathological changes have been described in the brains of chronic alcoholic patients, there have been no studies which have addressed the question of alterations in cortical neuronal dendritic arborisation. Loss of neurons from the superior frontal gyrus and shrinkage of neurons from both the superior frontal gyrus and motor cortex has been documented in chronic alcoholic patients; these areas were chosen for this study. Using a modified rapid Golgi technique the basal dendritic arborisation of layer III pyramidal neurons was compared in 15 male alcoholic patients and 15 age-matched male controls. All parameters measuring basal dendritic arborisation were significantly less in the alcoholic cases for both the superior frontal and motor cortices. Changes in the arbor are in the terminal branches, which is consistent with other models of dendritic plasticity. Such changes may explain both permanent and reversible functional deficits in chronic alcoholic patients. 
1	Contributions of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The salient contributions of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have made it unique. No pancreatic endocrine tumor described before (insulinoma) or subsequently (glucagonoma, somatostatinoma, vipoma, pancreatic-polypeptidoma) has been the topic of such a variety of studies, or has been such an inspiration and rich source of new ideas for investigation and ultimate improvement in patient care. 
5	Neutrophil function and pyogenic infections in bone marrow transplant recipients. In a consecutive entry trial, the incidence and time course of decreased neutrophil function was assessed in 20 patients treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The aim of the study was to assess the prognostic value of low neutrophil function for late pyogenic infections. Chemotaxis, superoxide production, and phagocytic-bactericidal activity were studied before and 2, 6, 9, and 12 months after BMT. Skin window migration was quantitatively assessed 2 months after BMT. Infectious complications were recorded prospectively with preset criteria during 1 year. Six of the 20 leukemic patients had defective neutrophil function before BMT. Two months after BMT all 10 patients with greater than stage II graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and 6 of 10 patients with less than or equal to stage II GVHD had at least one decreased function. At this time, patients with subsequent pyogenic infections had lower chemotaxis (P less than .05), phagocytic-bactericidal activity (P less than .005), and superoxide production (P less than .025) than those without. Defective skin window migration and combined defects were predictive for late pyogenic infections. At 9 months all tests were normal in seven patients surviving without GVHD. In contrast, at 9 months three of three patients, and at 1 year two of three with chronic GVHD had still decreased neutrophil function. In conclusion, neutrophil function is frequently impaired during the first months after BMT. Combined neutrophil defects predispose to pyogenic infections and indicate the patient at risk. 
1	Ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer. A population-based study. BACKGROUND. The risk of colorectal cancer is increased among patients with ulcerative colitis. The magnitude of this increase in risk and the effects of the length of follow-up, the extent of disease at diagnosis, and age at diagnosis vary substantially in different studies. METHODS. To provide accurate estimates of the risk of colorectal cancer among patients with ulcerative colitis, we studied a population-based cohort of 3117 patients given a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis from 1922 through 1983 who were followed up through 1984. RESULTS. Ninety-two cases of colorectal cancer occurred in 91 patients. As compared with the expected incidence, the incidence of colorectal cancer in the cohort was increased (standardized incidence ratio [ratio of observed to expected cases] = 5.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.6 to 7.0). Less extensive disease at diagnosis was associated with a lower risk; for patients with ulcerative proctitis, the standardized incidence ratio was 1.7 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 3.2); for those with left-sided colitis, 2.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.4); and for those with pancolitis (extensive colitis, or inflammation of the entire colon), 14.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 11.4 to 18.9). Age at diagnosis and the extent of disease at diagnosis were strong and independent risk factors for colorectal cancer. For each increase in age group at diagnosis (less than 15 years, 15 to 29 years, 30 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, and greater than or equal to 60 years), the relative risk of colorectal cancer, adjusted for the extent of disease at diagnosis, decreased by about half (adjusted standardized incidence ratio = 0.51; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.56). The absolute risk of colorectal cancer 35 years after diagnosis was 30 percent for patients with pancolitis at diagnosis and 40 percent for those given this diagnosis at less than 15 years of age. CONCLUSIONS. Close surveillance and perhaps even prophylactic proctocolectomy should be recommended for patients given a diagnosis of pancolitis, especially those who are less than 15 years of age at diagnosis. 
5	Microangiopathy in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with the ingestion of L-tryptophan was recognized in late 1989. We describe our pathologic study of skin, fascial, and muscle biopsies from 21 patients evaluated by light microscopy, histochemistry, and electron microscopy. A perivascular, lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils was present in the dermis, fascia, and skeletal muscle. Lymphocytic infiltration of arteries and arterioles was seen. Ultrastructurally, capillary and arteriolar endothelial cell thickening and necrosis was present. This microangiopathy suggests that ischemia may be a contributing factor to the findings in this syndrome. 
1	Solitary, isolated metastasis from Ewing's sarcoma to the brain: case report. We report a case of a 30-year-old woman who developed an intraparenchymal cerebral metastasis from a Ewing's sarcoma of the chest wall diagnosed and treated 3 years earlier and in apparent remission at the time of the neurological presentation (seizures). The case was complicated by a spontaneous preoperative intratumoral hemorrhage that occurred the morning of the scheduled surgical resection and caused a left dense hemiparesis. The tumor and the hematoma were removed. The patient improved after surgical intervention and a postoperative course of cranial irradiation followed by systemic chemotherapy was given. Nineteen months after treatment the patient remains disease-free from the clinical and radiological standpoint. 
5	Electrophysiologic findings after Fontan repair of functional single ventricle. Cardiac arrhythmias are well recognized sequelae of the Fontan operation for complex congenital anomalies. In this study the electrophysiologic effects of the Fontan procedure were evaluated in 30 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization with electrophysiologic study 1.9 +/- 1.3 years (mean +/- SD) after modified Fontan repair for functional single ventricle. Abnormalities of sinus node or ectopic pacemaker automaticity were detected in 50% (15 patients) by determination of a prolonged corrected sinus node or pacemaker recovery time. Total sinoatrial conduction time was prolonged in 50% of the patients with normal sinus rhythm. Sinus node or ectopic atrial pacemaker function was entirely normal in only 43% of patients. The predominant atrial rhythm was normal sinus in 70% and ectopic atrial or junctional in 30%. Abnormalities of atrial effective and functional refractory periods were noted in 43% of patients and were most pronounced at faster paced cycle lengths. Atrial endocardial catheter mapping revealed intraatrial conduction delays between adjacent sites in 76% of the patients tested and in eight of nine patients with inducible intraatrial reentry. Programmed atrial stimulation induced nonsustained supraventricular arrhythmias in 10% of the 30 patients and sustained arrhythmias in 27%. Intraatrial reentry was the most common inducible arrhythmia and was present in seven of the eight patients with sustained and two of the three patients with nonsustained atrial arrhythmias. Atrioventricular conduction abnormalities were noted in 10% (three patients). No patient had inducible ventricular arrhythmias with programmed ventricular stimulation. The electrophysiologic findings after Fontan repair include abnormal sinus node function, prolonged atrial refractoriness, delayed intraatrial conduction and inducible atrial arrhythmias. 
5	Multipolar electrocoagulation versus injection therapy in the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers. A prospective, randomized trial. This study prospectively compares multipolar electrocoagulation and injection therapy in high-risk patients with bleeding ulcers. Patients were considered for entry if they had a bloody nasogastric aspirate, melena, or hematochezia and unstable vital signs, transfusion of greater than or equal to 2 U of blood in 12 hours, or a decrease in hematocrit of greater than or equal to 6% in 12 hours. Sixty patients with endoscopic evidence of an ulcer with active bleeding (n = 26) or a nonbleeding visible vessel (n = 34) were randomly assigned to receive multipolar electrocoagulation or injection with absolute ethanol. Hemostasis was achieved in 14 of 14 actively bleeding patients with multipolar electrocoagulation vs. 10 of 12 (83%) treated with injection. No significant differences were observed between electrocoagulation and injection therapy in any parameter assessed during the hospitalization: incidence of further bleeding (6% vs. 10%), units of blood transfused after treatment (1.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.4), incidence of surgery for bleeding (6% vs. 7%), length of hospital stay in days (5.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.2 +/- 2.5), cost of hospitalization (+7160 +/- +1630 vs. +8520 +/- +2960), or mortality rate (3% vs. 3%). Treatment induced bleeding in nonbleeding visible vessels in 35% of subjects in each group, but this was controlled with continued treatment in all patients. One delayed perforation occurred 9 days after multipolar electrocoagulation. Multipolar electrocoagulation and injection therapy are of comparable efficacy in the treatment of patients with clinical evidence of a major upper gastrointestinal bleed and endoscopic evidence of an ulcer with active bleeding or a nonbleeding visible vessel. 
4	Cerebrospinal fluid endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 levels in normal and neurosurgical patients: a clinical study and literature review. Endothelins are a family of structurally related, potent, long-lasting vasoconstrictor peptides. There are no established normal human levels of endothelin-1 or endothelin-3 in the cerebrospinal fluid. We measured cerebrospinal fluid endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 levels in five groups of patients: normal controls, patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm, patients with severe head injuries, patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for intractable epilepsy, and a patient with a gunshot injury to the thoracic spine. Endothelin-3 levels were significantly elevated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and may participate in cerebral vasospasm and subsequent neurologic deterioration. 
5	Occult cancer in patients with deep venous thrombosis. A systematic approach. The authors prospectively studied 113 consecutive patients with deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities to determine the most appropriate workup study for searching for a hidden cancer. After a careful physical examination, the following routine tests were performed: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), whole blood counts, biochemistry, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, chest radiograph, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan. If a malignant lesion was suspected, further appropriate studies were performed. After discharge, periodic follow-up was performed on all patients in the outpatient clinic. A malignant neoplasm was detected in 12 patients. Of these 12 patients, six were asymptomatic with the exception of experiencing thrombophlebitis. Cancer was found more commonly in patients with idiopathic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (7 of 31 versus 5 of 82 patients with secondary DVT; P = 0.012), and in those patients with abnormal lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (6 of 23 versus 6 of 90; P = 0.007). Abnormal CEA levels allowed diagnosis of two cases of colonic cancer (on colonoscopy). Both ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen showed two cases of urinary bladder carcinoma at a very early stage. Furthermore, two cases of adenomatous polyps in colon were found, a condition considered by most authors to be a colorectal cancer precursor. In addition, there were five patients with large benign pelvic tumors, and two patients with absent inferior vena cava. The most striking finding was that some cases of cancer were at a very early stage. It was concluded that blood cell counts, LDH, CEA, chest radiograph, and abdominal ultrasonography (or CT scan) should be routinely performed on all patients with deep venous thrombosis (particularly those with idiopathic DVT). Malignancy would not have been recognized in some patients if these tests had not been performed. 
4	Factors predictive of results of direct ablative operations for drug-refractory ventricular tachycardia. Analysis of 80 patients. During a 9-year period 80 patients with drug-resistant sustained ventricular tachycardia underwent direct surgical ablation of arrhythmogenic myocardium. Sixty-nine were male (86%) and 11 female (14%), with 1.9 +/- 1.1 (standard deviation) ventricular tachycardia morphologies per patient. The mean number of drugs failed was 3.7 +/- 1.6 per patient. The preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction was 36.4% +/- 14.4%. Complete preoperative endocardial mapping data (greater than 4 endocardial sites in each ventricular tachycardia) were available for 60 of the 80 patients (75%) and intraoperative endocardial data in the clinical ventricular tachycardia was obtained in 37 (46.3%) of the patients. In 17 patients mapped intraoperatively by computer-assisted techniques, complete epicardial and endocardial data in the clinical ventricular tachycardia were obtained in 14 patients (82.4%). Overall, 73 of 80 (91.3%) had some mapping data available. Hospital mortality occurred in 10 patients (12.5%) at a mean interval of 13.5 days, range 0 to 62 days. Postoperatively the clinical ventricular tachycardia has not recurred in 65 of 70 surviving patients (92.9%). Nonclinical ventricular tachycardia occurred in another four patients. All nine patients with postoperative ventricular tachycardia responded to drugs. The major factors predictive of hospital mortality were prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass (greater than 150 minutes), preoperative ejection fraction less than 31%, and incomplete preoperative mapping. Hospital mortality in patients with an ejection fraction below 31% was significantly associated with a history of amiodarone usage. At 3 years of follow-up, freedom from sudden cardiac death was 95.7%, and 86.7% of patients were free of ventricular tachycardia on no antiarrhythmic drugs. These results suggest that direct ventricular tachycardia operations are an effective form of therapy for patients with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. 
3	Natural killer cell activity in patients with liver cirrhosis relative to severity of liver damage. To evaluate the role of severe liver damage on natural killer cell activity, 29 patients with liver cirrhosis were examined. The natural killer cell activity was measured with a 4-hr chromium release assay, and the K562 cell line was employed as target cells. The natural killer cell activity was significantly decreased in cirrhotic patients compared with normal controls and patients with chronic active hepatitis. Cirrhotic patients with Pugh's C grade of severity of liver disease had lower natural killer cell activity. The depression of natural killer cell activity in cirrhotic patients was inversely correlated with prothrombin time ratios, and the natural killer cell activity in cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy was lower than in patients without hepatic encephalopathy. Thus, the diminished natural killer cell activity in cirrhotic patients might be related to the severity of liver damage. 
1	Computed tomography and bronchoscopy in chest radiographically occult main-stem neoplasm diagnosis and Nd-YAG laser treatment in 8 patients. We studied 8 adult patients with variable symptoms of cough, dyspnea, stridor, wheezing, or hemoptysis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy in all showed complete or nearly complete endobronchial obstruction of a main-stem bronchus by neoplasm with a mean bronchial diameter of 1.9 mm +/- 1.6 mm (mean +/- standard deviation). In 4 patients, a lobar bronchus was also completely obstructed. No mass was visible on chest radiographs of any patient; however, computed tomography in each showed main-stem endobronchial obstruction, lobar obstruction (4 instances in 3 patients), and in 6 patients hypoperfusion of the involved lung. Computed tomographic scan showed additional abnormalities that were unsuspected on viewing chest radiographs or at bronchoscopy, including mediastinal adenopathy in 3 patients and an extraluminal tumor component in 4. After therapy with Nd-YAG laser, main-stem airway diameter increased to a mean of 9.6 mm +/- 1.0 mm (P less than .05) and pulmonary functions improved. Results suggest the complementary role of computed tomography and fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the detection and laser-treatment planning of chest radiographically occult severe neoplastic obstruction of the main-stem bronchus. 
1	Endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosis of the extent of gallbladder carcinoma. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed preoperatively in 39 patients with gallbladder carcinoma. Diagnosis of the anatomical extent of gallbladder carcinoma was compared with histologic analysis, and staging accuracy was evaluated according to the TNM classification. Carcinoma considered to be at an early stage with no lymph node metastasis was correctly diagnosed in 87.5%. Differential diagnosis between early and advanced staged tumors was possible in 79.5%. Overall accuracy for depth of tumor invasion (T) was 76.9%. Limitations were due to many stones in the gallbladder and microinfiltration of carcinoma. Assessment of regional lymph node metastasis (N) was at a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 92.9%, for an overall accuracy of 89.7%. We believe endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in the clinical staging of gallbladder carcinoma. 
4	Value of peak exercise oxygen consumption for optimal timing of cardiac transplantation in ambulatory patients with heart failure. BACKGROUND. Optimal timing of cardiac transplantation in ambulatory patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction is often difficult. To determine whether measurement of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) during maximal exercise testing can be used to identify patients in whom transplantation can be safely deferred, we prospectively performed exercise testing on all ambulatory patients referred for transplant between October 1986 and December 1989. METHODS AND RESULTS. Patients were assigned into one of three groups on the basis of exercise data: Group 1 (n = 35) comprised patients accepted for transplant (VO2 less than or equal to 14 ml/kg/min); group 2 (n = 52) comprised patients considered too well for transplant (VO2 greater than 14 ml/kg/min); and group 3 (n = 27) comprised patients with low VO2 rejected for transplant due to noncardiac problems. All three groups were comparable in New York Heart Association functional class, ejection fraction, and cardiac index (p = NS). Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was significantly lower in group 2 than in either group 1 or 3 (p less than 0.05), although there was wide overlap. Patients with preserved exercise capacity (group 2) had cumulative 1- and 2-year survival rates of 94% and 84%, which are equal to survival levels after transplantation. In contrast, patients rejected for transplant (group 3) had survival rates of only 47% at 1 year and 32% at 2 years, whereas patients awaiting transplantation (group 1) had a survival rate of 70% at 1 year (both p less than 0.005 versus patients with VO2 greater than 14 ml/kg/min). All deaths in group 2 were sudden. By univariate and multivariate analyses, peak VO2 was the best predictor of survival, with only pulmonary capillary wedge pressure providing additional prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that cardiac transplantation can be safely deferred in ambulatory patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and peak exercise VO2 of more than 14 ml/min/kg. 
5	Comparison of a hybrid with an uncemented total hip replacement. A retrospective matched-pair study. The efficacy of a type of uncemented total hip replacement was compared with that of a hybrid total hip replacement in which an uncemented acetabular and a cemented femoral component were used. Twenty-five patients who had had a hybrid total hip replacement were matched, by age, weight, sex, and diagnosis, with twenty-five patients who had had an uncemented total hip replacement. All of the operations were done by one surgeon, who used the same operative approach and the same regimen of postoperative rehabilitation. All of the patients were followed for at least two years. The mean postoperative hip score was 96 points for the hybrid group and 84 points for the cementless group (p less than 0.02). Twenty-four (96 per cent) of the patients who had a hybrid prosthesis reported no or only slight pain postoperatively. In the uncemented group, of the six patients (24 per cent) who reported mild to severe pain, five had pain in the thigh, a limp occurred more frequently, five femoral components had migrated, and four hips needed reoperation. The results with the hybrid replacement that had a cemented femoral component were superior to those with the uncemented femoral component over the relatively brief period for which these patients were followed. 
4	Synergistic effects of psyllium in the dietary treatment of hypercholesterolemia. We investigated psyllium fiber supplementation as a means of enhancing the cholesterol-lowering effect of the phase I American Heart Association diet. Fifty-nine subjects with total serum cholesterol (TC) levels ranging from 5.56 to 10.24 mmol/L (215 to 396 mg/dL) were given a 2-month dietary lead-in followed by 3 months of diet only (29 subjects) or diet supplemented with 20.4 g of psyllium daily (30 subjects). Unlike women, men had a significant decrease in levels of both TC (-8.0%) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (-10.1%) during the dietary lead-in. Psyllium supplementation resulted in an additional 5.5% reduction in the TC levels as compared to diet alone. Psyllium supplementation combined with dietary lead-in resulted in an overall 17.3% decrease in the TC and a 20.0% decrease in LDL-C for men, with decreases of 7.7% and 11.6%, respectively, for women. Psyllium effectively enhances the cholesterol-lowering effect of the phase I diet. 
5	Erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicts early relapse and survival in early-stage Hodgkin disease. The EORTC Lymphoma Cooperative Group. OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of an elevated (greater than 30 mm/h) Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for predicting early relapse and survival after therapy in patients with clinical stage I or II Hodgkin disease. INTERVENTIONS: We studied 772 patients with early-stage Hodgkin disease who had participated in two separate multicenter clinical trials. Both trials used modern field radiotherapy and, in some patients, multi-agent chemotherapy. MAIN RESULTS: The ESR patterns were based on pretherapy and post-therapy assessments: pattern 1, always normal (n = 261); pattern 2, elevated before therapy but normal immediately after therapy (n = 121); pattern 3, elevated before therapy but normal within 3 months after therapy (n = 89); pattern 4, always elevated (n = 48); pattern 5, normal before therapy but oscillating between normal and elevated after therapy (n = 150); pattern 6, elevated before therapy but oscillating between normal and elevated after therapy (n = 130). By multivariate analysis, independent of whether or not patients received chemotherapy in the initial therapy protocol, ESR patterns 4, 5, and 6 were shown to be the best predictors for early relapse and survival when patients were stratified according to the type of chemotherapy received and the number of involved nodal areas. Patients with ESR pattern 4 had a relative risk for death seven times that of patients with patterns 1, 2, or 3. Early relapse was the second most important factor predicting death, irrespective of ESR; patients with early relapse and ESR patterns 1, 2, or 3 had a relative risk for death of 4.5, and those with early relapse and ESR patterns 4, 5, or 6 had a relative risk for death of 15. Whether or not chemotherapy was given initially did not change the relative risk, which shows that ESR, not initial therapy, was the predictor for early relapse and death due to Hodgkin disease. CONCLUSION: An unexplained elevated ESR after therapy, especially after modern radiotherapy, independent of other factors, strongly suggest the presence of aggressive and resistant Hodgkin disease. An elevated ESR is predictive of early relapse and poor prognosis; its presence justifies early aggressive therapy. 
5	Effects of specific mu and kappa opiate tolerance and abstinence on hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis secretion in the rat. Chronic administration of opiates to rats results in HPA axis tolerance and abstinence-induced hypersecretion. The effects of specific mu and kappa tolerance and withdrawal on the functional secretion of the HPA axis were evaluated in this study. Adult male rats were injected s.c. twice daily with saline, morphine or U50,488 for 5 days. Serum adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) or corticosterone (CS) were determined by radioimmunoassay as measures of HPA axis function. Tolerance to morphine (10 mg/kg) and U50,488 (1 mg/kg), but no cross-tolerance, was observed suggesting the development of mu- or kappa-specific tolerance, respectively. Tolerance does not occur at the pituitary or adrenal levels after these paradigms because ACTH and CS responses to exogenous corticotropin-releasing factor and ACTH, respectively, were not attenuated. CS secretion in response to novelty stress was not affected by either chronic opiate treatment, but the circadian variation of CS levels was slightly blunted after chronic morphine. In contrast, the elevation of CS secretion by quipazine (0.5 mg/kg) and physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg) was attenuated after chronic U50,488, but not morphine administration. Both spontaneous and antagonist-precipitated withdrawal from morphine, but not U50,488, resulted in elevation of CS levels. Low doses of morphine suppressed morphine abstinence-induced CS hypersecretion, whereas, U50,488 and clonidine had no effect. In conclusion, alterations of HPA axis function occur during chronic mu or kappa opiate administration that are receptor-specific and involve multiple neural controls of the HPA axis. 
5	Does percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty accelerate atherosclerotic lesions? Recent reports have suggested that angioplasty may cause or accelerate coronary arterial stenoses secondary to traumatic injury. Ninety-four coronary angiograms performed in a 1 yr period were reviewed in patients who had successful coronary angioplasty 6 to 30 mo (mean 10.7) prior to restudy. Restenosis was found in 43 of 140 dilated lesions (31%) and in 41 of 94 patients (44%). Thirty-three (35%) patients had new or progressive lesions outside the angioplasty site. New or progressive lesions occurred with similar frequency in the arteries that did not have angioplasty (23/155 = 15%) as in the arteries that did (13/127 = 10%; chi-square n.s.). In the arteries which underwent angioplasty, new or progressive lesions occurred as commonly proximal to the PTCA site (7/14, 50%) as distal (6/13, 46%). New or progressive lesions occurred in 29% of patients with concomitant restenosis, and 40% of those without restenosis (chi-square n.s.). No clinical, angiographic, or procedural factors distinguished patients with new and progressive lesions in target vessels from those without these lesions in target vessels. Patients with progressive lesions anywhere in the coronary tree were more likely to have had a shorter duration of anginal symptoms before angioplasty and a family history of coronary disease when compared with patients without progressive atherosclerosis. In conclusion, new and progressive lesions outside the angioplasty site occur after the procedure but appear unrelated to the restenosis process or traumatic injury by angioplasty instrumentation. 
1	Procarbazine chemotherapy in the treatment of recurrent malignant astrocytomas after radiation and nitrosourea failure. The Brain Tumor Study Group has shown procarbazine (PCB) to be as effective an adjuvant treatment as 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU). We treated 35 patients with recurrent malignant astrocytomas after radiation and nitrosourea failure with successive courses of PCB 150 mg/m2/d for 28 days every 8 weeks. After 2 courses, 2 patients had complete responses, 7 had partial responses, 11 had stable disease, and 15 had progression. Significantly more patients receiving PCB had complete or partial responses or stable disease than a similar group of patients in a previous trial who received intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin (DDP). There is a significant advantage in time to disease progression for those receiving PCB compared with those receiving IA diaziquone (AZQ). Our results suggest that PCB is a more effective 2nd agent than IA DDP or AZQ following radiation and nitrosourea failure. 
5	Cytogenetic analysis of 750 spontaneous abortions with the direct-preparation method of chorionic villi and its implications for studying genetic causes of pregnancy wastage. Altogether, 750 cases of spontaneous abortion between the fifth and 25th week of gestation were analyzed cytogenetically by the direct-preparation method using chorionic villi. The majority of cases (68%) were derived from early abortions before the 12th week of gestation. The frequency of abnormal karyotypes was 50.1%; trisomy was predominant (62.1%), followed by triploidy (12.4%), monosomy X (10.5%), tetraploidy (9.2%), and structural chromosome anomalies (4.7%). Among trisomies, chromosomes 16 (21.8%), 22 (17.9%), and 21 (10.0%) were prevalent. The frequency of chromosomally abnormal abortions increased with maternal age but only because of an increase of trisomy. Polyploidy and monosomy X, however, decreased. Mean maternal age was significantly increased for trisomies 16, 21, and 22 and was highest for trisomies 18 and 20. The results obtained are within the range of variability reported earlier from tissue culture-type studies. A consistent feature during our study is the excess of females in chromosomally normal abortions (male:female sex ratio 0.71). According to the methodology applied, maternal cell contamination and undetected 46,XX molar samples cannot have influenced the sex ratio. However, a bias introduced by social status or maternal age cannot be excluded. With the more rapid and convenient direct preparation of chorionic villi, reliable cytogenetic data on causes of spontaneous abortions can be obtained. 
1	Abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 6 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To determine the biologic significance of the structural rearrangements of the long arm of chromosome 6(6q) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis, we studied 412 consecutive children whose leukemic cell chromosomes had been completely banded and identified 45 (11%) children with this abnormality. The 45 cases were divided into del(6q) only (n = 11), del(6q) and numerical abnormalities (n = 4), del(6q) and structural abnormalities (n = 23), and 6q translocations (n = 7). The breakpoints of del(6q) were subgrouped: del(6)(q15q21) in 11 cases, del(6) (q13q21) in six, del(6)(q21q23) in four, del(6)(q15) in four, del(6)(q15q23) in three, and other deletions in 10 cases. Notably, all these deletions encompassed the 6q21 band, suggesting that this might be the locus of a recessive tumor suppressor gene, the absence of which contributes to malignant transformation or proliferation. Among the seven children with 6q translocations, a previously unidentified nonrandom translocation, t(6;12)(q21;p13) was noted in two cases with an early pre-B immunophenotype. Clinical features and event-free survival were similar among children with or without 6q abnormalities. Overall, children with 6q abnormalities were less likely than those without the abnormality to have a pre-B immunophenotype (P = .03). T-cell immunophenotypes were equally represented in cases with or without 6q abnormalities. However, all four children with del(6q) and a 12p abnormality had early pre-B ALL and all three children with del(6q) and a 9p abnormality had a T-cell immunophenotype. The lack of specificity for a particular immunophenotype may imply that the gene or genes affected by 6q abnormalities are broadly active in the multistep process of lymphoid leukemogenesis. The relatively high frequency of microscopically visible del(6q) indicates the need for molecular studies to identify cases with submicroscopic deletions. 
5	Anoxic injury of mammalian central white matter: decreased susceptibility in myelin-deficient optic nerve. The rat optic nerve, a typical central nervous system white matter tract, rapidly loses excitability when it is exposed to anoxia and is irreversibly damaged by prolonged anoxia. Neonatal optic nerve is extremely resistant to anoxia-induced dysfunction and injury; the adult pattern of response to anoxia appears between 10 and 20 days postnatal, that is, during the period of oligodendroglial proliferation and myelination. To test the hypothesis that myelination, or associated events, confer anoxic susceptibility on developing white matter, we analyzed the effects of anoxia on the myelin-deficient (md) strain of rat. Acutely isolated optic nerves from 19- to 21-day-old md rats and control optic nerves from unaffected male littermates were maintained in vitro at 37 degrees C, and exposed to a standard 60-minute period of anoxia. The supramaximal compound action potential was recorded and amplitude of the compound action potential, expressed as % of amplitude before anoxic exposure, was determined. The compound action potential was nearly abolished within 3 to 6 minutes after onset of anoxia in control optic nerves, while optic nerves from md rats displayed a slower decrease in compound action potential amplitude during anoxia, with a distinct action potential present even after 60 minutes of anoxia. Optic nerves from md rats showed significantly greater recovery of compound action potential (71 +/- 25%) than did control optic nerves (33 +/- 21%; p less than 0.02) after 60 minutes of anoxia. These findings support the hypothesis that myelination, or changes associated with it, may be important in the development of anoxic susceptibility in central white matter. 
5	A mouse model of the aniridia-Wilms tumor deletion syndrome. Deletion of chromosome 11p13 in humans produces the WAGR syndrome, consisting of aniridia (an absence or malformation of the iris), Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma), genitourinary malformations, and mental retardation. An interspecies backcross between Mus musculus/domesticus and Mus spretus was made in order to map the homologous chromosomal region in the mouse genome and to define an animal model of this syndrome. Nine evolutionarily conserved DNA clones from proximal human 11p were localized on mouse chromosome 2 near Small-eyes (Sey), a semidominant mutation that is phenotypically similar to aniridia. Analysis of Dickie's Small-eye (SeyDey), a poorly viable allele that has pleiotropic effects, revealed the deletion of three clones, f3, f8, and k13, which encompass the aniridia (AN2) and Wilms tumor susceptibility genes in man. Unlike their human counterparts, SeyDey/+ mice do not develop nephroblastomas. These findings suggest that the Small-eye defect is genetically equivalent to human aniridia, but that loss of the murine homolog of the Wilms tumor gene is not sufficient for tumor initiation. A comparison among Sey alleles suggests that the AN2 gene product is required for induction of the lens and nasal placodes. 
1	Hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma: impact of surgical resection on the natural history. From 1960 to 1987, 1209 patients with colorectal liver metastases were recorded, and followed until 1 January 1990. In 242 cases the diagnosis was based on external imaging, whereas 967 patients had operative confirmation and staging of their liver disease. Three groups of patients were analysed: group 1 involved 921 cases, of whom 902 were deemed non-resectable whereas 19 could not be unequivocally classified. Only 21 patients lived for longer than 3 years, seven survived for 4 years, but there were no 5-year survivors. Group 2 comprised 62 highly selected patients who at laparotomy demonstrated resectable metastatic spread confined to the liver, but this was not treated mainly because of a formerly different therapeutic approach. These patients had a significantly longer median survival time (14.2 versus 6.9 months), but also failed to achieve 5-year survival. The 226 patients forming group 3 underwent hepatic resection with intent to cure. Nine of them had minimal macroscopic disease left, and 34 with all gross tumour removed had positive margins. Survival of patients with these 43 eventually non-radical resections followed an identical course as in group 2 (median survival 13.3 months, maximum 42 months). Of the 183 patients with potentially curative resection ten died after surgery (5.5 per cent). Actuarial 5 and 10-year survival rates in the remaining 173 patients were 40 and 27 per cent with 25 and seven patients alive at respective periods of time. Until 1 January 1990, 64 patients remained free from recurrent disease for up to 24 years. In three patients the tumour status at death was unclear. The other 106 patients developed definite cancer relapse. Nevertheless they demonstrated a prolongation of survival time by a median of 1 year when compared with the 43 non-radically resected patients or the 62 untreated patients with resectable liver-only metastases, and accomplished a maximum survival time of 8 years. Radical excision of colorectal secondaries to the liver therefore offers effective palliation, and in a small number the chance of a cure. 
1	Surgical treatment of thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas. Thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas have been diagnosed more frequently as radiographic techniques and biochemical assays have improved; however, they remain uncommon and are unfamiliar to most neurosurgeons. This report concerns eight patients with hyperthyroidism, inappropriately elevated levels of serum thyrotropin and alpha-subunit, and radiographic evidence of pituitary tumor. All underwent surgery and had pathological confirmation of a thyrotropin-secreting adenoma, and most had been subjected to prior ablation of the thyroid gland. Only one tumor was a microadenoma; the others ranged in size from 1.4 to 12 cm, and invasion of parasellar structures was common. Thyrotropin, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and alpha-subunit were measured preoperatively and at intervals postoperatively. Coexistent hormonal abnormalities (which occurred in all patients) included acromegaly and hyperprolactinemia and were also monitored. All four patients who had tumors less than 2 cm in diameter remain alive. Complete extirpation of tumor in these patients produced rapid correction of all hormonal abnormalities and resolution of clinical hyperthyroidism. The other four patients had larger invasive tumors: two died soon after surgery, one died of disseminated tumor 8 years after presentation, and one remains alive with residual tumor. Tumors secreting thyroid-stimulating hormone are less easily cured by surgery than are other types of pituitary adenoma because of the large size and invasive features that many attain during the delay to diagnosis; medical therapy can subdue the tumor but not cure it. The experience with these patients establishes the importance of early diagnosis and surgical excision for successful treatment, and demonstrates the utility of modern diagnostic techniques for finding these lesions. As occurs in Nelson's syndrome after adrenalectomy for Cushing's disease, ablation of the target organ may allow the tumor to convert to a more clinically malignant form which is resistant to cure. 
2	The potential and limitations of laser photoablation of colorectal adenomas. Ablation of colorectal adenomas by Nd:YAG laser energy was investigated in 271 patients. Two hundred and forty-one patients, selected because of poor surgical and medical condition or refusal of surgery, presented with incompletely removed polyps or with lesions unsuitable for endoscopic polypectomy. Thirty patients with polyposis coli were treated for rectal stump polyps after subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. Because of insufficient follow-up (28) or malignant degeneration (23), full evaluation was possible in 196 colon adenoma and 24 polyposis patients. Complete ablation with histologic confirmation for at least 12 weeks was achieved in 150 (82%) of the 183 colon adenomas. This declined to 141 (77%) because of later recurrences in prolonged follow-up. Treatment of large adenomas was less successful than that of intermediate and small lesions: ultimate ablation in 56, 85, and 93%, respectively. Impressive was the immediate relief in 100 symptomatic elderly patients, who were bothered by frequent diarrhea, excessive mucous discharge, and incontinence. All patients survived despite major complications (7%) that mainly consisted of stenosis and hemorrhage. Rectal stump polyps were eliminated in 20 patients with polyposis coli. The remaining four had an uneventful ileoanal anastomosis for ultimately uncontrollable growth of polyps. Malignancy was discovered in 22 adenoma patients and in 1 polyposis patient. We recommend laser ablation of colorectal adenomas for small and medium-sized polyps, that cannot be removed by endoscopic polypectomy in inoperable patients or in patients refusing operation. Laser treatment for extensive adenomas seems only appropriate for symptomatic relief. 
5	Clinical spectrum of leber's congenital amaurosis in the second to fourth decades of life. Leber's congenital amaurosis is a type of congenital retinitis pigmentosa in which the fundus abnormalities are extremely variable and to some extent age dependent. Most cases are seen in infancy. The retinal, electroretinogram, and fluorescein angiographic findings are described in ten patients with Leber's congenital amaurosis who ranged in age from 13 to 36 years when first seen. All of the patients were from Honduras and were unrelated except for one pair (a brother and sister). The polymorphic appearance of the fundus is emphasized and is particularly striking in the siblings. A macular lesion (a bull's-eye maculopathy) not previously associated with Leber's congenital amaurosis is reported as a variant fundus appearance in this entity. 
2	Analysis of 24-hour esophageal pressure and pH data in unselected patients with noncardiac chest pain. Fourty-four unselected patients with noncardiac chest pain were studied using conventional manometry with additional edrophonium provocation and 24-hour ambulatory esophageal pH and pressure recording with a system developed by our group. New, fully automated techniques of statistical analysis of the complete set of esophageal pressure and pH signals were used to examine the temporal relation between pain, esophageal motility disturbances, and gastroesophageal reflux. The analysis used the 97.5th percentile of amplitude and duration of all esophageal contractions in each patient as well as a chi 2 test of the distribution of contraction types to determine whether a pain episode was related to abnormal motility or not. The edrophonium test results were positive in 2 patients. Only 25 patients (56.8%) had at least one pain episode (total, 111 episodes) during 24-hour recording. Thirty-three percent of the pain episodes were related to reflux and 23.4% to abnormal motility, and 43.2% were not related to an esophageal function disturbance. In the patient-oriented analysis in this study, it was required for a positive correlation that the symptom index (percentage of related pain episodes) was higher than 75%. It was found that the pain was related to reflux in 2 patients (4.6%), to reflux and motor abnormalities in 4 (9.2%), and to motor abnormalities in 2 patients (4.6%). In 36 patients (81.8%), no relation with an esophageal abnormality could be established, either because the patients had no pain during the 24-hour study, or because the pain seemed unrelated to reflux or abnormal motility. 
3	Optimal wound closure after tethered cord correction. Technical note. A technique of wound closure following tethered cord correction is presented that significantly reduces the incidence of cerebrospinal fluid collections in the subcutaneous space. In over 60 cases, the described method of fascia and skin closure has lessened wound problems to a minimal level. Patient hospitalization time has also been greatly diminished. 
3	Lipids, vascular disease, and dementia with advancing age. Epidemiologic considerations. Elevated plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in middle-aged men and women. It is still not clear, however, whether lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities continue to be risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the elderly population. It is not even clear what normal lipid values are in the elderly, and whether diet or drug therapy should be advised on the basis of lipid values established in middle-aged populations. Ischemic heart disease does remain the leading cause of death in the elderly, and there is now preliminary evidence from epidemiologic studies that relative elevations of levels of lipid and lipoprotein fractions in an elderly population might be associated with an independent and increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and possibly dementia. Intervention studies are about to begin that will assess various lipid-and lipoprotein-modifying therapies and their ability to reduce vascular disease risk in the elderly. 
3	Prediction of cognitive change as a function of preoperative ability status among temporal lobectomy patients seen at 6-month follow-up. The relationship between preoperative ability levels and postoperative changes in cognitive function was examined among 23 left (LTL) and 19 right (RTL) temporal lobectomy patients using a battery of memory, language, and visuospatial tasks administered approximately 3 months before surgery and at 6 months follow-up. Higher preoperative performances on the memory and language measures were associated with larger decrements in postsurgical scores among the LTL patients. The RTL group showed no consistent relationship between preoperative ability levels and subsequent postsurgical cognitive changes. Based on the present data, we constructed base-rate tables for the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised indicating the likelihood of measurable gains or losses in memory as a function of presurgical ability level for patients undergoing LTL. While tentative, these data provide a useful and practical guide for counseling prospective epilepsy patients of the attendant cognitive risks of LTL. 
3	Aggravation of myasthenia gravis by erythromycin. Erythromycin is not currently recognized as causing clinical aggravation of myasthenia gravis. We report the case of a patient who experienced exacerbations of myasthenia gravis subsequent to each of several doses of intravenous erythromycin. We suggest that erythromycin can cause clinical worsening in patients with disease of the neuromuscular junction. 
4	Mechanical measures in the prophylaxis of postoperative thromboembolism in total knee arthroplasty. Total knee arthroplasty patients are at high risk for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in these patients seems mandatory. Pharmacologic agents such as dextran 40, aspirin, and warfarin are effective but may be associated with significant complications such as drug reaction, bleeding, hematoma, and hemarthrosis. Heparin was not effective and was associated with significant bleeding complications. Mechanical methods such as continuous passive motion and sequential pneumatic compression stockings were without complications and seemed equal to or more effective than pharmacologic agents. Adding warfarin to mechanical methods did not seem to augment the antithromboembolic effect of the mechanical methods. 
4	Baffle fenestration with subsequent transcatheter closure. Modification of the Fontan operation for patients at increased risk Ventricular dysfunction, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, and residual distal pulmonary artery distortion contribute to early mortality after a Fontan operation; they may be transient or reversible. A baffle fenestration, allowing right-to-left shunting, maintains cardiac output and limits right atrial pressure. A baffle fenestration was surgically created at the time of a modified Fontan repair in 20 consecutive patients. Risk factors included pulmonary artery pressure of 18 mm Hg or more, end-diastolic pressure of 12 mm Hg or more, valvar regurgitation, pulmonary artery distortion, pulmonary vascular resistance of 2 Woods' units or more, ventricular outflow obstruction, and complex anatomy. Nineteen of 20 patients survived. After the operation, mean arterial oxygen saturation was 86%, mean right atrial pressure was 15 mm Hg, and mean duration of pleural effusions was 6 days. Twelve of 19 survivors tolerated early test occlusion and had permanent transcatheter umbrella closure. Four patients failed early test occlusion, with a significant decrease in venous O2 saturation and a rise in central venous pressure, due to ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary artery distortion, or aortopulmonary collaterals. Three of four had successful late closure of the fenestration after correction of these abnormalities. 
5	AIDS enteropathy: occult enteric infections and duodenal mucosal alterations in chronic diarrhea OBJECTIVE: To investigate occult enteric infections and morphologic changes in the small intestine in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and chronic diarrhea of undefined cause. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Referral-based clinic and hospital in tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with advanced HIV infection (19 with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], 3 with AIDS-related complex) with chronic diarrhea, selected because of previously negative stool evaluations for bacterial or parasitic pathogens, were compared with 13 patients with advanced HIV infection (9 with AIDS, 4 with AIDS-related complex) without diarrhea by analysis of endoscopic biopsies using light and electron microscopy, viral culture, and morphometric studies. Both groups were convenience samples and had at least 7 months follow-up. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eleven of twenty-two patients with HIV infection and chronic diarrhea but only 1 of 13 patients without diarrhea showed occult enteric pathogens (that is, undetected by routine studies) after extensive evaluation of duodenal and colorectal biopsies. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and microsporidia were the most common occult agents in study patients with diarrhea (5 each). Patients with diarrhea and occult enteric infections had greater weight loss (mean, 14.3 kg compared with 6.2 kg; P less than 0.05) and shorter survival (1 of 11 compared with 8 of 11 still alive; P less than 0.004) than those with diarrhea but no identified pathogens (defined as "AIDS enteropathy"). Duodenal morphometry showed decreased villus-to-crypt ratios because of villus atrophy and crypt elongation in HIV-infected patients both with and without diarrhea compared with normal controls (P less than 0.001 for each). All three groups showed comparable frequencies of epithelial mitoses. CONCLUSIONS: Further endoscopic biopsy evaluation of patients with AIDS who had unexplained chronic diarrhea showed an occult infectious cause in half of the cases. However, altered villus and crypt architecture in advanced HIV infection was independent of the presence of diarrhea or enteric infection and therefore did not correlate with AIDS enteropathy. Subnormal epithelial proliferation in response to injury could be a factor, but the underlying cause of the architectural changes remains obscure. We suggest that T-cell dysfunction may play a role. 
4	Subarachnoid hemorrhage from a dissecting aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery. Case report. A case of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from a dissecting aneurysm of the inferior limb of the middle cerebral artery is reported. The patient's clinical status and the initial and follow-up angiographic appearance of the aneurysm are presented. Diagnosis and treatment are briefly discussed. It is suggested that, if angiography demonstrates luminal narrowing or vascular occlusion in a patient with unexplained SAH, a dissecting aneurysm of the carotid system should be considered as a cause of the hemorrhage. 
5	The validity and reliability of the navicular fat stripe as a screening test for detection of navicular fractures. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if the navicular fat stripe (NFS) is a valid and reliable screening tool in assessing potential navicular fractures. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Minor trauma section of the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center emergency department. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Study population included patients seen for wrist injury between January 1987 and December 1988. The individuals who interpreted the radiographs included eight observers with varying degrees of radiographic experience. INTERVENTIONS: None MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The positive predictive value averaged 12% or 15% depending on how we counted a straight NFS, and the negative predictive value averaged 93% or 95%, again depending on how we counted a straight NFS. A straight NFS was ten times as likely to occur among normal wrists than among those with navicular fractures. Interobserver reliability was found to be high with a Hoyt reliability coefficient of .79. CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal NFS is a poor predictor of a navicular fracture while both a straight and a normal NFS are good predictors of no navicular fracture. A normal NFS may allow less stringent treatment by the emergency physician. Extremes of radiographic experience were found to have no significant effect on NFS interpretation. 
1	Lack of correlation of clinical breast examination with high-risk histopathology. PURPOSE: Routine breast examination frequently finds differences in palpable density and palpable nodularity, but it is not known if these differences correlate with the presence of high-risk histopathology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To test for a relationship between clinical breast examination and histopathology, we devised separate, 4-point scales of clinical density and nodularity and validated these scales by repeat examinations 4 or more months apart in 199 separate breasts (the scale was the same or within 1 point on repeat examination 87% of the time for density and 90% for nodularity). We then used these two clinical scales to compare density and nodularity to histopathology of breast tissue at the margins of segmental resections in 60 women undergoing breast-conserving treatment of primary breast cancer. In cases such as these, a large sample of "normal" tissue is intentionally removed when the wide excision is done to obtain negative margins. Histopathology at the margins was graded according to the consensus panel of the American College of Pathology; as might be expected in women with previous cancer, some higher-risk histopathology was found in 37% of cases. A relationship was sought using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Neither clinical breast density (rho = 0.16) nor clinical breast nodularity (rho = 0.01) related to the presence of high-risk histopathology in the underlying tissue. Interestingly, breast nodularity increased with age (rho = 0.28), and clinical density and nodularity were inversely related (rho = -0.28). CONCLUSION: We conclude that neither clinical breast density nor nodularity correlates with histopathology and that it is unlikely that a larger study would find a clinically useful correlation. Therefore, a clinical examination should not be used to decide that high-risk histopathology is likely to be present in an individual woman's breast. 
3	Surgical decompression without transposition for ulnar neuropathy: factors determining outcome. Fifty-one surgical decompressions without nerve transposition for ulnar neuropathy were performed in 46 patients. All of the patients were men with an average age of 59 years at the time of surgery. The follow-up range was between 5 and 32 months (average, 17.8 months). The disease involved the nondominant arm in 24 patients (52%) and was bilateral in 5 (11%). In 23 cases (50%), no predisposing condition could be identified, whereas 15 patients (33%) abused alcohol and 8 patients (17%) had diabetes mellitus. Fifty-seven percent of the patients helped by surgery had symptoms for less than 1 year, whereas only 30% of patients with symptoms for more than 1 year had symptomatic improvement. The relative magnitude of the slowing of ulnar nerve conduction velocity across the elbow was not significantly correlated with the success of decompression in relieving symptoms. Ulnar nerve conduction velocities across the elbow were 36.13 +/- 11.76 m/s in those responding to surgery and 38.97 +/- 13.91 m/s in those not responding (c = 0.06, dF = 50, P less than 0.3). A total of 37 patients showed symptomatic improvement after decompression. Simple decompression of the ulnar nerve was performed under local anesthesia without transposition of the nerve. In all of these cases, compression of the nerve occurred predominantly in the epicondylar groove. Narrowing of the nerve in the groove was present in 28 cases (55%); scar tissue was found adhering to the nerve in 21 cases (41%); and two pseudoneuromas were found (4%). Forty-one operations (80%) resulted in symptomatic improvement, typically noted by the patient within the first month postoperatively. 
3	pH-adjustment and discomfort caused by the intradermal injection of lignocaine [published erratum appears in Anaesthesia 1991 Mar;46(3):242] One hundred adult day-case patients who required intravenous access had cannulae inserted using local anaesthesia with 1% lignocaine, 1% lignocaine with adrenaline or the corresponding pH-adjusted solutions. The local anaesthetic solutions were modified by the addition of 1 ml 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to 10 ml lignocaine. Pain scores at different stages of cannulation were noted and showed a significant reduction after use of pH-adjusted solutions (p less than 0.02 for the plain lignocaine, and less than 0.001 for the lignocaine with adrenaline). Modification of the pH of lignocaine solutions by the addition of sodium bicarbonate is a simple method significantly to reduce the discomfort caused by the infiltration of the local anaesthetic. 
2	Gallstones, cholecystitis and diabetes [published erratum appears in Surg Gynecol Obstet 1991 Jul;173(1):72] Findings from studies showing an increased incidence of gallstones in diabetic patients do not control for other variables, such as obesity. There is no proof that diabetic patients have more gallstones. Gallstones do not cause diabetes mellitus. The principal gallbladder pathologic feature in diabetic patients is a functional deficit of uncertain etiologic factors, creating a large, flaccid, poorly emptying organ. Bile acid and lipid composition are usually increased in diabetic patients. Cholecystitis seems to be a more serious disease in diabetic patients, with worse infectious sequelae and more rapid disease progression. This conclusion has not been examined statistically. Even with modern care, the complication rate for operations upon the biliary tract in patients with diabetes is increased. Those with diabetes are generally older than other patients requiring cholecystectomy. Systemic changes of aging partly explain increased morbidity and mortality. Diabetic patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease usually require operation. Risk of cholecystectomy in diabetic patients is similar to that in nondiabetics. Prophylactic cholecystectomy for diabetic patients with "silent" gallstones was formerly recommended because of an apparent high risk of cholecystitis. Until the natural history of gallstones in those with diabetes has been defined, such patients should be considered in danger of serious illness. The risk of acute cholecystitis in diabetic patients with stones is probably significant enough to warrant the performance of early cholecystectomy. 
5	Measurement of resistance versus flow in assessing efficiency of aortocoronary bypass grafts. Measurement of flow in saphenous bypass grafts with an electromagnetic flowmeter is complicated and poorly reproducible. Since coronary flow is largely dependent on variable factors the stable value of resistance seems more appropriate for comparison. A simple method has been developed for intraoperative measurement of resistance in the respective coronary bed. Pressure is recorded in the saphenous graft by an electromanometer during continuous flushing with known amounts of blood, and resistance is calculated instantaneously. The procedure is very simple and takes less than one minute. The quality of the saphenous vein itself can be assessed simultaneously by the same method. Resistances were measured during coronary surgery in over 500 saphenous grafts. The results were highly reproducible and comparable. Excellent flows can be expected if resistance is below 200 Peripheral Resistance Units (PRU); if this is over 800 PRU flow is very poor. 
1	Apocrine mammary carcinoma. A clinicopathologic study of 72 cases. Apocrine carcinoma (AC) is an uncommon, poorly characterized type of breast tumor. In this review, 55 patients with intraductal (ID) AC and 17 patients with infiltrating (IF) AC were analyzed retrospectively to define the histologic features and clinical course of this neoplasm. Recurrences in the breast occurred in 3 of 20 ID-AC patients treated by biopsy alone, but not in the 2 patients who received local radiation therapy after biopsy. One patient with ID-AC had axillary metastases at the time of treatment by mastectomy and died of disease five years later. The remaining patients with ID-AC treated by mastectomy have remained disease free. One of the three patients with IF-AC treated by biopsy alone died of disease, and one of two patients with IF-AC treated by biopsy and radiotherapy was alive with carcinoma. Twelve patients with IF-AC were treated by mastectomy. Ten of them were recurrence free at the time of last observation. More than one-third of the cases of ID-AC and IF-AC were detected by mammography alone. Survival analysis of IF-AC cases compared with nonapocrine duct carcinoma cases matched for stage revealed no statistical difference in estimated recurrence-free survival or estimated survival probability. AC is a distinct morphologic entity with a natural history similar to that of nonapocrine ductal carcinoma. 
4	Electroencephalographic changes during brief cardiac arrest in humans. Slowing and attenuation of the dominant frequency of the electroencephalogram (EEG) are changes commonly used to detect cerebral ischemia. To assess the validity of this method, the EEGs recorded during 93 episodes of circulatory arrest in ten normothermic, lightly anesthetized patients undergoing implantation of automatic internal cardioverting defibrillators (AICDs) were visually inspected for change. The number of events recorded for each patient varied from 5 to 18 and was a function of the duration and success of AICD testing in each patient. In 82 of 93 (88%) episodes, EEG changes were identified, and occurred an average of 10.2 s after the last normal heart beat. Of these 82, 67 (82%) illustrated slowing and attenuation. However, 15 (18%) of the hemodynamic events showed changes not previously described as indicative of cerebral ischemia: 6 (7%) showed a loss of delta-wave activity and 9 (11%) showed an increase in the amplitude of theta activity. Time to onset of these unusual changes (10.6 and 9.2 s, respectively) was not significantly different from that for EEG slowing and attenuation (10.2 s). Five of the ten subjects showed more than one pattern of EEG change. There was no significant difference in the time to onset of EEG change among individual patients, and neither were there differences in patterns of change associated with particular anesthetic agents. These results indicate that in normothermic, lightly anesthetized individuals, cerebral ischemia may cause changes in EEG pattern other than slowing and attenuation of dominant frequencies. These alternative patterns should be recognized as indicative of cerebral ischemia when intraoperative EEG monitoring is performed. 
4	Immediate reproducibility of electrically induced sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia before and during antiarrhythmic therapy The immediate reproducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia induction was evaluated prospectively during 106 studies performed in 53 patients with clinical sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Programmed electrical stimulation was performed twice, using the same protocol during 53 drug-free studies and 53 subsequent studies on antiarrhythmic therapy. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was reproduced in 104 (98%) of the 106 studies. There was no significant difference in the incidence of reproducible tachycardia in the drug-free state compared with that observed during treatment with different classes of antiarrhythmic drugs. An increase in the number of extrastimuli was required to reinitiate the tachycardia in 9 (11%) of 83 studies in which single or double extrastimuli were initially required to induce the tachycardia. In 39 (37%) of 104 studies with reproducible tachycardia induction, the two tachycardias significantly differed in electrocardiographic (ECG) configuration and cycle length. These observations suggest that the overall reproducibility of ventricular tachycardia induction is sufficiently high to provide a reliable marker for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. However, specific tachycardia characteristics such as cycle length and ECG configuration are more variable even within the same study and may be less useful in assessing the effects of subsequent interventions. 
4	The frequency, causes and timing of death within 30 days of a first stroke: the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project. In a prospective, community-based study of 675 consecutive patients with a first-ever stroke, of whom over 90% had computed tomography (CT) and/or necropsy examinations, 129 deaths occurred within 30 days of the onset of symptoms, a case fatality rate (CFR) of 19%. The 30 day CFR for patients with cerebral infarction was 10% (57 of 545, for primary intracerebral haemorrhage 52% (34 of 66), for subarachnoid haemorrhage 45% (15 of 33) and for those of uncertain pathological type 74% (23 of 31). The CFR for patients who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was 33% compared with 17% for those who had been independent pre-stroke. The age-adjusted relative risk of death for patients who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was not significantly greater (1.8, 95% confidence interval 0 to 4.3). There was a significant trend for CFR to increase with age (Chi square for trend = 4.0, p less than 0.05). This relationship was found in those patients who had been functionally independent prestroke (Chi square for trend = 7.9, p less than 0.005) but not in those who had been dependent pre-stroke (Chi square for trend = 0.5, NS). The pattern of increasing CFR with increasing age amongst those who had been independent prestroke was seen particularly in patients with cerebral infarction (Chi square for trend = 8.6, p less than 0.005). The age-adjusted relative risk of death for patients with cerebral infarction who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.1). Fifty three percent of all deaths within 30 days of stroke were due to the direct neurological sequelae of the stroke. 
5	Clinical significance of the "palpable mass" in patients with muscle-infiltrating bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy after pre-operative radiotherapy. Between 1976 and 1985, 132 patients with T2/T3/T4a bladder cancer underwent cystectomy after pre-operative radiotherapy (46 Gy: 67 patients; 20 Gy: 65 patients). After a median time of 41 months, 62 patients were alive; 51 had died from recurrent bladder cancer and 19 from intercurrent disease without recurrence of their malignancy. Distant metastases developed in 40 patients, accompanied in 5 cases by local recurrence. Local recurrence was the first sign of relapse in 11 patients. In 3 patients the localisation of the relapse remained unknown. The corrected 5-year survival rate was 60%. T category and a palpable bladder tumour were independent pre-treatment prognostic factors in a Cox regression analysis, together with the interval between initial diagnosis and cystectomy. The presence of a palpable tumour before the start of treatment was associated with a particularly poor prognosis in T3/T4a tumours, whereas the survival of patients with non-palpable T3/T4a tumours was similar to that of patients with T2 bladder cancer. Another important prognostic factor was post-irradiation stage reduction (no residual muscle infiltration in the cystectomy specimen). Significantly more patients with non-palpable bladder tumours experienced post-radiation stage reduction than did those with a palpable tumour. However, the prognostic value of stage reduction was statistically significant only in patients with palpable bladder tumours. 
1	Cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha on sensitive human melanoma cells in vitro may result in selection of cells with enhanced markers of malignancy. Monolayer cultures of the human melanoma cell lines StML-12, StML-11, StML-14 (third, respectively, twenty-fifth subculture), and SKMel-28 derived from specimens representing different stages of tumor progression were treated with 10-10,000 U/ml rTNF-alpha applied for 72 h. The effects of rTNF-alpha on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, cell viability, cloning efficiency, cell division, cell morphology, and the immunophenotype were studied in triplicate experiments. The cell line StML-14(3) revealed a significantly dose-dependent reduction of growth due to both cytostatic and cytotoxic activities of rTNF-alpha as well as a decrease of CE. Increased numbers of cells in prophase were observed 24 h after addition of r-TNF-alpha. In addition, dislocation of chromosomes in the metaphase, formation of micronuclei, and dose-dependent increases of cells exhibiting micronuclei and the DNA amount per cell were detected at the end of treatment. On the other hand, only a slight sensitivity to the anti-proliferative effect of rTNF-alpha was observed with StML-14(25) and SKMel-28, whereas StML-12 and StML-11 were significantly resistant. The last four cell lines were serially subcultivated and presented common phenotypic patterns with more malignant characteristics than the cell line StML-14(3) before treatment. Overall, rTNF-alpha enhanced the malignant immunophenotype of the cell lines tested. It increased the expression of the "late" melanoma progression markers A.10.33 and A.1.43, and Ki67, and it decreased the expression of the "early" progression marker K.1.2. The expression of HLA-I, HLA-DR, and ICAM-1 was also enhanced after rTNF-alpha treatment, whereas in contrast to other cytokines, rTNF-alpha did not induce the de novo expression of HLA-DR in HLA-DR-negative melanoma cell lines. These findings indicate that rTNF-alpha induces cytostasis and decreases cell viability of certain rTNF-alpha-sensitive melanoma cells. These effects may result in selection of rTNF-alpha-non-sensitive human melanoma cell populations with higher proliferation rates and a more aggressive immunophenotype in vitro. 
4	Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and sudden deaths among young adults in Wayne County. Based on postmortem records at the Wayne County Medical Examiners' Office from 1982 to 1986, autopsy results indicated that the deaths of 129 persons aged 20-34 resulted from heart disease: 51 of these deaths were attributed to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), 29 to hypertensive cardiovascular disease, 28 to cardiomyopathy, and 21 to other cardiac causes. The majority of the deaths due to ASCVD occurred among men, both black and white, followed by black women, and the incidence increased with age. All of these deaths due to ASCVD were sudden and accounted for all deaths due to ischemic heart disease in this age group among Wayne County residents. Diabetes mellitus, left ventricular hypertrophy, a history of seizures, and the recent ingestion of alcohol were all found to be associated with sudden death from ASCVD in this group. Obesity did not seem to be a significant factor. These data suggest that ASCVD is not rare as a cause of death in young adults and some of the risk factors identified in older subjects also operate in this age group. 
5	Urgent care center pediatric telephone advice. Pediatric telephone advice is sought frequently by members of the community. This study was undertaken to evaluate the quality and accuracy of pediatric telephone advice given by free-standing urgent care centers. One hundred such facilities were telephoned and advice was requested by a research assistant. A case was presented that could have represented a pediatric medical emergency. Overall only 17 centers gave adequate advice. The data suggest that under some circumstances free-standing urgent care center pediatric telephone advice may be inaccurate and inappropriate. Workable policies and protocols for pediatric telephone advice should be instituted by these facilities. 
4	Results and complications of angioplasty in fibromuscular disease. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was used to treat 66 patients with 85 renal artery stenoses due to fibromuscular dysplasia. The hypertension was refractory to medical management in 46 patients, and the initial success rate was 100%. Clinical follow-up has been obtained in all patients, who were followed for as long as 121 months. The recurrence rates were 8% of lesions and 10% of patients. Cumulative patency rate predicted for 10 years was 87.07%. The mean systolic pressure decreased by 52 mm Hg and the mean diastolic pressure decreased by 35 mm Hg in response to treatment. Twenty-six patients (39%) were cured, 39 (59%) were classified as improved, and one (2%) did not respond to PTA. Fourteen of the patients also had elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Renal function was improved in 86% of the patients and stabilized in 14% of the patients. Analysis of the long-term results suggests that PTA should be the initial treatment for choice of patients with fibromuscular dysplasia in the renal arteries. 
4	Use of the fistula assessment monitor to detect stenoses in access fistulae. Twenty-three unselected hemodialysis patients with functioning access arteriovenous fistulae were studied prospectively to determine the best technique for detecting stenoses within the fistulae. Combined clinical assessment and fistula assessment monitoring were compared with transbrachial angiography. Fistula assessment monitoring was more accurate (96%) than combined clinical assessment (accuracy, 52%) in stenosis detection. Complications of angiography occurred in 17% of patients; there were no complications of fistula assessment monitoring. Fistula assessment monitoring was better than combined clinical assessment in predicting clinical outcome for arteriovenous fistulae over 6 months and was as good as angiography. Routine fistula assessment monitoring could reduce inappropriate angiography and detect clinically significant silent stenoses. It is an ideal method for monitoring arteriovenous access fistulae. 
3	Sudden cervical pain: spontaneous cervical epidural hematoma. Three cases of cervical epidural hematoma are reported. Acute neck pain usually associated with a mild effort, closely followed by radicular pain and a neurologic deficit below the lesion is the typical presentation of this extremely rare and difficult diagnosis. As prognosis depends on preoperative neurologic state, the authors emphasize the importance of prompt identification of this lesion. The diagnosis is confirmed by computed tomography, and emergency neurosurgical laminectomy is mandatory. 
5	When epilepsy masquerades as heart disease. Awareness is key to avoiding misdiagnosis. Autonomic neural impulses that accompany discharges during a seizure can cause a variety of cardiac manifestations, including cardiac arrhythmias, sudden death, anginal chest pain, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and symptoms of pheochromocytoma. Either generalized or focal seizures may generate such signs and symptoms. A better appreciation of cardiac problems caused by epilepsy is helpful in preventing misdiagnosis, because the clinical picture in such a patient may be confusing. 
3	Tumoral thrombosis of cerebral venous sinuses: preoperative diagnosis using magnetic resonance phase imaging. Intracranial, dural-based neoplasms will not infrequently invade adjacent venous sinuses. Therefore, the preoperative diagnosis of venous invasion is important, as it will alter the surgical approach to the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive means of visualizing the cerebral venous sinuses. The preoperative diagnosis of venous thrombosis can, however, be difficult and confusing with conventional spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging because of variable appearances produced by blood clot degradation products as well as flowing blood. Phase magnetic resonance imaging is a simple method that can be acquired simultaneously with conventional spin-echo sequences, and is based primarily on whether protons are stationary or moving. In the context of venous sinus occlusion, phase imaging can demonstrate the presence or absence of blood flow more easily than spin-echo imaging. Three cases of dural-based neoplasms are presented that demonstrate the utility of phase imaging in diagnosing tumoral occlusion of the venous sinuses. 
4	Pressor systems in hypertension and congestive heart failure. Role of vasopressin [clinical conference] Elevated peripheral vascular resistance, which characterizes hypertension and congestive heart failure (the latter regardless of absolute blood pressure level) is maintained to a large extent by the combined effects of three major neurohormonal pressor mechanisms: the renin-angiotensin system, the sympathoadrenal system, and arginine vasopressin. Blockade of one of these mechanisms may lead to compensatory stimulation of the others, thus offsetting in part the hemodynamic benefits of a specific intervention. Combination therapy, designed to attack all three systems (with use of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, a sympathetic blocker such as clonidine, and an antagonist of the vasopressor action of vasopressin), may help in the treatment of such cases. To illustrate this strategy, two experimental studies, one case of malignant hypertension, and one case of congestive heart failure are presented. 
5	Influence of catheter technology and adjuvant medication on acute complications in percutaneous coronary angioplasty. We report on the complication rates in 660 consecutive coronary angioplasties (725 lesions) performed using four procedures that differed with respect to catheter technology and adjuvant medication. After the PTCA regimen in our laboratory had been changed from conventional steerable systems to the monorail technique, we observed a significant increase in the incidence of transient vessel occlusions from 2.6% to 7.7%, of permanent occlusions from 3.6% to 8.8%, and of intracoronary thrombus-formation from 2.6% to 5.5%. This was associated with the frequent observation of thrombotic material on the partially Teflon-coated guidewires. Coronary perfusion with urokinase (1,670-6,670 U/min) lead to a further increase in the complication rates (10.4%/10.3%/6.5%). Our present percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)-regimen (monorail technique with P.E.T. balloons, fully silicon-coated guidewires, no urokinase) shows an incidence of 3.8% for intermittent and recurrent coronary occlusions and 1.9% for permanent occlusions. Urokinase did not prevent intracoronary thrombus formation with the monorail technique. Furthermore, we suspect that in the case of PTCA-induced regional intimal dissection, fibrinolysis can prevent reestablishment of intima adherence to the vessel wall. Because five procedural deaths were observed in the 212 patients treated with i.c. urokinase as opposed to three deaths in the 448 procedures without urokinase, we feel that i.c. urokinase in PTCA is a potentially harmful regimen. We suggest that the monorail technique should be performed with fully silicon-coated guidewires and without urokinase. 
4	Plasma epinephrine levels in resuscitation with cardiopulmonary bypass. Since the highest plasma epinephrine levels have been recorded during resuscitation, we evaluated the isolated effect of cardiac arrest upon adrenomedullary secretion. We determined plasma epinephrine in dogs resuscitated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) after cardiac arrest periods of 12 (CPB-12; n = 4) or 16 min (CPB-16; n = 5). Through 2 h of CPB and the following 6 h of critical care, there was no difference between CPB-12 and CPB-16 regarding most cardiopulmonary functional variables. Plasma epinephrine was markedly elevated immediately after initiation of CPB (p less than .01 at 1 min CPB vs. basal) and returned rapidly to basal concentrations. Comparison of plasma epinephrine levels between CPB and standard CPR groups showed that responses to cardiac arrest were similar (p greater than .05 at 1 min CPB vs. 11.5 min CPR). We conclude that cardiac arrest is the main or sole determinant of the plasma epinephrine elevation of resuscitation. 
5	Weight gain with breast cancer adjuvant treatment. Available information suggests that individuals with breast cancer gain weight during adjuvant treatment and that this weight gain may be associated with poor prognosis. Exploration of the factors which affect weight gain may aid in developing weight control interventions for these patients. To determine the factors which are associated with weight gain, 32 women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy were followed over 2 years from the beginning of adjuvant treatment. Measures of psychologic functioning and self-reports of exercise levels and eating were assessed every 2 months during the course of treatment. Sixty-nine percent of the women gained weight over treatment, resulting in a significant weight gain for the group as a whole. Weight gain was correlated positively with several psychologic measures but not with assessed biologic measures. A multiple-regression equation using psychologic/behavioural measures of emotional discharge, logical analysis, affective regulation, interpersonal sensitivity, average number of symptoms, and obsessive compulsiveness accounted for 58% of the variance in overall weight gain. At 2 years of follow-up, 27 women had gained weight for an average of 6.03 kg. The coping style of logical analysis emerged as a significant predictor of disease recurrence, accounting for 28% of the variance in weight gain at 2 years. The results are discussed in terms of identification of women likely to gain weight during adjuvant treatment, directions for future research, and development of interventions to control weight gain. 
4	In vitro and in vivo testing of a new valved intravascular catheter design. Long-term intravascular catheterization carries a finite risk of catheter occlusion. A catheter tip valve design is presented (Buchwald-Wigness, Strato Medical Corporation, Beverly, MA) which incorporates features designed to decrease the risk of thromboembolism and reduce the need for maintenance procedures. Aspiration and infusion are controlled by separate valves, making it possible to engineer optimized inlet and outlet parameters. The outlet valve is an elastic sleeve expanded around the sidewall outlet ports which opens under injection pressure. The inlet valve is a tubular elastic element compressed against the inlet port from within the lumen, opening under aspiration pressure. A series of valves were prototyped with outlet pressures ranging from 2 to 100" H2O, and inlet pressures ranging from -40-70" H2O, and flowrates at 36" H2O of greater than 1,400 ml/hr. Dog implants of two prototypes with outlet valve pressures of 10" H2O, and inlet pressures of -40" H2O, demonstrated that dormant periods of up to 7.5 weeks could be achieved without detectable blood cell entry into the lumen. No significant hemolysis was observed in blood samples aspirated with a 6 cc syringe (8% scored "slightly hemolyzed" vs. 44% with the nonvalved controls) indicating that a hemodialysis application is likely. 
5	Survivorship analysis of total knee arthroplasty. Cumulative rates of survival of 9200 total knee arthroplasties. From 1971 through 1987, 9200 total knee arthroplasties were performed at the Mayo Clinic. Actuarial analysis was used to estimate cumulative rates of survival. Use of a proportional-hazard, general linear model led to the identification of four independent variables that were associated with a significantly lower risk of failure: primary total knee arthroplasty, a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, an age of sixty years or more, and use of a condylar prosthesis with a metal-backed tibial component. When all four of these favorable variables were present (without regard for radiographic changes and non-disabling symptoms), the probability of an implant being in situ was 97 per cent at both five and ten years. 
5	The cutaneous manifestations in children with familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent hereditary polyserositis). A six-year study. In a six-year study of 46 children with familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent hereditary polyserositis), 20 children (43 per cent) developed cutaneous manifestations. Ten children had 18 episodes of erysipelas-like erythema which proved to be specific for the disease. Twelve children (26 per cent) had 31 episodes of non-specific purpuric rash and six children (13 per cent) had nine episodes of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Other manifestations included diffuse erythema of the face, and/or trunk, angioneurotic oedema, diffuse erythema of the palms and soles followed by mild desquamation of the skin, Raynaud's phenomenon and a subcutaneous nodule. The mean frequency of the cutaneous lesions was 1.6/patient/year before colchicine therapy and 0.4/patient/year after colchicine therapy (p = 0.0005). The high incidence of cutaneous manifestations and their response to colchicine strongly suggest that skin involvement is an integral part familial Mediterranean fever. 
2	Liver cirrhosis: changes of Doppler waveform of hepatic veins [published erratum appears in Radiology 1991 Aug;100(2):586] The authors compared the Doppler ultrasonographic pattern of hepatic veins (HVs) in a group of 60 patients affected by liver cirrhosis and in 65 healthy subjects comparable for sex and age to (a) detect possible differences in HV waveform in the two groups and (b) investigate the relationship of these differences with the severity of the disease (according to Child-Pugh classification) and the modifications of systemic hemodynamics. The waveform of HVs was arbitrarily classified into three patterns: HV0, a normal waveform; HV1, lower oscillations without the reversed phase; and HV2, completely flat waveform. The resistivity index of the superior mesenteric artery, reflecting the peripheral splanchnic impedance and the hyperdynamic circulation, was also measured in a subgroup of 45 cirrhotic patients. The waveform of HVs in all healthy subjects corresponded to the HV0 pattern. Among cirrhotic patients, HV0 was found in 30 (50%), HV1 in 19 (31.7%), and HV2 in 11 (81.3%). The severity of functional impairment was greatest in the HV2 group and least in the HV0 group. This was significantly correlated with the decrease of the resistivity index in the superior mesenteric artery in the subgroup of 45 patients. Changes in the normal HV waveform could be considered a useful adjunctive tool for the noninvasive evaluation of liver disease. The pathophysiology of these changes in HV blood flow is still unclear. The significant correlation with the severity of the disease and with the decrease of splanchnic resistances indicates that these changes in the HV waveform occur in the presence of marked rearrangements of liver tissue and of hyperdynamic systemic circulation. 
3	Cefotaxime and aminoglycoside treatment of meningitis caused by gram-negative enteric organisms. We reviewed cases of Gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at Texas Children's Hospital from January, 1984, through June, 1989. Seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. The etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were Klebsiella sp, 9; Escherichia coli, 4; Enterobacter cloacae, 3; Citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2. With the exception of one isolate of Acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. In addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. Children with meningitis caused by Klebsiella sp. or non-Klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. Aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. Five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1). The mean durations of positive lumbar, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or brain abscess cultures were 5.8 +/- 4.7 and 7.2 +/- 5.0 days after start of therapy in the Klebsiella and non-Klebsiella meningitis patients, respectively. Only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. Gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against Gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection. 
2	Genital and anal conditions confused with child sexual abuse trauma. Examination of a child with genital or anal disease may give rise to suspicion of sexual abuse. Dermatologic, traumatic, infectious, and congenital disorders may be confused with sexual abuse. Seven children referred to us are representative of such confusion. 
4	Lipoprotein-related coronary risk factors in patients with angiographically defined coronary artery disease: relation to number of stenosed arteries. To determine whether an index estimating antagonism between low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) would improve separation between groups with and without coronary artherosclerosis, patients undergoing coronary catheterization (35 women and 99 men) were analysed for total cholesterol (TC), HDL cholesterol (HDLc), apolipoprotein A (apo A) and apolipoprotein B (apo B). The subjects were categorized as groups 0, 1, 2 or 3 according to the number of stenosed arteries (greater than 75% areal stenosis). Thirty of the patients showed no significant coronary atherosclerosis (group 0). Serum apo B and TC concentrations were directly related to the number of stenosed vessels, whereas the concentrations of apo A and HDLc were negatively correlated with the number of stenosed arteries. An 'atherogenic Index' (ATH index) calculated as the product of serum concentrations of apo B, and TC minus HDLc divided by the product of apo A and HDLc, proved more satisfactory than individual lipoprotein components for discrimination between subjects with and without stenosis. Accordingly, identification of coronary groups may be improved by using the ATH index. 
4	Coronary ostial reconstruction: technical issues. Coronary ostial reconstruction may be the preferred alternative to reestablish antegrade myocardial revascularization in patients with isolated ostial stenosis. The technical steps of reconstruction are described. The ultrasonic aspirator is a helpful implement in the dissection of the left main and the proximal right coronary arteries. Satisfactory results of coronary ostial reconstruction in the current era seem to fulfill its promise. 
4	Caliber-persistent artery of the stomach (Dieulafoy's vascular malformation). Caliber-persistent artery of the stomach (also known as cirsoid aneurysm, Dieulafoy's lesion, and submucosal arterial malformation) is clinically manifested as recurrent, massive, often fatal hematemesis. The lesion often is not seen endoscopically. Left gastric angiography in one patient with hematemesis showed a convoluted and ectatic artery in the gastric fundus, which proved to be caliber-persistent artery of the stomach on pathological examination. The tortuosity of the abnormal vessel in this condition has been attributed to artefactual contraction of the stomach following excision and formalin fixation. This is the first reported case in which a pathologically proven lesion has been clearly visualized by angiography. This demonstrates that the submucosal vessel is truly and not artifactually sinuous. It is proposed that angiographic demonstration of a nontapering, convoluted artery in the territory of the left gastric artery is highly suggestive of caliber-persistent artery of the stomach. 
5	Preventing postoperative acute bleeding of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. Two hundred and ninety-eight critically ill patients at risk for the development of postoperative stress ulcers and bleeding were randomized into three groups. The first group comprised 85 patients who received meciadanol, a new bioflavonoid, 500 milligrams every six hours through a nasograstric tube; the second group comprised 100 patients who received sucralfate (crushed tablets), 1,000 milligrams every six hours through a nasogastric tube, and the third group comprised 113 patients who received an antacid (Maalox [magnesium aluminum hydroxide gel]) through a nasogastric tube at an initial dose of 15 milliliters every hour. The gastric pH was measured hourly and titrated to a pH greater than or equal to 4.0 in patients in the group receiving the antacid. The gastric pH was measured every two hours in the other two groups. Bleeding in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract was determined visually (frank blood in gastric contents) or by guaiac testing. Bleeding occurred in seven patients receiving meciadanol, nine receiving sucralfate and six receiving the antacid. The difference in rates of bleeding was not statistically significant. Correlation between the severity of illness index and the development of bleeding was poor, at least in the low and intermediate index range. In contrast, there was a strong correlation between the age of the patient and the development of bleeding. Only one patient younger than 50 years had bleeding develop. Apparently, meciadanol exerts its action by a mechanism other than pH control. It may, therefore, fill an important gap in the ability to prevent postoperative stress ulcers and bleeding. 
3	Botulinum vs adjustable suture surgery in the treatment of horizontal misalignment in adult patients lacking fusion. Thirty patients were treated with either botulinum toxin or adjustable suture surgery in a prospective, randomized clinical trial. All patients had horizontal deviations greater than 10 prism diopters and absent fusion. Seventeen patients were assigned to toxin treatment, and 13 were assigned to surgical treatment. Follow-up at 6 months after either procedure indicated that surgery was superior, with patient alignment showing a 92.7% average net change, compared with a 50.50% net change in the botulinum-treated group. There was no difference in response between those patients with a starting deviation of 20 PD or less and greater than 20 PD in the surgery group. However, in the botulinum-treated group, those patients with a starting deviation of 20 PD or less seemed to show better responses than those patients with greater than 20 PD. Patients with esotropia showed an 88.89% change with surgery and a 51.55% change with toxin treatment. Patients with exotropia had a 95.83% change with surgery but a 50.3% change with toxin treatment. Since we had 20 patients with exotropia and 10 patients with esotropia, a more formal comparison would require larger numbers. 
1	Association of disease-free survival and percent of ideal dose in adjuvant breast chemotherapy. The relationship between percent of ideal dose and disease-free survival was examined in 256 Stage II and III patients who participated in a 2-year breast adjuvant chemotherapy trial consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) given postoperatively. When analyzed analogously to previous work, the results confirmed a dose-response relationship: that is, there appeared to be an improved disease-free survival for patients receiving higher doses of adjuvant chemotherapy. The major criticism of such an analysis is its bias. This bias was addressed by considering only patients who were still receiving therapy at 6, 12, and 24 months; then, the dose-response relationship was no longer seen. Although causality cannot be inferred, the apparent differences in disease-free survival among the dose groups can be attributed to recurrences in the first 2 years among patients receiving lower doses of chemotherapy. 
5	Can histological assessment predict the outcome in interstitial cystitis? In a retrospective study we compared the outcome of 39 patients with interstitial cystitis to the histological findings at initial diagnostic bladder biopsy. The degree of inflammation and fibrosis and the mast cell counts were assessed on each biopsy. The prognostic relevance of the clinical features of age, duration of symptoms, frequency, nocturia, pain and bladder capacity was assessed. The study showed no statistical correlation between the severity of histological findings at diagnosis and the eventual outcome of the disease. Over 50% of patients with severe histological abnormalities responded to conservative treatment. Although the majority of patients with mild pathological changes responded to conservative treatment, some did require surgical intervention. The clinical features of pain, nocturia and bladder capacity showed significant differences between the 2 patient groups. However, the former 2 features are subject to many variables and the latter probably has too wide a range to be useful as a prognostic indicator. Only the response of patients to conservative treatment will indicate those who are not being helped and who may eventually require surgical treatment. 
2	Asymptomatic rhabdomyolysis of unknown etiology. A 7-year-old boy developed rhabdomyolysis with a peak creatine phosphokinase level of 261,400 IU/L after his appendectomy. These abnormalities occurred following a 2-3-day illness consisting of upper respiratory tract symptoms, fever, and abdominal pain mimicking acute appendicitis. At the time of operation, a normal appendix was removed, and mesenteric lymphadenitis was noted. The myoglobinuria and elevation of creatine phosphokinase were transient, and the patient remained asymptomatic. We review various causes of right lower quadrant pain and rhabdomyolysis and address the roles of malignant hyperthermia and infectious agents. The possible cause of the phenomena observed in this patient is discussed. 
5	Human leukoagglutinating antibody evokes cooperative leukotriene synthesis in pulmonary microvasculature. Model of transfusion-related acute lung injury. Leukoagglutinating antibodies have been implicated in the development of transfusion-related acute lung injury. In the present study, human neutrophil leukotriene generation was provoked by an anti-5b immunoglobulin G, isolated from a multiparous donor plasma that caused noncardiogenic lung edema during transfusion therapy. In 5b-positive polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the antibody stimulated marked arachidonic acid metabolism, dependent on the presence of plasma as the complement source. Quantity and profile of lipid mediators (leukotriene B4 and its omega-oxidation products, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of leukotriene A4) corresponded to those repeatedly described after PMN in vitro stimulation with the artificial calcium ionophore A23187. Anti-5b challenge of PMNs sequestered in the microvasculature of perfused rabbit lungs did, however, induce a markedly modified metabolite profile. Nonenzymatic hydrolysis products of leukotriene A4 were not detected, and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid was markedly reduced. In contrast, cysteinyl leukotrienes were measured as predominant compounds, with rapid appearance of leukotriene C4 and more protracted generation of leukotriene E4. Leukotriene B4 and its omega-oxidation products were released with similar kinetics, but in lower amounts, as compared with the isolated PMN stimulation. Anti-5b challenge of PMNs coincubated with pulmonary artery endothelial cells in vitro, but not stimulation of either cell type alone, provoked marked generation of cysteinyl leukotrienes. These findings suggest modulation of PMN 5-lipoxygenase metabolism in favor of leukotriene A4 transfer to adjacent acceptor cells with subsequent enzymatic conversion to cysteinyl leukotrienes under conditions of lung vascular sequestration. Endothelial cells appear to serve as predominant cooperative cells under circumstances of blood-free lung perfusion. PMN-related transcellular eicosanoid synthesis may be involved in the pathogenesis of transfusion-evoked acute lung injury. 
3	Hereditary internal anal sphincter myopathy causing proctalgia fugax and constipation. A newly identified condition. A newly identified myopathy of the internal anal sphincter is described. In the affected family, at least one member from each of five generations had severe proctalgia fugax; onset was usually in the third to fifth decades of life. Three members of the family have been studied in detail. Each had severe pain intermittently during the day and hourly during the night. Constipation was an associated symptom, in particular difficulty with rectal evacuation. Clinically the internal anal sphincter was thickened and of decreased compliance. The maximum anal canal pressure was usually increased with marked ultraslow wave activity. Anal endosonography confirmed a grossly thickened internal anal sphincter. Two patients were treated by internal anal sphincter strip myectomy; one showed marked improvement and one was relieved of the constipation but had only slight improvement of the pain. The hypertrophied muscle in two of the patients showed unique myopathic changes, consisting of vacuolar changes with periodic acid-Schiff-positive polyglycosan bodies in the smooth muscle fibers and increased endomysial fibrosis. In vitro organ-bath studies showed insensitivity of the muscle to noradrenaline, isoprenaline, carbachol, dimethylpiperazinium, and electrical-field stimulation. Immunohistochemical studies for substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, galanin, neuropeptide Y, and vasoactive intestinal peptide showed staining in a similar distribution to that in control tissue. A specific autosomal-dominant inherited myopathy of the internal anal sphincter that causes anal pain and constipation has been identified and characterized. 
5	Coronary artery bypass operation in dialysis patients. To analyze the short- and long-term morbidity and mortality among maintenance dialysis patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass operations, we identified 25 such patients at the Mayo Clinic and three recently published large single-center studies that provided sufficient detail for meaningful comparison. Two independent observers reviewed the new information with regard to pertinent historical, clinical, and laboratory data. The perioperative mortality was 20%. Among the perioperative survivors, 1- and 2-year survival rates were 95% and 77%, respectively. The 3-year actuarial survival was 70%. Uniformly, the symptoms diminished, and the need for antianginal medication was decreased. In the three other large published series, the perioperative mortality ranged from 3 to 20%, and coronary artery bypass performed earlier after the onset of the symptoms seemed to result in a lower perioperative mortality. We conclude that elective coronary artery bypass in dialysis patients is associated with acceptable short-term morbidity and mortality and effective relief of symptoms. Surgically treated patients may have a survival advantage. Thus, we advocate aggressive early investigation and surgical treatment of these patients. 
3	Electromagnetic treatment of shoulder periarthritis: a randomized controlled trial of the efficiency and tolerance of magnetotherapy. The potential benefit of magnetotherapy was investigated in 47 consecutive outpatients with periarthritis of the shoulder. Using a controlled triple-blind study design, one group of patients received hot pack applications and passive manual stretching and pulley exercises; the other group received the same therapy plus magnetotherapy. Treatment was administered three times a week. For a maximum of three months, a standardized treatment protocol was used. There was no significant improvement in pain reduction or in range of motion with electromagnetic field therapy. After 12 weeks of therapy, the patients who received magnetotherapy showed mean pain scores of 1.5 (+/- .61 SD) at rest, 2.2 (+/- .76 SD) on movement, and 1.9 (+/- .94 SD), on lying, compared to scores for the control group of 1.4 (+/- .65 SD), 2.2 (+/- .7 SD), and 1.9 (+/- .95 SD), respectively. Linear pain scale scores improved from 71 to 21 for both groups. At 12 weeks the gain in range of motion was mean 109 degrees +/- 46.8 in patients receiving electromagnetic field therapy, compared to 122 degrees +/- 33.4 for the controls (not significant). At entry, the functional handicap score was 53.5 for both groups. At 12 weeks, it was 24 for the magnetotherapy group and 17 for the control group (difference not significant). In conclusion, this study showed no benefit from magnetotherapy in the pain score, range of motion, or improvement of functional status in patients with periarthritis of the shoulder. 
5	Five-year postoperative results of cemented femoral arthroplasty in patients with systemic bone disease. To determine whether bone cellular abnormality affects the results of cemented femoral arthroplasty, 21 patients had biopsies of the iliac crest and femoral cortex at the time of surgery. Roentgenographic and histomorphometric studies were used to characterize fibrous membrane formation, cancellous bone, calcar resorption, and bone turnover. Patients with high bone turnover and decreased femoral thickness and density before surgery were at risk of developing calcar resorption and cancellous diaphyses, conditions that weaken proximal stem support and lead to early failure. These findings suggest that noncemented stems may be indicated in this group. Another group, osteoporotic patients, suffered from osteoblastic insufficiency, which may be the indication for the use of cemented stems rather than noncemented stems, which require bony ingrowth. 
1	The cellular biology of bone tumors. New knowledge in cell and molecular biology has begun to expand the understanding of the biology of osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. Studies on osteosarcomas have revealed abnormalities in the growth-inhibiting retinoblastoma gene, which may release cells from normal growth control. Abnormalities in growth factor production or response tend to inappropriately activate cell growth. Tumor cell DNA content and cytogenetics may affect the diagnosis and prognostic grouping of osteosarcomas. In Ewing's sarcomas, a characteristic translocation between Chromosomes 11 and 22 has been identified; this translocation is also found in malignant neuroepitheliomas. A variety of studies point to both neuroectodermal and mesenchymal origins for Ewing's sarcomas. Applications of new biologic knowledge and technology to clinical problems will lead to significant changes in the diagnosis, and perhaps in the treatment, of these tumors in the coming years. Collaborations between community and referral center physicians and scientists are critical for continued progress. 
3	Coexisting thymic carcinoid tumor and thymoma. Thymic carcinoid tumors are unusual neoplasms that are different from thymomas. We report a case of coexisting thymic carcinoid tumor and thymoma associated with myasthenia gravis. The clinicopathological findings are discussed with a review of the literature. 
2	Role of visceral afferent mechanisms in functional bowel disorders. This report analyzes the clinical and physiological evidence supporting a role for altered visceral afferent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of two functional bowel syndromes: noncardiac chest pain and the irritable bowel syndrome. Considerable recent evidence indicates that increased contractility is present only in a minority of patients and that hypercontractile episodes are not temporally related to abdominal pain. In contrast, altered sensation and motor reflexes in response to physiological stimuli, such as mechanical distention or acid, is common when appropriately investigated. The vagal and spinal afferent innervation mediates visceral sensation and is involved in multiple reflex loops regulating gastrointestinal effector function, such as motility and secretion. Sensory input can be modulated peripherally at the afferent nerve terminal, at the level of prevertebral ganglia, the spinal cord, and the brainstem. An up-regulation of afferent mechanisms would result both in altered conscious perception of physiological stimuli and in altered motor reflexes. Current evidence is consistent with an alteration in the peripheral functioning of visceral afferents and/or in the central processing of afferent information in the etiology of altered somatovisceral sensation and motor function observed in patients with functional bowel disease. 
1	Carbon dioxide laser vaporization of diaphragmatic metastases for cytoreduction of ovarian epithelial cancer. Three patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics state IIIC ovarian adenocarcinoma underwent CO2 laser vaporization of large-volume (5-6 cm) and miliary right hemidiaphragmatic metastases at the conclusion of standard debulking surgery to effect optimal cytoreduction. Destruction of diaphragmatic metastases was accomplished rapidly with no added morbidity or blood loss. The hand-held CO2 laser is a useful modality for removal of isolated large- and small-volume diaphragmatic disease, particularly if only the peritoneum is involved, and avoids the morbidity that may accompany entry into the pleural space. 
5	Alterations of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the nasal mucosa of allergic patients in comparison with nonallergic individuals. Cholinergic nasal hyperresponsiveness in nasal allergy may be due to changes of the characteristics in muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Radioligand receptor binding and in vitro autoradiographic studies of nasal mucosa in nonallergic (NA) and allergic patients were performed to investigate this hypothesis. The heterogeneous NA group was subdivided into control individuals and patients with chronic sinusitis and vasomotor rhinitis. The 3H-(-)-Quinuclidinylbenzilate binding to muscarinic receptors in human nasal mucosa membranes was saturable and of high affinity in all groups. No significant differences could be demonstrated between the subgroups of the NA patients. In allergic patients the dissociation constants and receptor densities were significantly decreased in comparison with those of NA and with those of control individuals. No differences in agonist binding or coupling of the muscarinic receptor to the effector system via the G protein could be observed in allergic patients. In vitro autoradiographic experiments demonstrated specific 3H-(-)-Quinuclidinylbenzilate labeling of the glandular acini in NA and allergic patients. No specific labeling could be observed in the epithelium, blood vessels, or connective tissue. In conclusion, the increased sensitivity and decreased muscarinic receptor number may reflect the cholinergic-induced hypersecretion in nasal allergy but are probably too small to explain the complex allergic reaction. 
1	The butterfly rash and the malar flush. What diseases do these signs reflect? The butterfly rash and malar flush are common facial manifestations of several disorders. Systemic lupus erythematosus may produce a transient rash before any other signs. In pellagra, symmetric keratotic areas on the face are always accompanied by lesions elsewhere on the body. Erysipelas produces brawny, fiery red facial lesions, and scarlet fever causes facial eruptions as part of a generalized eruption. Lupus vulgaris and lupus pernio produce nodules that may spread in a butterfly pattern, and seborrheic dermatitis has a predilection for the malar prominences and other areas of the face. Carcinoid syndrome often causes flushing attacks that vary in duration, and facial flushing that lasts throughout treatment may accompany chemotherapy if the patient has a hypersensitivity reaction. Deep-red rashes and/or lichenoid lesions may be caused by graft-versus-host disease in a patient undergoing bone marrow transplantation. 
5	Middle cerebral artery strokes causing homonymous hemianopia: positron emission tomography. Eight patients were evaluated with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography between 3 and 30 days after isolated stroke involving the middle cerebral artery territory that caused homonymous hemianopia. Diffuse hypometabolism was present throughout the damaged cerebral hemisphere, even in cortical areas not obviously ischemic by clinical examination or neuro-imaging. Glucose metabolism in primary and association visual cortex of the damaged hemisphere was decreased by more than 47% (p less than 0.01). Metabolism in the undamaged hemisphere was less profoundly affected, but significant decrements were found in calcarine (40%; p less than 0.01) and lateral occipital cortex (35%; p less than 0.05). 
5	Supraventricular tachycardia due to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in children: early disappearance and late recurrence The clinical course of 140 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who had their initial episode of supraventricular tachycardia before 18 years of age was reviewed. Among those whose tachycardia began at age 0 to 2 months, it disappeared in 93% and persisted in 7%. In 31%, it disappeared and reappeared at an average age of 8 years. Among patients whose tachycardia was present after age 5 years, it was persistent in 78% at a mean follow-up period of 7 years. Accessory connection location was mapped by electrophysiologic study in 87 patients and estimated by electrocardiography in 53 patients. There were no differences in tachycardia onset or recurrence based on accessory connection location. Congenital heart defects were present in 37% of all patients, 23% of whom had Ebstein's anomaly. Among all patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, 63% of those with a congenital heart defect had a rightsided accessory connection, whereas 61% of patients with a normal heart had a left-sided connection (p less than 0.01). Multiple accessory connections were found in 12% of patients with a congenital heart defect compared with 6% of those without such a defect. In conclusion: 1) supraventricular tachycardia due to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome that begins in infancy may disappear, but it frequently recurs in later childhood; 2) if tachycardia is present after age 5 years, it persists in greater than 75% of patients; and 3) the location of the accessory connection does not affect the clinical course of tachycardia in children with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. 
4	Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and electrocardiographic effects of intravenous verapamil with intravenous calcium chloride pretreatment in normal subjects. To evaluate the effects of calcium pretreatment on the disposition and electrocardiographic effects of verapamil, 8 healthy male volunteers received treatment in each of 3 phases in a randomized, double-blind, crossover manner. Phase I denoted 10 ml of 0.9% intravenous sodium chloride followed by 10 mg of intravenous verapamil; phase II denoted 10 ml of 10% intravenous calcium chloride followed by 4 ml of 0.9% intravenous sodium chloride; and phase III denoted 10 ml of 10% intravenous calcium chloride followed by 10 mg of intravenous verapamil. Blood samples for the determination of verapamil concentrations were drawn at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes, and at 2, 4, 6, 10 and 24 hours. Blood pressure, heart rate and PR intervals were also measured at these times. Pretreatment of verapamil with intravenous calcium did not alter the disposition of intravenous verapamil. Blood pressure was not significantly altered in any treatment phase, although calcium tended to increase mean arterial pressure and verapamil abolished this effect. Calcium had no significant affect on verapamil-induced PR prolongation (maximum percent change in PR interval: phase I = 19 +/- 11%, phase III = 18 +/- 7%; time to maximal prolongation: phase I = 0.38 +/- 0.21 hours, phase III = 0.37 +/- 0.26 hours; and area under the percent change in PR vs time curve: phase I = 15.5 +/- 10, phase III = 21 +/- 9). Verapamil caused a reflex increase in heart rate of similar magnitude in both phases I and III (24 +/- 10% and 21 +/- 7%, respectively). 
5	Early-onset dementia and extrapyramidal disease: clinicopathological variant of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker or Alzheimer's disease? A case of progressive dementia and extrapyramidal signs beginning at age 29, with a ten year course until death, is presented. Necropsy examination showed an assortment of plaque types (including striatal plaques), neurofibrillary tangles, granulovacuolar degeneration, and depigmentation of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus. This case had pathological features found in both Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease and in Alzheimer's disease. While somewhat similar to several other cases with features of both diseases, it differs in the presence of dystonia and striatal plaques. Although such cases may be difficult to categorize at present, they must be considered in the differential diagnosis of early onset dementia. 
5	Intra-abdominal abscesses in Crohn's disease. We reviewed 22 patients who had intra-abdominal abscesses secondary to Crohn's disease. A total of 29 abscesses were discovered. These included superficial and deep intraperitoneal as well as pelvic and retroperitoneal abscesses. Diagnosis was aided by ultrasound and computer tomographic scanning. Barium studies continue to play an important role in delineating the extent of bowel involvement and fistulization. Treatment varied depending on the location and size of the abscess. The need for ultimate bowel resection was determined in the majority of cases by the presence of fistulization between the abscess cavity and the bowel. The terminal ileum or neoterminal ileum were almost always involved. 
1	Hepatic resection for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with removal of portal vein tumor thrombi. In 13 of 398 patients who underwent hepatectomy, tumor thrombi of the remnant portal vein was concomitantly removed by the balloon catheter method in 8, an open method under hepatic vascular exclusion in 1, and resection of the occlusive portal segment followed by portal reconstruction in 4. In 8 of these patients the liver was cirrhotic. The mode of hepatectomy consisted of bisegmetectomy or trisegmentectomy in 11, segmentectomy in one, and partial resection in one patient. Two patients died of portal thrombosis or hepatic failure in the hospital. The mean survival in four patients was 12 months. Seven are still alive (mean, 16 months). In the corresponding period, nine patients with occlusive tumor thrombi of the portal confluence were hospitalized without operation and survived up to 4 months (mean, 64 days) after detection of the tumoral occlusion. The causes of death of the nine patients were bleeding esophageal varices, rupture of the tumor, or hepatic failure. It was revealed that removal of tumor thrombi in the remnant portal vein contributes to (1) portal decompression, (2) feasibility of arterial embolization, and (3) increase in resectability of the main tumor. At present, this procedure might be regarded as an emergency procedure for the avoidance of the above lethal impendence, but it may open the door to an adjuvant therapy. 
1	Rapid analysis of carcinoembryonic antigen levels in gallbladder bile. Identification of patients at high risk of colorectal liver metastasis Recently it was found that immunoanalysis of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in gallbladder bile may be a sensitive method to detect colorectal liver metastases in humans. Methods used in the past for the detection of CEA in various body fluids were cumbersome and time consuming, requiring acid extraction, extensive dialysis, and column purification. Single-step, solid-phase radioimmunoassays, designed specifically for serum CEA analysis, were developed commercially to replace these methods. Parameters and methodology necessary to adapt these kits for Parameters and methodology necessary to adapt these kits for use with gallbladder bile are presented here. A combination of pretreatment procedures for bile, before radioimmunoassay, permit rapid, reproducible, and accurate measurement of CEA levels in gallbladder bile. 
5	A long terminal repeat-containing retrotransposon is mobilized during hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis. A hybrid dysgenesis syndrome similar to those described in Drosophila melanogaster occurs in Drosophila virilis when a laboratory stock is crossed to a wild strain collected in the Batumi region of Georgia (U.S.S.R). Mutations in various loci obtained during these crosses are presumably induced by the insertion of DNA sequences. We have cloned an induced white mutation and characterized the insertion sequence responsible for the mutant phenotype. This sequence is a 10.6-kilobase (kb) transposable element we have named Ulysses. This element is flanked by unusually large 2.1-kb long terminal repeats. Ulysses also contains other landmarks characteristic of the retrotransposon family, such as a tRNA-binding site adjacent to the 5' long terminal repeat and open reading frames encoding putative products with homology to the reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase domains typical of proteins encoded by vertebrate retroviruses. Some of the mutations obtained do not contain a copy of the Ulysses element at the mutant locus, suggesting that a different transposable element may be responsible for the mutation. Therefore, Ulysses may not be the primary cause of the entire dysgenic syndrome, and its mobilization may be the result of activation by an independent mobile element. 
3	Clinical diagnostic considerations on cocaine abuse. Following a review of the research literature on the psychophysiological effects of cocaine, a study is described of a group of 120 cocaine addicts. Of the 120 patients, 10 (8.33%) exhibited fleeting, unformed, organic delusions and hallucinations. Case reports of the 10 cases are presented. The quality of the adverse subjective effects of cocaine is emphasized, and the differential diagnosis between Cocaine Delusional Disorder and Paranoid Schizophrenia is discussed. Guidelines for a more accurate differential diagnosis are provided. 
3	Community hospital carotid endarterectomy in patients over age 75. We compared the prevalence of stroke and death in 133 patients aged 75 and older in whom 170 carotid endarterectomies were performed with that in 501 patients less than age 75 in whom 640 carotid endarterectomies were performed. There were three strokes (2%) in patients aged 75 and older and nine strokes (1%) in younger patients (p = 0.7). There were 8 deaths (5%) in patients aged 75 and older and 14 deaths (2%) in younger patients (p = 0.1). After controlling for the possible confounding effects of diabetes, prior stroke, history of angina, prior carotid artery disease, previous vascular surgery, history of myocardial infarction, preoperative hypertension requiring medication, and female gender, a logistic regression model showed that patients aged 75 and older were no more likely to have a stroke or death than patients under age 75. We conclude that age alone is not a contraindication to the safe performance of carotid endarterectomy in the community hospital. 
5	Localization of stereotactic targets by microrecordings of thalamic somatosensory evoked potentials. To improve the localization of stereotactic targets, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded from the thalamus and subthalamic area using a specially designed semimicroelectrode in 61 patients and a conventional "macroelectrode" in 17 patients. By means of the semimicroelectrode, median nerve stimulation evoked two distinct SEPs, consisting of a diphasic wave with a huge positivity restricted to the nucleus ventrocaudalis (Vc) and a triphasic wave of lower amplitude with a major negativity in the ventral part of the nucleus ventrointermedius (Vim) and nucleus ventrooralis posterior (Vop) as well as the subthalamic lemniscal pathway. The Vim-Vc junction could thus be clearly delineated by an abrupt transition of SEPs from one type to the other with a precision of 1 mm. The parvicellular part of the Vc (Vcpc), situated in its basal region, was distinguishable from the Vc proper by a significant reduction of the positivity elicited by stimulation of the median nerve and by a rapid growth of a diphasic SEPs to stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve. In the other thalamic nuclei, stimulation of the median nerve elicited triphasic SEPs of a very small amplitude, suggesting a volume conduction current from the lemniscal pathway. With the macroelectrode, the positivity in the Vc was sensitive to electrode manipulation and the thalamic nuclei could not be distinctly outlined. SEP monitoring using the semimicroelectrode significantly improved the precision of target localization, which allowed minimizing of the volume of the therapeutic lesion without losing surgical effectiveness, while avoiding complications associated with increased penetration of the coagulating electrode. It is suggested that recording serial thalamic SEPs with the semimicroelectrode is a practical method to refine stereotactic targets in the thalamus. 
3	Acetazolamide-responsive vestibulocerebellar syndrome: clinical and oculographic features. Five patients who presented with long-standing episodic vertigo had ocular motor signs localizing to the vestibulocerebellum. In each patient, the episodic vertigo was either abolished or markedly decreased in frequency and severity with acetazolamide therapy. In 4, other family members had identical symptoms and signs. This syndrome is 1 of the few treatable causes of chronic episodic vertigo. 
1	Regulation of insulin, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor-alpha levels by growth factor-degrading enzymes. The mechanisms by which growth factors are degraded and the role this process plays in the regulation of cell growth are not well understood. Insulin degradation is believed to be mediated by a specific metalloprotease, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). We have previously shown that IDE can also degrade transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha), but not epidermal growth factor (EGF), in vitro. This selectivity was surprising, since TGF alpha and EGF are structurally similar and bind to the same receptor with comparable affinities. Using a spectrum of protease inhibitors, we have now analyzed the degradation of TGF alpha, EGF, and insulin by human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The results suggest that bacitracin-sensitive metalloproteases are involved in the degradation of TGF alpha and EGF as well as insulin, and that the degradation of TGF alpha, but not EGF, is mediated in part by IDE. Inhibiting the activity of these metalloproteases decreased growth factor depletion, suggesting that these enzymes play an important role in the control of extracellular growth factor levels. The existence of separate degradative pathways for EGF and TGF alpha may explain how the two factors exert differential effects in some systems, and degradation of TGF alpha by IDE would provide a possible mechanism for interaction between the insulin and TGF alpha/EGF signalling systems. 
1	In vitro anticolon antibody production by mucosal or peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with ulcerative colitis [published erratum appears in Gut 1991 Apr;32(4):460] Serum anticolon antibody and in vitro anti-colon antibody production by peripheral blood and mucosal lymphocytes was investigated in patients with ulcerative colitis. The frequency of serum anticolon antibody was 71% in 41 patients with ulcerative colitis, estimated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using isolated rat colon epithelial cells. This finding confirms our previous report on the frequency of serum anticolon antibody detected by flow cytometry analysis. The estimated frequencies of IgG anticolon antibody secreting cells were 1.5-12.5/10(6) cells in the colonic mucosa and 0.1-0.5/10(6) cells in peripheral blood, from patients with ulcerative colitis when Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was used as a B cell polyclonal activator. Poisson analysis of limiting dilution culture showed that about one per 140 IgG cells in the colonic mucosa synthesised anticolon antibody. Two monoclonal IgG antibodies were obtained from EBV transformed anticolon antibody secreting cells by limiting dilution method. One reacted with goblet cells in the intestine, and the other reacted mainly with colonic epithelial cells. These results suggest that heterogeneous anticolon antibodies are present in patients with ulcerative colitis and that colonic mucosa may be the main source of anticolon antibody. Local autoimmune reaction might have an important role in causing the inflammation of colonic mucosa in this disease. 
5	Intra-abdominal abscess in regional enteritis. Intra-abdominal abscess (IAA) developed in 129 of 610 patients (21.2%) with Crohn's disease confined to the small bowel. The location of the abscess was intraperitoneal (IPA) in 109 (17.9%) and retroperitoneal (RPA) in 20 (3.3%). There was a marked preponderance of male patients in the retroperitoneal group (ratio, 18:2) (p less than 0.0001). All 129 patients were operated on. Thirteen of one hundred nine patients (12%) with IPA were reoperated on for recurrent abscess, and nine (8.2%) for other reasons. External fistula developed in 24 patients (22%) after simple incision and drainage. Four (3.7%) died; one from hepatitis, and three from sepsis 5, 14, and 90 days after surgery. Of the 20 patients with RPA, two (10%) were reoperated on for recurrent abscess and four (20%) for other reasons. External fistula developed in two patients (10%). There were no deaths in this group. A small number of patients with IAA complicating regional enteritis had persistent sepsis causing postoperative death, which is, however, six times lower than in our comparable series of Crohn's (ileo)colitis. 
2	Hepatocyte expression of HBcAg and serum HBeAg in hepatitis B: comparison of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies during a trial of interferon. The distribution and quantitative expression of HBcAg in relation to serum HBeAg and liver histology before and after a trial of interferon in 50 patients with chronic type B hepatitis were evaluated using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. In general, both antisera showed a similar pattern in terms of the distribution of HBcAg, with predominant localisation of HBcAg in the cytoplasm in HBeAg positive patients with chronic active hepatitis. Semiquantitative analysis showed, however, that there was a higher degree of cytoplasmic expression of HBcAg with polyclonal than with monoclonal anti-HBc. Some of the HBeAg positive patients with only a focal expression of HBcAg in the cytoplasm by polyclonal anti-HBc showed no expression of HBcAg with monoclonal anti-HBc. The expression of HBcAg with polyclonal anti-HBc correlated better with the histological features of chronic active hepatitis or the persistence of serum HBeAg on follow up, suggesting that it did not result from non-specific or false positive staining. All of the HBeAg negative patients with minimal histological changes or inactive cirrhosis were HBcAg negative with both antisera. In conclusion, though both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies produced a quite similar distribution of HBcAg in patients with chronic type B hepatitis, polyclonal antibody seemed to be more sensitive in detecting HBcAg in the cytoplasm than did monoclonal anti-HBc, and the expression of HBcAg with polyclonal anti-HBc correlated better with the clinical and histological outcome. 
1	Surrogate receptor-mediated cellular cytotoxicity against malignant human glioma cells. A method for incorporating palmitate-derivatized antibody molecules into effector cells and the influence of these incorporated antibodies (surrogate receptors) on the lytic potential of peripheral blood lymphocytes is described. This surrogate receptor-mediated cellular cytotoxicity provides a means by which killer cells are directed specifically to the desired target glioma cells. The cytotoxic activity does not require the Fc region of the incorporated antibody molecules and shows more lytic potential than ordinary antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. By complement-mediated cell depletion and Percoll gradient separation, the effector cell populations for surrogate receptor-mediated cellular cytotoxicity are found to be natural killer cells, as in the murine system. This strategy of surrogate receptor incorporation into effector cells may provide not only valuable insights into the mechanism of cell-mediated cytotoxicity, but also a means of generating target-specific effector cells for clinical applications in neurosurgery. 
4	Transforming growth factor-beta activity in sheep lung lymph during the development of pulmonary hypertension. Chronic pulmonary hypertension is associated with extensive structural remodeling of the pulmonary arterial bed. The structural changes in the arterial walls include increased production of extracellular matrix components and smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, changes that have been similarly induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in culture. In the present study, experiments were performed to determine whether TGF-beta is present in sheep lung lymph, and whether TGF-beta levels were altered in an animal model of chronic pulmonary hypertension induced by continuous air embolization. Several standard biological assays for TGF-beta activity were used for these determinations including soft agar assays, inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation, and a TGF-beta-specific radioreceptor assay. In each case, control lung lymph contained high concentrations of TGF-beta (100 ng/ml) which required transient acidification for detection. Samples of lung lymph from hypertensive sheep showed a transient and early two- to threefold increase in concentrations of latent TGF-beta. This activity could be partially blocked by TGF-beta antibodies. These studies indicate that sheep lung lymph contains TGF-beta and that the level of TGF-beta increases early during the development of pulmonary hypertension. Thus, TGF-beta may contribute to the development of the structural changes in the pulmonary arteries that occur during the onset of chronic pulmonary hypertension. 
3	Effects of carotid denervation and decerebration on ventilatory response to CO. To clarify the mechanisms involved in the ventilatory response to the inhalation of low concentrations of CO (0.18-0.22% in air), the roles of the arterial chemoreceptors and the forebrain structures have been investigated in unanesthetized adult cats. The ventilatory response was observed in conscious animals intact, after carotid denervation (CD), and after midcollicular decerebration. The results show that the initial small ventilatory depression was unaffected by CD but that the subsequent characteristic tachypnea was blunted after CD even after more prolonged exposure to CO. The CO tachypnea was not observed after decerebration, but a residual hyperventilation was noted with the higher concentration used. It may be concluded that carotid chemoreceptors do not mediate the CO tachypnea, which may then originate in suprapontine structures as shown by comparison of intact and decerebrate animals. The blunting of the tachypnea after CD may be caused by the relative hypercapnia observed in CD animals. The residual hyperventilation observed in decerebrate animals may be caused by central acidosis and/or some peripheral potentiation of chemoreceptor activity resulting from the decrease in arterial blood pressure that accompanied CO inhalation in decerebrate animals. 
1	Immunohistochemical alterations in basement membrane components of squamous cell carcinoma. To investigate alterations in the basement membrane (BM) in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we investigated 20 tumors. Four had the cytologic characteristics of Bowen's disease (SCC-BD) and 16 did not have them (SCC-NB). Tumors were studied immunohistochemically by double immunofluorescent staining by using mouse monoclonal antibodies to the core protein of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and chondroitin 6-sulfate glycosaminoglycan (Ch6S) as well as rabbit antiserum to laminin (LN) and type IV collagen (C-4). In well-differentiated and highly keratinized SCC-NB, LN, C-4, and HSPG could be detected in the tumor nest BM and showed no loss of continuity, but they were largely lost in poorly differentiated and poorly keratinized SCC-NB. This suggests that poorly differentiated SCC-NB cause greater enzymatic degradation of BM components than well-differentiated SCC-NB. Ch6S was detected in parts of the BM of SCC-BD, but it was absent in all SCC-NB examined. It appears that SCC-NB have lost the ability to synthesize Ch6S, and that SCC-BD degrade Ch6S although they continue to produce it. Thus, it appears that in SCC the BM is qualitatively different from that of normal epidermis, and that SCC-BD can be distinguished from SCC-NB by the Ch6S content of the BM. 
1	Hyaluronan in pleural effusions and in serum. It has been suggested that a high level of hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HYA) in pleural fluid is an indicator of malignant mesothelioma. In 78 consecutive patients with pleural effusion of various causes the HYA concentration was measured in pleural fluid samples and in serum. Nine patients had malignant pleural mesothelioma, and in three of them the HYA level in pleural fluid was 100 mg/l or more. In 42 patients with effusions due to metastatic malignancy, the mean HYA in the pleural fluid was 75 mg/l, and in five the HYA level was above 100 mg/l. Cardiac insufficiency caused the effusion in 11 patients, of whom two had a level above 100 mg/l in pleural fluid. Four patients had a serologically confirmed viral infection and had HYA levels in pleural fluid of 8, 157, 335, and 554 mg/l, respectively. One patient had postinfectious effusion with an HYA level in pleural exudate of 748 mg/l, the highest in this investigation. Two patients had benign asbestos pleural effusions, and both had high pleural HYA levels (256 and 490 mg/l, respectively). The serum HYA values were much lower than in the pleural fluid, namely from 15 to 480 micrograms/l; the levels were independent of the levels in the pleural fluid. Thus, a high level of HYA in pleural fluid is not specific for mesothelioma but can occur in other malignant or benign diseases, and a low level does not exclude mesothelioma. 
5	Detrusor hyper-reflexia as a factor in spontaneous perforation of augmentation cystoplasty for neuropathic bladder. In a series of 30 children undergoing cystoplasty for neuropathic bladder, 14 had a combination of a competent sphincteric mechanism and detrusor hyper-reflexia. All 3 cases of spontaneous perforation of the augmentation occurred within this latter group and it is postulated that excessive intravesical pressure due to high pressure hyper-reflexia was the causal factor. Strategies to reduce the risk of perforation are discussed. 
5	The effect of alcohol in isolated blunt splenic trauma. The effect of alcohol on trauma patients is controversial, with numerous authors citing no difference in mortality in acutely intoxicated patients. The purpose of our study was to retrospectively investigate the effect of alcohol in adult patients with isolated blunt splenic injury. From 1980 through 1989, 47 adult patients with splenic trauma as the only major injury were admitted to the Trauma Service. There were 37 males and ten females with a mean age of 29 years (range, 15 to 61). Motor vehicle accidents were responsible for 44 (94%) of the injuries. Group 1 consisted of 24 patients with a mean blood alcohol level of 185 mg/dl (range, 15 to 380). In Group 2 there were 23 patients without detectable blood alcohol. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in age, Abbreviated Injury Severity Score, initial hematocrit, and grade of splenic injury. Hypotension was present in 13 patients (55%) in Group 1 versus six patients (26%) in Group 2 (p less than 0.05). Significant abnormalities in clotting studies were present on admission in six patients (25%) in the alcohol-detected group versus one in the other group (p less than 0.05). Blood transfusion requirements in the first 24 hours were significantly greater in Group 1 (mean, 3.9 units) versus Group 2 (mean, 0.5 units) (p less than 0.001). If alcohol was present, there was much less chance for splenic conservation, as 18 patients (75%) underwent splenectomy versus seven patients (30%) in the nonalcohol group (p less than 0.05). There was one death and this occurred in a patient acutely intoxicated who suffered a cerebral infarct. 
2	Approaches to the patient with aspiration and swallowing disabilities. Aspiration, or soiling of the tracheobronchial tree, can produce life-threatening pulmonary disease. Intermittent or persistent aspiration may cause symptoms including cough, intermittent fever, recurrent tracheobronchitis, atelectasis, pneumonia, and/or empyema. The pulmonary disease may be associated with weight loss, cachexia, and dehydration. In many cases the aspiration is caused by laryngeal dysfunction, allowing pulmonary contamination by swallowed material. In other cases the aspiration is caused by a dysfunction of the oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal phases of swallowing. In some cases the aspiration is caused by a combination of laryngeal and swallowing dysfunction. Geriatric patients are more likely to experience aspiration, since muscle weakness causing mechanical disability and neurologic impairment are more common in this age group. Therefore, with the ever-increasing aging of our population, these disabilities will be on the rise, with an associated increase in pulmonary disease and death. The approach to evaluation and management of these disorders must be based on an understanding of the underlying functional impairment. 
2	Exacerbation of chronic active hepatitis type B after short-term corticosteroid therapy resulting in fatal liver failure. The case of a 36-yr-old male with chronic active type B hepatitis in whom 4-wk prednisone therapy resulted in prolonged and fatal exacerbation of liver disease is described. Thus, short-term corticosteroid therapy may in some patients have disastrous effects on the course of chronic active hepatitis B. 
4	Serum sialic acid concentration and cardiovascular mortality OBJECTIVE--To determine whether serum sialic acid concentration may be used to predict short and long term cardiovascular mortality. DESIGN--Prospective study on all men and women who had their serum sialic acid concentration measured as part of a general health survey in 1964 or in 1965. All were followed up for an average of 20.5 years. SETTING--Geographical part of the county of Varmland, Sweden. SUBJECTS--Residents in the area participating in a health check up in 1964-5 (27,065 men and 28,037 women), of whom 372 men (169 with incomplete data and 203 lost to follow up) and 345 women (143 and 202 respectively) were excluded; thus 26,693 men and 27,692 women entered the study. The study sample was restricted to subjects aged 40-74 during any of the 20 years' follow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Serum sialic acid concentration, serum cholesterol concentration, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index at the general health survey visit; cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular deaths during three periods of follow up (0-6 years, 7-13 years, and 14-20 years), according to the Swedish mortality register, in subjects aged 45-74. RESULTS--Mean serum sialic acid concentration (mg/100 ml) was 68.8 (SD 8.0) for men and 69.2 (8.0) for women; the average concentration increasing with age in both sexes. A total of 5639 (21%) men and 3307 (12%) women died during the follow up period, in whom death in 3052 (54%) men and 1368 (41%) women was from cardiovascular causes. During short (0-6 years), medium (7-13 years), and long (14-20 years) term follow up the relative risk of death from cardiovascular disease increased with increasing serum sialic acid concentration. The relative risk (95% confidence interval) associated with the highest quartile of sialic acid concentration compared with the lowest quartile was 2.38 (2.01 to 2.83) in men and 2.62 (1.93 to 3.57) in women. Similar results were found for deaths from non-cardiovascular disease with relative risks of 1.50 (1.34 to 2.68) in men and 1.89 (1.57 to 2.28) in women, but these relative risks were significantly lower than those for deaths from cardiovascular disease (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.005 respectively). In multivariate analysis of total mortality and of cardiovascular mortality with sialic acid concentration, serum cholesterol concentration, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index as independent variables the impact of sialic acid concentration was virtually the same as in univariate analysis. CONCLUSION--Serum sialic acid concentration is a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality. A possible explanation of these findings is that the serum sialic acid concentration may reflect the existence or the activity of an atherosclerotic process, and this may warrant further investigation. 
4	Frequency and significance of occult late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram in sustained ventricular tachycardia after healing of acute myocardial infarction. The quantitative and morphologic characteristics and significance of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiographic QRS complex remain unknown. To assess this, the signal-averaged electrocardiogram of 48 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation 62 +/- 9 years) with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) after healing of acute myocardial infarction and late potentials were analyzed. Late potentials could be classified into 3 morphologic subtypes: type I late potentials (19 patients, 40%) occurred in the terminal 40 ms of the QRS complex; type II late potentials (16 patients, 33%) started before the end of the QRS complex and extended 30 +/- 17 ms into the ST segment; type III late potentials (13 patients, 27%) started after the end of the QRS complex in the ST segment and ended 67 +/- 27 ms after the end of the QRS complex. The amplitude of the late potentials in type III, when compared with types I and II, was significantly lower, whereas the QRS duration on the electrocardiogram in type I, when compared with types II and III, was significantly longer. Computer algorithm based on noise failed to identify most type III late potentials. No difference was noted in age, sex, site of the myocardial infarction, and rate of induced VT among the 3 types. 
5	The nature of adverse events in hospitalized patients. Results of the Harvard Medical Practice Study II. BACKGROUND. In a sample of 30,195 randomly selected hospital records, we identified 1133 patients (3.7 percent) with disabling injuries caused by medical treatment. We report here an analysis of these adverse events and their relation to error, negligence, and disability. METHODS. Two physician-reviewers independently identified the adverse events and evaluated them with respect to negligence, errors in management, and extent of disability. One of the authors classified each event according to type of injury. We tested the significance of differences in rates of negligence and disability among categories with at least 30 adverse events. RESULTS. Drug complications were the most common type of adverse event (19 percent), followed by wound infections (14 percent) and technical complications (13 percent). Nearly half the adverse events (48 percent) were associated with an operation. Adverse events during surgery were less likely to be caused by negligence (17 percent) than nonsurgical ones (37 percent). The proportion of adverse events due to negligence was highest for diagnostic mishaps (75 percent), noninvasive therapeutic mishaps ("errors of omission") (77 percent), and events occurring in the emergency room (70 percent). Errors in management were identified for 58 percent of the adverse events, among which nearly half were attributed to negligence. CONCLUSIONS. Although the prevention of many adverse events must await improvements in medical knowledge, the high proportion that are due to management errors suggests that many others are potentially preventable now. Reducing the incidence of these events will require identifying their causes and developing methods to prevent error or reduce its effects. 
1	Excision repair of pyrimidine dimers induced by simulated solar radiation in the skin of patients with basal cell carcinoma. One prominent lesion induced in DNA by ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimer formed between adjacent pyrimidines on the same DNA strand. We investigated whether people who have developed basal cell carcinoma on sun-exposed skin have an altered ability to repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in DNA. Twenty-two patients with at least one basal cell carcinoma, aged 31-84 years, and 19 healthy volunteers, aged 25-61 years, took part in the study. Both groups were given one minimal erythema dose (MED) of simulated solar radiation on the lower back. DNA was extracted from the irradiated skin 0 to 6 h later, and the number of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers was determined using a dimer-specific endonuclease. At time 0, the average number of dimers per unit of DNA was similar in the two groups. After 6 h, an average of 22 +/- 4% of the dimers were removed in the group with basal cell carcinoma compared to 33 +/- 4% in the cancer-free group. In the basal cell carcinoma group, only 23% of the patients repaired more than 30% of the dimers after 6 h, compared with 53% of the cancer-free subjects (p less than 0.05). We conclude that patients who develop basal cell carcinoma on sun-exposed skin may have a decreased ability to repair pyrimidine dimers induced in skin exposed to simulated solar radiation. 
5	Reoperation for small intestinal obstruction. Today, intestinal adhesions represent the most frequent etiology for complete or partial intestinal obstruction. Although partial obstruction can be treated nonoperatively with a considerable likelihood of success, intestinal strangulation cannot uniformly be predicted or prevented. Complete intestinal obstruction is associated with a significant incidence of strangulation if not treated by a vigorous surgical approach. Consequently, complete intestinal obstruction secondary to adhesions is still a surgical disease. Attempts at control of the adhesion process include mechanical methods to prevent subsequent obstruction and chemical methods to prevent the adhesion process itself. The invasive mechanical methods appear dated. A variety of agents have been used either systemically or in the peritoneal cavity to prevent the establishment of intra-abdominal adhesions. Agents that do not contribute to subsequent morbidity or impede the native host defense mechanisms should be utilized. High-molecular-weight dextran and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents show some promise of being both safe and effective. As is frequently the case, the bottom line in preventing and treating intra-abdominal adhesions is appropriate surgical technique. Intestinal adhesions can be related clearly to leaving damaged, devitalized, or ischemic tissue in the peritoneal cavity or to excessive roughness in handling of tissues. Steps such as avoidance of excessive suture material and unnecessary handling of the bowel will do much to prevent subsequent adhesion generation. Likewise, the surgical lysis of intraperitoneal adhesions is frequently fraught with complications such as intra-abdominal abscess or postoperative incisional failure. This is again related to surgical technique and most directly to the use of blunt dissection to divide adhesions. Knife dissection in the lysis of adhesions is recommended. This technique, combined with excellent intraoperative hemostasis, can be associated with a marked diminution in the incidence of postoperative fistulas and abscesses. 
4	Postinfarction ventricular septal defect repair: retrospective thoughts and historical perspectives. Evolution of surgical techniques for repair of postinfarction ventricular septal rupture initially involved differentiation of these lesions from prior experience with surgical approaches to congenital ventricular septal defects, which were in the main not applicable. Second, understanding of the differing anatomical locations of postinfarction ventricular septal defects required innovation in terms of the location of the cardiotomy and type of repair necessary to achieve a successful result in any given patient. The gradual appreciation of different clinical courses pursued by patients after postinfarction ventricular septal rupture both in terms of location of the defect and the degree of right ventricular functional impairment has led to increased urgency relative to the timing of surgical repair. The incorporation of specific anatomical concepts of surgical repair and better understanding of the time course of physiological deterioration of patients can ultimately lead to an integrated approach aimed toward improved salvage of patients suffering this catastrophic complication of acute myocardial infarction. 
3	Neuroacanthocytosis. A clinical, haematological and pathological study of 19 cases. Nineteen cases are described, including 12 cases from three different families and 7 nonfamilial cases, in which multisystem neurological disease was associated with acanthocytosis in peripheral blood and normal plasma lipoproteins. Mild acanthocytosis can easily be overlooked, and scanning electron microscopy may be helpful. Some neurologically asymptomatic relatives with significant acanthocytosis were identified during family screening, including some who were clinically affected. The mean age of onset was 32 (range 8-62) yrs and the clinical course was usually progressive but there was marked phenotypic variation. Cognitive impairment, psychiatric features and organic personality change occurred in over half the cases, and more than one-third had seizures. Orofaciolingual involuntary movements and pseudobulbar disturbance commonly caused dysphagia and dysarthria that was sometimes severe, but biting of the lips or tongue was rarely seen. Chorea was seen in almost all symptomatic cases but dystonia, tics, involuntary vocalizations and akinetic-rigid features also occurred. Two cases had no movement disorder at all. Computerized tomography often demonstrated cerebral atrophy. Caudate atrophy was seen less commonly, and nonspecific focal and symmetric signal abnormalities from the caudate or lentiform nuclei were seen by magnetic resonance imaging in 3 out of 4 cases. Depression or absence of tendon reflexes was noted in 13 cases and neurophysiological abnormalities often indicated an axonal neuropathy. Sural nerve biopsies from 3 cases showed evidence of a chronic axonal neuropathy with prominent regenerative activity, predominantly affecting the large diameter myelinated fibres. Serum creatine kinase activity was increased in 11 cases but without clinical evidence of a myopathy. Postmortem neuropathological examination in 1 case revealed extensive neuronal loss and gliosis affecting the corpus striatum, pallidum, and the substantia nigra, especially the pars reticulata. The cerebral cortex appeared spared and the spinal cord showed no evidence of anterior horn cell loss. Two examples of the McLeod phenotype, an X-linked abnormality of expression of Kell blood group antigens, were identified in a single family and included 1 female. The genetics of neuroacanthocytosis are unclear and probably heterogeneous, but the available pedigree data and the association with the McLeod phenotype suggest that there may be a locus for this disorder on the short arm of the X chromosome. 
5	Periprosthetic chronic inflammation characterized through the measurement of superoxide anion production by synovial-derived macrophages. Periprosthetic macrophages were isolated from the synovium of primary and revision arthroplasty patients. Inflammatory activity was determined by the level of superoxide (O2-) production de novo and in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation. Nonstimulated primary arthroplasty-derived macrophages produced 2.54 +/- 2.04 pmoles of O2-/minute/10(5) cells. When identical reaction tubes were stimulated with PMA, O2- levels increased to 5.76 +/- 3.77 pmol of O2-/minute/10(5) cells. Nonstimulated revision arthroplasty-derived macrophages produced 3.26 +/- 2.02 pmol of O2-/minute/10(5) cells during this ten-minute time period. When identical reaction tubes were stimulated with PMA, O2- levels increased to 3.98 +/- 2.52 pmol of O2-/minute/10(5) cells. The difference in the ratio of O2- production in response to stimulation between primary and revision groups was statistically significant. The observation of a chronic moderate level of activation and the lack of responsiveness to a potent stimulator suggests that macrophage inflammatory activity is down-regulated in periprosthetic synovium. 
5	Have changing treatment patterns affected outcome for operable breast cancer? Ten-year follow-up in 1288 patients, 1965 to 1978. From 1965 to 1978, 1288 patients with primary operable breast cancer were treated by the senior author, using extended radical (ERM), radical (RM), and modified radical (MRM) mastectomy operations exclusively. Results were analyzed for trends in overall and disease-free survival, and patterns of local and distant relapse, the years 1965 to 1970 versus 1971 to 1974 versus 1975 to 1978. Significant changes (p less than 0.00001) from 1965 to 1978 included progressively earlier stage of disease, less frequent use of RM and ERM, a decline in the use of postoperative radiotherapy, and the introduction in 1975 of multidrug adjuvant chemotherapy. Ten-year disease-free survival rates improved significantly for all patients (by 11%, p = 0.00004) and for node-negative (by 12%, p = 0.0024), node-positive (by 8%, p = 0.012), clinical stage II (by 15%, p = 0.0022), and pathologic stage II (by 12%, p = 0.016) disease. Ten-year local recurrence for all patients was 3% (local only) and 2% (local with distant metastasis), and survival from date of recurrence for all patients failing treatment increased two times (p less than 0.0001) for patients treated most recently. As the primary surgical treatment of breast cancer continues to become more moderate, the promise of systemic adjuvant therapies can be realized only with continued emphasis on earlier diagnosis and maximal local control of disease. 
5	Use of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements to show clonal lymphoproliferation in hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly In Africa, hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS), which is also known as tropical splenomegaly syndrome, can be associated with a prominent lymphocytosis in blood and bone marrow that is difficult to distinguish clinically from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). The observation that some patients with HMS become resistant to treatment with anti-malarial drugs has led to the suggestion that HMS may evolve into a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder. To test this hypothesis, 22 Ghanaian patients with HMS and/or lymphocytosis were categorised by degree of response to proguanil according to standard clinical criteria, and DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells and screened for rearrangements of the Jh region of the immunoglobulin gene with a DNA probe. Clonal rearrangements of the Jh region were found in all 3 patients with no response, in none of 13 patients with sustained response, and in 2 of 6 patients with moderate response or relapse on proguanil therapy. The detection of such rearrangements, and hence clonal lymphoproliferation in individuals with clinical features intermediate between HMS and CLL, supports the hypothesis that HMS may evolve into a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder. 
4	Results of vein graft reconstruction of the lower extremity in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The results of 171 vein grafts of the lower extremity were evaluated. These were placed between January 1981 and December 1987 in 150 patients, 75 diabetic and 75 nondiabetic, to determine the influence of diabetes on the outcome of the procedure. One and four year patency rates were determined by a life table analysis. No statistical differences in primary patency were found between the patients with diabetes and those without diabetes for all indications of operations (one year, diabetic patients 95 +/- 3 per cent, nondiabetic patients 85 +/- 3 per cent; four years, diabetic patients 89 +/- 11 per cent and nondiabetic patients 80 +/- 12 per cent; p = n.s.). For those operated upon for salvage of the limb because of rest pain, ulceration or gangrene, patency in diabetic patients at one year approached a statistically significant advantage (diabetic patients 94 +/- 4 per cent versus nondiabetic patients 79 +/- 8 per cent; p = 0.056). We believe that arterial reconstruction of the lower extremity can be performed upon patients with diabetes with the same high degree of success for revascularization and salvage of the limb as can be accomplished in nondiabetic patients. This is true even though those with diabetes present with necrosis of the tissue and more often require bypass to distal tibial arteries. 
5	Evolution of fundic argyrophil cell hyperplasia in nonantral atrophic gastritis. Fundic argyrophil cells were studied for a mean period of 68.7 months (range, 11-170) in 18 patients with fundic atrophic gastritis and achlorhydria. Initially, 12 patients had hyperplasia of the argyrophil cells, the severity of which was assessed using a semiquantitative classification based on the number of argyrophil clusters per square millimeter. At the end of the study, the degree of hyperplasia was unchanged in 9 patients, had decreased in 2, and had increased in 1; no significant increase in the number of argyrophil clusters, precarcinoid changes, or carcinoid tumors were observed and the high level of gastrinemia [mean, 4.8 (range, 1.9-8.1) times the upper limit for normal) did not change significantly. Of the 6 patients with no hyperplasia at the outset of the study, 4 continued without hyperplasia and 2 presented a low-grade hyperplasia at the 20th and 130th month. Gastrinemia increased significantly in the last patient and stayed normal in the other 5. This study argues in favor of the stable appearance of fundic argyrophil cells in patients with atrophic gastritis and stable gastrinemia. 
3	Probability of stroke: a risk profile from the Framingham Study. A health risk appraisal function has been developed for the prediction of stroke using the Framingham Study cohort. The stroke risk factors included in the profile are age, systolic blood pressure, the use of antihypertensive therapy, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, prior cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, cardiac failure, or intermittent claudication), atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram. Based on 472 stroke events occurring during 10 years' follow-up from biennial examinations 9 and 14, stroke probabilities were computed using the Cox proportional hazards model for each sex based on a point system. On the basis of the risk factors in the profile, which can be readily determined on routine physical examination in a physician's office, stroke risk can be estimated. An individual's risk can be related to the average risk of stroke for persons of the same age and sex. The information that one's risk of stroke is several times higher than average may provide the impetus for risk factor modification. It may also help to identify persons at substantially increased stroke risk resulting from borderline levels of multiple risk factors such as those with mild or borderline hypertension and facilitate multifactorial risk factor modification. 
3	A clinicopathological study of the paraneoplastic neuromuscular syndromes associated with lung cancer. The highest incidence of remote neuromuscular disorders in cancer has previously been reported in lung carcinoma. The clinical incidence of neuromuscular disorder was estimated and correlated with muscle histology and the histological type of lung tumour in 100 patients with lung carcinoma who were studied prospectively. Thirty-five patients had small cell carcinoma and 65 patients non-small cell lung cancer. Clinically, 33 patients had a polymyopathy, of whom 18 had a cachectic myopathy and 15 had a proximal myopathy (two patients had Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, one presented with dermatomyositis and one had evidence of ectopic ACTH production). Cachexia was more common in non-small cell cancer; proximal myopathy was more common in small cell cancer. Ninety-nine patients had abnormal muscle histology; 74 had type II atrophy, 12 had type I and II atrophy, one had type I atrophy and 12 had necrosis. The majority of patients were affected sub-clinically and the clinical entities of cachectic and proximal myopathy did not correspond to previous pathological classifications. Atrophy was not related to the duration of tumour symptoms, ageing, clinical type of myopathy or histological type of lung tumour, and was statistically different from that seen in controls. Qualitatively, the presence of weight loss, muscle wasting and metastatic disease were not factors in the development of atrophy. Similarly, necrosis was not related to the type of lung tumour, the presence of metastases, ageing, weight loss, muscle wasting, duration of tumour symptoms or the clinical form of myopathy. This study demonstrates that lung carcinoma has a direct effect on the motor unit, including atrophy, a necrobiotic myopathy and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Clinical assessment does not accurately assess the 'remote' neuromuscular effects of cancer on the motor unit. 
4	Midterm surgical results of arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries with intact septum. Between April 4, 1984, and December 31, 1987, 156 consecutive neonates with simple transposition of the great arteries underwent an arterial switch operation (ASO) at our institution. Surgery was performed before the age of 15 days in 96%, and patient weight was less than 3 kg in 28%. Seventeen patients (10.9%) died after surgery. One patient was lost to follow-up. Of the 138 survivors, two died of myocardial infarction 35 and 40 days, respectively, after surgery. They were the only late deaths, and actuarial survival rates were 87% (70% confidence level [CL], 83-89%) at 45 days and 87% (70% CL, 68-95%) at 52 months. Another patient had a myocardial infarction 50 days after surgery and is well 50 months later. Pulmonary stenosis was observed in 14 patients (10.3%) during the first year after surgery; two patients were reoperated on 10 and 12 months, respectively, after ASO. Aortic regurgitation was observed in 17 patients: two had grades II and III, respectively, aortic regurgitation on aortography; in 15 patients, it was detected only by Doppler examination. At the last follow-up (2-52 months after ASO; mean, 27.3 +/- 11.3 months), all patients were asymptomatic and taking no medication. On bidimensional echocardiography, left ventricular fractional shortening was normal at rest in all survivors but one. One patient had junctional rhythm, and one had Wenckebach periods; the remainder were in sinus rhythm. For as long as 5 years after ASO, late death and reintervention were rare; 99% of the survivors were asymptomatic and had sinus rhythm and good systemic ventricular function. 
1	Social support and the cancer patient. Implications for future research and clinical care. This review assesses past progress, current practices, and future needs in research and clinical practice involving the social support needs of cancer patients. A review is given of the various conceptualizations of the social support/stress paradigm and of the state of the art of measuring social support. Then the current work in the field of social support and cancer is considered and an argument is made for the use of social support measures, which are relevant to the experiences of the cancer patient. Potential adaptations of an existing instrument (the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Scale) are demonstrated, and a taxonomy of stages of cancer that would require additional types of social support measures and interventions is outlined. Interventions are discussed in terms of the traditional support groups as well as interventions by the oncologist and primary care physician. An argument is made for the inclusion of quality of life or functional measures as outcomes in clinical trials and the care of the cancer patient. Finally, the need to address the existential, philosophic, or religious issues surrounding cancer and its treatment is discussed. 
3	Granulocytic sarcoma presenting as an epidural mass with acute paraparesis in an aleukemic patient. Granulocytic sarcomas are rare tumors composed of granulocytic precursor cells. They are most commonly encountered in patients with acute myelogenous leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders in blast crisis. Rarely, patients presenting with granulocytic sarcoma show no evidence of acute leukemia. The authors report an aleukemic patient with acute paraparesis from an epidural granulocytic sarcoma. Only five such cases have been reported previously. Immunoperoxidase stain for lysozyme and chloroacetate esterase stain were used to prove the myeloid origin of the tumor cells. 
4	Serial ultrasonographic evaluation of neonatal vein of Galen malformations to assess the efficacy of interventional neuroradiological procedures. Two-dimensional echocardiography complemented with color-flow imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasound was used to evaluate one fetus and five neonates with a vein of Galen malformation who had severe high-output congestive heart failure and cranial bruits at birth. Intracranial blood flow through the vein of Galen malformations, cardiac status, and direction of aortic blood flow were assessed before and after staged interventional neuroradiological treatment with transarterial and transvenous embolization procedures. Color-flow imaging in each infant displayed the major vascular anatomy including feeding vessels and the patterns of filling of the vein of Galen malformations. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound performed on the descending aorta above the diaphragm showed the degree of diastolic flow reversal indicative of runoff into the vein of Galen malformations. A reduction in blood flow through the vein of Galen malformation was seen on color-flow imaging in four patients treated successfully by embolic procedures. The ratio of diastolic retrograde flow velocity in the descending aorta to systolic antegrade velocity decreased from 0.51 +/- 0.15 (mean +/- standard deviation) to 0.15 +/- 0.20 (P less than 0.05). Color-flow imaging and pulsed Doppler ultrasonography provided anatomical and pathophysiological information regarding cardiac hemodynamics and intracranial blood flow; with the patient's clinical status, these methods provided a reliable, noninvasive means to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy and the need for further treatment in neonates with vein of Galen malformations. 
4	Association of perioperative myocardial ischemia with cardiac morbidity and mortality in men undergoing noncardiac surgery. The Study of Perioperative Ischemia Research Group BACKGROUND. Adverse cardiac events are a major cause of morbidity and mortality after noncardiac surgery. It is necessary to determine the predictors of these outcomes in order to focus efforts on prevention and treatment. Patients undergoing noncardiac surgery sometimes have postoperative cardiac events. It would be helpful to know which patients are at highest risk. METHODS. We prospectively studied 474 men with coronary artery disease (243) or at high risk for it (231) who were undergoing elective noncardiac surgery. We gathered historical, clinical, laboratory, and physiologic data during hospitalization and for 6 to 24 months after surgery. Myocardial ischemia was assessed by continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, beginning two days before surgery and continuing for two days after. RESULTS. Eighty-three patients (18 percent) had postoperative cardiac events in the hospital that were classified as ischemic events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina) (15 patients), congestive heart failure (30), or ventricular tachycardia (38). Postoperative myocardial ischemia occurred in 41 percent of the monitored patients and was associated with a 2.8-fold increase in the odds of all adverse cardiac outcomes (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.9; P less than 0.0002) and a 9.2-fold increase in the odds of an ischemic event (95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 42.0; P less than 0.004). Multivariate analysis showed no other clinical, historical, or perioperative variable to be independently associated with ischemic events, including cardiac-risk index, a history of previous myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, or the occurrence of ischemia before or during surgery. CONCLUSIONS. In high-risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, early postoperative myocardial ischemia is an important correlate of adverse cardiac outcomes. 
2	Proximal gastric vagotomy in the emergency treatment of bleeding duodenal ulcer. Proximal gastric vagotomy for bleeding duodenal ulcer was performed in 52 low-risk patients between 1973 and 1986. Duodenotomy without violation of the pylorus was done in all patients to allow inspection and control of the bleeding site. The median duration of operation was 3 hours and 20 minutes, although 25% of the procedures required 4 or more hours. There was no postoperative mortality and no early reoperations. Among the six patients with postoperative complications, one rebled from the ulcer and two developed prolonged gastric atony. At the time of follow-up (median, 2.9 years), 48 of the patients were alive and 4 had died of non-ulcer causes. No patient had significant postvagotomy sequelae. Ulcer recurrence was documented in six patients, and three required reoperation. Proximal gastric vagotomy is a safe, effective therapy for bleeding duodenal ulcer. Because of the length of the operation, it should be restricted to low-risk patients who are hemodynamically stable at the time of operation. 
2	Esophageal motility, heartburn, and gastroesophageal reflux: variations in clinical presentation of esophageal dysphagia. Dysphagia is a potentially important symptom, often leading to the finding of an anatomical or motility disorder of the esophagus. Dysphagia and heartburn represent two of the most common symptoms associated with esophageal motility disorders. To explore the relationship of symptomatic esophageal dysphagia and heartburn and their association with primary esophageal motor disorders, we have performed a retrospective assessment of 1035 patient evaluations performed at our gastrointestinal laboratory. A clear statistical association of symptomatic dysphagia and heartburn was established; however, no pattern diagnostic of a specific motility disorder was discernible. A sizable fraction of our patient population with dysphagia demonstrated normal esophageal motility. A significant portion of dyspeptic patients exhibited both normal motility and acid exposure. The differences observed between the incidence of subjective symptoms and objective dysfunction may be explained in part by an altered or increased esophageal sensitivity of these patients. 
5	Growth disturbance in Legg-Calve-Perthes disease and the consequences of surgical treatment. Seventy-two patients with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease were studied to assess the interference with proximal femoral growth as a result of the disease itself and of surgical treatment. Twenty-five patients were treated nonoperatively, 20 were treated by femoral varus derotation osteotomy, and 27 by innominate osteotomy. All patients were studied clinically for evidence of abductor weakness and leg-length discrepancy. They were also studied roentgenographically for evidence of femoral head deformity and trochanteric overgrowth. The overall results showed a 6% incidence of leg-length discrepancy greater than 2 cm after both operative and nonoperative treatment. The articulo-trochanteric distance (ATD) was less than +5 mm in 23% of patients, of which 43% had a positive Trendelenburg sign. A significantly lower mean ATD was found in patients treated by femoral varus osteotomy, which should be avoided in patients over eight years of age. The study also demonstrated a strong association between coxa magna and growth disturbance of the proximal femoral physis manifesting itself as either a leg-length discrepancy or as a low ATD. The significant effects of growth disturbance after treatment must be considered, as well as the sphericity of the healed femoral head, in the final assessment in Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. 
3	Delayed hearing loss after neurovascular decompression. We report two unusual cases of delayed hearing loss after neurovascular decompression of structures within the cerebellopontine angle. In the first case, the patient noted a unilateral hearing loss 3 weeks after undergoing vascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve for tic douloureux. This gradually improved over an 18-month period. In the second case, the patient awoke on the 4th day after vascular decompression of the facial nerve for hemifacial spasm with a bilateral hearing loss that has remained unchanged after the onset. These are examples of delayed acoustic dysfunction occurring with a shift in surgically freed vessels and may have been induced by newly directed neurovascular compression or distortion. 
5	Complications of flaps. Flaps are susceptible to the same complications as side-to-side closures. However, as the blood supply to a flap is more precarious, the complication may have a more dire effect. This article catalogues the various acute complications with an emphasis on early recognition and management. 
2	Pathological observations of intrahepatic peribiliary glands in 1,000 consecutive autopsy livers. III. Survey of necroinflammation and cystic dilatation. Pathological changes and significance of intrahepatic peribiliary glands, hitherto poorly recognized intrahepatic elements, have been evaluated in our laboratory. In this report, we surveyed necroinflammatory and cystic changes of the peribiliary glands in 1,000 consecutive autopsy livers because these two changes coexisted frequently in the same liver. The necroinflammatory change was found in 228 livers (22.8%) and the cystic change in 202 livers (20.2%), and 103 cases showed both changes in the same liver. The necroinflammatory change was frequently found in intrahepatic cholangitis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction with bacterial infection, suggesting that biliary bacterial inflammation extends into these peribilary glands. This change was also frequent in systemic infection or septicemia without biliary bacterial infection, implying that the peribiliary glands were also damaged in such conditions without direct infection. The cystic change was frequent in livers with portal hypertension or obstruction, adult polycystic disease and necroinflammation of the glands, suggesting that the cystic change of the glands could occur as the result of the disturbance of intrahepatic circulation or as the result of inflammatory destruction of the glandular conduits. Some of peribiliary cysts may be of congenital origin. Dysfunction related to these pathological changes in the glands may diminish seromucous secretion and cause alterations in hepatic bile composition. The cystic change of the glands may retard bile flow by compressing bile duct lumina. 
1	A new monoclonal antibody (CH-F42) recognizes a CD7- subset of normal T lymphocytes and circulating malignant cells in adult T-cell lymphoma-leukemia and Sezary syndrome. We describe a new rat immunoglobulin M monoclonal antibody (CH-F42) that recognizes a subset (1.5% to 8%) of normal peripheral blood T lymphocytes. The phenotype of these cells was determined, using dual-color immunofluorescence, to be CD2+, CD3+, CD4+, CD5+, CD7-, CD8-. They do not express T-cell activation markers, and are positive for UCHL1 (CD45RO), but negative for 2H4 (CD45RA). The antigen was expressed on circulating malignant cells in Sezary syndrome (four of four cases) and adult T-cell lymphoma-leukemia (ATLL) (four of six cases) and negative in a variety of other hematologic malignancies tested. These included chronic and acute lymphoid leukemias of B and T lineage, together with chronic and acute myeloid leukemias. However, normal CH-F42+ cells do not display any of the ultrastructural features associated with Sezary or ATLL cells. The marked similarities between these conditions together with the shared expression of an otherwise very restricted surface antigen (CH-F42) provide strong evidence for the existence of a common normal counterpart. Preliminary characterization studies of the antigen, which is also expressed by K562 and Jurkat cells, suggest the CH-F42 antigen is an O-linked, sialated glycan on a glycoprotein. 
1	Prolonged response to carboplatin in an infant with brain stem glioma. Adults and children with brain stem gliomas have a mean survival time of 15 months after radiation therapy (XRT). Infants with this tumor present additional complexities for treatment because of possible neurotoxicity of the radiation to the developing brain. We report a 15-month-old child with biopsy-proven brain stem glioma with clinical and radiographic evidence of disease progression. She was treated with 24 monthly courses of carboplatin without radiation therapy and has had a 39+ month response. The clinical response started after 3 months and the radiographic evidence was documented at 10 months by magnetic resonance imaging. The toxicity was minimal. Longitudinal neuropsychological assessment demonstrated continued improvement at 36 months post diagnosis but with some motor functioning below expected age levels. Cervico-medullary astrocytoma in a young patient may be the appropriate clinical setting for future trials of chemotherapy without XRT. 
1	Value of monoclonal anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO7) for diagnosing acute leukaemia. The expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was studied in 100 cases of acute leukaemia (83 with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 17 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) by both a conventional cytochemical method and the immunocytochemical antiperoxidase (APAAP) technique using the monoclonal antibody MPO7. In each case the staining was evaluated by light microscopical examination (percentage of positive cells). Of the 83 cases of AML, 78 (93.9%) were positive for MPO7 compared with 70 (84.3%) by cytochemistry. Antibodies against the myeloid markers CD13 and CD33 were positive in 71 (85.5%) and 70 (84.3%) cases, respectively. Importantly, all cases of ALL were negative for both MPO7 and cytochemical MPO staining even when they were positive for CD13 and CD33. These results indicate that the anti-myeloperoxidase antibody MPO7 is the most sensitive and specific reagent for the diagnosis of AML and should therefore be included in routine immunophenotyping panels. 
5	Persistence of arrhythmia exercise response in healthy young men. This study assesses the persistence of arrhythmia at rest or during exercise tests, or both, after a mean follow-up period of 6.7 years in 76 young men (mean age 21.5 years) without evidence of organic heart disease. The exercise test was performed using a near-maximal protocol based on progressively increasing intermittent work loads, each of 5 minutes' duration. The initial work load was 50 W. The electrocardiogram was continuously registered throughout all stages of the examination. Arrhythmia was defined as the occurrence of greater than or equal to 1 supraventricular or 1 ventricular premature beat at any stage of the examination. At the follow-up examination, the rate of persistence of arrhythmia did not differ significantly among the subgroups, irrespective of follow-up interval, type of arrhythmia, or arrhythmia patterns of response to exercise. Two-dimensional echocardiography did not show any structural abnormalities and Doppler examination did not demonstrate significant abnormal flow patterns. Our data show that almost all patients continued to present arrhythmia after the follow-up period, without any evidence of development of organic heart disease. Moreover, the arrhythmia pattern of response to exercise remained constant throughout the years. At this time, arrhythmia without underlying heart disease seems to be of a benign natural course in these young men. 
2	A plasma protease which is expressed during supramaximal stimulation causes in vitro subcellular redistribution of lysosomal enzymes in rat exocrine pancreas. The complex events by which digestive enzyme zymogens and lysosomal hydrolases are segregated from each other and differentially transported to their respective membrane-bound intracellular organelles in the pancreas have been noted to be disturbed during the early stages of several models of experimental pancreatitis. As a result, lysosomal hydrolases such as cathepsin B are redistributed to the subcellular zymogen granule-rich fraction and lysosomal hydrolases as well as digestive enzyme zymogens are colocalized within large cytoplasmic vacuoles. The current study was designed to create an in vitro system that would reproduce this redistribution phenomenon. Our results indicate that cathepsin B redistribution occurs when rat pancreatic fragments are incubated with a supramaximally stimulating concentration of the cholecystokinin analogue caerulein along with plasma from an animal subjected to in vivo supramaximal caerulein stimulation. Neither the plasma nor a supramaximally stimulating concentration of caerulein, alone, is sufficient to induce in vitro cathepsin B redistribution. The ability of the plasma to induce in vitro cathepsin redistribution is dependent upon its content of a 10,000-30,000-D protein and is lost by exposure to protease inhibitors. In vitro cathepsin B redistribution also occurs when rat pancreatic fragments are incubated with plasma obtained from opossums with hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis caused by bile/pancreatic duct ligation. 
1	Direct extension of laryngeal carcinoma to the skin of the neck. Invasion of the skin of the neck by laryngeal carcinoma is relatively uncommon. Twelve cases of cancer of the larynx fungating through the cervical skin are presented. They mostly followed initial treatment by deep X-ray therapy or partial laryngectomy. A high tracheostomy was also considered to be a contributing cause for the occurrence of such a mishap. The management and follow-up of these patients is described. 
4	Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of anomalous right coronary artery. Coronary angioplasty of tortuous anomalous coronary arteries can be technically challenging. We describe a successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of an anomalous right coronary artery after a failed previous attempt. The anatomic limitations of anomalous right coronary arteries and technical considerations for PTCA are discussed. 
2	Dysplasia and DNA aneuploidy in a pelvic pouch. Report of a case. A patient with an 18-year history of ulcerative colitis was operated on with colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, ileoanal anastomosis, and an S-type pelvic pouch due to intractable chronic continuous disease. The patient was followed by endoscopic controls and biopsy sampling from the pouch at regular intervals. A gradual development of severe atrophy in the ileal mucosa was followed by the development of low grade dysplasia. At the most recent endoscopic control, 4 years after the construction of the pouch, biopsies were sampled also for flow cytometric DNA analyses. DNA aneuploidy was detected in a biopsy from the center of the pouch, and a biopsy taken immediately adjacent showed low grade dysplasia. These findings underline the importance of endoscopic follow-up after construction of a pelvic pouch and focus attention to the potential of malignant transformation of the mucosa. 
5	Spinal coning after lumbar puncture in prostate cancer with asymptomatic vertebral metastasis: a case report. A 60-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for complete urinary retention. Prostate cancer was diagnosed and anti-cancer chemotherapy was administered. Regression of prostatic enlargement was appreciated and difficult urination improved. At 6 months after the initial treatment vertebral metastasis of T10-11 was noted on a bone scintigram but there were no symptoms induced by bone metastasis. Orchiectomy was performed with the patient under lumbar anesthesia. Complete paralysis of both lower extremities occurred postoperatively. Computerized tomography and myelographic findings demonstrated complete subarachnoid block with an extramedullary spinal cord tumor. It was concluded that traction on the spinal cord producing neurological deterioration (spinal coning) occurred after removal of the cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture. 
1	Clinical analyses and short-term prognoses of neonates with subependymal cysts. Twenty-one neonates with subependymal cysts detected by neurosonography soon after birth were prospectively examined. The clinical and cranial sonographic findings were evaluated with respect to short-term prognosis. The prognosis was poor in 6 patients with congenital viral infection (4 with cytomegalovirus infection and 2 with rubella infection). Five patients also had neurodevelopmental abnormalities (2 with neonatal epileptic seizures, 2 with chromosomal abnormalities, and 1 with lissencephaly). The remaining 10 patients had normal psychomotor development. The incidence of congenital viral infection was statistically correlated with a poor neurodevelopmental outcome. A correlation did not exist between the short-term prognosis and each of the other clinical factors or cranial sonographic findings. Our evidence suggests that further investigation of possible subependymal cyst etiologies is required during a careful, long-term follow-up period. 
5	Multilevel occlusive vascular disease presenting with gangrene. The medical records of all patients subjected to lower extremity amputations during a 3-year period were reviewed. It was shown that advanced age and the presence of multiple medical problems do not predispose to higher levels of limb loss. Although diabetic patients more frequently undergo amputation because of sepsis than their nondiabetic counterparts, the diabetic state was not found to be associated with a greater likelihood of above knee (AK) procedures. Prior arterial surgery was not shown to make AK amputation more likely, but it was disconcerting to note that limb salvage was not achieved in many individuals despite patent proximal inflow revascularization procedures. This initial study showed that several presumed risk factors were not predictors of amputation level. Those patients requiring AK amputations had a greater frequency of combined segment (aortoiliac and femoropopliteal) occlusive disease than those who had successful amputations at more distal levels. A follow-up study of 41 consecutive patients presenting with tissue loss due to combined segment occlusive disease was performed. Eighteen (Group I) underwent inflow procedures only, while 23 (Group II) also underwent distal revascularization. The groups were similar with respect to age, risk factors, extent of tissue loss and sepsis. At 1 year 10 (56%) Group I and only 3 (13%) Group II patients required major amputation (P = 0.01). Distal bypass, in addition to an inflow procedure, is recommended for those who present with tissue loss due to multilevel arterial occlusion. 
1	Immunochemical characterization and quantitative distribution of pancreatic stone protein in sera and pancreatic secretions in pancreatic disorders. A fluorometric immunoassay has been established to quantitate pancreatic stone protein providing a sensitivity for concentrations from 0.015 to 0.5 micrograms/mL. When concentrations of pancreatic stone protein were determined from pancreatic secretions obtained either from patients suffering from chronic pancreatitis (n = 31) [including the calcifying forms (n = 10)], pancreatic cancer (n = 22), or nonpancreatic diseases (n = 17), no significant differences were found. In contrast, increased concentrations were found in serum samples from patients with chronic (39/66) and acute pancreatitis (16/20) compared with control patients. The differences between these diagnostic groups and controls were highly significant (P less than 0.0001) and independent of pancreatic enzyme activity. Immunochemical analyses of serum pancreatic stone protein showed an isoelectric point (pH 9) similar to that reported for the pancreatic thread protein. With respect to recent communications, these data do not support the etiopathogenic role postulated for pancreatic stone protein in chronic pancreatitis and chronic calcifying pancreatitis by other investigators. 
1	Thrombin stimulates tumor-platelet adhesion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Recent studies have revealed a role for platelets and the platelet-adhesive proteins, fibronectin and von Willebrand factor (vWF) in platelet-tumor cell interaction in vitro and metastasis in vivo. The present report documents the effect of thrombin treatment of platelets on this interaction in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, thrombin at 100-1,000 mU/ml maximally stimulated the adhesion of six different tumor cell lines from three different species two- to fivefold. As little as 1-10 mU/ml was effective. The effect of thrombin was specific (inhibitable by hirudin, dansyl-arginine N-(3-ethyl-1,5 pentanediyl) amide and unreactive with the inactive thrombin analogue N-P-tosyl-L-phenylchloromethylketone-thrombin and D-phenylalanyl-L-propyl-L-arginine chloromethylketone-thrombin (PPACK-thrombin), and required high-affinity thrombin receptors (competition with PPACK-thrombin but not with N-P-tosyl-L-lysine-chloromethyl-ketone-thrombin). Functionally active thrombin was required on the platelet surface. Binding of tumor cells to thrombin-activated platelets was inhibitable by agents known to interfere with the platelet GPIIb-GPIIIa integrin: monoclonal antibody 10E5, tetrapeptide RGDS and gamma chain fibrinogen decapeptide LGGAKQAGDV, as well as polyclonal antibodies against the platelet adhesive ligands, fibronectin and vWF. In vivo, thrombin at 250-500 mU per animal increased murine pulmonary metastases fourfold with CT26 colon carcinoma cells and 68-413-fold with B16 amelanotic melanoma cells. Thus, thrombin amplifies tumor-platelet adhesion in vitro two- to fivefold via occupancy of high-affinity platelet thrombin receptors, and modulation of GPIIb-GPIIIa adhesion via an RGD-dependent mechanism. In vivo, thrombin enhances tumor metastases 4-413-fold with two different tumor cell lines. 
4	Brain retractor edema during induced hypotension: the effect of the rate of return of blood pressure. This study evaluated the hypothesis that the postoperative formation of cerebral edema may be influenced by the rate of blood pressure return after induced hypotension in a graded brain retractor injury. Nineteen cats underwent unilateral craniotomy, isoflurane-induced hypotension to a mean of 50 mm Hg, and application of a brain retractor at 20 mm Hg of pressure for 1 hour. Blood pressure was returned to normal either within 3 minutes or over 20 minutes. The degree of cerebral edema formation was determined by Evans blue dye and coronal magnetic resonance imaging. All animals showed extravasation of Evans blue dye in the retracted hemisphere that was most marked at the periphery of the retractor. T1 relaxation times were significantly prolonged in the retracted hemispheres of both the fast return and slow return groups (18.8% and 17.8%, respectively) and more so at the Evans blue sites (42.8% and 40.8%), although not so strikingly beneath the retractor itself (6.3% and 7.8%). T2 relaxation times were similarly prolonged but to approximately half the degree of the T1 times. In the nonretracted hemisphere, drug-induced hypotension alone did not result in significant acute cerebral edema or blood-brain barrier alteration. There was no significant difference between the fast and slow groups in Evans blue extravasation or magnetic resonance changes. Thus, in a retractor-induced brain injury, restoration of arterial pressure to normal either gradually or rapidly did not influence the degree or extent of edema formation. 
5	Differential diagnosis of sclerosing cholangiocarcinomas of the common hepatic duct (Klatskin tumors). Although it is recognized that some other lesion may be the cause, a presumptive diagnosis of Klatskin tumor is usually made when a focal stenotic lesion of the common hepatic duct is seen on a cholangiogram of a jaundiced patient. Biopsy is so often nondiagnostic that decisions about therapy are usually made on the basis of the imaging tests and lack of evidence for some other disease. Because the accuracy and consequences of this strategy have never been tested, we contrasted the preoperative diagnosis of Klatskin tumor with the final diagnosis in 98 consecutive patients treated from 1985 to 1990. Preoperative investigations included ultrasound and computed tomographic scans, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and angiography. Sclerosing cholangiocarcinomas of the bile duct were correctly diagnosed in 68 cases. The final diagnosis was other than a sclerosing adenocarcinoma in 30 (31%) cases. There were 5 papillary bile duct carcinomas, 12 gallbladder carcinomas invading the bile duct, 5 metastatic tumors to the bile duct, 2 cases of Mirizzi syndrome, 3 granulomas, and 3 cases of idiopathic benign focal stenosis. Patients with papillary adenocarcinomas had an extensive filling defect of the duct, which was often thought to be unresectable. However, four of these five lesions could be completely excised, and the tumor was confined to the duct wall in all four. The outcome of surgical treatment of the other eight patients with benign lesions was good in most cases. These findings demonstrate the pitfalls of assuming that a focal stenosis of the hepatic duct represents a sclerosing adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis is much less specific than is generally thought, so there is considerable opportunity for mismanaging such patients. 
1	Malignant fibrous histiocytoma developing in bone 44 years after shrapnel trauma. Tumors induced by foreign bodies are uncommon in humans, but they are a relatively common occurrence in some experimental animals. The development of sarcoma in association with metallic foreign bodies has rarely been reported. The development of a malignant fibrous histiocytoma in a 65-year-old man 44 years after shrapnel fragments lodged in his left arm is described. The literature regarding metallic foreign body-induced cancer in humans is reviewed. 
4	The effect of thromboxane synthetase inhibition on cardiopulmonary function during endotoxemia in sheep. The early pulmonary hypertension seen with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) has been reported as resulting from the release of thromboxane A2. We studied the cardiopulmonary response to endotoxin in sheep with and without treatment with a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, OKY-046. The animals were implanted with instruments for crystallographic dimension analysis of the left ventricle and measurement of left ventricular, aortic, left atrial, and pulmonary arterial pressures and cardiac index. Thirteen sheep received 1.0 micrograms/kg of Escherichia coli endotoxin with (n = 6) and without (n = 7) OKY-046 (10 mg/kg bolus, then 10 micrograms/kg/min). OKY-046 prevented the increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and decrease in cardiac index usually seen during the early phase of endotoxemia. Between 8 and 12 hours after the administration of endotoxin, cardiac index increased from 6.4 +/- 0.8 to 8.4 +/- 0.8 L/min/m2. Concomitantly, the end-systolic pressure/diameter relationship (a sensitive myocardial contractility index) significantly decreased from 14.7 +/- 0.6 to 7.7 +/- 0.7 mm Hg/mm. Another index of the left ventricular contractility, the maximum rate of pressure rise was also reduced. OKY-046 prevented decreases in end-systolic pressure/diameter relationship and maximum rate of pressure rise. 
3	Continuous muscle fiber activity, peripheral neuropathy, and thymoma. Two patients, one of them with myasthenia gravis, presented symptoms of continuous muscle fiber activity syndrome before discovery of a thymoma. Peripheral neuropathy was present in both patients, with axonal and demyelinating lesions in sural nerve biopsy. The syndrome remained unchanged or worse after thymectomy. Both patients died of associated complications. 
4	Collagen phenotypes during development and regression of myocardial hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The myocardium contains collagen matrix that is a major determinant of its architecture, structural integrity, and mechanical properties. This fibrillar matrix consists primarily of type I and type III collagens having epimysial, perimysial, and endomysial components. The present study shows the alteration of collagen phenotypes during the evolution of hypertensive hypertrophy. Therapy with captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that regresses cardiac hypertrophy, not only reduces the total amount of collagen but reverses the altered distribution of type I and type III collagen. In normotensive rats, captopril did not significantly reduce collagen content or alter the ratio of type I to type III collagen. 
4	Ultrasound demonstration of a superior mesenteric artery aneurysm in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. A large aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery was the presumed cause of abdominal pain in an 11-year-old girl with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This aneurysm was readily identified by ultrasonography, suggesting that this method could be the diagnostic technique of choice in this disorder. 
1	Primary treatment of large and massive adult sarcomas with iododeoxyuridine and aggressive hyperfractionated irradiation. For a decade, the authors have experimented with treatment for unresectable adult soft tissue and bony sarcomas. Over the last 6 years, they have combined hyperfractionated radiation therapy and intravenous iododeoxyuridine as a radiosensitizer, in regimens designed to minimize toxicity and permit delivery of aggressive radiation therapy. Patients with solitary lesions and those with metastasis (38%) were treated in the hope of both potential cure in some and durable palliation in others. The most formidable of these cancers have been those that are large or massive, often requiring five or more fields and extensive treatment planning. The authors report results from 36 patients with large unresectable sarcomas (tumors ranging from 5 to 35 cm; average 14 cm) treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year, follow-up of 4 or more years (in 50%), or follow-up until death. Overall local control has been 60%, with control of 66% of lesions from 5 to 9 cm, 63% of those from 10 to 14 cm, 63% of those from 15 to 19 cm, and 57% of those greater than 20 to 40 cm. Morbidity has been modest. This experience compares favorably with the authors' earlier trials with misonidazole, and toxicity has been reduced considerably. 
5	The effect of race on the relationship between fetal death and altered fetal growth. This population study examines racial differences in the relationship between birth weight and fetal death. An earlier report showed that a birth weight that results in a fourfold increased risk of stillbirth is not a constant birth weight percentile (2nd percentile at 25 weeks, 17th percentile at 42 weeks). This analysis was applied to 782,430 white and black births in Illinois from 1980 to 1984. Mean and 10th percentile growth for white and black infants is identical before 34 weeks' gestation and growth diverges by 250 gm at term, with white infants being larger. Race-specific birth weights resulting in quadrupling of the stillbirth rate were determined with an exponential regression analysis of the relationship between birth weight and fetal death rate for each gestational age. The data indicate (1) that the birth weights resulting in quadrupling the stillbirth rate are substantially above the Denver 10th percentile and the previously unpublished race-specific Illinois 10th percentiles and (2) that at term white infants demonstrate this constant risk at the 12th percentile, whereas black infants exhibit the risk at the 18th percentile. From these data we conclude that black fetuses are more sensitive than white fetuses to factors that adversely affect growth and that continued use of "race-neutral" data for clinical management in racially heterogenous populations will not accurately predict the risk of stillbirth. 
1	Reversed helper/suppressor T-lymphocyte ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with breast cancer and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) usually occurs in patients with hematologic malignancies and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patients with solid tumors represent a very small fraction of the reported cases of PCP. Over an 18-month period, PCP was diagnosed in three patients who had received radiation and chemotherapy for breast cancer. In all three patients, there was no serologic or clinical evidence of AIDS. Direct staining of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) revealed Pneumocystis carinii, and cellular analysis of BAL revealed an increased percentage of lymphocytes with reversed helper/inducer:suppressor/cytotoxic T-cell (CD4:CD8) ratio. Because decreased CD4:CD8 ratio in BAL is commonly accepted as findings consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis and AIDS, we conclude that similar findings in patients without AIDS are not specific for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and P. carinii should be ruled out in the appropriate clinical setting. 
5	Hospital admissions from the Surgical Day Care Centre of Vancouver General Hospital 1977-1987. The admissions to Vancouver General Hospital from its Surgical Day Care Centre were reviewed for the period 1977 to 1987. The overall mean rate of admission for the period was 0.28 per cent, for surgically-related admissions 0.22 per cent and for anaesthesia-related admissions 0.07 per cent. The principal reasons for surgery-related admissions were postoperative bleeding, complications, the need for further surgery, the requirement for prolonged postoperative care, and pain. Urology had a particularly high percentage of admissions compared with its workload, because of the diagnostic nature of much of the work. Anaesthesia-related admissions included "syncope," lack of an accompanying adult, aspiration pneumonitis and coincident acute disease. Twelve of the 14 patients admitted with syncope had surgery in the afternoon and had received less than ideal amounts of intravenous fluid. Seven of the 12 ASA physical status II patients admitted had an admission diagnosis related to the coincident disease. 
4	Eustachian valve endocarditis. M mode and cross sectional echocardiography showed a highly mobile globular pedunculated mass(3.0 cm long with a maximum diameter of i.5 cm) attached to the eustachian valve in a heroin addict with staphylococcal endocarditis. 
5	Richner-Hanhart's syndrome. Electron microscopic study of the skin lesion. The plantar hyperkeratotic skin lesion in a case of Richner-Hanhart's syndrome was investigated using ultrastructural examination. Light microscopic examination showed remarkable hyperkeratosis and some aberrant keratinocytes with multiple nuclei. On ultrastructural examination, some abnormal structures were seen in the affected keratinocytes: aggregations of tonofilaments and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The inclusions were needle shaped and were considered to be "crystal ghosts," presumably of tyrosine. The formation of tyrosine crystalline inclusions seems to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the cutaneous lesions in Richner-Hanhart's syndrome. 
5	Maternal outcome after open fetal surgery. A review of the first 17 human cases. A few fetal diseases may benefit from surgical treatment before birth, but hysterotomy and subsequent delivery by cesarean section pose a risk to the otherwise unaffected mother. To assess maternal risk of mortality, morbidity, and reproductive potential after fetal surgery, we reviewed our experience with 17 highly selected women who underwent fetal surgery. Fifteen of these procedures were performed for one of two congenital anomalies: severe bilateral hydronephrosis and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. There were no deaths or serious maternal injuries. In the 14 women who continued pregnancy after hysterotomy, uterine irritability and preterm labor were frequent complications, requiring early confinement in most cases. There has been no detectable effect on future fertility, as indicated by eight subsequent normal pregnancies. We conclude that hysterotomy for fetal surgery can be accomplished without unduly endangering the mother's life or her future reproductive potential. However, morbidity related to premature labor remains a serious problem, and our ability to control uterine contractions after hysterotomy remains the limiting factor in human fetal surgery. 
3	Hemodynamic effects of nasal CPAP examined by Doppler echocardiography. The effects of incremental application of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (0 to 15 cm H2O) on heart rate, pulmonary artery pressure, and cardiac index were studied noninvasively by Doppler echocardiography. By two-way analysis of variance within two groups (19 normal volunteers and six sleep apnea patients), no significant effects on heart rate, pulmonary artery pressure, ventricular size, or cardiac index could be found with increasing positive intrathoracic pressures and consequent lung hyperinflation. In subjects with normal cardiac function, nasal CPAP is safe from a hemodynamic viewpoint. This simple, repeatable and noninvasive technique may be used to assess the clinical safety and efficacy of prescribed nasal CPAP on cardiac hemodynamics in individual patients. 
5	Identification of patients at greatest risk for developing major complications at cardiac surgery [published erratum appears in Circulation 1991 Jul;84(1):446] As part of a prospective program to use risk-adjusted outcome (operative mortality and morbidity) as a measure of quality of care, we have analyzed perioperative complication data in 10,634 patients representing 73% of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass at Veterans Administration medical centers between April 1, 1987, and March 31, 1989. One or more complications occurred in 15% of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, and in 24% of patients undergoing valve and other cardiac surgery. Patients experiencing one or more complications had an eightfold to 10-fold increase in operative mortality compared with patients with no perioperative complications. The most frequent complication was requirement for mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours occurring in 8% of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass and in 15% of patients undergoing valve and other cardiac surgery; 24-25% of these patients died within 30 days of surgery or as a direct result of a surgical complication. Previous heart surgery was a strong predictor of development of one or more complications in both groups of patients, being associated with an adjusted relative risk of 1.6-2.0. Other important predictors in both surgical groups were surgical priority, older age, peripheral vascular disease, and higher serum creatinine. Although a number of preoperative risk factors could be identified for the development of renal failure, low cardiac output, and requirement for prolonged mechanical support, few risk factors could be identified for the development of mediastinitis and reoperation for bleeding. This observation suggests that mediastinitis and reoperation for bleeding are more likely the result of technical factors rather than patient-related risk factors. 
5	Ultrasound-guided aspiration for transient synovitis of the hip. We reviewed 15 children with transient synovitis of the hip who had aspiration of an effusion under local anaesthesia with ultrasound guidance. There were no significant complications; aspiration was useful for diagnosis and gave considerable symptomatic relief. We discuss the role of ultrasound in diagnosis and treatment. 
5	Variceal sclerosis in schistosomotic patients: a 5-year follow-up study. To assess the therapeutic possibilities of injection sclerosis in schistosomotic portal hypertension, a 5-year prospective study was conducted in northeast Brazil, where this parasitosis is endemic. Fifty patients undergoing endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage from rupture of esophageal varices from July through December 1981 were chosen for the study. The 32 consenting patients were submitted to injection sclerotherapy paravariceally, using ethanolamine oleate; the 18 refusing to participate were assigned to the control group. The incidence of rebleeding was 28.1% in the former and 44.5% in the latter, a difference which was not statistically significant (Fisher's test, p = 0.375). Mortality from rupture of esophageal varices was 3.1% in the sclerotherapy group and 27.7% in the control group, a statistically significant difference (Fischer's test, p = 0.017). Since sclerotherapy markedly improved the long-term survival rate of the patients, this procedure is advocated for the treatment of esophageal varices in cases of portal hypertension due to schistosomiasis. 
3	Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. The mitochondrial diseases present with great heterogeneity. They are often multisystemic and vary considerably in age at onset, distribution of weakness, severity, and course. Only nonthyroidal hypermetabolism has a distinctive clinical presentation. Therefore, attempts at classification have generated some controversy. This article discusses the general classification that takes into account genetic and biochemical features, which has resulted from the fast pace of biochemical and molecular genetic investigations. 
1	Suppressive effects of visceral tumor on the generation of antitumor T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. Antitumor reactive cells can be generated from lymphoid organs of mice bearing subcutaneous (SC), but not liver or lung, tumors by in vitro sensitization with irradiated tumor and interleukin 2. To examine whether visceral tumors mediated tumor-induced suppression, in vitro sensitization cells were generated from mice bearing SC tumors with and without concomitant liver or lung tumors. Antitumor efficacy of these cells was assessed in adoptive immunotherapy experiments. The presence of visceral tumors suppressed the ability to generate therapeutic in vitro sensitization cells from mice with SC tumors. By establishing visceral tumors at different intervals in relationship to SC tumor inoculation, we found that visceral tumor appeared to suppress directly the development of a host immune response to SC tumor, rather than inhibit function of established immune cells. Our model affords a means to study mechanisms of tumor-induced immunosuppression. 
5	Molteno implants and operating microscope-induced retinal phototoxicity. A clinicopathologic report. The right eye of a 75-year-old man with a history of cataract extraction, three penetrating keratoplasties, laser trabeculoplasty, two Molteno implants, and an operating microscope-induced retinal phototoxic lesion was studied post mortem. Histopathologic examination of the anterior segment showed evidence of penetrating keratoplasty, cataract surgery, and two Molteno implants with minimal associated tissue response. Ultrastructural examination showed a loose collagenous matrix surrounding the Molteno reservoirs, suggesting aqueous percolation from the reservoirs into the conjunctiva. Posteriorly, in the area of the phototoxic operating microscope-induced lesion, a nodule of retinal pigment epithelial hyperplasia with overlying atrophy of the photoreceptor cell layer of the neurosensory retina was noted. The retina also contained cystoid macular edema and an extensive preretinal membrane that was clinically unexpected. 
4	Myocardial preservation using lidocaine blood cardioplegia. Prevention of ventricular fibrillation after aortic unclamping using lidocaine hydrochloride as an additive to cold potassium blood cardioplegia was studied prospectively in 46 patients undergoing elective myocardial revascularization. Patients were similar with respect to age, ventricular function, severity of coronary artery disease, cross-clamp time, completeness of revascularization, frequency of internal thoracic artery grafting, systemic temperature at the time of cross-clamp removal, and mean infusate volume and temperature. Patients receiving lidocaine blood cardioplegia (group 1, 23 patients) had a significant reduction in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (22% versus 74%; p less than 0.0005) and in the mean number of cardioversion attempts required to defibrillate the heart (0.5 +/- 1.3 versus 1.9 +/- 0.97; p less than 0.0005) after cross-clamp removal compared with controls (group 2, 23 patients). There were no differences between the two groups postoperatively with regard to cardiac enzyme release, hemodynamic measurements, or clinical outcome. Patients receiving lidocaine blood cardioplegia tended to have a lower incidence of new postoperative atrial fibrillation (9% versus 26%). Ventricular function was preserved equally in both groups. We conclude that lidocaine is a safe additive to potassium blood cardioplegia and significantly reduces the incidence of ventricular fibrillation after aortic unclamping. 
3	Educational policies. It is vital that teachers, parents, and health professionals recognize the major educational problems that affect students with epilepsy. Children with epilepsy should be placed in the least restrictive schooling environment so that social, emotional, and educational requirements can be met in a setting best suited to the individual's present needs and future development. Personal assessment and monitoring of progress form an equally important part of a child's educational program in integrated schools, but there is a need to develop suitable instruments to assist teachers in their assessments and decision making. In Australia, the National Epilepsy Association has developed an "Alert Kit" based on the Epilepsy Foundation of Americas "School Alert Kit" to provide basic medical information on epilepsy to teachers and pupils. 
1	T-cell subsets with a naive phenotype are selectively decreased in the peripheral blood of patients with mycosis fungoides. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of 33 patients with histopathologic confirmation of mycosis fungoides and 27 healthy controls matched for age and sex were analyzed with a panel of monoclonal antibodies using both single and dual color immunofluorescence. Patients with mycosis fungoides had a significant reduction in the percentage of circulating T cells with a naive phenotype (i.e., CD4+2H4+ and CD4+Leu8+), as well as a significant reduction in the absolute numbers of circulating lymphocytes with the phenotype CD8+Leu8+ compared to the control cohort. The reduction in circulating naive T cells was found to occur irrespective of stage of disease, duration of disease, or mode of treatment. The depletion of circulating naive T cells may reflect increased conversion to memory T cells in the peripheral blood or skin. 
4	High resolution real-time ultrasound for the diagnosis of venous thrombosis in the rehabilitation setting. Accurate, noninvasive testing for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) by conventional methods is often not possible in the rehabilitation patient. Lower extremity amputation, a cast or bandage, or skin problems present obstacles to standard diagnostic methods. This report describes the use of duplex ultrasound (US) scanning for noninvasive diagnosis of DVT in a seventy-year-old man with a below-knee amputation, on whom Doppler and plethysmography examinations could not be performed. As experience is gained with this technique, the use of venography for diagnosis of DVT becomes more difficult to rationalize. 
2	Gastroesophageal reflux and respiratory symptoms: is there an association? Proposed mechanisms and treatment. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a dysfunction of the distal esophagus causing movement of stomach contents into the esophagus. Patients may develop heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, odynophagia, and hemorrhage. Respiratory symptoms occur in 10-60 percent of patients with GER or hiatal hernia. Although there is evidence associating pulmonary symptoms and GER, causality has not been proven. The appropriate use of antireflux therapy or surgery to treat GER may consequently alleviate respiratory symptoms. 
2	Diffuse-adhering Escherichia coli (DAEC) as a putative cause of diarrhea in Mayan children in Mexico. Diarrhea is a major cause of infantile morbidity and mortality in developing countries. A community-based, case control study was conducted in a southern Mexican Mayan village for 3 weeks during the peak diarrhea period to prospectively identify the infectious agents associated with childhood diarrheal disease. Several enteropathogens were isolated from stools of 34 of 58 cases, although none was significantly associated with diarrhea. For the 24 cases from which no enteropathogens were isolated, diffuse-adhering Escherichia coli (DAEC) strains were significantly associated with diarrheal disease (P less than .02; odds ratio = 6; 95% confidence limit, 1.08-99.0). DAEC were highly heterogeneous with respect to plasmid content and serotype. Three DNA probes designed to differentiate E. coli exhibiting localized, diffuse, or aggregative adherence were compared with results from a standard HeLa cell binding assay to assess the utility of these probes in the field. This study provides evidence for the potential pathogenic capacity of DAEC and underscores the variety of diarrheal agents operating within a community. 
1	Premalignant lesions: role of antioxidant vitamins and beta-carotene in risk reduction and prevention of malignant transformation. Epidemiological studies have shown that diets rich in one or more antioxidant nutrients may reduce the risk of cancers of the lung, uterine cervix, mouth, and gastrointestinal tract. Study of premalignant lesions offers a comparatively expedient approach to identifying and evaluating the efficacy of the cancer chemopreventive components of foods. Some recent findings suggest roles for beta-carotene and/or vitamin C in reversing or reducing the risk of cervical dysplasia and oral leukoplakia. There are some indications that vitamin C and beta-carotene may reduce the risk of atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer. Additional epidemiological and molecular biology studies and clinical intervention trials using premalignant lesions as the marker of specific cancer risks should become an important component of future research in the area of cancer chemoprevention. 
1	Epidermal growth factor receptor expression in colorectal cancer. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression was estimated in 50 invasive human colorectal cancers using immunohistochemistry and the degree of expression was quantified from integrated optical density measurements on the stained sections. All tumours stained positively, but Dukes' C tumours exhibited significantly higher levels of receptor than either Dukes' A or B tumours. In addition, histologically high grade cancers expressed receptors more strongly than those of low grade. It is concluded that a high EGF receptor concentration is associated with poor prognostic factors in colorectal malignancy. 
5	Liver transplantation in children. Although liver transplantation is now accepted as the ideal therapy for end-stage liver disease, relatively few centers have gained a large experience in children, and good results have been elusive. Technical difficulty and a high incidence of graft failure are among the obstacles to success. At the University of California at Los Angeles, 39% of our liver transplants are in the patients who are younger than 18 years. We have analyzed our experience with 103 patients to emphasize factors important to a favorable outcome with the procedure. One hundred twenty-three transplants were performed in 103 children (mean age, 5.2 years; 48% younger than 3 years). No reduced-size grafts were used. Scrupulous attention to technical details of the vascular reconstruction, including frequent use of the supraceliac aorta of the recipient and interrupted suture techniques, ensured construction of sound hepatic artery and portal vein anastomoses at the first operation. Preoperative exchange transfusions were used if the prothrombin time was prolonged beyond 7 seconds, resulting in an average blood loss of only 3.3 volumes. Cyclosporine dosage was maintained in the high therapeutic range for the first 4 weeks, and anti-T-cell antibody (OKT3) was used for rejection (38%). Amphotericin prophylaxis was used for biliary atresia patients with multiple previous operations. Eighty-two of one hundred three patients (80%) are alive. There were no intraoperative deaths. Actuarial survival rates at 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years are 80%, 79%, and 77%, respectively. Survival of patients who underwent transplantation at age less than 1 year is 65% versus 85% at age more than 1 year (p = 0.08). Retransplantation was performed in 19 patients (18%), with a survival rate of 58%. Hepatic artery thrombosis, the most frequent technical complication, occurred in only 16 patients (13%). Survival rates of ABO identical-match versus nonidentical-match grafts were 96% and 60%, respectively (p = 0.02). Graft survival was only 47% if more than one steroid cycle was needed, compared to 75% survival with OKT3 treatment. Despite impairment of renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] less than 80 cc/kg/min) in 54% of patients and hypertension requiring therapy in 27%, 90% of the children demonstrated enhancement of growth, development, and functional status. The following conclusions were made. (1) Pediatric liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for all types of end-stage liver disease and should be considered early. (2) Factors that enhance survival include technical precision, aggressive retransplantation, antifungal chemoprophylaxis and therapy, and judicious immunosuppression with use of OKT3 for rejection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Laboratory parameters to monitor safety and efficacy during thrombolytic therapy. Thrombolytic therapy is being used with increasing frequency in myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and peripheral arterial occlusion. Use of these agents, however, is hampered by concerns regarding safety and efficacy. Numerous laboratory parameters have been evaluated for monitoring the risk of bleeding complications, with levels of fibrinogen (and percentage of decrease) and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) correlating to a variable extent with clinical bleeding. The bleeding time (BT) test has also been proposed as a potential predictor of bleeding during thrombolytic therapy. With respect to efficacy, the D-dimer fragment of FDPs, when corrected for soluble fibrin polymers, has been shown to correlate with clot lysis in venous thromboembolism but not MI. The BT also is being considered as a marker of lysis in patients with DVT. Given the increasing concomitant use of antiplatelet agents during thrombolytic therapy, the BT, as an in vivo test of hemostasis and platelet function, has potential utility as a noninvasive, adjunctive marker of thrombolytic efficacy. 
1	Localization of malignant melanoma using monoclonal antibodies. Finding a screening test to evaluate patients with cancer for occult metastatic disease, as well as imaging all known disease, is a goal of research efforts. Twenty-nine evaluable patients with deeply invasive (stage I), regional nodal (stage II), or systemic (stage III) melanoma underwent imaging by administration of a preparation of the antimelanoma antibody labeled with technetium 99m. Scan results indicated that 28 of 32 confirmed metastatic sites were imaged with this technique (88% sensitivity). Analysis of the individual positive sites revealed that nodal basins and visceral metastases accounted for the highest percentage of metastatic sites imaged, with 14 (88%) of 16 nodal basin metastases and all four visceral metastases being detected through imaging. Occult nodal disease was detected in the iliac nodal chain in two of the 29 patients. The imaging of benign tumors and nodal basins not containing disease accounted for a confirmed false-positive rate of 21%. Three (10%) of the 29 scan results were confirmed to be false-negative. In vivo tumor localization with monoclonal antibodies showed a sensitivity similar to that of other roentgenographic procedures for identifying metastatic disease and was useful in two of three patients in identifying occult iliac nodal disease, a region that is difficult to evaluate with physical examination and other imaging modalities. 
4	Coronary angioplasty of anomalous coronary arteries: notes on technical aspects. Five patients with significant atherosclerotic lesions of anomalous coronary arteries underwent coronary angioplasty of the anomalous vessel. Four patients had anomalous circumflex artery and 1 had an anomalous right coronary artery. Angiographic and clinical success was achieved in all 5 patients. To ensure adequate equipment selection special consideration should be given to angiographic characteristics of these vessels, such as the orifice configuration, exit angulation, the route the artery traverses and the location of the stenotic lesions. Major determinants for successful angioplasty in these patients are guiding catheter selection and advancement of the balloon catheter to the very proximal portion of the anomalous vessel to subsequently facilitate guide wire advancement. This data indicates that balloon angioplasty can be successfully utilized in patients with significant atherosclerotic disease of anomalous coronary arteries. 
5	Exposing patients with chronic, stable, exertional angina to placebo periods in drug trials. Because the safety of withholding standard therapy and enrolling patients with stable angina in placebo-controlled trials is not known, we identified all events leading to dropout from trials of 12 antianginal drugs submitted in support of new drug applications to the US Food and Drug Administration. Persons who dropped out of the trials were classified as cause due to adverse cardiovascular events or other causes without knowledge of drug assignment. There were 3161 subjects who entered any randomized, double-blind phase of placebo-controlled protocols; 197 (6.2%) withdrew because of cardiovascular events. There was no difference in risk of adverse events between drug and placebo groups. A prospectively defined subgroup analysis showed that groups who received calcium antagonists were at an increased risk of dropout compared with placebo groups (P = .04), primarily because of a disproportionate number of adverse events in studies of one drug. In conclusion, there were few adverse experiences associated with short-term placebo use. Withholding active treatment does not increase the risk of serious cardiac events. 
5	Loss of endothelium-dependent relaxant activity in the pulmonary circulation of rats exposed to chronic hypoxia. To determine whether exposure to chronic hypoxia and subsequent development of pulmonary hypertension induces alterations of endothelium-dependent relaxation in rat pulmonary vascular bed, we studied isolated lung preparations from rats exposed to either room air (controls) or hypoxia (H) during 1 wk (1W-H), 3 wk (3W-H), or 3W-H followed by 48 h recovery to room air (3WH + R). In lungs pretreated with meclofenamate (3 microM), the endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses to acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) and ionophore A23187 (10(-9)-10(-7) M) were examined during conditions of increased tone by U46619 (50 pmol/min). Acetylcholine or A23187 produced dose-dependent vasodilation in control lungs, this response was reduced in group 1W-H (P less than 0.02), abolished in group 3W-H (P less than 0.001), and restored in group 3WH + R. In contrast, the endothelium-independent vasodilator agent sodium nitroprusside remained fully active in group 3W-H. The pressor response to 300 pM endothelin was greater in group 3W-H than in controls (6.8 +/- 0.5 mmHg vs. 1.6 +/- 0.2 mmHg, P less than 0.001) but was not potentiated by the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF) antagonists: hydroquinone (10(-4) M); methylene blue (10(-4) M); and pyrogallol (3 x 10(-5) M) as it was in controls. It was similar to controls in group 3W-H + R. Our results demonstrate that hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension is associated with a loss of EDRF activity in pulmonary vessels, with a rapid recovery on return to a normoxic environment. 
1	Basal cell carcinoma recurring after radiotherapy: a unique, difficult treatment subclass of recurrent basal cell carcinoma. Twenty-seven basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) recurring following radiation therapy alone or in addition to other treatment modalities were treated with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) from 1983 to 1989. Mean tumor size was 2.1 cm. Of the tumors, 70.4% arose in the mid-face region, 55.6% had undergone multiple previous treatment modalities. The present recurrence rate is 7.4% (mean follow-up: 25 months). Basal cell carcinoma recurring following radiotherapy deserves special subclassification among recurrent BCC. It is very difficult to eradicate, with high recurrence rates following standard surgical excision or further radiotherapy. Tumors are usually large, aggressive, and invasive. Most arise in the cosmetically crucial mid-face region, where extension into subcutaneous tissue planes is common. Mohs surgery, with its inherent abilities to examine all margins, map tumor extension, and conserve tissue, is uniquely suited to treatment of these difficult tumors. 
5	Bell's palsy. Ensuring the best possible outcome. Bell's palsy is thought to be an idiopathic polyneuritis and must be distinguished from other disorders that cause facial weakness. In most cases, differentiation can be accomplished on the basis of the history, physical examination, and clinical course. Routine follow-up care ensures that recovery is occurring. Electrodiagnostic testing often helps to assess prognosis. Eye care and corticosteroid therapy are recommended. 
1	Depressed adenoma of the stomach, revisited. Histologic, histochemical, and immunohistochemical profiles. For 52 patients with depressed adenomas of the stomach, histopathologic studies were done on 56 tumors and for 43 of them, histochemical and immunohistochemical features were examined. In addition, nondepressed adenomas (n = 57) and the depressed type of early gastric adenocarcinomas of the well-differentiated variety (n = 44) were studied as the controls. Depressed adenomas in the majority (73%) involved the entire thickness of the mucous membrane of the stomach with tubules of atypical epithelium, presenting a severe grade in many of the cases (41%). Paneth's cells were found in cases of a depressed adenoma, in significantly higher percentages (61%) than in those with a nondepressed adenoma (P less than 0.01). The frequency of cases with argyrophil cells was also higher in depressed adenoma (63%) than in nondepressed adenoma (36%) or in cases of early gastric carcinoma (32%). Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 were noticed in tumor cells, immunohistochemically in 28% of the cases with depressed adenoma, the frequency being intermediate between cases of a benign nondepressed adenoma (6% for both CEA and CA 19-9) and cases of early gastric carcinoma (71% for CEA and 66% for CA 19-9). No difference was noticed in lectin reactivity and mucin content between depressed and nondepressed adenomas, whereas tumor cells in the early depressed carcinoma had a higher lectin reactivity and less mucin content than those seen in the adenomas. It would thus appear that depressed adenoma is a benign neoplastic lesion; however, the malignant potential of this lesion is somewhat higher than the nondepressed counterpart, as indicated by the immunoreactivity to tumor markers and follow-up results reported by colleagues previously. 
5	Neuroendocrine features of reactive bile ductules in cholestatic liver disease. Various cholestatic liver diseases are accompanied by a striking increase in the number of bile ductules. This so-called ductular reaction is thought to arise both from ductular metaplasia of hepatocytes and from proliferation of pre-existing bile ductules. Previous studies have shown that these reactive bile ductules differ from their normal counterpart in enzyme and immunohistochemical make-up. Using monoclonal antibodies directed to neuroendocrine markers and immunohistochemistry, we found that reactive bile ductules in cholestatic liver disease display neuroendocrine features. In all cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), extrahepatic obstruction, and acute hepatitis A, reactive bile ductules expressed the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and reacted with monoclonal antibody A2B5. Both N-CAM and the ganglioside, recognized by A2B5, are restricted to neuroendocrine cells and tissues. In all but four of these cases, the same bile ductules expressed chromogranin-A, present in the matrix of neuroendocrine granules. Furthermore, in three cases of longstanding cholestasis, scattered periportal hepatocytes expressed chromogranin-A but not N-CAM. Other neuroendocrine markers such as neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, or myelin-associated glycoprotein were lacking from both bile ductules and hepatocytes. The neuroendocrine phenotype of bile ductules and hepatocytes was confirmed on electronmicroscopy, demonstrating various numbers of dense-cored, neuroendocrine granules near the peripheral cell membrane in bile ductules as well as in cells intermediate between hepatocytes and bile ductular cells. In 10 cases of normal liver tissue without ductular reaction, bile ductules lacked neuroendocrine markers except in two cases in which very weak reactivity for chromogranin-A was observed. These findings illustrate the presence of a new, neuroendocrine cell type that emerges in the liver during cholestasis. Elucidation of the significance of the neuroendocrine substance(s) produced in the dense cored granules of reactive bile ductules awaits their isolation and characterization. We can speculate that this molecule plays an autocrine or paracrine regulatory role in the process of ductular metaplasia of hepatocytes or growth of bile ductules. 
5	Cruciate paralysis: a clinical and radiographic analysis of injuries to the cervicomedullary junction. Fourteen patients with superior cervical spinal cord injuries and the clinical signs and symptoms of cruciate paralysis are presented. This rare injury pattern is characterized by weakness of the upper extremities with little or no compromise of lower-extremity function following trauma to the superior spinal cord. Anatomically, cruciate paralysis is thought to represent selective injury to descending corticospinal tracts as they decussate at the cervicomedullary junction. The clinical and radiographic findings of each patient are outlined and the incidence and natural history of the injury syndrome, including a review of the literature, are presented. 
5	Impact of the availability of a prior electrocardiogram on the triage of the patient with acute chest pain STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether information from a prior electrocardiogram (ECG) improves diagnostic accuracy in the emergency department (ED) evaluation of patients with acute chest pain. DESIGN: Analysis of prospectively collected data from a cohort study. SETTING: Emergency departments of four community and three university hospitals. PATIENTS: 5,673 patients aged greater than or equal to 30 years who presented to the EDs of participating hospitals for evaluation of acute chest pain, including 772 (14%) with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After adjusting for clinical characteristics, no significant difference was found in the sensitivities of admission to the hospital or to the coronary care unit (CCU) between AMI patients with and without prior ECGs available for review. However, non-AMI patients with prior ECGs available for review were more likely to avoid CCU admission than were non-AMI patients without prior ECGs. This improvement in specificity was most marked in the 2,024 patients whose current ED ECGs had changes consistent with ischemia or infarction: when a prior ECG was available, non-AMI patients were more than twice as likely to be discharged (26% vs. 12%) and about 1.5 times as likely to avoid CCU admission (39% vs. 27%) (both p less than 0.0001). Admission rates of AMI patients with and without prior ECGs were similar. CONCLUSION: When the current ECG is consistent with ischemia or infarction, the availability of a prior ECG for comparison to determine whether the ECG changes are old or new improves diagnostic accuracy and triage decisions by reducing the admission of patients without AMI or acute ischemic heart disease (increased specificity) without reducing the admission of patients with these diagnoses (unchanged sensitivity). 
2	Bile duct emptying in response to fat: a validation study. Fatty meal sonography has been suggested to assess patients with biliary pain after cholecystectomy, but the effects of gallbladder removal on biliary dynamics has not been studied prospectively. Before elective cholecystectomy, 25 patients had their common hepatic ducts' diameter measured by ultrasonography before and after a fat stimulus. In 23, tests were repeated 1 month, 1 year, and 5 years after surgery. In preoperative studies, 5 patients showed dilatation after fat and 2 of these had stones in the common bile duct. However, another 4 patients with stones or sludge in the duct did not show dilatation, so that the response to fat was a poor indicator of patients requiring common bile duct exploration. No patient had major symptoms after surgery. At 1 month and 12 months, the response to fat was variable with more than half of those tested showing no decrease in duct size. A more consistent pattern emerged at 5 years, when 14 of 18 patients tested showed a decrease in common hepatic duct after fat; 3 were unchanged and 1 increased by 1 mm. The response to fat was less consistent and more difficult to measure in the common bile duct, even 5 years after operation. It was concluded that not all patients with indications for exploration of the common bile duct on operative cholangiography show a dilatation response to fat on preoperative testing. Also, fatty meal sonography should be used with caution because the response to fat in asymptomatic patients soon after operation is unpredictable, with occasional patients showing dilation without apparent obstruction. Measurement of common hepatic duct is preferred to common bile duct and increases in diameter of 1 mm are probably not significant. 
5	Patterns of acute respiratory tract infection in children: a longitudinal study in a depressed community in Metro Manila. The incidences of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) and acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) were 6.1 and 0.5 per child-year, respectively, in children less than 5 years old in a depressed urban community in Manila. The peak age-specific incidence occurred in those children 6-23 months old for ARI and 6-11 months old for ALRI. Age less than 2 years, malnutrition, household crowding, and parental smoking were associated with a statistically significant, though modest, increase in ARI morbidity. The crude mortality rate was 14.3 per 1,000 children 0-4 years old, with a corresponding ARI-specific mortality rate of 8.9 per 1,000. The prevalence of viral infection was 32.8 and that of bacteremic ALRI was 6.7 per 1,000 children with moderate ALRI. Respiratory syncytial virus was the predominant viral pathogen, while Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens. Transmission of respiratory pathogens in depressed communities, facilitated by inadequate housing, inaccessible health services, and prevalent malnutrition, will continue unless meaningful socioeconomic improvement is realized. 
1	Osteoid osteoma of the scapula. A case report and review of the literature. The scapula is a rare location for osteoid osteoma, which in most cases does not involve the flat bones. The en bloc excision in this uncommon location can be problematic since the surgical exposure is difficult, and shoulder joint function can be affected if the lesion is subchondral. In an 18-year-old man, an osteoid osteoma was located in the subchondral area of the glenoid. A guided needle biopsy of the nidus resulted in complete healing. This mode of treatment, with proper follow-up examination, is acceptable for a benign lesion situated in a problematic location. 
5	Inhaled albuterol and oral prednisone therapy in hospitalized adult asthmatics. Does aminophylline add any benefit? STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of intravenous aminophylline in the treatment of adult patients hospitalized for exacerbation of asthma. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial throughout the study. SETTING: University Hospital Clinical Research Center. PATIENTS: Forty-four patients admitted from the emergency room with a primary diagnosis asthma; 39 patients completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either intravenous aminophylline or placebo in addition to frequent nebulized albuterol; prednisone 0.5 mg/kg body weight every 6 h orally; and supplemental oxygen. Aminophylline infusion rates were adjusted to achieve serum theophylline concentrations of 10 to 20 micrograms/ml. Changes were made in placebo infusion rates to maintain the double blind design. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and other spirometric measurements every 8 h by a blinded investigator or trained respiratory therapist. Subjective patient response and duration of hospitalization were compared. No difference in spirometric measurements was observed between the two groups at any time point. On admission to the study, FEV1 in the placebo group was 41.5 (+/- 2.9) percent predicted and in the aminophylline group 34.7 (+/- 2.3) percent predicted (p = 0.08). At discharge, FEV1 was 70.4 (+/- 2.9) percent predicted in the placebo group and 63.7 (+/- 2.8) percent predicted in the theophylline group (p = 0.10). There was no difference in subjective patient rating or duration of hospitalization between the two groups (placebo 1.95 days and aminophylline 1.78 days, p = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that aminophylline therapy does not add significant benefit to other standard therapies in hospitalized adult asthmatic patients. Because of the risks and cost of aminophylline treatment in the hospital setting, further research is needed to determine if there are subgroups of adult asthmatics who may benefit from the addition of aminophylline to other standard optimal therapies. 
5	Anterior decompression and stabilization of thoracolumbar burst fractures by the use of the Slot-Zielke device. Between July 1983 and November 1986, 29 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures underwent a one-stage operation consisting of anterior decompression by subtotal vertebrectomy, reduction, and stabilization with the Slot-Zielke device. The mean follow-up was 3.1 years. Most patients with incomplete neurologic lesions showed postoperative improvement and were upgraded one or two steps in the Frankel scale. No patient showed neurologic deterioration after surgery. In all patients, bony union occurred. Loss of reduction of more than 5 degrees occurred in 41% of the patients. Because of this high rate of loss of reduction in patients and the low degree of flexion-bending loading and torsional stability in biomechanical evaluation in vitro of the Slot-Zielke device on human cadaveric spines, an additional posterior stabilization of the spine after an anterior approach for anterior- and middle-column fractures should be considered. 
4	Vascular entrapment of intra-aortic balloon after short-term balloon counterpulsation. Prolonged, continuous intra-aortic balloon (IAB) counterpulsation for several weeks can result in balloon entrapment secondary to thrombus formation in the balloon lumen. In this report, we describe a patient who developed IAB entrapment, early (1 wk) after initiation of counterpulsation. A trace amount of blood was noted in the tubing connecting the balloon catheter to the console for 3 days prior to IAB malfunction and vascular entrapment. We suggest that the balloon catheter be removed immediately when blood is detected in the external connecting tubing even if the IAB is functioning satisfactorily. 
5	Compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots. A mechanical or biological problem? Pathophysiologically, nerve root pain production is a complex issue. For many years, mechanical compression has been regarded as the sole cause for such pain. There are indications, however, that other factors, such as intraneural inflammation, may be of importance in this context. In this article, four cases are presented in which nerve root related pain gradually resolved without any proven change in the mechanical deformation of the involved nerve root. The data presented here suggest that mechanical compression, per se, may not always be the sole cause of radicular pain and dysfunction. These findings suggest that improvement is needed in our understanding of the pathophysiology of nerve root compression and inflammation. 
1	Effect of intraarterial versus intravenous cisplatin in addition to systemic doxorubicin, high-dose methotrexate, and ifosfamide on histologic tumor response in osteosarcoma (study COSS-86). In osteosarcoma, intraarterial (IA) administration of systemic treatment has been advocated to improve local tumor response preparing for, or even obviating, definitive surgery. Because data from the literature did not unequivocally support the local superiority of IA infusion, a comparative study was started in 1986. Preoperative chemotherapy consisted of 45 mg/m2 of doxorubicin on days 1 and 2; 12 g/m2 of high-dose methotrexate on days 15 and 22; and 3 g/m2 of ifosfamide on days 29, 30, 50, and 51 followed on days 31 and 52 by intravenous (IV) versus IA tourniquet infusion of cisplatin (DDP). A strict randomization of patients was not feasible. A balanced distribution of risk factors was strived for by stratifying and allocating the appropriate patients centrally. The infusion time was prolonged from 1 to 5 hours in the IV group, and the DDP dose was reduced from 150 to 120 mg/m2 in both arms when intolerable ototoxicity became apparent. A multivariate analysis was performed to exclude a bias on the response rates from risk factor distribution and from modifications of DDP infusion time and dosage. The overall fraction of histologic good responders (greater than 90% necrosis) was not found to be different after IA versus IV treatment (34/50 [68%] vs. 41/59 [69%]). Intraarterial instead of IV use of DDP within an aggressive systemic treatment does not seem to improve the local tumor response. 
5	Phenobarbital and cerebral blood flow during hypertension in the newborn beagle. Phenobarbital sodium has been used in anticonvulsant concentrations (15 to 40 micrograms/mL serum) in premature newborns in attempts to prevent periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhages. Although its clinical usefulness in this regard is controversial, phenobarbital treatment has been shown to reduce periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhages after hypertensive insult in newborn beagles. In this study cerebral blood flow values in steady state and during phenylephrine-induced hypertension with and without phenobarbital pretreatment were measured in newborn beagles. At anticonvulsant dosage, phenobarbital sodium decreased mean arterial blood pressure transiently during steady state and significantly reduced total cerebral blood flow during phenylephrine-induced hypertension without reducing mean arterial blood pressure. This phenobarbital sodium effect on cerebral blood flow was not as great in the presence of acidosis, and the initial hypotensive effect of phenobarbital sodium was sustained for a longer period of time during acidosis. Phenobarbital sodium may reduce the incidence of hemorrhages in the newborn brain by providing protection against isolated hemodynamic stresses characterized by acute increases in cerebral blood flow, with or without increased mean arterial blood pressure. 
4	Ten-year follow-up of survival and myocardial infarction in the randomized Coronary Artery Surgery Study The Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) randomized 780 patients to an initial strategy of coronary surgery or medical therapy. Of medically randomized patients, 6% had surgery within 6 months and a total of 40% had surgery by 10 years. At 10 years, there was no difference in cumulative survival (medical, 79% vs. surgical, 82%; NS) and no difference in percentage free of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (medical, 69% vs. surgical, 66%; NS). Patients with an ejection fraction of less than 0.50 exhibited a better survival with initial surgery treatment (medical, 61% vs. surgical, 79%; p = 0.01). Conversely, patients with an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 exhibited a higher proportion free of death and myocardial infarction with initial medical therapy (medical, 75% vs. surgical, 68%; p = 0.04) although long-term survival remained unaffected (medical, 84% vs. surgical, 83%; p = 0.75). There were no significant differences either in survival and freedom from nonfatal myocardial infarction, whether stratified on presence of heart failure, age, hypertension, or number of vessels diseased. Thus, 10-year follow-up results confirm earlier reports from CASS that patients with left ventricular dysfunction exhibit long-term benefit from an initial strategy of surgical treatment. Patients with mild stable angina and normal left ventricular function randomized to initial medical treatment (with an option for later surgery if symptoms progress) have survival equivalent to those patients randomized to initial surgery. 
5	Anaesthetic management of the brain dead for organ donation. An increasing number of anaesthetists is being called upon to manage organ donors during organ retrieval procedures. We briefly describe the technical aspects of the surgical procedure together with a guide to the anaesthetic management. The aims of the latter may be summarized as the "Rule of 100": systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg, urine output greater than 100 ml.hr-1, PaO2 greater than 100 mmHg, haemoglobin concentration greater than 100 g.L-1. Common management problems (hypotension, arrhythmias, diabetes insipidus, oliguria, and coagulopathy) are discussed in detail. The intraoperative management of the brain-dead organ donor provides the anaesthetist with the challenge of a major surgical procedure in a subject with important physiological derangements. 
2	Postanginal sepsis with dysphagia. We have described a 10-year-old girl who had dysphagia followed abruptly by arthritis. Streptococcus pyogenes was identified as the pathogen by fasciotomy with bone biopsy, and a tonsillar fluid collection confirmed the diagnosis of postanginal sepsis. The patient was cured by a 6-week course of parenteral antibiotics. 
5	Benign parotid tumors: a 24-year experience. The medical records of 125 patients benign parotid neoplasms surgically treated over a 24-year period were retrospectively reviewed; 128 tumors were excised. These included 90 pleomorphic adenomas, 33 Warthin's tumors, 3 benign lymphoepitheliomas, and 2 oncocytomas. The surgical procedures consisted of 2 local excisions, 6 enucleations, 88 superficial parotidectomies, 13 subtotal parotidectomies, and 3 radical parotidectomies. The morbidity rate was 49%. There was one total permanent facial nerve paralysis (0.7%), four (3%) partial permanent facial nerve paralysis, five (5%) transient total facial nerve paralysis, and 32 (25%) partial transient facial nerve paralysis. After a median follow-up of 84 months, there was one recurrence (0.7%). A superficial parotidectomy is the minimum procedure that should be performed for the treatment of a benign parotid neoplasm. 
4	Magnetic resonance imaging white matter lesions and cognitive impairment in hypertensive individuals. To search for a morphologic basis of cognitive impairment possibly associated with essential hypertension, we studied 35 otherwise asymptomatic hypertensive individuals (mean age, 38.7 years; range, 22 to 49 years) and 20 normotensive control subjects (mean age, 37.9 years; range, 26 to 49 years) using neuropsychologic tests and magnetic resonance imaging. Irrespective of drug treatment, hypertensive individuals performed significantly worse than did control subjects when assessed for verbal memory and total learning and memory capacity, while there were no differences in test results of visual memory, attention, vigilance, and reaction time. The hypertensive individuals also described themselves as less active but ranked similar on five other mood subscales. Punctate high-signal intensities of the white matter were found almost twice as often in the hypertensive group (38%) as in the control group (20%). There was no difference in test performance between hypertensive individuals with and those without white matter lesions, however. Our results confirm the presence of subtle neuropsychologic deficits and indicate a higher frequency of white matter signal abnormalities in essential hypertension, as shown on magnetic resonance imaging, but do not indicate a correlation of these findings with each other. 
1	Retroviral recombination and reverse transcription. Recombination occurs at a high rate in retroviral replication, and its observation requires a virion containing two different RNA molecules (heterodimeric particles). Analysis of retroviral recombinants formed after a single round of replication revealed that (i) the nonselected markers changed more frequently than expected from the rate of recombination of selected markers; (ii) the transfer of the initially synthesized minus strand strong stop DNA was either intramolecular or intermolecular; (iii) the transfer of the first synthesized plus strand strong stop DNA was always intramolecular; and (iv) there was a strong correlation between the type of transfer of the minus strand strong stop DNA and the number of template switches observed. These data suggest that retroviral recombination is ordered and occurs during the synthesis of both minus and plus strand DNA. 
1	Hemibody irradiation in advanced prostatic carcinoma. In summary, hemibody irradiation has developed as a safe, efficient technique for palliating multiple sites of symptomatic osseous metastases, which occur so often in advanced prostatic carcinoma. The rapidity, frequency, and duration of pain relief, as well as the convenience to the patient of a solitary treatment to multiple symptomatic areas simultaneously, make this type of treatment especially appealing. By following premedication and radiation dose guidelines, both acute and delayed side effects can be kept tolerable or at a minimal incidence. Although sequential hemibody radiation has also been explored as "systemic" therapy, the results in prostatic carcinoma have not proved dramatic, and complications have been considerable. Hormonal therapy would certainly seem to be less life-threatening and equally beneficial according to present data. As a palliative treatment, however, hemibody irradiation is a pragmatic option for relieving prostatic cancer pain. 
1	Cervicography for evaluating the "atypical" Papanicolaou smear. A study was designed to compare various case-finding procedures in the evaluation of patients with an "atypical" Papanicolaou smear. Six hundred eighty-one consecutive patients were referred to the Denver General Hospital Colposcopy Clinic for smears showing evidence of atypical nuclear and/or cytoplasmic changes insufficient to justify a cytologic diagnosis of dysplasia. A full colposcopic evaluation with appropriate directed biopsies was carried out on all the patients. Fourteen percent of the patients demonstrated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and 29% had condyloma without CIN. Both cervicography and the colposcopist's impression, though not ideal, were superior to a repeat smear, human papillomavirus typing or both. Cost effectiveness criteria and ease of training appear to justify the use of cervicography in the evaluation and triage of patients with atypical Papanicolaou smears. 
4	Human coronary transplantation-associated arteriosclerosis. Evidence for a chronic immune reaction to activated graft endothelial cells. Occlusive disease of coronary arteries of engrafted hearts is the major obstacle to long-term survival of human cardiac allografts. The pathogenesis of this process remains uncertain. The identity and localization of cells found in transplantation-associated arteriosclerosis lesions from human cardiac allografts were evaluated, and their expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (human leukocyte antigen-DR [HLA-DR]), surface molecules required for recognition of foreign cells by CD4+ T lymphocytes, was noted. Expanded intimas of transplanted coronary arteries contain T lymphocytes (both CD4+ and CD8+ in approximately equal number) and HLA-DR+ macrophages, both localized primarily in a ring immediately below the luminal endothelium, a distribution strikingly different from that in typical atherosclerosis. Coronary arterial endothelium from six of six transplanted hearts studied bore high levels of HLA-DR. Normal human arteries or usual atherosclerotic lesions have few if any HLA-DR+ endothelial cells. The significance of these findings was tested by evaluating the ability of HLA-DR+ arterial cells to interact with allogeneic T cells in vitro. Endothelial cells (but not smooth muscle cells) cultured from human arteries stimulated foreign CD4+ T cells to proliferate and augmented their secretion of interleukin-2. These findings suggest that ongoing stimulation of recipient T lymphocytes by HLA-DR+ endothelium of donor coronary arteries contributes to a sustained regional immune response. Consequent local release of cytokines may regulate smooth muscle cell proliferation and matrix accumulation within the coronary arteries of allografted hearts. 
1	Preoperative cell-mediated immune function and the prognosis of patients with gastric carcinoma. The cell-mediated immune function of 83 patients with gastric carcinoma was assessed preoperatively and the results were compared to that of 52 patients with benign lesions. The data were subjected to an analysis in order to evaluate their prognostic significance. The abilities to induce allogeneic cytotoxicity and to produce interleukin 2 (IL2) in patients with stage IV carcinoma were significantly depressed, as compared to those in patients with benign lesions, whereas natural killer (NK) cell activity was not significantly impaired. There was no significant correlation among these immune functions. When the patients were stratified into two groups, those who had high (greater than the mean value in patients with benign lesions) and low (less than the same value) values of these immune reactivities, the survival of patients with high NK activity (greater than or equal to 43%) was significantly better, as compared to that of patients with low cytotoxicity (less than 43%). However, there was no correlation between the survival and allogeneic cytotoxicity in these patients. The high ability to produce IL2 (greater than or equal to 1.3 U/ml) correlated with the better survival in the patients, but not in the group of patients who underwent curative resection. 
5	Ability of the c-mos product to associate with and phosphorylate tubulin. The mos proto-oncogene product, pp39mos, is a protein kinase and has been equated with cytostatic factor (CSF), an activity in unfertilized eggs that is thought to be responsible for the arrest of meiosis at metaphase II. The biochemical properties and potential substrates of pp39mos were examined in unfertilized eggs and in transformed cells in order to study how the protein functions both as CSF and in transformation. The pp39mos protein associated with polymers under conditions that favor tubulin oligomerization and was present in an approximately 500-kilodalton "core" complex under conditions that favor depolymerization. beta-Tubulin was preferentially coprecipitated in pp39mos immunoprecipitates and was the major phosphorylated product in a pp39mos-dependent immune complex kinase assay. Immunofluorescence analysis of NIH 3T3 cells transformed with Xenopus c-mos showed that pp39mos colocalizes with tubulin in the spindle during metaphase and in the midbody and asters during telophase. Disruption of microtubules with nocodazole affected tubulin and pp39mos organization in the same way. It therefore appears that pp39mos is a tubulin-associated protein kinase and may thus participate in the modification of microtubules and contribute to the formation of the spindle. This activity expressed during interphase in somatic cells may be responsible for the transforming activity of pp39mos. 
4	Carnitine palmitoyltransferase in cardiac ischemia. A potential site for altered fatty acid metabolism. The sensitivity of carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A (CoA) transferase I to inhibition of its activity by malonyl-CoA is progressively reduced in mitochondria isolated from ischemic cardiac cells as blood flow decreases to 30% or less of the preocclusion flow. The activity of carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase I in mitochondria isolated from nonischemic cardiac cells demonstrates incomplete inhibition, even at high concentrations of malonyl-CoA. Kinetic analyses of these data gave results most consistent with the expression of two overt enzyme activities: one activity that is sensitive to inhibition by malonyl-CoA and one activity that demonstrates little or no sensitivity to such inhibition. The decrease in malonyl-CoA-sensitive activity associated with ischemia results from a 13% decrease in the activity of the sensitive component and a corresponding 13% increase in the activity of the insensitive component. Decreased sensitivity of ischemic carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase I to inhibition by malonyl-CoA, together with potential fluctuations in the content of malonyl-CoA in tissue, would increase the synthesis of palmitoylcarnitine during ischemia and facilitate return to the use of fatty acid as a preferred metabolic fuel on reperfusion. This apparent conversion occurs concomitantly with a decrease in the free protein thiol content of the mitochondrial membranes isolated from ischemic cardiac cells. Treatment of the mitochondria from ischemic cardiac cells with dithiothreitol in vitro partially reverses the loss in sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, suggesting the possible role of thiol oxidation in the altered metabolism of ischemic mitochondria. Western blot analysis of these mitochondria using an antibody against carnitine palmitoyltransferase II purified from beef heart demonstrates a 68-kDa protein, which under ischemic conditions apparently is decreased by 2 kDa. These results are more indicative of a modification in protein folding of carnitine palmitoyltransferase than proteolytic changes during ischemia. 
5	Predisposing factors in bladder calculi. Review of 100 cases. One hundred patients, aged twenty to ninety-two years, underwent 111 procedures for removal of bladder calculi. Most patients (88) had some type of bladder outlet obstruction. Two types of stones were identified: those that had apparently formed in the upper tract and been trapped in the bladder (17 cases) and those that appeared to have formed in the bladder in the presence of various types of outlet obstruction. Stone analysis revealed uric acid stones in 50 percent, calcium oxalate stones in 19 percent, and stones of mixed composition in 31 percent. Five patients had metabolic abnormalities predisposing to stone formation; in 2 cases, these abnormalities were discovered during the evaluation for stone disease. Treatment depended on stone characteristics, associated pathology, and the general health of the patient. A review of the literature with regard to the morbidity and mortality of combining treatment of vesical calculi and bladder outlet obstruction secondary to prostatic obstruction is included. 
3	Coccydynia. Aetiology and treatment. A five-year prospective trial involving 120 patients was undertaken to investigate the aetiology and treatment of coccydynia. The cause lies in some localised musculoskeletal abnormality in the coccygeal region. Lumbosacral disc prolapse is not a significant factor. The condition is genuine and distressing and we found no evidence of neurosis in our patients. Physiotherapy was of little help in treatment but 60% of patients responded to local injections of corticosteroid and local anaesthesia. Manipulation and injection was even more successful and cured about 85%. Coccygectomy was required in almost 20% and had a success rate of over 90%. 
3	Germ cell tumor of testis in a patient with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Germ cell testicular tumor is a previously undescribed entity in association with von Hippel-Lindau disease. This case exemplifies the variety of pathologic entities encountered in von Hippel-Lindau disease and stresses the importance of thorough evaluation of the patient, as well as careful follow-up, to ensure early detection of potentially malignant lesions. 
4	Natural history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the elderly. The prognosis of patients diagnosed as having hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at advanced age has not been well defined. This study details follow-up information obtained for 95 patients initially diagnosed as having hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at age greater than or equal to 65 years. Seventy-five percent of patients were symptomatic, as defined by the presence of chest pain, dyspnea or syncope, and the mean ventricular septal thickness was 20 mm. The median duration of follow-up study was 4.2 years. The survival rate at 1 and 5 years was 95% and 76%, respectively, which was not significantly different from that an age- and gender-matched control group. Of patients presenting with New York Heart Association functional class I or II dyspnea, only 18% progressed to class III or IV during the follow-up period. However, patients presenting with class III dyspnea had a 1 year mortality rate of 36%, significantly higher than that of control subjects (p less than 0.003). Of the echocardiographic variables, indexed left atrial size was most strongly associated with reduced survival (p less than 0.008). These results suggest that the prognosis of elderly patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is generally favorable. Certain clinical and echocardiographic variables appear to be of use in identifying patients with a less favorable prognosis. 
1	Immunophenotypic analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia using routinely processed bone marrow specimens. Monoclonal antibodies have been recently developed that react with antigens expressed on T and B lymphocytes in routinely processed, paraffin-embedded lymphoid tissues. In this study, we assessed bone marrow clot and/or core biopsy sections of 19 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using routinely decalcified, B5- or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections and a panel of monoclonal antibodies, including LN1, LN2, L26, Leu-22, UCHL-1, and LCA. Each case had been previously phenotyped using freshly obtained aspirate material and a standard immunophenotypic protocol. Our results demonstrate the utility of the LN2 antibody in differentiating between precursor B-cell (pre-B) and precursor T-cell ALL. The LN2 antibody stained 11 of 12 cases of pre-B ALL and did not react with any of the seven T-cell ALLs. The other antibodies tested were less helpful. The Leu-22 antibody stained both pre-B and T-cell ALLs, while the results with UCHL-1 revealed peculiar nuclear staining of pre-B and T-cell ALLs; this we attributed to processing artifact. The L26 antibody reacted with only one case of pre-B ALL (also CD20 antigen positive), while the LN1 antibody did not react with any pre-B ALLs. Neither L26 nor LN1 stained any cases of T-cell ALL. The LCA antibody stained in only four (21%) of 19 cases, two pre-B and two T-cell ALLs. The results also suggest that this panel of antibodies may be useful in differentiating ALL from mature B-cell and T-cell lymphomas involving the bone marrow. 
2	Immunohistochemical demonstration of acetaldehyde-modified epitopes in human liver after alcohol consumption. Acetaldehyde, the toxic product of ethanol metabolism in the liver, covalently binds to a variety of proteins. Recent studies indicate that such binding can stimulate the production of antibodies against the acetaldehyde adducts. We raised rabbit antibodies which recognized various protein-acetaldehyde conjugates but not the corresponding control proteins. Such antibodies were used in immunohistochemical studies to find out whether acetaldehyde-generated epitopes can be detected from liver specimens of 13 human subjects with different degrees of alcohol consumption. While the specimens obtained from alcohol abusers (n = 4) and alcoholics (n = 3) exhibited marked positive staining for acetaldehyde adducts inside the hepatocytes in a granular uneven pattern, the control samples (n = 6) were almost devoid of immunoreactivity. In the alcohol abusers with an early stage of alcohol-induced liver damage, staining was detected exclusively around the central veins. The data indicate that intracellular acetaldehyde adducts occur in the centrilobular region of the liver of individuals consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. Immunohistochemical detection of such adducts may prove to be of value in the early identification of alcohol abuse and in elucidating the mechanisms of alcohol-induced organ damage. 
4	Cholesterol screening in 5,719 self-referred elderly subjects. To assess the frequency of hypercholesterolemia as a potential major public health problem in the elderly, we studied 5,719 self-referred subjects greater than age 60 and 11,890 less than or equal to 60 years, whose nonfasting capillary blood cholesterol levels were measured during an 18-month screening in Cincinnati area grocery stores. We followed National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines for serum cholesterol (less than 200 mg/dl "desirable," 200-239 "borderline-high," and greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl "high"). Of 4,011 61-70 year-olds, only 19% had capillary blood total cholesterol less than 200, 38% were 200-239, and 43% greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl. Of 1,493 aged 71-80 years, only 20% had total cholesterol less than 200, 36% had levels 200-239, and 44% were greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl. In 215 subjects, 81 and over, 29% had total cholesterol less than 200, 36% were 200-239, and 35% were greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl. Application of the non-age, non-race, non-sex specific National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines to the elderly may necessitate followup and perhaps therapy in 71-81% of subjects, suggesting that the appropriate intervention approach be general population-oriented, rather than the individual detection, diagnosis, and treatment approach which presents a huge, expensive load for a relatively unprepared health care community. 
5	Cytokine regulation of IL-1 beta gene expression in the human polymorphonuclear leukocyte. Although recently polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) have been identified as producers of IL-1 beta in response to LPS and granulocyte/monocyte colony stimulating factor, little is known regarding the ability of other cytokines to induce the production of IL-1 beta in the PMN. Inasmuch as IL-1 and TNF have been shown to be important priming agents, as well as agents that induce migration of PMN, we investigated their effect on IL-1 beta gene expression in human peripheral blood PMN. In the present study, we demonstrate that human peripheral blood PMN produce IL-1 beta in response to IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha. Control (unstimulated) human PMN had virtually undetectable levels of IL-1 beta mRNA. Either IL-1 beta or TNF, induced PMN to transiently express IL-1 beta mRNA with peak expression at 1 h, returning to untreated levels by 2 h. A dose response indicated that as little as 0.05 ng/ml of IL-1 beta or TNF resulted in IL-1 beta induction, with maximal effects at 1 ng/ml of IL-1 beta and 5 ng/ml of TNF. IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta exhibited similar dose responses in IL-1 beta mRNA induction. Inasmuch as cytokines have been shown to have synergistic effects in cell function studies, we induced PMN with a combination of maximally effective doses of TNF plus IL-1 beta. They demonstrated a cooperative effect on IL-1 beta gene expression, in that mRNA levels were sustained for three hours. IL-1 beta Ag expression, as measured by ELISA, paralleled IL-1 beta mRNA expression with cell associated peak levels at 2 to 4 h. IL-1 beta Ag levels in PMN lysates and supernatants correlated with IL-1 beta mRNA levels, i.e., TNF + IL-1 greater than TNF greater than IL-1. Thus, these studies represent the first demonstration of IL-1 and TNF induction of IL-1 beta gene expression in the PMN. Furthermore, the time course of induction is unique to the PMN, with peak induction of mRNA at 1 h, which is consistent with the short lived nature of these cells in inflammatory lesions. 
1	Lipolytic factors associated with murine and human cancer cachexia. We have identified a lipolytic factor in extracts of a cachexia-inducing murine carcinoma (MAC16) that shows characteristics of an acidic peptide and appears to be composed of three fractions of apparent molecular weights corresponding to 3 kd, 1.5 kd, and 0.7 kd, as determined by exclusion chromatography. Material with identical chromatographic and molecular weight characteristics was also present in the serum of patients with clinical cancer cachexia but absent from normal serum, even under conditions of starvation. The MAC16 lipid factor, when injected into animals bearing the non-cachexia-inducing tumor MAC13, was capable of inducing weight loss without a significant reduction in food intake. Similar lipolytic material, although in lower concentration, was also found in the MAC13 tumor extracts. These findings suggest that cachexia may arise from the enhanced expression of a lipolytic factor associated with tumor cells. 
2	Symptoms of achalasia in young women mistaken as indicating primary anorexia nervosa. The case of a young women with dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight loss, who was diagnosed as having anorexia nervosa but in whom reevaluation showed that achalasia was causing the symptoms, is presented together with related observations. Misinterpretation of esophageal symptoms may occur not only as a consequence of inadequate history taking and of being biased by a patient's emaciation, age, and gender, which leads to view certain aspects of the patient's history and behavior as suggesting a pathologic attitude towards eating and body weight, but also as a consequence of a misinterpretation of the symptoms as indicative of an eating disorder by the patients themselves. In some cases a disordered attitude toward eating and body weight may develop together or coexist with achalasia. The clinical evaluation of patients with symptoms suggestive of anorexia nervosa but also of bulimia nervosa should include the taking of a thorough history regarding swallowing and vomiting in order to recognize a possible esophageal motor disorder. 
1	Synergistic inhibition by verapamil and quinine of P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance in a human myeloma cell line model. In an effort to develop a clinically useful approach to overcoming P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR1), we evaluated combined chemosensitization with verapamil and quinine in a multidrug-resistant (MDR) human myeloma cell line model. In clonogenic assay, verapamil was used at concentrations from 0.1 to 1.0 micrograms/mL, bracketing the plasma levels achieved by oral administration and high-dose intravenous (IV) infusion, respectively. The dose of quinine was held constant at 1.0 micrograms/mL, a plasma concentration readily achieved by oral administration. At each dose level of verapamil tested, the combination with quinine proved more effective than either drug individually in reversing resistance to doxorubicin and vinblastine and synergistic chemosensitizing interaction was observed. Verapamil at 0.1 microgram/mL combined with quinine was capable of restoring sensitivity to doxorubicin fully and reduced resistance to vinblastine as effectively as verapamil alone at 1.0 micrograms/mL. Furthermore, the combination of 1.0 mumol verapamil with 10 mumols quinine increased accumulation and retention of anthracycline in the resistant cells to a greater extent than did either drug individually (P less than .001) and inhibited drug efflux as effectively as verapamil alone at 10 mumols. Our findings suggest that combined chemosensitization with verapamil and quinine may prove useful for overcoming MDR1 in patients with drug-refractory B-cell neoplasms such as multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. 
3	Mechanism of stroke in patients taking aspirin. During a 1-year period, we prospectively studied the mechanism and severity of stroke in 47 patients sustaining a cerebral infarction while taking aspirin. The mechanism of stroke was undetermined in 12 patients (26%). In the remaining 35 patients, we identified 39 potential mechanisms: large-artery atherosclerosis (19 patients, 40%), cardioembolism (15 patients, 32%), and small-vessel occlusive disease (5 patients, 11%). Of 11 patients with carotid atherosclerosis and stroke, 9 (82%) had greater than 90% carotid stenosis or occlusion; of 12 patients with stroke of undetermined mechanism, 10 (83%) had previous stroke, of which 8 were also of undetermined mechanisms. Disability after stroke was moderate or severe in 27 patients (57%). These data suggest that (1) stroke in patients taking aspirin has a variety of etiologies and frequently causes moderate or severe disability; (2) patients with carotid disease failing aspirin often have high-grade carotid stenosis or occlusion; (3) stroke of undetermined mechanism may recur more frequently than other stroke subtypes in patients taking aspirin. 
1	Partial and total penectomy for cancer. Squamous carcinoma of the penis remains an uncommon tumor in the United States. In the properly selected patient, partial or total penectomy performed with an understanding of the salient surgical anatomy results in adequate local control of these cancers with excellent functional and cosmetic results. 
5	Circumflex artery ventricular fistula and pseudoaneurysm after mitral reoperation. Prosthetic mitral valve reoperation complicated by atrioventricular groove pseudoaneurysm and circumflex ventricular fistula is presented. Ligation of the circumflex artery during mitral valve replacement is implicated after review of a previous cardiac angiogram. 
5	The transoral approach for the management of intradural lesions at the craniovertebral junction: review of 7 cases. The main difficulty in dealing with intradural lesions located ventrally in the region of the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) is related to their relative inaccessibility. Posterolateral approaches involve some manipulation of the brain stem and provide limited access because of the necessity of working between the cranial nerves. Even then, the view of the ventral midline and across is limited. The transoral approach, which has been widely used for the management of extradural lesions in this area, is also useful for the treatment of intradural lesions. It provides an unimpeded although somewhat restricted, view of the ventral aspect of the CVJ without the need for brain retraction. The cranial nerves and vertebral arteries are not interposed between the surgeon and the lesion. The risks of cerebrospinal fluid leakage and infection are greatly diminished by the use of fibrin adhesive and prolonged diversion of the cerebrospinal fluid. The use of this approach, together with its technical difficulties and results, in the management of seven purely intradural lesions located ventrally at the CVJ, is discussed. 
5	Crohn's disease and pregnancy. Seventy-eight pregnancies in 50 patients were reviewed to evaluate the effects of Crohn's disease on the outcome of pregnancy and the influence of the pregnancy on the course of Crohn's disease. Overall, 21 pregnancies (27 percent) had abnormal outcomes including spontaneous abortions (9), infants small for gestational age (6), premature infants (5), and infants who developed respiratory distress (1). Eight (50 percent) patients with active disease compared with 13 (21 percent) patients with inactive disease at conception had abnormal outcomes (P less than 0.05). During pregnancy 15 (55 percent) with active disease and 6 (12 percent) with inactive disease had an abnormal outcome (P less than 0.001). Neither medical nor surgical treatment, independent of disease activity, appeared to affect the outcome adversely. Eighteen of 73 (25 percent) patients with quiescent or mild disease relapsed, and seven of 16 patients with some disease activity improved (44 percent). Of 34 patients on medication, nine relapsed (27 percent), and of 39 patients not on medication, nine relapsed (24 percent) (P = N.S.). These results suggest that the outcome of pregnancy is not adversely affected by Crohn's disease. However, patients with active disease at conception and/or during the pregnancy have poorer outcomes independent of the use of medication or requirement of surgery. Neither pregnancy nor medications taken affect the course of the disease. 
1	Oral findings in HIV-infected patients attending a department of internal medicine: the contribution of intraoral examination towards the clinical management of HIV disease The occurrence of oral mucosal lesions was studied in 70 consecutive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, including 35 patients with AIDS, who had been admitted to a Department of Internal Medicine. Lesions of the oral mucosa were observed in 52 patients (74 per cent). Oral candidiasis (50 per cent), hairy leukoplakia (14 per cent), periodontal disease (13 per cent), and oral Kaposi's sarcoma (4 per cent) were the most common lesions. Oral mucosal lesions suggestive of HIV infection were present in ten of 12 patients of unknown HIV status in whom Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was suspected. Close cooperation between the medical and dental professions is recommended since accurate intraoral examination can make a valuable contribution towards the clinical management of HIV-infected patients and may influence the CDC classification of this disease. 
1	Multiple intracranial tumors of different cell types. Multiple intracranial tumors of different cell types are rare. We report nine patients with multiple intracranial tumors, who did not have a history of trauma, irradiation, or phacomatosis. The clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings as well as indications for operations in patients with asymptomatic second tumors are discussed. 
5	Cytologic diagnosis of aspergillosis in cardiac transplantation. Fine-needle aspiration of the lung is now widely utilized to diagnose pulmonary neoplasms, but often serologic techniques or open-lung biopsy is relied on for the diagnosis of infectious pulmonary processes. We report a series of four patients in whom the fine-needle aspiration technique was used to make the rapid cytologic diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis. Culture confirmation was also obtained on the aspirated material. A discussion of the available techniques for the laboratory diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis is presented and the advantages of fine-needle aspiration cytology are stressed. Our favorable results support expanded use of fine-needle aspiration cytology in the evaluation of lung nodules appearing in immunosuppressed populations. 
1	Immunohistochemical evaluation of seven monoclonal antibodies for differentiation of pleural mesothelioma from lung adenocarcinoma. A panel of seven monoclonal antibodies including anti-vimentin, anti-keratin markers AE1/AE3 and EAB902, human milk fat globule (HMFG-2), B72.3, anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and anti-Leu-M1 were used for an immunoperoxidase staining assay to determine their value in the differentiation of pleural mesothelioma from lung adenocarcinoma. Anti-vimentin positively identified 86% of the mesotheliomas and none of the adenocarcinomas. AE1/AE3, EAB902, and B72.3 reacted with a high percentage of both mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma specimens. With HMFG-2, both membrane and cytoplasmic staining was observed in 92% of the adenocarcinomas and in 14% of the mesotheliomas, whereas 26% of the mesotheliomas only exhibited membrane staining. Eighty percent of the adenocarcinomas and 8% of the mesothelioma tissues stained with anti-Leu-M1. Anti-CEA did not react with any of the 50 mesotheliomas tested but did react with 95% of the lung adenocarcinomas tested. From this study, it was concluded that anti-CEA and anti-Leu-M1 were the most effective of the seven tumor markers evaluated; and that 100% of the pleural mesothelioma tissues could be correctly differentiated from lung adenocarcinomas using a panel consisting of anti-vimentin, HMFG-2, anti-CEA and anti-Leu-M1 monoclonal antibodies. 
5	The efficacy of azathioprine in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. We randomized 59 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis to receive azathioprine (AZA) 3.0 mg/kg daily or placebo in a double-masked therapeutic trial. Analysis of data for predetermined primary outcome measures demonstrated a significant difference favoring AZA for observed mean exacerbation rate after 2 years of therapy and time to deterioration in both Ambulation Index and Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale score. This study confirms a modest therapeutic benefit for azathioprine previously reported by other investigators. 
3	Vigabatrin: rational treatment for chronic epilepsy. Vigabatrin is a selective, irreversible suicide inhibitor of GABA transaminase and thus increases brain and CSF GABA. In 33 adult patients with long standing refractory epilepsy on treatment with one or two standard anti-convulsant drugs, the addition of vigabatrin up to 3g daily for eight weeks was associated with a 48.2% reduction in seizure frequency. Twenty patients who had exhibited a 50% or more reduction in frequency of one or more seizure types entered an eight week double-blind placebo controlled phase. Patients on vigabatrin maintained a 54.7% reduction of seizure frequency, whereas those on placebo showed an 18.6% increase in seizure frequency, a highly significant difference between the two groups. In the open phase, seven patients were withdrawn due to unacceptable and reversible adverse events. The commonest side effects were drowsiness, depression and mood instability, and headaches. Vigabatrin is a potentially valuable new treatment for chronic epilepsy, especially partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation. 
4	Use of auscultation to follow patients with mitral systolic clicks and murmurs. Mitral systolic clicks and murmurs together with associated symptoms constitute a major reason for cardiologic referral. Although echocardiography with Doppler study enables characterization of the mitral valve apparatus and quantification of regurgitation, its use has resulted in an overemphasis of the technical diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse and an undervaluation of diagnosis based on physical examination. To determine the clinical significance of an auscultatory classification of mitral systolic clicks with or without precordial systolic murmurs, 1 consultant's medical records of 291 patients with these signs were reviewed. Based on initial auscultatory findings, patients were divided into: (1) single or multiple apical systolic clicks with no murmur (n = 99); (2) single or multiple apical systolic clicks and a late systolic murmur (n = 129); and (3) single or multiple apical clicks and an apical pansystolic murmur or murmur beginning in the first half of systole (n = 63). The average duration of patient follow-up was 8 years (range 1 to 30). The prognosis was excellent for patients from all 3 classes. Two cardiac-related deaths occurred: 1 each from classes 1 and 2. Mitral valve surgery was performed in 3 class 2 patients (2%) and in 2 class 3 patients (3%). No patients developed endocarditis during follow-up. Palpitations, with varying anxiety overlay, constituted a major indication for cardiologic referral in all 3 classes. Auscultatory findings were valuable to the physician for explanation and relief of patient anxiety. For patient management, use of an auscultatory classification may be preferable to the technically generated term "mitral valve prolapse.". 
1	Soft tissue sarcoma with additional anaplastic components. A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 27 cases. This clinicopathologic study concerns 27 cases of "dedifferentiated" soft tissue sarcoma (DSTS), including 14 liposarcomas, six leiomyosarcomas, five chondrosarcomas, and two rhabdomyosarcomas. In addition, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical survey of 23 cases and an electron microscopic examination of three. The findings were compared with observations of 32 cases of de novo malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH). All tumors contained additional distinct anaplastic portions indistinguishable from MFH under conventional light microscopy, ultrastructurally, and in cases of immunoreactivity for alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-1-antitrypsin and on lectin histochemical findings for ricinus communis agglutinin and concanavalin agglutinin. The desmin reactivity present in anaplastic portions of 14 DSTS and in eight de novo MFH is taken to mean that myofibroblasts are present in these tumors. The anaplastic components of DSTS are presumed to represent the proliferation of another clone of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that fail to differentiate along any specific lineage other than fibroblast-like cells, histiocyte-like cells, and myofibroblasts. Nineteen patients died of tumor and four are alive and well 1.6, 1.7, 2.1, and 5.2 years after the initial treatment, respectively. 
1	Primary Ewing sarcoma: follow-up with Ga-67 scintigraphy. While avid accumulation of gallium-67 citrate and technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) occurs initially in most cases of primary Ewing sarcoma, uptake after therapy is less well defined. Thirty patients with Ewing sarcoma who underwent Ga-67 and bone scintigraphy at diagnosis, at completion of therapy, and at relapse from 1978 to 1988 were evaluated. All 30 patients showed less primary site Ga-67 activity following therapy. Twenty-three of 28 patients who underwent corresponding bone scintigraphy showed less uptake, but residual activity was usually more intense than with Ga-67. Avid reaccumulation of Ga-67 occurred in four of five patients with primary site relapse, while patients who underwent bone scintigraphy showed less change. It was concluded that a greater decrease in Ga-67 than in Tc-99m MDP uptake often occurs in patients successfully treated for primary Ewing sarcoma. Information obtained at Ga-67 scintigraphy is most likely to be helpful if results of bone scintigraphy remain abnormal or if occult relapse is suspected. 
2	Endemic Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia infections in a Thai orphanage. We conducted a point prevalence survey for enteric protozoa in 205 institutionalized orphans 1-61 months of age in Bangkok, Thailand. Cryptosporidium was identified in 17 children (8%), Giardia lamblia in 42 (20%), and 3 children (1%) had both parasites. At the time of diagnosis, diarrheal symptoms were present in a minority of subjects: 36% of children with Cryptosporidium alone, 10% with G. lamblia alone, and in 20% of those with neither parasite. Although chronic nutritional status (height/age) was similar in all groups, acute nutritional status (weight/height) was lower only in children with Cryptosporidium (Z score = -1.39 +/- 0.13) compared with children with G. lamblia (mean Z score +/- SEM = -0.56 +/- 0.26) or neither parasite (Z score = -0.78 +/- 0.13; P = 0.05). Detectable levels of Cryptosporidium-specific IgG antibodies by ELISA were identified in 15 of 16 Thai children with Cryptosporidium and in 17 of 19 Thai children without Cryptosporidium (mean OD +/- SEM = 1.27 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.06 +/- 0.13, respectively), but in only 1 of 18 sera from toddlers in day-care centers in Denver, CO (OD = 0.128 +/- 0.03). Although neither infection with Cryptosporidium nor G. lamblia was consistently associated with acute diarrheal symptoms, Cryptosporidium was more often associated with depressed acute nutritional status than G. lamblia. The high prevalence of specific antibodies to Cryptosporidium in Thai orphans suggests an association between high rates of exposure with asymptomatic excretion of the parasites. 
5	Multimodality cisplatin treatment in nonresectable alpha-fetoprotein-positive hepatoma. Twenty-eight patients with alpha-fetoprotein-positive (AFP+) nonresectable hepatoma have been enrolled in a new multimodality Phase I, II program. Induction therapy consisted of 50 mg/m2 intravenous cisplatin followed by 2100 cGy irradiation to the tumor volume in seven fractions over 10 days. Hepatic arterial infusion of 50 mg/m2 cisplatin (IA-CDDP) was then administered at monthly intervals. Twenty-one patients have completed induction and at least two cycles of IA-CDDP. Twelve-month cumulative survival was 52% for all 28 patients and 69% for the 21 patients completing induction and IA-CDDP. Median survival has not yet been reached. Response rate (complete and partial) was 36% overall and 48% among the 21 patients who completed treatment. The improved survival of the present series of patients as well as the minimal hematologic toxicity suggests possible further integration of new modalities for therapy. 
5	Coronary artery bypass grafting in elderly patients. Comparative results in a consecutive series of 469 patients older than 75 years. A consecutive series of 7104 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting during an 18-year period (1971 to 1988) included 469 patients older than 75 years. Results were analyzed to determine comparative risk factors for morbidity, early and late survival, and functional outcome. Patients younger than 75 years (group I) and patients older than 75 years (group II) were identical for ejection fraction and standard hemodynamic indices. Mean number of grafts and crossclamp time were greater for group II patients (p less than 0.01). Mean age of group I was 58.6 years and group II, 77.6 years (p less than 0.01). Women composed 19.7% (1308/6635) of group I and 36.2% (170/469) of group II patients (p less than 0.05). Mammary grafts were placed in 57.7% (3830/6635) of group I and 41.6% (195/469) of group II patients (p less than 0.05). Overall perioperative mortality rate was 2.1% for group I and 6.8% for group II (p less than 0.05). Perioperative myocardial infarction rate was similar for the two groups. Ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, renal insufficiency, neurologic complications, prolonged ventilatory support, increased hospital cost, and prolonged hospitalization were significantly more prevalent (all p less than 0.05) in patients older than 75 years. Five and 10 years postoperatively, there were no significant differences between groups I and II with regard to event-free status including angina, myocardial infarction, and reoperation. The 5-year survival rate was 92% for group I and 80% for group II (p less than 0.05), similar to that of age-matched control subjects. The significantly increased potential for complications and expense of coronary bypass in patients over 75 years of age mandates judicious patient selection and preoperative counseling. Despite a significantly increased early mortality and an anticipated decreased long-term survival paralleling normal life table survival curves, good intermediate functional improvement can be realized in patients older than 75 years, comparable with that expected in a much younger age group. 
4	Ventricular arrhythmias after correction of ventricular septal defects: importance of surgical approach. To compare the prevalence of conduction disturbances and ventricular arrhythmias in cases of postoperative ventricular septal defect, 100 patients (50 with repair by right atriotomy, group 1; and 50 with repair by right ventriculotomy, group 2) underwent complete evaluation including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and 24 h ambulatory ECG monitoring. The two groups were comparable except for a shorter follow-up duration (7 +/- 3 versus 12.4 +/- 7 years) and a younger age at evaluation (12.4 +/- 5 versus 16.9 +/- 7 years) in group 1. Complete right bundle branch block was less frequent in group 1 than in group 2 (20% versus 50%, p less than 0.05) but three of the four patients with complete atrioventricular (AV) block detected on ambulatory monitoring were in group 1. Six patients had significant supraventricular arrhythmias, all well tolerated. Ambulatory monitoring revealed significant ventricular arrhythmias (modified Lown grade 2 or higher) in 39 patients, with a lower prevalence in group 1 (30% versus 48%, p = 0.05). No correlation was found between prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias and right ventricular systolic pressure, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, presence of a synthetic patch, previous pulmonary artery banding, presence of complete right bundle branch block and cardiomegaly on chest X-ray film. Prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias increased with follow-up duration, age at evaluation and age at surgery. These were always well tolerated and did not warrant treatment. Thus, right atriotomy reduces the prevalence of right bundle branch block but does not prevent late AV block. Ventricular arrhythmias are frequent after surgical closure of ventricular septal defect whatever the surgical approach and their prevalence is not statistically different from that in postoperative tetralogy of Fallot. 
2	Gallbladder dynamics in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and essential dyspepsia. To assess whether gallbladder motility is altered in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or essential dyspepsia (ED), we studied gallbladder function in 25 healthy volunteers, 20 patients with IBS, and 22 with ED. By real time ultrasonography, we studied the following parameters: (a) fasting gallbladder volume, (b) maximum percent of gallbladder emptied, (c) time required for maximal contraction, (d) residual volume after maximal contraction, and (e) percent fasting volume at 2 h. All parameters, except fasting gallbladder volume, were measured after a high-fat meal. The fasting gallbladder volume, maximum percent of gallbladder emptied, time required for maximal contraction, residual volume after maximal contraction, and percent fasting volume at 2 h in controls and patients with IBS was 19.3 +/- 8.8 ml and 24.4 +/- 9.7 ml, 67.1 +/- 10.7% and 67.6 +/- 13.5%, 41 +/- 20.6 min and 49.7 +/- 25.3 min, 6.2 +/- 3.3 ml and 7.6 +/- 5.3 ml, and 38.1 +/- 12.2% and 40.7 +/- 14.5%, respectively. The differences between the two groups were statistically not significant. The corresponding values in patients with ED were 15.5 +/- 6.3 ml, 57.6 +/- 16.5%, 51.8 +/- 29.3 min, 6.1 +/- 3.2 ml, 44.1 +/- 17%, respectively. Compared with controls there was no statistically significant difference in these parameters, except the maximum percent of gallbladder emptied, which was significantly less than that in controls (57.6 +/- 16.5% vs. 67.1 +/- 10.7%; p less than 0.05). Therefore, we could not find that patients with IBS have any abnormality of gallbladder function; postprandially, patients with ED have submaximal contraction of the gallbladder. 
3	Heterogeneity in progressive aphasia due to focal cortical atrophy. A clinical and PET study. Six patients with a slowly progressive aphasic disorder due to degenerative cortical disease are reported. The length of history varied from 18 months to 6 years. In 5 patients, there was a naming deficit, associated in 4 of these with some abnormalities in comprehension. One patient had a progressive history of reduced speech output, which was associated with an orofacial dyspraxia. All patients were studied neuropsychologically, and in addition regional cerebral metabolism was measured using position emission tomography. A localized left hemisphere deficit was found in all patients except 1, who had the longest history and the most profound clinical deficit, and who also had right hemisphere hypometabolism. The major brunt of the deficit was in the anterior portion of the left temporal lobe in all but 1 case, the patient with poor speech output who had a more severe left posterior frontal deficit. These findings suggest that in progressive aphasia due to focal cortical atrophy there is heterogeneity in the clinical presentation and anatomical site of the deficit, with possible implications for the underlying aetiology. 
5	Efficacy of thrombolysis in infrainguinal bypass grafts. The initial outcome of a consecutive series of 43 intra-arterial urokinase infusions for thrombosed infrainguinal grafts in 37 patients was analyzed. There was an 88% (38/43) technical success rate (complete clot lysis) and a 74% (32/43) clinical success rate. Complications occurred in 10 patients (23%) and were related to bleeding in four patients (9%). Patient age, graft age, location, material, and the duration of occlusion did not significantly influence the initial outcome, although there was a trend toward a higher bleeding complication rate among grafts less than or equal to 1 month of age at the time of thrombolysis. A second group of 43 infrainguinal grafts successfully recanalized using regional infusions of thrombolytic agents were followed for long-term patency. This group included 32 grafts successfully treated with urokinase and 11 grafts recanalized with streptokinase. By life-table analysis there was a 55.6% 1-year patency, which fell to 42.4% at 4 years. Vein grafts had significantly (p = 0.01) better long-term patency than prosthetic grafts (69.3% versus 28.6% at 30 months). Grafts with flow-limiting lesions identified and corrected by angioplasty or surgery also had significantly (p = 0.01) better long-term patency than those without such lesions (79.0% versus 9.8% at 2 years). Based on the results of our study compared with a survey of long-term results following secondary surgical procedures for thrombosed infrainguinal grafts, thrombolysis can be recommended in several circumstances. Thrombolysis is indicated for thrombosed vein grafts or when thrombus is present in distal runoff vessels. Thrombosed prosthetic grafts should be replaced by autogenous vein grafts whenever possible. 
3	Assessing the severity of dementia. Patient and caregiver. In dementia there is cognitive impairment, disability in daily life, and sometimes behavioral disturbance. These changes are a burden for the caregivers of patients with dementia. Few studies are available that examine all these aspects and their interrelationships in a single patient group. In our study we selected detailed methods for assessment of all these aspects. Interrelationships were studied in 30 mild to moderately impaired patients with dementia and their caregivers. Although the relations of cognitive deterioration to disability in daily life and of burden experienced by the caregiver to patient's condition were stronger than often reported, it was impossible to deduce the overall severity of dementia from one single aspect. Thus, for effective management of patients and caregivers, for evaluation of individual treatment or of clinical trials, attention should be paid to all the different aspects of patients' condition and caregivers' burden. Outcome measurements will then be more valid. 
4	Symptomatic pericardial effusion in breast cancer patients: the role of fluid cytology. Clinical and cytologic findings in 21 breast cancer patients with symptomatic pericardial effusion are presented. The etiology of the pericardial effusion was definitely malignant, by cytology/histology in 13 patients (62%), and suspected malignant by cytology in 2 patients (9%). One patient (5%) with definitely nonmalignant pericardial effusion by cytology was found to be histologically positive at autopsy. In 5 patients (24%) there was no histological/cytological evidence of malignancy; radiation pericarditis could be the etiology in 4 of these 5 patients. The median time from the diagnosis of breast cancer to the development of symptomatic pericardial effusion was 60 months (range: 1-219 months). Ten patients developed cardiac tamponade; they were treated by either pericardiocentesis or pericardiectomy. The mean survival of patients with negative cytology/histology was 12 months; patients with suspicious cytology had a mean survival of 9 months; patients with malignant effusion, treated by pericardiectomy, had a mean survival of 22.3 months, while patients with malignant pericardial effusion, who were not subjected to surgery, had a mean survival of 4.7 months, only. It is concluded that the etiology of symptomatic pericardial effusion in breast cancer patients is not always malignant, which emphasizes the role of fluid cytology in establishing definite diagnosis. The survival probability is a function of the extent of extracardiac disease; among patients with malignant pericardial effusion those selected for pericardiectomy have a longer than average survival. 
4	Ataxia-telangiectasia: an interdisciplinary approach to pathogenesis. Ataxia-telangiectasia is a syndrome with many facets, involving a progressive cerebellar ataxia, immunodeficiency, cancer susceptibility, radiosensitivity, defects in DNA repair/processing, chromosomal breakage and rearrangements, elevated serum alphafetoprotein, and premature aging. Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder, rare in outbred populations; carriers of the ataxia-telangiectasia gene may be as common as 1 in 60 and have subclinical radiosensitivity and cancer susceptibility. One estimate suggests that 8.8% of patients with breast cancer could be carriers of ataxia-telangiectasia. These carriers may be responsible for underestimating normal tolerance doses for radiation therapy by 15% to 20%; thus by preselecting and excluding carriers of ataxia-telangiectasia from cohorts of patients with cancer, conventional radiation doses might be increased so as to improve greatly the efficacy of radiotherapy. The genes for the 3 most common ataxia-telangiectasia complementation groups, which include 97% of tested families, have recently been localized to the long arm of chromosome 11. 
5	Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. A retrospective review of 94 patients who had undergone anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was performed to analyze the result in patients who had a diagnosis of posterolateral spondylosis, disc herniation, or both. Although in 23 of 94 patients additional adjacent asymptomatic levels of spondylosis were noted, only the symptomatic levels were addressed in the 94 cases. Postoperatively two cases of dysphagia were noted, as well as a 4% pseudarthrosis rate. There was an 88% good or excellent result when no additional spondylosis was present, but only a 60% good or excellent result when just the symptomatic levels were addressed, leaving unoperated adjacent levels of spondylosis. 
5	Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in patients who undergo open heart surgery. To determine whether heparin-dependent antiplatelet antibodies (HAAb) have an effect on morbidity and/or mortality rates, we reviewed the cases of 3438 patients who underwent open heart surgery from 1981 to 1989. Forty-six patients (1.3%) had HAAb. The patients were divided into two groups: those patients who were known to have HAAb before surgery (group I) and those patients who were diagnosed with HAAb after surgery (group II). Group I patients (n = 5) were pretreated with platelet-inhibiting drugs before reexposure to heparin during cardiopulmonary bypass and were maintained with strict abstinence from heparin afterward. Their lowest observed platelet counts ranged from 42,000/mm3 to 89,000/mm3 (median, 63,00/mm3). Thromboembolic complications did not occur, and all patients survived. Group II patients (n = 41) who were diagnosed to have HAAb after surgery had not been pretreated with platelet-inhibiting drugs before surgery. Lowest platelet counts ranged from 11,000/mm3 to 128,000/mm3 (median, 42,000/mm3). Bleeding complications occurred in 21 patients (51%), and thromboembolic complications occurred in 13 patients (32%). Hospital mortality in group II patients was 37%. Late recognition of HAAb was associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality rates. Thromboembolic complications of HAAb, which had been diagnosed before surgery, were eliminated, and bleeding was reduced by pretreatment with platelet-inhibiting drugs and strict abstinence from heparin after surgery. 
4	Strain differences in baroreflex inhibition by centrally infused enalapril in old rats. To determine whether inhibition of the brain renin-angiotensin system would affect baroreflexes similarly in old rats of different strains, we compared 24-month-old male Fischer 344 and Sprague-Dawley rats. Baroreflex sensitivity was tested while the rats were awake by recording reflex heart rate responses elicited as blood pressure was elevated with phenylephrine or lowered with sodium nitroprusside. Sprague-Dawley rats had higher blood pressures and lower heart rates initially. Chronic infusion of enalapril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, into a lateral cerebral ventricle (ICV) for two weeks lowered blood pressure in Sprague-Dawley but not in Fischer 344 rats. Furthermore, reflex bradycardia was unaffected in either rat strain, but reflex tachycardia was selectively suppressed in Fischer 344 rats. Thus, although time controls were not done to rule out spontaneous changes during the 14-day infusion period, these results suggest that central cardiovascular regulation does not change similarly with age in these two rat strains. As removal of the brain renin-angiotensin system lowered blood pressure in one strain and inhibited reflex tachycardia in the other, the divergence could mean that the brain renin-angiotensin system acts differently to keep blood pressure elevated in Sprague-Dawley rats and modulate reflex tachycardia in Fischer 344 rats. 
1	Primary malignant melanoma of the lower respiratory tract. Report of a case and literature review. The authors report a case of primary bronchial malignant melanoma, occurring in a 34-year-old woman presenting with persistent cough. At bronchoscopic examination, a polypoid mass was found to occlude the left mainstem bronchus. Biopsies showed a malignant epithelioid tumor resembling an atypical carcinoid. Histochemistry, electron microscopic study, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of melanoma. Physical examination and additional clinical history to exclude other possible primary sites were negative. The patient underwent thoracotomy with left pneumonectomy. Nineteen months after resection she was found to have a histologically similar tumor involving her left adrenal gland. Review of the literature shows that melanoma of the lower respiratory tract has been reported only in adults and has a tendency to present as a central polypoid growth that may be responsive to surgical resection. 
1	Multiple myeloma and acute megakaryoblast leukemia in spent phase polycythemia vera. The spontaneous and simultaneous occurrence of multiple myeloma and megakaryoblast leukemia with myelodysplastic features in a case of spent phase polycythemia vera is well documented. In support of the morphologic characteristics of the bone marrow, immunocytologic studies show proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells and megakaryoblasts. The cytogenetic findings of 20q- and unbalanced t(1;7) are consistent with myelodysplastic and leukemic transformation of the bone marrow. These transformations expand observations on variable and spontaneous lineage commitments as the consequence of alterations of the hematopoietic stem cell clone. These data are in support of the changing insights in hematopoiesis as a process of ordered commitment of the stem cell with sequential lineage potentials. 
1	Evaluation of serum CA 125 as a tumor marker in non-small cell lung cancer. Serum CA 125 levels were evaluated in 130 healthy subjects and 133 patients with untreated pulmonary lesions. These were 33 patients with benign pulmonary conditions and 100 with lung cancer. The mean concentration of CA 125 was higher in patients with lung cancer (37 +/- 81 U/ml) than in those with nonmalignant disease (4.2 +/- 5.7 U/ml) (P less than 0.01). In the healthy control group CA 125 concentrations were significantly lower (0.63 +/- 1.5 U/ml) (P less than 0.001). In patients with lung cancer the concentration of this tumor marker was related to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. At a cut-off value of 15 U/ml, CA 125 had a sensitivity of 44%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 65% with respect to healthy subjects; in patients with benign pulmonary conditions, these values were 44%, 94%, 94%, and 31%, respectively. At this cut-off value, a correlation between the respectability prognosis and the likelihood of survival 24 months posttreatment was observed. These findings suggest that CA 125 can be used as an adjunctive test in the management of patients with lung cancer patients. 
5	Normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells manifest differential sensitivity to inhibitory effects of c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides: an in vitro study relevant to bone marrow purging. The c-myb protooncogene is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells, and its encoded protein, Myb, is required for hematopoietic cell proliferation. To analyze the relative Myb dependence of normal and leukemic human hematopoietic progenitor cells, normal bone marrow cells, several types of leukemic blast cells, and 1:1 mixtures of normal and leukemic cells were cultured in the presence of c-myb sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; cell viability and cloning efficiency were then assessed. c-myb sense oligomers had negligible effects on normal and leukemic cells. In contrast, c-myb antisense oligomers strongly inhibited or completely abolished clonogenic growth of a T-cell leukemia line, 78% (18 of 23) of primary acute myelogenous leukemia cases examined, and 4 of 5 primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases in blast crisis. In three of the latter patients, polymerase chain reaction analysis of a 1:1 mixture of c-myb antisense-treated normal and CML cells revealed a complete absence of bcr-abl expression, suggesting that the CML clonogenic units had been completely eliminated from the cultures. At antisense doses that inhibited leukemic cell growth, normal hematopoietic progenitor cells survived. Thus, normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells show differential sensitivity to the toxic effects of c-myb antisense DNA. Perturbation of c-myb function with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides might eventually form the basis for a molecular approach to leukemia therapy, perhaps most immediately as ex vivo bone marrow purging agents. 
5	Acute and chronic stress in duodenal ulcer disease. Acute and chronic life event stressors were objectively assessed in a sample of duodenal ulcer patients and community controls. Stress was assessed on two dimensions, "personal threat" and "goal frustration." Chronic stressors (those of 6 months' duration or more) involving high goal frustration were significantly and independently associated with the onset and relapse of duodenal ulcers, as were acute events of high immediate but transient personal threat. 
1	Fingernail deformities secondary to ganglions of the distal interphalangeal joint (mucous cysts). Twenty-six nail deformities secondary to ganglions of the distal interphalangeal joint were retrospectively reviewed to assess the important aspects of their management. The patients' ages ranged from 41 to 79 years. The long and index fingers were most commonly involved. A depression or groove was present in 23 of 26 digits reviewed. Two had gross disruption of the nail. Fifty-eight percent of the cysts had spontaneously drained or had been drained by the patient or a physician preoperatively. Degenerative arthritic changes were seen in 87 percent of those with x-rays or a radiology report available. Most underwent surgical removal of the cyst and debridement of associated osteophytes of the distal interphalangeal joint. The cyst was located above the germinal matrix in all but two digits. Osteophytes were found in all 20 digits in which the joint was explored. No recurrences were seen in those available for postoperative follow-up (22 of 25). Normal nail growth was found in 14 of 22, although follow-up was short in one. All eight postoperative nail deformities were quite mild and of little concern to the patient. There was no correlation between preoperative cyst drainage and aesthetic postoperative nail growth. Nail removal at the time of surgery appeared to be unnecessary unless the nail was grossly disrupted. 
5	Can the status of tubal pregnancy be predicted with transvaginal sonography? A prospective comparison of sonographic, surgical, and serum hCG findings Results of transvaginal sonography were compared prospectively with surgical findings and levels of serum human chorionic gonadotropin in 120 women with a proved tubal pregnancy. The most common sonographic finding was a saclike adnexal ring, which was seen in 74 of the women (61.7%). This finding was strongly associated with functioning trophoblasts and with an intact fallopian tube. In 39 of the women (32.5%) an adnexal mass with a complex texture was found. Of these 39 women, 20 had a tubal hematoma and six had a ruptured fallopian tube. The size of the tubal mass created by ectopic pregnancy was predicted precisely (r = .91, P less than .001), and transvaginal sonography enabled detection of hemoperitoneum with a sensitivity of 91% (68 of 75 women). This study suggests that the status of a tubal pregnancy can be predicted reliably on the basis of transvaginal sonographic findings. 
3	Aortic calcified plaques and cardiovascular disease (the Framingham Study). The relation between the presence of calcified plaques in the thoracic aorta, as detected on chest x-rays, and the development of cardiovascular disease is examined during 12 years of follow-up of the Framingham cohort (n = 5,209). The prevalence of aortic calcified plaques approximately doubled with each decade of age, with only a trivial male predominance. Its presence was associated with a twofold increase in risk of cardiovascular death in men and women younger than age 65, even after other risk factors were taken into account. Similar increases in risk were found for coronary artery disease, stroke and intermittent claudication among middle-aged women. In middle-aged men these risks were less marked. The predictive value of aortic calcified plaques generally diminished with age. Risk of sudden coronary death in men with calcified plaques in the thoracic aorta ranged from a sevenfold increase at age 35 to no excess risk at age 70 years. These results support the view that atherosclerosis is a generalized process. The finding of aortic calcified plaques in a relatively young subject on a routine chest x-ray should be regarded as a sign for potential development of clinically manifest atherosclerotic disease in the cardiac, cerebral and peripheral arterial circulation. 
5	Vertical partial laryngectomy on demand. The author proposes the term 'vertical partial laryngectomy on demand' for all modifications of vertical laryngectomies (frontal, frontolateral, vertical and hemilaryngectomy). This term includes two conditions: the first is complete oncological removal of the tumour (proven by histological examination and with the use of magnification or the operating microscope during the operation); secondly, reconstruction of the laryngeal defect by various procedures. The author uses the sternohyoid fascia in vertical and frontolateral partial laryngectomies. From 120 operated cases, a five-year survival rate of 81 per cent was achieved. The fascia showed resistance to post-operative complications and irradiation. 
5	Stools containing altered blood-plasma urea: creatinine ratio as a simple test for the source of bleeding. The plasma urea:creatinine ratio (U:C ratio) is known to be elevated in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Almost all patients with haematemesis have upper gastrointestinal (or generalized) bleeding so that in this study we characterized the diagnostic power of the U:C ratio in patients with stools containing altered blood without haematemesis in the hope that this simple laboratory test (used in conjunction, perhaps, with clinical data) might reduce the number of patients subjected to an unrewarding gastroscopy or colonoscopy. Of 76 cases seen in a provincial and a metropolitan hospital, 42 and 34 patients had upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding, respectively. Fifty-four per cent of those with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and none of those with lower gastrointestinal bleeding had U:C ratios above 110 on admission. However, a discriminating level of 90 is considered to be more suitable, judged by the quadratic uncertainty score. At this level the odds for upper gastrointestinal bleeding were 15:1. 
5	Clinical and angiographic determinants of primary coronary angioplasty success. M-HEART Investigators. Clinical and anatomic determinants of the initial success of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were prospectively evaluated in 826 patients enrolled in the Multi-Hospital Eastern Atlantic Restenosis Trial (M-HEART). The 639 men and 187 women ranged in age from 31 to 85 years. Successful angioplasty (residual stenosis less than 50% and no major complications) was achieved in 886 (88.6%) of 1,000 lesions. Success rates were uniform among the eight individual centers. Outcome was not influenced by gender, age or other clinical features, including severity and duration of angina, prior myocardial infarction, rest pain, transient ST segment elevation, history of smoking or diabetes. In contrast, procedural outcome was significantly associated with lesion-specific angiographic factors. Stenoses 60% to 74%, 75% to 89%, 90% to 99% and 100% were associated with success rates of 96%, 90%, 84% and 69%, respectively (p less than 0.001). Angioplasty was less successful in calcified than in noncalcified lesions (82% versus 90%, p less than 0.01), in thrombotic than in nonthrombotic lesions (82% versus 90%, p less than 0.05) and in lesions in the right coronary artery than in other vessels (84% versus 90%, p less than 0.01). Outcome was not related to other anatomic variables, including lesion location (proximal versus distal), vessel size, eccentricity, stenosis length or translesional gradient. By multivariate logistic regression, preangioplasty percent stenosis, right coronary artery location and lesion calcification were demonstrated to be significant independent predictors of angioplasty success. Alternative clinical and angiographic variables did not contribute to this regression model. 
1	Ewing's sarcoma. Prognostic factors, disease control, and the reemerging role of surgical treatment. Advances in the treatment of Ewing's sarcoma have been dramatic. Present treatment protocols control local disease by radiotherapy, surgery, or both; systemic spread is limited by aggressive multiagent chemotherapy. In patients with localized osseous Ewing's sarcoma, five-year survival rates now range from 54% to an estimated 74%. With late relapse not uncommon, control of the primary lesion is critical to long-term survival. Several studies now show improved local control and possibly improved survival of patients with surgical treatment of primary osseous Ewing's sarcoma. 
2	Emergency laparoscopy. Unnecessary abdominal explorations in severely injured patients can be reduced by employing emergent or urgent laparoscopy in blunt abdominal trauma and the obscured, acute abdominal cases. In 150 blunt abdominal trauma cases, a mini-laparoscopy was used in the emergency room or the intensive care unit without major complications. In 56%, the findings were negative. In 19%, the laparoscopic findings were corroborated by surgery. In 25%, a minimal to moderate hemoperitoneum was found and the laparoscopic impression dictated close observation. Unnecessary exploration was avoided except in one case. In the elderly high-risk patient with a poor history, abdominal examination can be noninformative. Laparoscopy can detect acute appendicitis or organ perforation. In the young female, appendicitis can be differentiated from pelvic inflammatory disease. Laparoscopy is more accurate and gives a larger latitude for decision-making than lavage. It can also be useful in the obscured problematic abdominal case. 
3	Phenytoin administration by constant intravenous infusion: selective rates of administration. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the adequacy of seizure control and the adverse effects of administering an IV loading dose of phenytoin by constant infusion pump. DESIGN: A prospective study of patients presenting with acute onset of seizures. Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 comprised all patients 50 years of age or younger without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Group 2 comprised all patients older than 50 years or with a history of ASCVD. SETTING: A rural community hospital emergency department. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two adult patients. INTERVENTIONS: Both groups received an IV loading dose of phenytoin at 15 mg/kg. Infusion rates were 50 mg/min and 25 mg/min for groups 1 and 2, respectively. Cardiac rhythm and vital signs were monitored throughout and after infusion. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: Group 2 demonstrated significantly more cardiovascular side effects (hypotension and bradycardia) than did group 1 (Fisher's exact test, P less than .05). CONCLUSION: Phenytoin provided adequate seizure control in both groups. For individuals with ASCVD, IV phenytoin administration rates should not exceed 25 mg/min. For individuals without ASCVD, phenytoin administration at 50 mg/min appears safe and without significant cardiovascular side effects. 
2	Pharyngoesophageal perforation after blunt neck trauma. Pharyngoesophageal perforation secondary to blunt neck trauma is an uncommon injury that can cause serious morbidity and mortality if not recognized and treated. Pharyngeal perforation secondary to blunt trauma sustained while boxing is reported. Review of the world literature found 10 cases of pharyngoesophageal perforation secondary to blunt neck trauma. Analysis of these cases indicates that perforations less than 2 cm and limited to the pharynx may be treated medically with close observation. Large perforations and those perforations that extend to the esophageal inlet or involve the esophagus exclusively are best treated surgically. 
3	Deletion of Alu sequences in the fifth c-sis intron in individuals with meningiomas. An abnormality in the c-sis protooncogene was identified in leukocyte DNA from members of a family predisposed to the development of meningioma, and was found to be associated with the development of the tumor in those individuals. Molecular analysis of this abnormality demonstrated a deletion within the fifth intron of the c-sis gene. The normal c-sis gene has an Alu sequence in this region which includes two perfect 130 nucleotide repeated sequences separated by 5 bp. The deleted c-sis allele is missing precisely one copy of the 130 bp repeat and the intervening 5 bp. An identical deletion was also found in DNA from 1 of 13 sporadic meningiomas. 
4	Fulminant hepatitis after lisinopril administration. A case of fulminant hepatitis in a patient taking lisinopril for 5 weeks for arterial hypertension is reported. Jaundice, fever, myalgia, and marked increase in serum aminotransferase activities occurred after 2 weeks of treatment. Continuation of lisinopril administration for 3 weeks after the onset of jaundice was associated with the development of grade III encephalopathy and a marked decrease in prothrombin and proaccelerin levels. This case strongly suggests that lisinopril may induce acute hepatitis and that continuation of the treatment after the onset of jaundice can lead to life-threatening hepatic failure. 
1	Prognostic implications of tumor diameter in carcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Two hundred twenty patients with a carcinoma in the head of the pancreas were divided into three tumor diameter groups: group 1, 0.5 to 4.4 cm (n = 72); group 2, 4.5 to 6.0 cm (n = 77); and group 3, 6.1 to 15.0 cm (n = 71). For these tumor diameter groups a six-fold eliminatory curability analysis was performed. Of the patients with liver metastases in group 1 the last patient had died at 10 months and in groups 2 and 3 no patients were alive at 18 months after the start of complaints. Patients with extrahepatic metastases did not survive 12 months in group 1, 16 months in group 2, and 25 months in group 3. The 6% actuarial survival rate for inoperable patients was reached in group 1 after 17 months, in group 2 after 36 months, and in group 3 after 27 months after the start of complaints. For groups 1 through 3 in curable, but not curatively operated patients, the respective 0% actuarial survival rate was reached at 24 months, 23 months, and 14 months. The 0% actuarial survival rate in patients with irresectable vessel invasion was reached in group 1 at 33 months, in group 2 at 23 months, and in group 3 at 25 months. The 0% actuarial survival rate in patients with an irresectable tumor was reached at 33 months, 31 months, and 27 months after the start of complaints in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The 0% actuarial survival rate in curatively operated patients was reached in group 3 after 26 months and in group 2 after 29 months. In group 1 25% of the patients were alive at 36 months after the start of complaints. Small tumors were associated with the greatest chance of curative operation and on average had the longest survival. However, small tumors with liver or other metastases carried a worse prognosis than large tumors with liver or other metastases. If tumors were found not to be resectable at the time of operation, the size of the tumor did not appear to affect survival. 
3	Carpal tunnel syndrome: correlations between pressure measurement and intraoperative electrophysiological nerve study. In 19 carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients and 4 control subjects a catheter was introduced into the carpal tunnel and slowly retracted in 5 mm steps. Pressure was measured with the continuous infusion technique. In the same group of patients and controls, median nerve antidromic sensory action potential (aSAP) was detected intraoperatively stimulating proximally (S1), in the center (S2), and distally (S3) to the carpal tunnel and recording from the third finger (R). Sensory conduction velocity (SCV) and aSAP amplitude were considered in S1-S2, S2-S3 and S3-R segments. The intracarpal tunnel pressure was significantly higher in CTS patients than in controls, with the highest values located between 25 and 35 mm distal to the proximal border of the flexor retinaculum. SCV and aSAP amplitude were also decreased most often in the distal part (S2-S3) of the carpal tunnel. 
3	Cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics in children with external ventricular drains. Fifty-five children had 64 external ventricular drains (EVDs) placed predominantly (95%) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infections. In 9 children, a computer monitoring system measured the CSF output each second continuously for up to 24 hours. The monitoring was repeated daily for up to 9 days. The state of arousal of the patients was recorded simultaneously. In all children, daily EVD outputs were related to age, sex, weight, method of establishing the EVD, height of the drip chamber, time since insertion, and type of infecting organism. Computer monitoring revealed wide fluctuations in flow rate, with peak rates frequently greater than 20 ml/h and periods of flow arrest. These changes were usually associated with increased arousal, but also occurred with sleep. The mean EVD flow rate for all children was 6.3 ml/h. EVD output increased with age and weight. EVD output decreased with Gram-negative or multiple-organism infections and with elevation of the drip chamber. Resolution of the infection, sex of the patient, and method of establishing the EVD had no effect on output. These results predict that CSF production increases with brain growth in humans: that CSF production is depressed by Gram-negative and multiple-organism infections: that implanted CSF shunts with standard valves flow at equivalent rates to an EVD in the supine position; and that the CSF drainage requirements in this group are approximately equal to their EVD outputs. 
1	Synergism of herpes simplex virus and tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines in cell transformation. Previous studies indicate that herpes simplex virus (HSV) enhances the carcinogenic activity of smokeless tobacco and tobacco-related chemical carcinogens in animals. Since tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines (TSNAs) such as N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(N-methyl-N'-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) are major chemical carcinogens of smokeless tobacco and are known to be responsible for the development of oral cancers in smokeless tobacco users, the combined effects of TSNAs and HSV in cell transformation were investigated. Exposure of cells to NNN or NNK followed by virus infection resulted in a significant enhancement of transformation frequency when compared with that observed with chemical carcinogens or virus alone. This study suggests that TSNAs and HSV can interact together and show synergism in cell transformation. 
1	Olfactory neuroblastoma: clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical characterization of four representative cases. Olfactory neuroblastomas are rare tumors whose clinical prognosis is not predictable by assessment of initial stage or grade. The pathologic diagnosis is often difficult because of the wide range of the patient's age and histologies. In this report, we document that the diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma can be clarified by immunohistochemical demonstration of a unique antigenic profile that can be obtained in routinely processed biopsies. We describe four cases of olfactory neuroblastoma diagnosed and treated from 1979 to 1989, each confirmed by immunohistology. One of our patients was misdiagnosed twice at an outside institution, first as having nasopharyngeal carcinoma and then as having small-cell, undifferentiated "oat cell" carcinoma. Despite accurate tumor diagnosis and appropriate therapy, we found that there was no apparent correlation of clinical outcome with Kadish clinical stage or histologic grade of tumor. 
3	Cemented total knee arthroplasty for gonarthrosis in patients 55 years old or younger. The results of 68 cemented total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) in 50 patients with gonarthrosis who were 55 years old or younger at the time of surgery were reviewed. These patients were operated on between 1979 and 1987 and were followed for an average of 6.2 years. The average age of the patients was 50 years. Patients were evaluated by the Hospital for Special Surgery knee score. The average preoperative score was 53, and the average follow-up score was 90. Overall, 55 TKAs were rated as excellent and 13 as good. Using the knee rating score advocated by the Knee Society, the average postoperative score was 92 for pain and 84 for function. There were four successful reoperations for patellar component loosening, all in metal-backed patellae. The femoral and tibial components in these patients were intact, and at the follow-up period, two knees were rated as excellent and two as good. Detailed roentgenographic evaluation demonstrated that 20% of tibial components had radiolucencies in at least one zone on the anteroposterior roentgenogram and in 11% on the lateral roentgenogram. Femoral radiolucencies occurred in only 2% of knees. Patellar radiolucencies in one or more zones occurred in 20% of knees that had not had patellar revision. No complete or progressive radiolucencies at the bone-cement interface were noted for any component, and no components were considered to be roentgenographically loose. Cemented TKAs can achieve excellent long-term results in patients younger than 55 years old with gonarthrosis of the knee. These results compare with those obtained in published reports on older age groups. 
4	Triiodothyronine in the recovery of stunned myocardium in dogs Two groups of dogs were subjected to a 15-minute period of regional myocardial ischemia by snaring the left anterior descending coronary artery proximal to its first diagonal branch. After release of the snare, the dogs were given either placebo (group 1: n = 7) or triiodothyronine (T3) therapy (group 2: n = 6). The dose of T3 given was 0.2 microgram/kg at 30-minute intervals to a total of six doses. Plasma free T3 level fell significantly during the ischemic period in both groups and continued to fall after reperfusion in group 1. In both groups, cardiac function deteriorated significantly during the period of ischemia and rapidly returned to control level after reperfusion. After 90 minutes of reperfusion, however, deterioration of left ventricular function was observed in group 1 and was significantly worse than in group 2, in which hemodynamic function was maintained and, in fact, improved to levels superior to control. It is suggested that T3 therapy may be worthy of trial in patients in whom reperfusion of the myocardium takes place after a relatively short ischemic period (the "stunned myocardium"). 
2	Emergency portosystemic shunt in patients with variceal bleeding. Thirty-five patients for whom emergency sclerotherapy or conservative treatment, or both, failed to arrest variceal bleeding, or who had early rebleeding and required emergency portosystemic shunts (EPSS) were studied. EPSS permanently controlled the variceal bleeding in all but one patient. In this patient, the shunt was patent as demonstrated by angiography. Esophageal varices disappeared in 18 patients and were reduced in 14. Three patients died before the endoscopic examination could be performed. The causes of death were hepatic failure in two and bleeding ulcerations of the gastric fundus in the other patient. One patient was classified in Child's category B and two in Child's category C. Thirty-two patients submitted to EPSS and were discharged alive. Twelve of these patients subsequently died, at an average of 11.2 months after undergoing the shunt procedure. Four of 12 patients died of hepatic failure; two patients died of hepatomas; two, other neoplasia; three, hemorrhaging duodenal ulcers, and one patient, renal failure. Analysis of actuarial survival rates showed that the five year survival rate was 43 per cent. The long term survival rates were fewer for patients with Child's category C than for those with combined Child's categories A and B (five year survival rates were 21 versus 55 per cent; p less than 0.05). During the follow-up period, none of the patients had variceal bleeding. Chronic encephalopathy developed in six, which was mild in three, moderate in one instance and severe in two. It developed soon after EPSS, with onset in the first month after discharge in three. Thus, when conservative treatment fails to arrest variceal bleeding, EPSS should be performed to guarantee definitive control of hemorrhage and prolong the survival period. 
1	Ileocolic neobladder post-cystectomy: continence and potency. Incontinence and impotence are 2 of the primary complications associated with total bladder reconstruction after cystectomy for carcinoma. These and other features are addressed in 25 patients who underwent total neobladder reconstruction following cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma. Of these patients 20 had a urethral anastomosis. No patient had to wear a pad or device. Enuresis was rare. When the radical cystoprostatectomy population was contrasted with a radical prostatectomy patient population, continence was achieved more rapidly in the neobladder group. Potency was maintained in 15 of 21 (71%) evaluable patients. This ileocolic neobladder produces a large volume and low pressure, and provides excellent day and night continence. With preservation of the neurovascular bundle potency can be maintained in the majority of patients. 
4	Blood pressure lowering in elderly subjects: a double-blind crossover study of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. In 46 elderly (aged greater than or equal to 60 y) hypertensive subjects with entry systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 160 or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg, our specific aim in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study (two 8-wk treatment periods separated by a 3-wk washout) was to compare blood pressure-lowering effects of 9 g fish oil/d [omega-3 (n-3) fatty acid] vs 9 g corn oil/d [omega-6 (n-6) fatty acid]. After a 4-wk baseline period, 22 subjects were randomly assigned to receive fish oil and 24 to receive corn oil. For both 8-wk treatments there were no between-group differences in the change in blood pressure. There was a treatment difference for standing DBP when baseline values were compared with those after treatment 2; DBP decreased by 5.1 mm Hg in the fish-oil group vs 0.72 mm Hg in the corn-oil group (P = 0.024). Within groups during the first treatment, both fish oil and corn oil lowered all four blood pressure measures (P less than 0.05); blood pressures were not further lowered during the second treatment compared with the washout period. There were no significant between-group differences in laboratory safety tests or categorical side effects. Fish oil lowered triglycerides by 0.47 mmol/L (P less than 0.001). In elderly subjects, diet plus both omega-3 and omega-6 supplements (9 g/d) safely and effectively lower SBP and DBP. 
5	Living arrangements and sources of caregiving. This study examined both the prevalence of different types of caregivers (in terms of the relation to the individual), and whether living with someone is more important for caregiving than the relation of an elder to an individual. Caregiving is examined in terms of IADL and emotional support. Analyses are conducted using three separate random samples of those who are married and living with a spouse, those who live alone, and those who live with nonspousal others in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The results confirm previous research pointing out that married people tend to receive assistance from their spouse. Among nonmarrieds, children are named most frequently as the primary caregiver. After children, however, those who live alone tend to receive assistance from friends, and those who live with nonspousal others receive assistance from siblings. The data further document the importance of the structural characteristic of living with someone, rather than marital status, for assistance with IADL. 
4	Laser angioplasty: results of a prospective, multicenter study at 3-year follow-up. A prospective multicenter trial was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser angioplasty. Laser recanalization was performed in 338 patients with arteriosclerotic femoropopliteal artery occlusions (average length, 8.5 cm). Neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet lasers were used in combination with sapphire probe catheters. The initial recanalization rate was 85%. Complications were observed in 14% of the patients. Emergency surgery was required in 1.5%. The cumulative long-term patency rate of the successfully recanalized arteries was 80%, 70%, 62%, and 57% at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 and 3 years, respectively. The patency rates were not affected by the length of the occlusion and the long-term medication (platelet inhibition vs anticoagulation), but patients with a normal runoff had significantly better patency rates than those with reduced runoff (63% vs 52%, P less than .01). The study has shown that laser-assisted angioplasty is safe and at least as effective as conventional angioplasty. 
5	Meiotic recombination between yeast artificial chromosomes yields a single clone containing the entire BCL2 protooncogene. The common translocation found in human follicular lymphoma, t(14;18)(q32;q21), results in deregulation of the BCL2 protoonocogene. The isolation of the intact gene would provide an essential substrate to analyze the molecular basis of this malignancy. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis suggested that this three-exon gene was several hundred kilobases (kb) long. Therefore, a library of yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones was screened to isolate the intact BCL2 gene. Two clones, yA85B6 (200 kb) and yB206A6 (700 kb), were isolated by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays specific for exon I/II and exon III, respectively. However, neither YAC contained the entire BCL2 locus. Since the two YACs were found to overlap by 60 kb, we sought to take advantage of the high recombination frequency in yeast and induce physical recombination between the two clones. Cells containing each YAC were mated and induced to undergo meiotic division and sporulation. Analysis of the resulting tetrads revealed a spore containing a single recombinant YAC of 800 kb. PCR assays and Southern blotting demonstrated that this recombined YAC contained the entire approximately 230-kb BCL2 gene. Furthermore, probe order was conserved and there was no evidence of overt rearrangements or deletions. These results indicate the feasibility of reconstructing large genomic segments with overlapping YAC clones to study genes spanning hundreds of kilobases. 
5	A histologic evaluation of the accuracy of TMJ diagnostic arthroscopy. Sixty-seven temporomandibular joints with internal derangement were examined with arthroscopy, and synovial biopsies were taken for histologic evaluation. Histologically, in 10 cases, the synovium appeared to be normal in appearance, 24 cases had moderate to severe synovitis, 11 cases showed hyperplastic synovitis, 13 cases showed synovial fibrosis, and foreign body granuloma was found in 9 cases. Correlation between arthroscopic observation and histologic findings disclosed an 89.1% specificity and 100% sensitivity. 
2	Effective intraperitoneal antiprotease therapy for taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats In canine pancreatitis, irreversible hypotension and death follow saturation of the antiprotease molecules in peritoneal exudate by activated proteolytic enzymes which are released from the pancreas. This study has examined, in rats with taurocholate-induced pancreatitis, the efficacy of removal of the peritoneal exudate by aspiration and a single lavage, followed by instillation of an exogenous antiprotease solution. Instillation of human fresh frozen plasma, containing alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 1-antiprotease, was associated with the longest median survival. Aprotinin, although possessing a much greater trypsin inhibitory capacity, just failed to significantly improve the median survival time compared with the control group. Intraperitoneal antiprotease therapy is simple to perform, has a beneficial effect on survival time in this model and merits investigation in man. 
5	In vivo biological effects of stereotactic radiosurgery: a primate model. Single-fraction, closed skull, small-volume irradiation (radiosurgery) of intact intracranial structures requires accurate knowledge of radiation tolerance. We have developed a baboon model to assess the in vivo destructive radiobiological effects of stereotactic radiosurgery. Three baboons received a single-fraction, 150-Gy lesion of the caudate nucleus, the thalamus, or the pons using the 8-mm diameter collimator of the gamma unit. Serial standard neurodiagnostic tests (neurological examination, computed tomographic scan, magnetic resonance imaging, stable xenon-enhanced computed tomographic scan of cerebral blood flow, somatosensory and brain stem evoked potentials, and myelin basic protein levels of cerebrospinal fluid) were compared with preoperative studies. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the development of a lesion at the target site between 45 and 60 days after irradiation. Deterioration of the brain stem evoked potentials preceded imaging changes when the lesion encroached on auditory pathways. Myelin basic protein levels increased subsequent to imaging changes. Postmortem neuropathological examination confirmed a well-demarcated radionecrosis of the target volume. The baboon model appears to be an excellent method to study the in vivo biological effects of radiosurgery. 
4	Mechanisms in heart failure and the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. The four major diagnostic criteria for the syndrome of congestive heart failure are left ventricular dysfunction, exercise intolerance, pulmonary congestion or edema and ventricular arrhythmias. Activation of norepinephrine, angiotensin II, vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide may be a key factor in the vasoconstriction and increased impedance to left ventricular ejection in heart failure. Interventions that interfere with these vasoconstrictor mechanisms should have a salutary effect on left ventricular performance. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-adrenoceptor blockers and vasopressin antagonists has resulted in hemodynamic benefits, but it has been more difficult to demonstrate long-term clinical effectiveness. Reductions in mortality have been demonstrated in patients with heart failure treated with vasodilators and ACE inhibitors. Improvement in the quality of life and prolongation of life are the only two appropriate goals in the management of heart failure. Further understanding of the role of angiotensin II and its interference by ACE inhibition in the tissue processes of heart failure is needed. 
1	Intraatrial extension of thyroid cancer: technique and results of a radical surgical approach. An occlusion of the superior vena cava by a tumor thrombus extending into the right atrium was diagnosed in three patients with a follicular thyroid cancer. All patients showed the typical clinical picture of the superior vena cava syndrome. A right parasternal thoracotomy was performed for preparation of the major vessels. The superior vena cava was opened and the entire intravascular tumor thrombus was removed. The cavotomy was closed directly in two patients. In the third patient the left brachiocephalic trunk was resected and reconstructed with a vascular (polytetrafluoroethylene) graft. This patient had bone and brain metastases and an occlusion of the graft 3 months after surgery after anticoagulation was stopped. The other two patients were clinically symptom free without local recurrence 13 and 50 months after surgery. An aggressive surgical approach is justified in grossly invasive thyroid cancer to decrease local recurrence and death rates, to correct the disturbing clinical symptoms of superior vena caval occlusion, and to prevent tumor embolism and the development of distant metastases. By reducing tumor mass, an even better basis for radioiodine treatment can be prepared. 
5	Overdose reperfusion of blood cardioplegic solution. A preventable cause of postischemic myocardial depression. Reperfusion of warm blood cardioplegic solution is useful in minimizing reperfusion damage after ischemia. This study tests the hypothesis that overzealous administration of blood cardioplegic solution at reperfusion counteracts these benefits and can lead to a prevalence of depressed ventricular performance and mortality similar to that seen after normal blood reperfusion. Thirty-one dogs underwent 45 minutes of 37 degrees C global ischemia on vented bypass. Six received normal blood reperfusion and 25 were reperfused with a warm aspartate/glutamate-enriched blood cardioplegic solution; of these, eight received high-dose (3600 +/- 600 ml) and 17 received limited-dose (1180 +/- 120 ml) blood cardioplegic reperfusion over 10 to 20 minutes. High-dose blood cardioplegic perfusion (5100 +/- 200 ml) without prior ischemia was tested in an additional five dogs. High-dose blood cardioplegia without preceding ischemia did not alter ventricular function (peak stroke work index 96% of control). After ischemia, normal blood reperfusion (no cardioplegia) resulted in marked left ventricular dysfunction (peak stroke work index 36% of control, p less than 0.05 versus control) and a 33% mortality rate (2/6 died). High-dose cardioplegic reperfusion yielded marginal recovery of stroke work index (40% of control, p less than 0.05 versus control) and a 25% mortality rate (2/8 died). In contrast, limited-dose reperfusion of blood cardioplegic solution allowed 100% survival (17/17) and restored stroke work index to 90% of control (1.3 versus 1.45 gm.m/kg). We conclude that reperfusion damage can be avoided by initial reoxygenation with limited doses of substrate-enriched blood cardioplegic solution. Conversely, high-dose reperfusion of blood cardioplegic solution offsets this benefit, reduces recovery substantially, and may be lethal. 
5	Emergency cardiopulmonary bypass support in patients with cardiac arrest. Emergency percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support was instituted in 11 patients in cardiac arrest refractory to conventional resuscitation measures. Emergency percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support was used in five patients in whom cardiac arrest occurred as a result of a complication in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (group 1) and in six other patients in cardiac arrest (group II). A 21F cannula and a 17F cannula were percutaneously inserted into the femoral vein and artery. Flow rates of 3 to 5 L/min were achieved with restoration of mean arterial pressure to 70 mm Hg (range 50 to 75). The status of all 11 patients was improved initially both clinically and hemodynamically with percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass. Of the group II patients, three had anatomy unsuitable for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary bypass grafting, could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary support, and died; three of these patients had coronary artery bypass grafting and two survived. All five group I patients underwent successful coronary bypass grafting and survived. Of the seven patients with anatomically correctable disease, all seven were discharged from the hospital. With conventional management nearly all seven of these patients would have died. Nine of 11 patients underwent a cardiac operation and seven of the nine survived. The operative mortality rate was 22% and the overall survival rate was 64%. At follow-up (mean 7 months), all seven patients are alive and six have resumed a normal and active life-style. In conclusion, emergency percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support is a powerful resuscitative tool that may stabilize the condition of patients in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest to allow for definitive intervention. 
5	Ultrasonography compared with intravenous urography in the investigation of adults with haematuria OBJECTIVE--To compare ultrasonography with intravenous urography in the investigation of adults with haematuria. DESIGN--Prospective study entailing the examination of all patients with both investigations concurrently. The investigations were performed independently on routine lists by different duty radiologists. Each was aware of the details of the request form but not of the findings of the other investigation. SETTING--Radiology department of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--155 Consecutive adult patients (aged 18-93) referred from general practitioners and hospital outpatient clinics with a history of haematuria. FOLLOW UP--When results of both examinations proved normal no clinical or radiological follow up was sought. All abnormal findings of either investigation were correlated with results of subsequent imaging studies or operative findings. RESULTS--81 Patients (52%) had normal findings on urography and ultrasonography. Overall, the findings of ultrasonography concurred with those of urography in 144 cases (93%). Among the discrepant findings of the two investigations ultrasonography missed two ureteric calculi; one was in a non-dilated ureter, and in the other case ultrasonography detected the secondary ureteric dilatation. Ultrasound examination alone detected four bladder tumours not visible on urography with sizes ranging from 5 to 21 mm, representing one fifth of the 20 cystoscopically proved bladder tumours detected in the series. Ultrasonography detected all the 22 neoplastic lesions discovered in the study (20 bladder, two renal). Ultrasonography clarified the nature of renal masses evident in three urograms (simple cysts). CONCLUSIONS--Ultrasonography is a safe and accurate method of investigating the urinary tract in adults with haematuria. When combined with a single plain abdominal radiograph it proved to be superior to urography as the primary imaging study in this series. Ultrasonography should certainly be preferred to urography if cystoscopy is not planned. No urothelial tumours of the upper urinary tract were found in the series, reflecting their rarity. For those patients in whom ultrasonography and plain radiography have shown no abnormality and in whom cystoscopic appearances are normal urography would be advisable to exclude urothelial tumours of the upper urinary tract. 
5	Role of laparoscopy in the evaluation of patients with suspected hepatic or peritoneal malignancy. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of laparoscopy in patients with suspected hepatic or peritoneal malignancy and a normal computerized tomograph (CT). Twenty-five consecutive patients with a normal liver and no peritoneal lesions on CT were evaluated. Patients with a documented primary neoplasm or a positive ascitic fluid cytology were excluded. At laparoscopy, malignancy was documented by biopsy in 12 patients for an incidence of 48%. Of the patients with exudative ascites, 75% had peritoneal metastases. In addition seven patients had benign liver disease documented by laparoscopic biopsy. Liver enzymes were not helpful in distinguishing benign and malignant disease in this group of patients. This study indicates that a negative CT does not exclude liver or peritoneal malignancy. Laparoscopy has a significant yield in patients with a negative CT suspected of having hepatic or peritoneal malignancy and is the procedure of choice in evaluating these patients. 
5	Modeling human performance in running. This paper focuses on the characteristics of a model interpreting the effect of training on athletic performance. The model theory is presented both mathematically and graphically. In the model, a systematically quantified impulse of training produces dual responses: fitness and fatigue. In the absence of training, both decay exponentially with time. With repetitive training, these responses satisfy individual recurrence equations. Fitness and fatigue are combined in a simple linear difference equation to predict performance levels appropriate to the intensity of training being undertaken. Significant observed correlation of model-predicted performance with a measure of actual performance during both training and tapering provides validation of the model for athletes and nonathletes alike. This enables specific model parameters to be estimated and can be used to optimize future training regimens for any individual. 
4	Neisseria mucosa endocarditis. A case of Neisseria mucosa tricuspid valve endocarditis in an intravenous drug abuser is described. The patient was treated initially with intravenous penicillin G followed by oral penicillin VK but relapsed. He was cured after 4 weeks of combined therapy with penicillin G and gentamicin. In vitro synergy studies performed on the patient's and two other isolates revealed synergy in all three. Thus, combination therapy is recommended for treatment of recalcitrant cases of bacterial endocarditis caused by N. mucosa. 
5	Late effects of paralytic poliomyelitis in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We identified a cohort of 300 individuals who had paralytic polio between 1935 and 1955. All lived in Olmsted County, Minnesota. From the 247 survivors, we selected 50 subjects for detailed historical, functional, psychological, clinical, and electrophysiologic evaluation. Sixty-four percent of these 50 survivors complained of new symptoms of muscle pain, fatigue, and weakness after a period of prolonged stability. This led to changes in lifestyle or activity in only 18%. The likelihood of expressing new complaints was not related to present age or interval since polio, and electrophysiologic testing did not distinguish between those with or without new problems. The development of new difficulties in a limb was most strongly predicted by significant paralysis of that limb at the time of the acute illness. Patients with leg weakness were twice as likely to complain of new problems compared to those with arm weakness. Elevated creatine kinase levels were present only in those with new complaints. 
5	Treatment of decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department--correlation between clinical features and prognosis. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Patients with decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at high risk of relapse after treatment in an emergency department. The purpose of this study was to determine if the risk of relapse correlates with the clinical features of the disease. PATIENTS: Three hundred fifty-two patients with documented COPD who were treated for dyspnea in the ED of the Albuquerque Veterans Administration Medical Center over a three-year period. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical features and pulmonary function tests of the patients, who were considered to have COPD if the baseline prebronchodilator one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) was less than 80% predicted, and less than 80% of the forced vital capacity and inhaled bronchodilators failed to increase the FEV1 to levels of more than 80% predicted. Visits for pneumonia, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or pulmonary emboli were excluded. A relapse was defined as an unscheduled revisit to the ED within 14 days of initial treatment. Data were entered into a microcomputer data base and analyzed by a commercial statistical package. RESULTS: Of 877 visits in which the patient was treated and released from the ED, 281 (32.0%) resulted in relapse and were considered unsuccessful Compared with successful visits, unsuccessful visits were characterized by a shorter duration of dyspnea (P = .002), a lower entry FEV1 (P = .027), a lower discharge FEV1 (P = .040), a greater number of treatments with nebulized bronchodilators (P = .009), more frequent use of parenteral adrenergic drugs (P = .006), and less frequent use of oral prednisone on discharge (P = .016). Patients with one or more relapse visits during the study period (relapsers) differed from nonrelapsers in several respects. Relapsers had a greater bronchodilator response on baseline FEV1 than nonrelapsers (P = .047). Nevertheless, relapsers required more bronchodilator treatments in the ED (P less than .001); were treated more frequently with parenteral adrenergic drugs (P less than .001), IV glucocorticoids (P less than .001), and oral prednisone (P less than .001); and recovered less of their baseline FEV1 (P less than .014). CONCLUSION: Bronchodilator response on baseline pulmonary function testing appears to identify patients with COPD who have a poor prognosis after emergency treatment. Their poor response to intensive bronchodilator treatment suggests that loss of bronchodilator response may be involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory decompensation. 
4	Time course and prognostic significance of serial signal-averaged electrocardiograms after a first acute myocardial infarction. The prognostic significance of serial signal-averaged electrocardiograms recorded during the first 3 days (period 1), in the second week (period 2) after a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 6 months later (period 3) was prospectively assessed in 190 patients. No patients were treated with thrombolytic therapy. Patients with conduction disturbances were excluded. Mean age of the 190 patients was 57 years (range 34 to 74) and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 40 + 6% (range 12 to 70). Eighty-four patients had an anterior wall AMI and the remaining 106 patients an inferior wall AMI. After a mean follow-up of 24 months, 16 patients developed sustained symptomatic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, 7 patients were resuscitated from an episode of ventricular fibrillation, and 10 patients died suddenly. Multivariate regression analysis using continuous variables showed that the strongest predictor of sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was the left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.0001) followed by the duration of QRS complex on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram recorded during the first 3 days of AMI (p less than 0.0005). Sudden death was only predicted by left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.02). 
4	Evaluation of argon laser surgery in children under 13 years of age. Argon laser surgery is an effective treatment for ectasias and congenital port-wine stains; however, its use in children under the age of 13 is controversial. This paper reviews 202 children under the age of 13 who underwent argon laser treatments for congenital port-wine stains, spider angiomas, epidermal nevi, and lentigines. The clinical characteristics of port-wine stains in 170 children are discussed. Good to excellent results (moderate to complete clearing) in port-wine stains were obtained in 60 percent of patients and seemed to correlate best with lack of blanchability on pressure. Hypertrophic scarring was seen in only 7 children, all of whom had undressed wounds; no significant scarring has been seen in any subsequent child who had maintained a dressed wound postoperatively. 
5	Plasma concentrations of methadone during postoperative patient-controlled extradural analgesia. Plasma concentrations of methadone were measured by gas chromatography in 16 patients receiving extradural methadone by continuous infusion for relief of postoperative pain. Venous blood samples were taken after a loading dose of extradural methadone 2 mg and during infusion of 0.46 mg h-1 plus patient-controlled increments of 0.2-1 mg. Mean (SD) plasma concentration of methadone was 9.8 (2.1) ng ml-1 at 15 min; this did not change significantly during the first 2 h, after which it increased gradually to 32.2 (4.6) ng ml-1 (P less than 0.001) at the end of 24 h. The mean quantity of extradural methadone required to produce effective analgesia was 10.3 (1.8) mg during the first 12 h after operation and 6 (1.0) mg for the subsequent 12 h. The mean amount of methadone for effective analgesia on the second day was 7.6 (1.1) mg. No adverse effects were detected during the 2-3 days of methadone therapy. Plasma concentration of methadone increased significantly during patient-controlled infusion of extradural methadone in the first 24 h after operation, suggesting rapid vascular uptake. Systemic activity of the drug contributes to the analgesic effect of extradural methadone. 
1	Hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome. A 66-year-old woman with Pendred's syndrome underwent a partial thyroidectomy when she was 17 years old. At the age of 52 years, she had a second thyroid operation because of hyperthyroidism due to a toxic multinodular goiter with a mediastinal extension consisting of several separate nodules. Five years later a hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular carcinoma was diagnosed histologically. After treatment with radioactive iodine, the patient was well. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of a metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome and the first report of hyperthyroidism occurring after malignant degeneration of a dyshormonogenetic goiter. 
4	Percutaneous balloon pulmonic valvuloplasty following treated endocarditis in a patient with congenital pulmonary valve stenosis. A 36-year-old woman with congenital pulmonary valve stenosis developed the rare complication of endocarditis of the valve. After successful sterilization of the valve, the patient underwent percutaneous balloon pulmonic valvuloplasty at a later date. The procedure successfully reduced the peak pulmonary valve gradient from 94 to 45 mm Hg. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is the procedure of choice for treatment of congenital pulmonary valvular stenosis, even in the unusual patient who has healed endocarditis of the pulmonary valve. 
5	Poisoning with equine phenylbutazone in a racetrack worker. Phenylbutazone is a potent nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug often used by veterinarians to treat racetrack animals. Its use in human beings is limited because of significant adverse effects and the availability of newer, safer drugs. We report the case of a 24-year-old man who ingested 17 g of equine phenylbutazone over a 24-hour period to treat the pain of a toothache. He developed grand mal seizures, coma, hypotension, respiratory and renal failure, and hepatic injury. Serum phenylbutazone concentration obtained approximately eight hours after presentation was 900 micrograms/mL. The patient recovered during six weeks of intensive supportive care and repeated hemodialysis. 
5	Relation between transcardiac and transthoracic current during defibrillation in humans. Conceptually, transthoracic defibrillation threshold current can be considered a function of at least two quantities. It is directly proportional to the transcardiac threshold current and inversely proportional to the transcardiac current fraction (FC) or the ratio of transcardiac and transthoracic current. Although experimental and theoretical estimates of FC have been as high as 45%, previous measurements in humans have not been made. This study was designed to quantify FC in humans. During intraoperative testing of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator, transthoracic rescue shocks of 200-400 J were delivered when the device failed to defibrillate. Simultaneous transthoracic voltage (VT) and transcardiac voltage (VC) between two implanted epicardial patch electrodes were measured. The ratio, VC/VT, was 0.04 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SD) in 10 patients. In 16 dogs, a comparison was made between direct measurement of FC and VC/VT. FC was determined with a specially designed electrode system, which was calibrated to account for field distortion introduced by the electrodes. There was no significant difference between FC and VC/VT, which were both approximately 0.05, suggesting that VC/VT was statistically equivalent to FC. The results of this study, therefore, indicate that during transthoracic defibrillation in humans, approximately 4% of transthoracic current traverses the heart. This relatively small percentage of current results from the existence of parallel pathways, such as the thoracic cage and lungs, which shunt current around the heart. 
1	Malignant cyst of the lateral aspect of the neck: branchial cleft carcinoma or metastasis? A 58-year-old man had a left jugulodigastric mass, which was found to be cystic by computed tomography, and no evidence of other lesions. Grossly and histologically, the surgical specimen consisted of a thin-walled, fluid-filled cyst lined by squamous epithelium that varied in appearance from benign to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The findings supported a differential diagnosis of branchial cleft carcinoma (BCCA) versus cystic growth of a lymph node metastasis from an occult malignancy. On this basis, guided biopsies of the upper aerodigestive tract were performed, with strong suspicion of a tonsillar bed lesion. Microscopic examination revealed the primary tumor within tissue excised from the left tonsillar fossa. Comparison of the current case with cases of BCCA and cystic tonsillar metastases from the literature illustrated the potential pitfalls in rendering a diagnosis of BCCA. Recognition of this lesion as a distinctive clinical variant of oropharyngeal carcinoma is warranted. 
4	Clinical safety and efficacy of celiprolol. The management of essential hypertension requires therapeutic selections that are not only effective in reducing diastolic blood pressure but are also tailored to the individual patient, with minimal effect on patient demographics, concurrent illnesses, and cardiovascular risk factors. Celiprolol hydrochloride is a new highly cardioselective vasodilating beta-adrenoceptor antagonist that has been proven effective and safe for the treatment of essential hypertension. It is comparable to other therapies in blood pressure control while demonstrating an excellent safety profile, favorable hemodynamic activity, and minimal effects on other cardiovascular risk factors. Celiprolol may offer the physician a unique therapeutic alternative. 
4	Angiodysplasia: characterization, diagnosis, and advances in treatment. Gastrointestinal bleeding accounts for 2% of all adult hospital admissions each year. Angiodysplasia is one of the most frequently reported causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. In 80% of patients with bleeding angiodysplasia, the bleeding will stop spontaneously, but will often recur. Although angiography may detect bleeding in 86% of actively bleeding patients, the bleeding rate must be at least 0.5 mL/min. The treatment of choice for control of bleeding has been resection of the suspected segment of bowel, but this procedure is associated with a 10% rebleeding rate and 7% to 8% mortality. Superselective catheterization with infusion of vasoconstrictors has been used to control bleeding, but effects are short-lived. Superselective embolization occludes an offending vessel, but is difficult to perform accurately and is associated with risk of infarction. Laser photocoagulation controls bleeding in 84% of patients, with a 6% complication rate. This method of controlling bleeding offers distinct advantages, especially for the hemodynamically unstable patient. Except for cases in which surgical resection is indicated, Nd:YAG laser photocoagulation is the safest, least invasive, and probably most effective means of treating angiodysplasia. 
4	The estimation of post-test probability of coronary disease following exercise testing using the sequential application of two Bayesian methods. Recent studies have revealed that Bayesian methods to estimate post-test probability following exercise testing differ in their sensitivity and specificity across the range of post-test probability. To take advantage of the relative strengths of each method, we combined two of these methods into a single method (DUAL BAYES) and compared it with the two original methods in 436 patients who underwent stress testing followed within 2 months by coronary arteriography. All patients had post-test probabilities determined using CADENZA (better sensitivity). Those CADENZA-derived probabilities greater than or equal to 50% were substituted with post-test probabilities determined by Diamond and Forrester's original TABULAR method (better specificity). Mean post-test probabilities were as follows: TABULAR 34, CADENZA 48, DUAL BAYES 37 (actual incidence 38%). Comparison of sensitivity and specificity at every fifth percentile of post-test probability revealed that the sensitivity of DUAL BAYES was better than that of TABULAR and equal to that of CADENZA at thresholds less than or equal to 10 and that the specificity was better than that of CADENZA and equal to that of TABULAR at thresholds greater than or equal to 60. Therefore using both methods as indicated above was better than using either method alone. 
4	Early 24-hour blood pressure elevation in normotensive subjects with parental hypertension Subjects with a family history of parental hypertension are reported to have a slightly higher office blood pressure in the prehypertensive stage. Whether this reflects a hyperreactivity to blood pressure measurement or a more permanent blood pressure elevation, however, is not known. In the present study, blood pressure was measured in 15 normotensive subjects whose parents are both hypertensive (FH++), 15 normotensive subjects with one hypertensive parent (FH(+)-), and 15 normotensive subjects whose parents are not hypertensive (FH--); among the three groups, subjects were matched for age, sex, and body mass index. The measurements were made in the office during a variety of laboratory stressors and during a prolonged resting period, and for a 24-hour period (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring). Office blood pressure was higher in the FH++ group than in the FH-- group (p less than 0.05). The pressor responses to laboratory stressors were similar in the two groups, but the FH++ group had higher prolonged resting and 24-hour blood pressure than the FH-- group; the difference was always significant (p less than 0.05) for systolic blood pressure. The FH++ group also had a greater left ventricular mass index (on echocardiographic examination) than the FH-- group (p less than 0.01). The blood pressure values and echocardiographic values of the FH(+)- group tended to be between those of the other two groups. Thus, the higher blood pressure shown by individuals in the prehypertensive stage with a family history of parental hypertension does not reflect a hyperreactivity to stress but an early permanent blood pressure elevation. 
4	Noninvasive discrimination of right atrial ectopic tachycardia from sinus tachycardia in "dilated cardiomyopathy". Right atrial ectopic tachycardia (RAET) with secondary cardiac dysfunction can be difficult to differentiate from primary dilated cardiomyopathy (CMP) with sinus tachycardia. In an attempt to separate RAET from CMP by noninvasive testing, routine surface electrocardiograms (EGGs), 24-hour ambulatory ECGs (Holter monitors), and echocardiograms of patients with RAET (n = 34) and CMP (n = 33) were reviewed. RAET atrial rates were significantly faster than CMP rates on the resting ECG and on Holter monitoring; 12 of 33 patients with RAET had resting ECG rates greater than 150% of predicted normal values for age but none of 32 patients with CMPs had resting ECG rates in this range. Mean P wave axis in the horizontal plane was more posterior in patients with RAET and was less than 0 degrees (negative in lead V2) in 8 of 29 patients with RAET but in 1 of 33 patients with CMP. Second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was observed in 12 of 33 patients with RAET but in none of 33 with CMP. Shortening fraction less than 10% was found in 13 of 33 individuals with CMP but in only 1 of 27 with RAET. We conclude that noninvasive studies can help identify RAET among patients with poor functioning hearts and right atrial tachycardia. 
3	Tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia is a potentially irreversible syndrome of involuntary hyperkinetic movements that occur in predisposed persons receiving extended neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drug therapy. It is usually characterized by choreoathetoid dyskinesias in the orofacial, limb, and truncal regions, but subtypes of this syndrome may include tardive dystonia and tardive akathisia. Although the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of this disorder are unproven, altered dopaminergic functions will likely play a role in any explanation of it. Tardive dyskinesia develops in 20% of neuroleptic-treated patients, but high-risk groups such as the elderly have substantially higher rates. Risk factors include age, female sex, affective disorders, and probably those without psychotic diagnoses, including patients receiving drugs with antidopaminergic activity for nausea or gastrointestinal dysfunction for extended periods. Total drug exposure is positively correlated with tardive dyskinesia risk. Management strategies include a careful evaluation of both the psychiatric and neurologic states, a broad differential diagnosis, and adjustment of neuroleptic agents to the lowest effective dose that controls psychosis and minimizes motor side effects. No drug therapy is uniformly safe and effective for treating this disorder. A favorable long-term outcome of improvement or resolution correlates with younger age, early detection, lower drug exposure, and duration of follow-up. 
5	Contrast venography in patients with very edematous feet: use of transdermal illumination to aid in vein puncture. Contrast venography can be technically difficult or impossible in patients with very edematous feet. The authors report a simple technique that uses transdermal illumination of the edematous subcutaneous tissue to enable visualization of a vein and also guide the needle into the vein. This technique has been used successfully in eight patients in whom conventional attempts at vein puncture had failed. 
4	The clinical course of residual carotid arterial disease. Over a 5-year period 642 patients underwent 686 carotid endarterectomies with patch closure and intraoperative surveillance with continuous-wave Doppler. The perioperative stroke rate was 1.5%. Patients were screened with duplex scans immediately after operation for the presence of residual carotid lesions, and followed every 3 to 6 months for either the development of a true recurrent lesion or a change in a residual one. Five hundred thirty-nine arteries (84%) had no postoperative abnormalities. The incidence of recurrent carotid lesions in this groups was 1.5%, 3.4%, and 5.2% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The incidence of symptoms in this group was 0.2%, 0.7%, and 1.4% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The earliest recurrence or symptom occurred 8 months from operation. One hundred forty-seven arteries had residual lesions that were more common when either a temporary shunt was used or the operation was carried out above the hypoglossal nerve or below the omohyoid muscle. Sixty-one patients who had plaque proximal to the arteriotomy without a significant stenosis were followed an average of 21 months. There were no changes in plaque morphology and no proven symptoms related to the residual lesion. Fifty-six patients with both plaque and significant hemodynamic abnormalities in the carotid bulb were followed an average of 18 months. Seven of these patients (12.5%) had either a significant deterioration of the lesion or a symptom from it. Each event occurred within 6 months of operation. Thirty patients had significant flow abnormalities but no visible plaque. None of these lesions deteriorated. Although common, residual carotid lesions are benign unless the lesion is characterized by both plaque within the artery and a hemodynamically significant stenosis. These lesions should be further investigated and treated when discovered. 
4	Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion in miniature pigs induces local tissue hypoxia and vasoproliferative microangiopathy. In miniature pigs, retinal veins were experimentally occluded using argon laser coagulation. Microvascular modifications leading to retinal hemorrhages and retinal edema were observed some hours after the occlusion. These lesions resolved progressively within 3 weeks after the occlusion, but in most cases ischemic retinal territories persisted. Preretinal partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) measurements, using double barrelled O2-sensitive microelectrodes, showed that all the ischemic areas were indeed hypoxic. In half of the experiments, preretinal and intravitreal new vessels grew on the ischemic territories. Tissue hypoxia appears to be a key step in triggering neovascularization. However, the critical level of hypoxia was not determined. 
1	The relationship of prostate specific antigen levels and residual tumor volume in stage A prostate cancer. Preoperative serum prostate specific antigen correlates well with morphometrically determined prostate tumor volume in prostatectomy specimens. However, since prostate specific antigen is produced by hyperplastic as well as malignant prostatic epithelium, the contribution of hyperplastic epithelium (benign prostatic hyperplasia) to serum prostate specific antigen interferes with the ability of serum prostate specific antigen to predict tumor volume in individual patients. We wondered if the removal of benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue would increase the correlation between prostate specific antigen and tumor volume, and, thus, make prostate specific antigen a more accurate predictor of residual cancer volume after transurethral resection of the prostate. A total of 67 patients with clinical stage A cancer underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy (22, or 33%, with stage A1 and 45, or 67%, with stage A2 disease), and had pre-radical prostatectomy measurement of serum prostate specific antigen and morphometric determination of residual cancer volume in the radical prostatectomy specimen. The correlation between serum prostate specific antigen and residual cancer volume for all 67 patients was 0.66, and for stages A1 and A2 disease it was 0.64 and 0.70, respectively. All stage A1 cancer patients with a serum prostate specific antigen value of 1 ng./ml. or less had residual tumor volumes of less than 0.5 cc and all stage A cancer patients with a serum prostate specific antigen value of more than 10 ng./ml. had residual tumor volumes of greater than 0.5 cc. Of the patients 51% had levels of 1 to 10 ng./ml. and serum prostate specific antigen was not useful to predict residual tumor volume in this group. Serum prostate specific antigen measurements may be helpful in stage A1 cancer patients with levels of 1 ng./ml. or less, or greater than 10 ng./ml. in choosing the most appropriate therapy. 
2	Choice of emergency operative procedure for bleeding duodenal ulcer In a consecutive series of 201 emergency operations in patients with bleeding duodenal ulcer the size of the ulcer was the only factor that showed a significant correlation with the procedure chosen. Vagotomy, pyloroplasty and underrunning of the bleeding point was performed in 101 cases with ten deaths (10 per cent), partial (Billroth II) gastrectomy in 81 cases with ten deaths (12 per cent), and vagotomy and antrectomy in 16 cases with one death (6 per cent). A patient was more likely to be treated by partial gastrectomy if a giant ulcer with an internal diameter of greater than or equal to 2 cm was found. The results suggest that while vagotomy and pyloroplasty, combined with a direct attack on the bleeding point or excision of an anterior ulcer is an acceptable standard emergency operation for bleeding duodenal ulcer, gastric resection proved to be a satisfactory alternative procedure and should be considered in the technically difficult case with a very large ulcer. A giant ulcer was present in 37 per cent of cases coming to surgery. 
4	Percutaneous balloon versus surgical closed commissurotomy for mitral stenosis. A prospective, randomized trial BACKGROUND. We performed a prospective, randomized trial comparing percutaneous balloon commissurotomy with surgical closed commissurotomy in 40 patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Data were analyzed by investigators who were masked to treatment assignment or phase of study. Patients randomized to balloon (n = 20) or surgical (n = 20) commissurotomy had severe mitral stenosis without significant baseline differences (left atrial pressure, 26.1 +/- 4.2 versus 27.6 +/- 6.2 mm Hg; mitral valve gradient, 18.0 +/- 4.2 versus 19.7 +/- 6.3 mm Hg; mitral valve area, 1.0 +/- 0.2 versus 1.0 +/- 0.4 cm2, respectively). At 1-week follow-up after balloon commissurotomy, pulmonary wedge pressure was 14.3 +/- 7.2 mm Hg; mitral valve gradient was 9.6 +/- 5.1 mm Hg; and mitral valve area was 1.6 +/- 0.6 cm2 (all p less than 0.0001). At 1-week follow-up after surgical closed commissurotomy, wedge pressure was 13.7 +/- 5.4 mm Hg; mitral valve gradient was 9.4 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (both p less than 0.0001); and mitral valve area was 1.6 +/- 0.7 cm2 (p less than 0.003). At 8-month follow-up, improvement occurred in both groups: Mitral valve area was 1.6 +/- 0.6 cm2 in the balloon commissurotomy group (p less than 0.002) and was 1.8 +/- 0.6 cm2 in the surgical closed commissurotomy group (p less than 0.0001). There was no difference between the groups at 1-week or 8-month follow-up (all p greater than 0.4). One case of severe mitral regurgitation occurred in each group; complications were otherwise related to transseptal catheterization. There was no death, stroke, or myocardial infarction. Cost analysis revealed that balloon commissurotomy may substantially exceed the cost of surgical commissurotomy in developing countries, whereas it may represent a significant savings in industrialized nations. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that percutaneous balloon commissurotomy and surgical closed commissurotomy result in comparable hemodynamic improvement that is sustained through 8 months of follow-up. 
5	X-linked spinal muscular atrophy (Kennedy's syndrome). A kindred with hypobetalipoproteinemia. Kennedy's syndrome, X-linked adult-onset bulbospinal muscular atrophy, has been described in over 30 families. The characteristic distribution of weakness creates a recognizable syndrome, augmented by frequent findings of testicular atrophy and gynecomastia. Type IV or type II hyperlipoproteinemia has been found in some families. We have studied another family with Kennedy's syndrome, this one with hypobetalipoproteinemia. The diversity of serum patterns suggests that lipoprotein abnormalities are not causally related to either the endocrinopathy or the spinal muscular atrophy. However, gene linkage studies indicate proximity of the gene for Kennedy's syndrome and the gene encoding the androgen receptor, which could explain the combination of a motor neuron disorder and the endocrine abnormalities. 
4	Ten-year incidence of myocardial infarction and prognosis after infarction. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study of Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery BACKGROUND. The 10-year incidence of myocardial infarction (fatal and nonfatal) and the prognosis after infarction were evaluated in 686 patients with stable angina who were randomly assigned to medical or surgical treatment in the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study of Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS. Myocardial infarction was defined by either new Q wave findings or clinical symptoms compatible with myocardial infarction accompanied by serum enzyme elevations with or without electrocardiographic findings. Treatment comparisons were made according to original treatment assignment; 35% of the medical cohort had bypass surgery during the 10-year follow-up period. The overall cumulative infarction rate was somewhat higher in patients assigned to surgery (36%) than in medical patients (31%) (p = 0.13) due to perioperative infarctions (13%) and an accelerated infarction rate after the fifth year of follow-up (average, 2.4%/yr in the surgical group versus 1.4%/yr in the medical group). The 10-year cumulative incidence of death or myocardial infarction was also higher in surgical (54%) than in medical (49%) patients (p = 0.20). According to the Cox model, the estimated risk of death after infarction was 59% lower in surgical than in medical patients (p less than 0.0001). The reduction in postinfarction mortality with surgery was most striking in the first month after the event: 99% in the first month (p less than 0.0001) and 49% subsequently (p less than 0.0001). The estimated risk of death in the absence of infarction was nearly identical regardless of treatment (p = 0.75). Exclusion of perioperative infarctions did not alter the findings. CONCLUSIONS. Although surgery does not reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction overall, it does reduce the risk of mortality after infarction, particularly in the first 30 days after the event (fatal infarctions). 
4	Effect of thiazide on rates of bone mineral loss: a longitudinal study [published erratum appears in BMJ 1991 Jan 26;302(6770):18] OBJECTIVE--To determine the effect of thiazide diuretic drugs on rates of bone mineral loss. DESIGN--Longitudinal, observational study with a mean follow up of five years. SETTING--Hawaii Osteoporosis Center, Honolulu. SUBJECTS--1017 Japanese-American men born between 1900 and 1920, of whom 378 were treated for hypertension (study group) and 639 did not have hypertension (control group). INTERVENTION--Thiazide diuretics were taken by 325 men for a mean of 11.9 years; 53 men took antihypertensive drugs other than thiazides. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Rate of bone loss estimated from serial photon absorptiometric scanning at three skeletal sites (calcaneus, distal radius, and proximal radius). RESULTS--Rates of bone loss at all three sites were significantly reduced among thiazide users when compared with controls. The reductions in loss rate ranged from 28.8% (p = 0.02) (distal radius) to 49.2% (p = 0.0005) (calcaneus) relative to the controls. At all three sites the men taking other antihypertensive drugs had faster loss rates (22.6-43.1%) than those of the controls but the difference was significant only for the distal radius. CONCLUSION--Thiazide diuretics slow the rate of bone loss in elderly men. 
4	Polytetrafluoroethylene graft for spontaneous coronary dissection: 7-year follow-up. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection remains an exceedingly rare cause of myocardial ischemia. The patients are usually young and female, and the dissection is frequently fatal. The use of polytetrafluoroethylene as an aortocoronary conduit is generally followed by early occlusion. We report a case of spontaneous right coronary dissection in which a polytetrafluoroethylene graft was placed that was observed to remain patent by angiography at least 72 months after operation. 
1	Cystic mesothelioma of peritoneum: occurrence in a man. We report a case of cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum in a 54-year-old man in whom cystic masses were removed twice by surgery at an interval of 2 years. The patient died of cardiac arrest shortly after the second operation for a concurrent unresectable colonic cancer. The pathogenesis of the disease is uncertain, but we consider it neoplastic of low grade malignancy. 
5	Cancer in relatives of survivors of childhood sarcoma. Relatives of 88 long-term survivors of childhood sarcoma were examined for the familial cancer syndrome of sarcoma, breast cancer, and other neoplasms (Li-Fraumeni syndrome). Twenty-six of 402 close relatives developed cancer (expected, 23.8), including breast cancer in four mothers (expected, 3.1). Two sarcoma probands who developed second malignant tumors have multiple relatives with cancer and might have an inherited predisposition. An increased cancer risk and exceptional requirement for disease screening appear to be confined to first-degree relatives of a small fraction of children with sarcoma, notably probands with second cancers. 
5	Development of the hip in multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. Natural history and susceptibility to premature osteoarthritis. We have determined the natural history of hip development in 42 patients with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED). Premature osteoarthritis was a frequent outcome and was almost inevitable before the age of 30 years in those with incongruent hips. There were two types of immature hips: type I, the more severe form, had a fragmented and flattened ossific nucleus and acetabular dysplasia, was misshapen at skeletal maturity and osteoarthritic by 30 years of age; the milder type II hip had a small, rounded, uniformly ossified nucleus and a more normal acetabulum. Type II hips were well formed at maturity and were less prone to premature osteoarthritis. Considerable variations were noted in the manifestations of MED between families but not within families. The prognosis of a child's hip could be predicted; in sporadic cases from the type of immature hip, and in familial cases by also taking into account the outcome of affected relatives. 
3	An assessment and care planning strategy for nursing home residents with dementia. Dementia is extremely common among nursing home patients, and it takes many forms. Accurate assessment by staff is crucial in providing appropriate care to these patients. Equally important is the ability to establish care priorities. Current staging models are so general, however, that their usefulness is limited. Thus, this paper proposes a strategy that, using basic assessment data, categorizes dementia residents according to four key determinants of care needs: activities of daily living status, behavioral problems, communication abilities, and physical transition. 
5	Clinical experience with the Palmaz-Schatz coronary stent. Initial results of a multicenter study. Stenting of native coronary arteries with a balloon-expandable stent was attempted in 226 patients after elective angioplasty. Delivery of the device was successful in 213 (94%) of the patients. Of these, 39 received aspirin and dipyridamole only (group 1) and 174 received aspirin, dipyridamole, and warfarin for 1-3 months (group 2). There was no abrupt closure (less than or equal to 1 day) or perioperative death in either group. In-hospital or perioperative complications in group 1 compared with group 2 were as follows: subacute closure (1-14 days), seven (18%) patients versus one (0.6%) patient, respectively, p less than 0.0001; myocardial infarction, five (13%) patients versus one (0.6%) patient, respectively; condition requiring urgent bypass surgery, one (2.5%) patient versus no patients, respectively. Thus, the incidence of major complications such as death, myocardial infarction, or a condition requiring urgent bypass surgery was 15% in group 1 and 0.6% in group 2. Clinical follow-up revealed that 92% of the patients were asymptomatic at 3 months after stenting compared with 6% before stenting (p less than 0.0001). Of the 13 patients who were symptomatic, nine underwent cardiac catheterization and, ultimately, successful elective coronary angioplasty or bypass surgery. We conclude that a high delivery success rate can be expected with this device and that clinical thrombosis is less frequent in anticoagulated patients than in nonanticoagulated patients. Furthermore, in this selected patient population, coronary stenting results in a low incidence of in-hospital and perioperative complications. Clinical success, defined by absence of symptoms, appears to be sustained at 3 months. 
5	Giant lymph node hyperplasia of the lung (Castleman's disease) associated with recurrent pleural effusion. A case of giant lymph node hyperplasia (Castleman's disease) of the lung presented with pleural effusion (which was recurrent), an unusual complication. The patient was treated with pneumonectomy and has survived for three years without relapse. This is the first report of the disease from black Africa. 
5	Randomized comparison of routine vs highly selective use of Doppler ultrasound and biophysical scoring to investigate high risk pregnancies OBJECTIVE--To compare routine versus highly selective use of Doppler ultrasound and biophysical scoring in higher risk pregnancy. DESIGN--A pragmatic randomized trial. SETTING--St James's University Hospital, Leeds. SUBJECTS--500 pregnant women at high risk of intrauterine growth retardation or still birth. INTERVENTIONS--Regular monitoring with biophysical profile assessment and Doppler velocity waveform recording in umbilical and uteroplacental arteries. Results immediately available to clinicians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Gestational age at delivery, obstetric intervention rates and short-term neonatal morbidity. RESULTS--Risk factors were distributed very evenly between the 250 patients in the study and control groups respectively. A total of 902 biophysical profile and Doppler assessments were done in the 250 study group patients and only in 12 patients in the control group. In the study group, absent end-diastolic flow was found in only 2.7% of all 902 measurements. A persistently abnormal biophysical score was always associated with absence of end-diastolic flow. The mean gestational age at induction of labour was statistically and clinically similar in the two groups and there was no overall statistically significant difference in intervention rates between the two groups. There was a statistically significant lower frequency of depressed 5-min Apgar scores in the study group. Serious neonatal morbidity was also statistically significantly more common in the control group than in the study group. CONCLUSIONS--The use of Doppler ultrasound in higher risk pregnancies does not lead to an increase in iatrogenic preterm delivery. The total rate of positive tests on Doppler ultrasound is very low and persistently abnormal biophysical scores are unlikely to be found in patients where umbilical end-diastolic blood flow is present. Surrogate measures for fetal damage seem to be improved when clinicians have access to Doppler ultrasound assessments. 
4	Quantification of rate of coronary artery disease progression by a new method of angiographic analysis. To assess the rate and variability of atherostenosis progression in patients with coronary artery disease at baseline angiography, we used a simplified quantitative method of analysis to study single angiograms in 54 patients and paired angiograms in 29 patients. All discrete lesions were identified, then traced and digitized to determine lumen diameter (LD), and summed to give the total LD; the differences in LD for paired angiograms were summed to give total stenosis change (TSC). The following results were obtained: Correlation between LD measured by our method and LD determined by the Brown/Dodge method was excellent (r = 0.99, N = 54). There also was a high correlation between interobserver (r = 0.98, N = 54) and intraobserver (r = 0.99, N = 54) findings. Short-term TSC (N = 9, angiograms paired at less than 1 week) was negligible (0.03 +/- 0.38 mm). Long-term (N = 20, angiograms paired at 0.6 to 4.3 years) total LD differed significantly from baseline total LD (4.1 +/- 2.5 mm vs 6.0 +/- 3 mm; p less than 0.001), and TSC (2.0 +/- 1.3 mm) in long-term patients differed significantly from TSC in short-term patients (p less than 0.001). These results show that true coronary disease progression occurring over 1 to 4 years can be distinguished from intraobserver, interobserver, and interstudy variability by means of a simplified method and provide approximate rates and variability of progression. These results will be useful for power calculations in therapeutic trials aimed at slowing progression. Further prospective studies with the use of this method appear indicated. 
4	Development and prospective application of quantitative 2-day stress-rest Tc-99m methoxy isobutyl isonitrile SPECT for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The clinical diagnostic accuracy of 2-day stress/rest quantitative Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (Tc-sestamibi) single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) was assessed in a validation population of 61 patients from two different sites using two different camera/computer systems. The study population was made up of 53 catheterized patients, 29 from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) and 24 from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSMC), and eight UTSMC patients with a less than 5% pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease. Interpretation employed gender-specific normal limits developed in an additional 15 men and 8 women at CSMC with less than a 5% likelihood of significant coronary artery disease. The results from CSMC compared with those from UTSMC were not different from each other. The overall sensitivity for detection of patients with coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis) was 94% (CSMC: 92%, UTSMC: 95%). Overall specificity in the five patients with normal coronary arteriograms was 80% (CSMC: 67%, UTSMC: 100%). The normalcy rate in patients with a low likelihood of coronary artery disease was 88%. Vessel sensitivity was 85% (CSMC: 84%, UTSMC: 85%), while vessel specificity was 71% (CSMC: 72%, UTSMC: 69%). There was also no significant difference in the sensitivities and specificities between male and female populations. In addition, the agreement with coronary angiography for assessment of disease extent (normal coronary arteriogram, single or multivessel disease) was 75% (kappa = 0.6 +/- 0.1). This study demonstrated that Tc-sestamibi SPECT by quantitative analysis is accurate for the detection and localization of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the CSMC quantitative method was shown to provide similar diagnostic accuracy when applied to data acquired at a different site using a different camera/computer system. 
4	Assessment of stable ischemic heart disease. Which tests are best for which patients? An understanding of the importance of various risk factors, the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia, and the appropriate use of various noninvasive and invasive tests is essential for management of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Although coronary angiography remains the "gold standard" for diagnosis of CAD, much of the data obtained from risk factor assessment, medical history, and various noninvasive tests provides information that may be even more important than cardiac catheterization data alone for defining prognosis and directing management. 
4	Hypertension in Hispanics, Asians and Pacific-Islanders, and Native Americans. There is a paucity of information about hypertension and its risk factors, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in many racial minorities in the United States. Most of the population groups discussed in this section are composed of several subgroups that differ culturally, socioeconomically, educationally, and ethnically. This fact, however, does not lessen the need for more information about the extent of hypertension and risk factors in these groups. Moreover, a bonus from expanded research in these areas will be new information useful to the general population. 
4	Ultrasonographic assessment of placental abnormalities. Current ultrasonographic techniques offer a novel approach for the identification of a wide variety of placental abnormalities usually described postnatally by the pathologist. Placental vascular lesions, placental tumors, and abnormal placentation are potentially associated with perinatal complications and their diagnosis in utero may influence the pregnancy management. An ultrasonographic classification of placental lesions that is based on their location, size, echogenicity, and number is proposed. Repeated ultrasonographic examination, together with biologic investigations, is important for the prenatal differential diagnosis of most these lesions and for full understanding of their pathophysiologic characteristics and significance. 
4	Multiple orbital tumors were cavernous hemangiomas. Two distinct masses in the left orbit were incidentally found in a 48-year-old woman during a computed tomographic scan done to evaluate neurologic complaints. Initial diagnostic considerations focused on a lymphoproliferative disorder or other systemic disease. Orbitotomy revealed two discrete tumors, both cavernous hemangiomas. Although uncommon, cavernous hemangioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the patient with multiple orbital lesions. 
5	Long-term follow-up comparing subclavian flap angioplasty to resection with modified oblique end-to-end anastomosis The definitive surgical procedure for correction of aortic coarctation remains controversial. Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed a total of 56 children under 4 years of age with coarctation repair between 1977 and 1986. Thirty-four had the subclavian flap angioplasty technique and 22 had resection with oblique end-to-end anastomosis. The group was further subdivided to include only the 23 infants less than 3 months of age--eight infants with resection with oblique end-to-end anastomosis (less than or equal to 3ETE) and 15 infants with subclavian flap angioplasty (greater than or equal to 3SFA). The remaining 33 patients older than 3 months of age were divided into 14 patients with resection and oblique end-to-end anastomosis (greater than 3ETE) and 19 patients with the subclavian flap angioplasty technique (greater than 3SFA). The overall mortality was not significantly different between techniques. Postoperative hypertension was significantly more prevalent with end-to-end anastomosis than with the subclavian flap angioplasty technique (p less than 0.01). Seven patients had recurrent coarctation. The 6-year actuarial freedom from recoarctation was 93% +/- 6% in the less than or equal to 3SFA group compared with 53% +/- 20% in the less than or equal to 3ETE group (p less than 0.02), but there was no significant difference in those children operated on at a later age regarding the type of coarctation repair. Therefore, we recommend subclavian flap angioplasty in patients less than 3 months of age. In those older than 3 months either procedure is safe and the risk of recoarctation is similar. 
3	Magnetic resonance imaging in the preoperative evaluation of cervical radiculopathy. Forty patients with cervical radiculopathy were examined preoperatively with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI was used alone in 27 (68%) of the 40 patients; the remainder also had computed tomography in conjunction with myelography. The primary criterion on MRI for a clinically significant lesion was asymmetrical narrowing of the subarachnoid space in the region of the nerve root. Surgical confirmation of the abnormality was obtained in all 40 cases. The operative findings were a herniated nucleus pulposus (32 of 40 patients), spondylosis (2 of 40 patients), or a combination of the two (6 of 40 patients). MRI identified a surgical lesion (herniated nucleus pulposus, spondylosis, or both) in 37 of the 40 (92%) patients. We think MRI is the only preoperative imaging examination necessary in most cases of cervical radiculopathy. 
1	Clonal origin of pituitary adenomas. Benign pituitary adenomas are among the most common neurosurgical tumors and account for a diversity of clinical syndromes due to their hormone content and release. To determine whether these tumors arise from a single cell or multiple cells, the authors studied X chromosome inactivation in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from pituitary adenomas in women. Tumors of three different hormonal subtypes were examined. One tumor contained cells immunoreactive for prolactin and human growth hormone; one tumor contained foci immunoreactive for the beta-subunits of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone; and the third tumor had no immunoreactive prolactin, human growth hormone, beta-subunits of thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone, or the alpha-subunit. Analysis of the DNA revealed that, in each of the three pituitary tumors, one X chromosome was active in all cells and one X chromosome was inactive, indicating that each of these tumors was monoclonal in origin. It is concluded that clinically evident pituitary tumors arise from a genetic mutation in a single cell. 
5	Total hip arthroplasty in ankylosing spondylitis. Total hip arthroplasty was performed on 29 hips in 19 patients diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis over a 13-year period. The results were analyzed retrospectively with an average follow-up period of more than four years. Complete pain relief was achieved in 97%, and significant gains were made in ambulatory capacity. The limited gains in total range of motion (average improvement 75 degrees) were felt to be primarily due to the high incidence of Brooker Class III and IV myositis ossificans (23%) and long-standing soft tissue contractures. 
5	Toxoplasmic chorioretinitis and hepatic granulomas. A 71-yr-old male presented with a 2-month history of fever, malaise, and weight loss. Physical exam revealed chorioretinitis. Laboratory studies were notable for elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase. Immunoglobulin G antibody to Toxoplasma gondii was positive to a dilution of 1:4096, whereas serologic studies for hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Brucella, and Tularemia were negative. A percutaneous biopsy of the liver revealed hepatic granulomas. Culture of the biopsy specimen was negative for growth of mycobacteria or fungi. Spontaneous improvement in clinical and laboratory parameters occurred over a 4-month period. 
4	Electrocardiographic body surface potential mapping in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Noninvasive determination of the ventricular insertion sites of accessory atrioventricular connections. BACKGROUND. A reliable, noninvasive procedure to determine the location of accessory atrioventricular connections in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome would add an important diagnostic tool to the clinical armamentarium. METHODS AND RESULTS. Body surface potential mapping (BSPM) using 180 electrodes in various-sized vests and displayed as a calibrated color map was used to determine the ventricular insertion site of the accessory atrioventricular (AV) connections in 34 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Attempts were made to determine the 17 ventricular insertion sites described by Guiraudon et al. All 34 patients had an electrophysiologic study (EPS) at cardiac catheterization, and 18 had surgery so the ventricular insertion sites could be accurately located using EPS at surgery. A number of physiologic observations were also made with BSPM. CONCLUSIONS. The following conclusions were drawn: 1) BSPM using QRS analysis accurately predicts the ventricular insertion site of accessory AV connections in the presence of a delta wave in the electrocardiogram; 2) the ventricular insertion sites of accessory AV connections determined by BSPM and by EPS at surgery were identical or within one mapping site (1.5 cm or less) in all but four of 18 cases; three of the four exceptions had more than one accessory AV connection, and the other had a very broad ventricular insertion; 3) BSPM and EPS locations of the accessory AV connections correlated very well in the 34 cases despite the fact that BSPM determines the ventricular insertion site and EPS determines the atrial insertion site of the accessory AV connection; 4) as suggested by the three cases of multiple accessory AV connections, EPS and BSPM may be complementary since BSPM identified one pathway and EPS identified the other (in the case with a broad ventricular insertion, BSPM and EPS demonstrated different proportions of that insertion); 5) BSPM using ST-T analysis is very much less accurate in predicting the ventricular insertion site of accessory AV connections unless there is marked preexcitation; 6) standard electrocardiography using the Gallagher grid methodology (but with no attempt at stimulating maximal preexcitation) was not as accurate as QRS analysis of BSPM in predicting the ventricular insertion site of the accessory AV connection; however, exact comparison is hampered by the different number and size of the Gallagher and Guiraudon insertion sites; 7) BSPM using QRS analysis appears to be very accurate in predicting right ventricular versus left ventricular posteroseptal accessory AV connections; 8) typical epicardial right ventricular breakthrough, indicative of conduction via the specialized AV conduction system, occurs in all patients with left ventricular free wall accessory AV connections; 9) epicardial right ventricular breakthrough was not observed in cases with right ventricular free wall or anteroseptal accessory AV connections; 10) epicardial right ventricular breakthrough can occur in the presence of posteroseptal accessory AV connections, whether right or left ventricular; and 11) the delay in epicardial right ventricular breakthrough in cases with left ventricular insertion may provide a marker to estimate the degree of ventricular preexcitation. 
1	The beta-type transforming growth factor. Mediators of cell regulation in the lung. An increased interest in the role of growth factors in the regulation of processes concerning normal and pathologic lung physiology has spurred a flurry of research in this area. Peptide growth factors are known to control not only cell proliferation but other events such as differentiation, chemotaxis, and matrix deposition as well. The transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) family of regulatory peptides serves as a prime example to illustrate the multiplicity of effects elicited by peptide growth factors in various lung-derived cell types. At present, the TGF beta family consists of at least 17 proteins and, based on sequence analysis, they can be divided into two groups: a cluster that shows very high sequence similarity to TGF beta 1, the closely related group, and a cluster that shows weaker sequence similarity to TGF beta 1, the distantly related group. The purpose of this brief review is to summarize the salient features of TGF beta structure and regulatory abilities of the closely related group. In addition, we will outline the evidence suggesting a role for TGF beta in normal lung development and physiology. Emphasis will be placed on studies with the closely related members TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 2 because, until recently, purified protein was available only for these two proteins. 
5	Airway inflammation during late asthmatic reactions induced by toluene diisocyanate. To determine the importance of airway inflammation for the development of late asthmatic reactions, we examined sensitized subjects during late asthmatic reactions induced by exposure to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in the laboratory. Late asthmatic reactions are associated with a transient increase of bronchial responsiveness and, at the same time, with an increase of neutrophils followed by eosinophils, and of LTB4 and albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Late asthmatic reactions, increased bronchial responsiveness, and increase of neutrophils, eosinophils, LTB4, and albumin concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage induced by exposure to TDI are all prevented by pretreatment with prednisone but not with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent indomethacin. Aerosolized steroids (beclomethasone and dexamethasone isonicotinate) completely inhibit late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI, whereas theophylline has a partial, and verapamil, ketotifen, and cromolyn have no protective effect. These results suggest that late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI may be caused by airway inflammation, and that anti-inflammatory steroids should be recommended in the prophylaxis of TDI asthma. 
3	The effect of nightly nasal CPAP treatment on underlying obstructive sleep apnea and pharyngeal size. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It is usually prescribed for nightly use; however, recent studies show that patients often do not wear the appliance consistently. Previous studies have also suggested that nasal CPAP may improve a patient's underlying OSA even when the mask is not in place. We investigated 12 men with OSA to see if nasal CPAP used nightly for six weeks would improve their underlying sleep-disordered breathing. We also studied pharyngeal volumes measured using magnetic resonance imaging and a computer-controlled digitizing pad. Patients with more severe OSA had improvement after six weeks; however, they still demonstrated significant OSA. Patients with less severe OSA did not have significant change. We were unable to show a significant difference in any patient's awake pharyngeal volumes. We conclude that patients with OSA should be encouraged to wear their nasal CPAP machines regularly. 
3	Postural hypotension: pressor effect of octreotide not mediated by norepinephrine. Orthostatic hypotension of the Shy-Drager syndrome is a chronic incapacitating condition characterized by lack of an appropriate increase in the plasma norepinephrine level in response to standing. Recently, the somatostatin analogue octreotide has been reported to induce a pressor response in patients having this syndrome. We have reported a case of Shy-Drager syndrome in which octreotide was effective, but the rise in blood pressure was not accompanied by an increase in the plasma norepinephrine level. Hence, the pressor effect of octreotide is not mediated by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, but probably through splanchnic vasoconstriction. 
2	Enteric neuronal autoantibodies in pseudoobstruction with small-cell lung carcinoma. Severe gastrointestinal dysmotility is a newly recognized paraneoplastic syndrome that occurs with small-cell lung carcinoma. Thirty-four patients with small-cell carcinoma, of whom 5 had chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction and 29 had no digestive symptoms, were studied serologically. Four of the 5 patients with gut dysmotility had immunoglobulin G antibodies reactive with neurons of the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of jejunum and stomach in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies of this type were not found in any of the 29 patients who had no gut dysmotility, nor were they found in patients with chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudoobstruction (n = 8), ovarian cancer (n = 20), or epilepsy (n = 4) or in normal subjects (n = 9). In 4 of the patients with paraneoplastic pseudoobstruction, antibodies in highly diluted serum (1:4000-1:8000) bound selectively to nuclei and cytoplasm of neuronal elements in the gut. This novel autoantibody activity suggests that intestinal pseudoobstruction occurring in patients with small-cell carcinoma may have an autoimmune basis. From a clinical standpoint, serological testing offers a simple means for determining which patients with gut dysmotility syndromes may have associated small-cell carcinoma, thereby enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment of the tumor. 
4	Prostacyclin and acetylcholine as screening agents for acute pulmonary vasodilator responsiveness in primary pulmonary hypertension. Epoprostenol sodium (prostacyclin) administered intravenously is considered the standard for assessing the ability of the pulmonary circulation to vasodilate. At present, epoprostenol sodium is an investigational drug that has limited availability. In contrast, acetylcholine, also a pulmonary vasodilator, is readily available. Therefore, we assessed the feasibility of using acetylcholine as an alternative to prostacyclin in testing for the capacity of the pulmonary vasculature to vasodilate. Twenty-three patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 58.5 +/- 13.4 mm Hg) received incremental infusions of prostacyclin and acetylcholine to predetermined maximal infusion rates as part of a battery of vasodilator agents administered according to standard protocols (mean, 5.4 +/- 1.2 agents/patient; range, 3-8 agents/patient); the administration of the different agents was timed to avoid synergistic effects. Of all the agents tested, prostacyclin and acetylcholine were most consistently effective in evoking acute pulmonary vasodilation, and both seemed to distinguish patients capable of manifesting acute pulmonary vasodilation from those who were not. However, at maximal doses set by protocol, prostacyclin generally elicited a greater vasodilator response than acetylcholine. The difference in magnitude of response may have been due to use of prescribed dosages of acetylcholine that were submaximal. In other respects, the two agents were similar; both were equally well-tolerated, and side effects were mild and resolved rapidly when the vasodilator infusions were stopped. We conclude that in the majority of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, acetylcholine appears to be an effective and available substitute for prostacyclin in screening for pulmonary vasodilator responsiveness. 
5	Long-term results of surgical resection of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma. This study was undertaken to review the long-term results of multivisceral resection of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma. Between 1964 and 1980, 1042 patients underwent exploratory surgery for colorectal cancer. Of these, 58 patients (5.5%) underwent curative multivisceral resection for suspected contiguous invasion by the primary tumor. Follow-up was complete for all patients. The primary tumors were located in the rectum (38 patients), sigmoid (9 patients), left colon (6 patients), and right colon (5 patients). En bloc resection of other viscera included uterus, adnexa, bladder, vagina, small intestine, abdominal wall, liver, stomach, kidney, and ureter. The operative morbidity and mortality rates were 31% and 1.7%, respectively. Resection margins were free of tumor in 54 patients. In the four patients with tumor-positive resection margins, recurrence of disease was evident between 8 and 22 weeks after surgery (mean survival time, 8.2 months). Carcinomatous invasion of the resected contiguous organ was confirmed in 49 patients (84%). The mean survival time for patients without lymph node metastases was 100.7 months, but it was only 16.2 months (p less than 0.01) for patients with lymph node metastases. Actuarial 5-year disease-free survival rate for patients without lymph node metastases was 76% (36 of 47 patients). None of the patients (0 of 11) with lymph node metastases survived for 5 years. Three of 36 of the 5-year survivors experienced recurrence of disease before the seventh postoperative year; no cancer-related deaths occurred between 7 and 25 years. These data suggest that survival in locally advanced colorectal carcinoma is more dependent on lymph node status than on the extent of local invasion. Effective disease control associated with survival in the long term can be achieved by multivisceral resection. 
3	Congenital demyelinating motor and sensory neuropathy with focally folded myelin sheaths. Six patients (5 index cases and 1 sib) with a congenital motor and sensory neuropathy are described. The clinical, genetic and electrophysiological features resembled Dejerine-Sottas disease or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) type III. Sural nerve biopsy of 5 patients revealed segmental demyelination and remyelination with hypertrophic changes, although onion bulbs were not as ubiquitous as in classical HMSN type III. A striking discriminating feature from HMSN type III was an abundance of focal myelin thickenings (tomacula) present in nearly all teased fibres. Possible pathogenic implications are discussed. These cases corroborate the heterogeneity of congenital motor and sensory neuropathies. 
5	Substance abuse-related spontaneous bladder rupture: report of 2 cases and review of the literature. Spontaneous rupture of the normal bladder associated with alcohol abuse is rare, with only 20 cases reported in the English literature to which we add 2 cases. Heavy alcohol ingestion predisposes the bladder to rupture by the large volume of fluid intake, its diuretic effect and the mental obtusion it produces, clouding sensory cues to void. alpha-Sympathomimetic drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, increase the resistance at the urethral sphincter and exacerbate the effects of alcohol. Cystography will be diagnostic, and prompt operative repair of intraperitoneal rupture is mandatory. Complete evaluation of the bladder, including urodynamic study, is important to eliminate underlying bladder pathological conditions. Substance abuse-related rupture demonstrates a typical constellation of clinical features that necessitate considering it a syndrome separate from other causes of spontaneous bladder rupture. 
5	Recurrent peripheral facial nerve palsy after dental procedures. Peripheral facial palsy is an uncommon complication of dental procedures. Most cases begin immediately after dental anesthesia and resolve within 12 hours. No report of recurrent facial palsy with dental manipulations has previously been described. We report a patient with two episodes of peripheral facial palsy, 2 years apart, developing within 24 hours of dental procedures. A third episode of contralateral facial weakness developed 3 years after the second event. This event was not related to dental manipulations. Although the exact mechanism is not known, dental manipulations may rarely result in precipitation of recurrent Bell's palsy. 
4	Influence of mental stress on ventricular pump function in postinfarction patients. An invasive hemodynamic investigation. To assess the influence of mental stress on ventricular pump function in coronary patients, 88 postinfarction patients (mean age, 53 +/- 10 years) performed mental arithmetic during Swan-Ganz catheterization monitoring a mean of 44 +/- 16 days after myocardial infarction. The test lasted 3 minutes in 66 patients and 10 minutes in 22 patients. Two patients suffered acute pulmonary edema a few minutes after mental arithmetic, but no others complained of symptoms. Mean heart rate increased from 76 +/- 14 to 92 +/- 17 beats/min, mean systolic blood pressure increased from 138 +/- 22 to 160 +/- 27 mm Hg, mean diastolic blood pressure increased from 89 +/- 10 to 101 +/- 15 mm Hg, mean pulmonary wedge pressure increased from 13 +/- 6 to 19 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and mean stroke volume decreased from 72 +/- 18 to 65 +/- 18 ml (p less than 0.001) during mental arithmetic. The changes in central hemodynamics during mental arithmetic were not predictable from noninvasive parameters. In the 22 patients who performed 10-minute mental arithmetic, the changes persisted throughout mental exercise. Eighty-one patients underwent supine bicycle ergometry after mental arithmetic: Absolute mental arithmetic-pulmonary wedge pressure values correlated with those during exercise at the first stage (25 W) (r = 0.63, p less than 0.001) and at maximal load (77 +/- 29 W) (r = 0.49, p less than 0.001), and pulmonary wedge pressure change between stress values and baseline during mental arithmetic did not correlate with those during the first stage of exercise (r = 0.09, p = NS) or during maximal load (r = 0.11, p = NS). Twenty-nine patients repeated the study 1 year after myocardial infarction, and the same hemodynamic changes were observed during mental arithmetic. In conclusion, it appears that mental stress can cause deteriorations of central hemodynamics that can be independent of changes in heart rate and blood pressure and are not predictable from exercise-induced changes; stress-induced cardiovascular activation can last for at least 10 minutes and is stable over long time periods. 
3	The accuracy of predictions about progress of patients on a stroke unit. The aim of the study was to check the accuracy of predictions about the factors which affect the progress, in physical abilities and activities of daily living, of patients admitted to a stroke unit. A series of 60 patients admitted consecutively to a stroke unit were assessed on tests of motor, functional and cognitive abilities at admission. On the basis of these assessments predictions were made about the abilities of the patients at discharge. Patients were assessed for level of motor abilities and activities of daily living at discharge and the accuracy of the predictions checked. Predictions were found to be significantly correlated with outcome but the relationships were not so close as to be useful for the clinical management of individual patients. 
3	An empirical study of diagnostic criteria for delirium. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine empirically how many patients are identified as delirious or nondelirious according to DMS-III, DMS-III-R, and ICD-10 criteria. METHOD: Daily, a trained research assistant using a structured instrument to detect the presence of symptoms of delirium evaluated 325 elderly patients who were admitted to a general hospital for acute medical problems. Each patient's symptoms were then compared with these diagnostic criteria sets to determine if the patient met criteria for delirium. RESULTS: DSM-III criteria were the most inclusive: they identified 125 patients as delirious. DSM-III-R identified a somewhat different group of 106 patients as delirious. ICD-10 criteria identified only 30 patients as delirious. CONCLUSIONS: The development of new criteria for delirium (e.g., DSM-IV) will have to balance the need to define a pure group of patients for research purposes with the need to include cases of clinical interest. Changes in criteria should be based on data such as those presented in this paper. 
5	Relation of central obesity and insulin resistance with high diabetes prevalence and cardiovascular risk in South Asians. The hypothesis that the high mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) in South Asians settled overseas compared with other populations is due to metabolic disturbances related to insulin resistance was tested in a population survey of 3193 men and 561 women aged 40-69 years in London, UK. The sample was assembled from industrial workforces and general practitioners' lists. In comparison with the European group, the South Asian group had a higher prevalence of diabetes (19% vs 4%), higher blood pressures, higher fasting and post-glucose serum insulin concentrations, higher plasma triglyceride, and lower HDL cholesterol concentrations. Mean waist-hip girth ratios and trunk skinfolds were higher in the South Asian than in the European group. Within each ethnic group waist-hip ratio was correlated with glucose intolerance, insulin, blood pressure, and triglyceride. These results confirm the existence of an insulin resistance syndrome, prevalent in South Asian populations and associated with a pronounced tendency to central obesity in this group. Control of obesity and greater physical activity offer the best chances for prevention of diabetes and CHD in South Asian people. 
5	Cerebral circulation and metabolism in patients with septic encephalopathy. Cerebral circulation and metabolism in septic encephalopathy have not been well documented. The authors measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) in six patients with septic encephalopathy associated with multiple organ failure (three to five organs). They found that CBF and CMRO2 were significantly lower than awake control values of 46 +/- 2 to 28 +/- 3 mL/100g/min (mean +/- SEM) and 3.1 +/- 0.2 to 1.2 +/- 0.2 mL/100g/min, respectively. Cerebral vascular resistance (CVR) and cerebral circulatory index (CCI:CBF/CMRO2) were significantly higher than the control values of 2.0 +/- 0.1 to 3.0 +/- 0.4 mm Hg/mL/100g/min and 15.1 +/- 0.8 to 24.2 +/- 3.3, respectively. At the time of cerebral circulatory and metabolic measurements, their consciousness varied between 4 and 10 as evaluated by the Glasgow coma scale. The electroencephalogram showed diffuse slow wave activity and the latency of the auditory brain stem evoked response was prolonged in four of six patients. Computed brain tomography showed either no abnormality or mild atrophy. It is concluded that CBF and CMRO2 are disproportionally decreased during septic encephalopathy in association with dysfunction of the CNS and decreased electrical activity. 
3	Multicenter trial of L-carnitine in maintenance hemodialysis patients. II. Clinical and biochemical effects. Since carnitine deficiency has been reported in some patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, we studied the effects of intravenous infusion of L-carnitine or placebo at the end of each dialysis treatment. The trial, which lasted seven months (one month baseline, 6 months treatment) was multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled, and randomized. Eighty-two long-term hemodialysis patients, who were given either carnitine (N = 38) or placebo (N = 44), completed this study. In each group, clinical and biochemical parameters during treatment were compared with baseline values. Intra-dialytic hypotension and muscle cramps were reduced only in the carnitine treated group, while improvement in post-dialysis asthenia was noticed in both carnitine and placebo groups. Maximal oxygen consumption, measured during a progressive work exercise test, improved significantly in the carnitine group (111 +/- 50 ml/min. P less than 0.03) and was unchanged in the placebo group. L-carnitine treatment was associated with a significant drop in pre-dialysis concentrations of serum urea nitrogen, creatinine and phosphorus (means +/- SEM, 101 +/- 4.5 to 84 +/- 3.9, 16.7 +/- 0.67 to 14.7 +/- 0.64, and 6.4 +/- 0.3 to 5.5 +/- 0.4 mg/dl, respectively, P less than 0.004). No significant changes in any of these variables were noticed in the placebo group. Mid-arm circumference and triceps skinfold thickness were measured in 11 carnitine and 13 placebo treated patients. Calculated mid-arm muscle area increased in the carnitine patients (41.37 +/- 2.68 to 45.6 +/- 2.82 cm2, P = 0.05) and remained unchanged in the placebo patients. 
4	Cyclosporine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy resulting in renal allograft loss and its successful reuse: a report of two cases. Cyclosporine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy is a rare complication of renal transplantation. It commonly leads to graft loss. The mechanism of this entity is unknown. Factors intrinsic to the donor kidney appear to play an important role. We describe two cases of renal transplant patients who lost their first grafts secondary to cyclosporine-induced thrombotic microangiopathy. These patients were successfully retransplanted with an immunosuppressive protocol that included long-term cyclosporine. We conclude that graft loss from this entity is not a contraindication to subsequent successful transplantation with cyclosporine. 
5	Do you have patients with anorexia or bulimia? Understanding is the first step in helping. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa have, in recent years, become disorders of major concern. Young women are particularly prone to such eating disorders, and substantial numbers have involved themselves in the practices that identify these problems. Understanding the thinking behind these disorders is helpful in recognizing them and developing a treatment approach. The most effective medication for bulimia reported to date is fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac). The concurrent participation of a physician, nutritionist, and family therapist in the care of these patients is ideal. 
5	Treatment of alopecia areata with diphenylcyclopropenone. One hundred thirty-nine patients with severe alopecia areata (the majority with the subtotal, total, or universalis type) were treated with topical immunotherapy (diphenylcyclopropenone). Patients were initially treated unilaterally; the other side of the scalp served as a control. In 50.4% of the patients the response was either excellent (total regrowth) or satisfactory (subtotal regrowth with only a few remaining bald patches). The most frequent side effects were eczematous reactions with blistering, spreading of the induced contact eczema, and sleep disturbances. 
4	Prevalence of unsuspected mitral regurgitation and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease and acute pulmonary edema associated with normal or depressed left ventricular systolic function. To define the prevalence and role of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, LV diastolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients with acute pulmonary edema, 40 patients with coronary artery disease and acute pulmonary edema were prospectively evaluated within 36 hours of presentation. LV ejection fraction and 3 parameters of LV diastolic function were measured with radionuclide ventriculography, whereas MR was assessed with Doppler echocardiography. LV ejection fraction was normal in 11 (27%) and depressed in 29 (73%) patients. Moderate or severe MR without LV diastolic dysfunction was common and equally prevalent in patients with and without LV systolic dysfunction (33 vs 38%; difference not significant). Diastolic dysfunction without MR was less frequent but equally prevalent in patients with and without systolic dysfunction (17 vs 27%; difference not significant). Two (18%) of 11 patients without and 12 (33%) of 36 patients with LV systolic dysfunction had both MR and LV diastolic dysfunction. Furthermore, MR was clinically silent and unsuspected in two-thirds of all patients with MR, regardless of a normal or depressed systolic function. These data show that there is a high prevalence of unrecognized moderate to severe MR in patients with acute pulmonary edema, regardless of the presence or absence of LV systolic dysfunction. Furthermore, the prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction without MR is relatively low even in patients with normal LV systolic function and pulmonary edema. Thus, unrecognized MR may be an important contributor to the syndrome of acute pulmonary edema in patients with normal or depressed LV systolic function. 
5	Contribution of the band 3-ankyrin interaction to erythrocyte membrane mechanical stability. In an effort to evaluate the role of the band 3-ankyrin linkage in maintenance of red blood cell membrane integrity, solution conditions were sought that would selectively dissociate the band 3-ankyrin linkage, leaving other membrane skeletal interactions intact. For this purpose erythrocytes were equilibrated overnight in nutrient-containing buffers at a range of elevated pHs and then examined for changes in mechanical stability and membrane skeletal composition. Band 3 was found to be released from interaction with the membrane skeleton over a pH range (8.4 to 9.5) that was observed to dissociate the band 3-ankyrin interaction in vitro. In contrast, all other membrane skeletal associations appeared to remain intact up to pH 9.3, after which they were also seen to dissociate. Whereas hemolysis of mechanically unstressed cells did not begin until approximately pH 9.3, where the membrane skeletons began to disintegrate, enhanced fragmentation of shear stressed membranes was seen to begin near pH 8, where band 3 dissociation was first observed. Furthermore, the shear-induced fragmentation rate was found to reach a maximum at pH 9.4, ie, where band 3 dissociation was essentially complete. Based on these correlations, we hypothesize that the band 3-ankyrin linkage of the membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer is essential for red blood cell stability in the face of mechanical distortion but not for cellular integrity in the absence of mechanical stress. 
5	Results of treatment of displaced patellar fractures by partial patellectomy. The results of partial patellectomy as a treatment for displaced patellar fractures were assessed retrospectively with use of clinical, radiographic, and isokinetic strength-testing criteria. Forty patients who had been followed for an average of 8.4 years were studied. In the extremity that had been operated on, the mean active range of motion was 94 per cent, the circumference of the thigh was 100 per cent, and the strength of the quadriceps was 85 per cent of these measurements in the contralateral extremity. The over-all result was rated as excellent in twenty patients, good in eleven, fair in six, and poor in three. There was a significant statistical correlation between the type of fracture and the outcome. The results of this study indicate that partial patellectomy can be an effective treatment for selected patellar fractures. 
5	Effacement of glomerular foot processes in kwashiorkor. In a study of the pathogenesis of the oedema of kwashiorkor the ultrastructure of the kidneys from 6 children was examined shortly after they died from oedematous malnutrition. There was a generalised effacement of the glomerular epithelial cells onto the basement membrane. The filtration slits that remained were narrowed. The picture was similar to that seen in minimal-change nephrotic syndrome--but none of the children had albuminuria. The degree of effacement was statistically related to treatment with gentamicin. The findings suggest that there is a defect in the anionic charge of the glomerular basement membrane in oedematous malnutrition, that the membrane charge is more easily neutralised by cations such as gentamicin, and that, because proteinuria is not a feature of oedematous malnutrition, the proteinuria in other conditions associated with glomerular epithelial cell effacement (eg, minimal-change nephrotic syndrome) is due to something more complex than simple loss of charge. 
3	Lateralized effects of subclinical epileptiform EEG discharges on scholastic performance in children. The interaction between lateralization of subclinical epileptiform discharges and cognitive tasks was investigated in 21 children (12 girls and 9 boys, mean age 10.6 years). Seventeen had a diagnosis of epilepsy (partial or secondarily generalized). Testing was by reading, arithmetic, and intelligence subtests during continuous telemetric EEG and video monitoring. Children with left-sided discharges had significantly lower reading performance than children with right-sided discharges. During reading, epileptiform discharges occurred relatively less frequently and with a shorter total duration over the left hemisphere than the right. This supports the view that cognitive tasks suppress epileptiform discharges when they activate a region of the brain within the epileptogenic zone. Discharges from other epileptogenic zones not directly activated by the tasks are increased, however. 
5	Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and anaphylactoid reactions to high-flux membrane dialysis In a retrospective study, 9 of 236 haemodialysis patients treated with high-flux polyacrylonitrile 'AN 69' membranes were found to have had anaphylactoid reactions. Treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors had been recently started in all 9 affected patients; only 5 of 227 unaffected patients had been treated with ACE inhibitors, and anaphylactoid reactions disappeared after discontinuation of ACE inhibitors. 
4	The influence of extracorporeal circulation on erythrocytes and flow properties of blood. The influence of extracorporeal circulation on red blood cells and flow properties of blood was studied in 10 patients undergoing aorta-coronary bypass grafting. Blood samples were drawn on admission, under general anesthesia before the operation, during extracorporeal circulation, immediately after extracorporeal circulation, and 24 hours after extracorporeal circulation. Echinocytes were found during and shortly after extracorporeal circulation, but disappeared within 24 hours. Washing the cells in buffer restored the normal discocytic shape, which indicated that a plasma factor was responsible. Red cell membrane lipids were not affected. Analysis of the membrane proteins revealed a decrease of ankyrin after extracorporeal circulation, which was prevented by protease inhibitors during preparation. This suggests an increased proteolytic activity of the plasma after extracorporeal circulation. Red cell deformability was not altered. Plasma viscosity and hematocrit were markedly reduced by hemodilution with the priming solution. Their low levels resulted in a low blood viscosity during extracorporeal circulation, which was even lower at 26 degrees C than before or after the operation at 37 degrees C. We conclude that the red cell is affected by extracorporeal circulation. The flow properties of blood, however, are not impaired, but are improved by hemodilution. 
4	Elevation of plasma neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity and noradrenaline during myocardial ischaemia in man. Plasma levels of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) and noradrenaline were studied for 25 h in 22 patients with acute ischaemic heart disease. On admission, NPY-LI levels were above normal in 16 patients, and 20 patients had increased noradrenaline levels. The initial plasma NPY-LI did not differ between patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and angina pectoris. Initial plasma noradrenaline levels were higher in patients with AMI than in those with angina pectoris. Plasma levels of noradrenaline remained elevated in AMI patients, but decreased towards normal values in patients with angina pectoris. Levels of NPY-LI returned to normal within 25 h in all patients. Tachycardia and left ventricular failure were related to high NPY-LI and noradrenaline levels. A positive correlation was found between noradrenaline and NPY-LI in plasma. It is suggested that neuropeptide Y (NPY), an endogenous vasoconstrictor peptide, should be considered as one of the mediators involved in the cardiovascular response to sympathetic activation induced by myocardial ischaemia. 
3	Vancomycin pharmacokinetics in hydrocephalic shunt prophylaxis and relationship to ventricular volume. Vancomycin pharmacokinetics were determined in 25 patients receiving ventriculoperitoneal shunts for hydrocephalus. Computed tomography scan-derived ventricular-brain ratio as an expression of hydrocephalus varied between 9.3% and 15.4% (12.9% +/- 1.7%). One hour prior to surgery each patient received 1 g of vancomycin infused intravenously over 60 minutes. Samples of cerebrospinal fluid and venous blood were obtained 1 hour later and vancomycin levels assayed by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. There were 11 females and 14 males, with a mean age of 44.5 +/- 10.3 years and a mean weight of 72.0 +/- 11.4 kg. All had normal renal function. Levels of vancomycin in the cerebrospinal fluid at 1 hour ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 micrograms/mL (0.9 +/- 0.3). Weight did not affect these values (p greater than 0.1). Simultaneous blood vancomycin levels varied between 9.1 and 38.7 micrograms/mL (22.3 +/- 8.3). Ventricular volume, expressed as the ventricular-brain ratio, did not correlate with cerebrospinal fluid vancomycin levels (p greater than 0.5). There was no significant increase in concentrations of vancomycin in CSF as cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration increased, nor when blood vancomycin concentration was greater than 20 mg/dL (therapeutic range) (p greater than 0.1). No patient had evidence of infection at 6 months follow up. These results indicate minimal cerebrospinal fluid penetrance of vancomycin when administered systemically 1 hour prior to shunt surgery. In addition concentrations of vancomycin in cerebrospinal fluid bear no relationship to weight, ventricular volume, meningeal inflammation, or blood levels in the therapeutic range. The minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin for staphylococci is 1.5 to 3.1, and as bactericidal levels of 5 to 8 minimum inhibitory concentration are needed to kill organisms, a combination of both systemic and intraventricular vancomycin may be needed to ensure adequate cerebrospinal fluid and tissue concentration of antibiotic during shunt prophylaxis. 
4	The risk for systemic vascular diseases and mortality in patients with central retinal vein occlusion. In this cross-sectional study, the authors evaluated 197 patients diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) at the Wilmer Ophthalmological Institute between 1980 and 1985 to determine the risk of systemic disease and mortality. Complete follow-up information for mortality was obtained in 191 (97%). National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) patients and Wilmer cataract patients formed two comparison groups. The prevalence of hypertension was significantly elevated in the CRVO cases when compared with both comparison groups (P less than 0.03, 0.005). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was increased in CRVO cases in comparison with the NHIS group (P less than 0.005). The prevalence of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease was the same for all three groups, as was overall mortality. Mortality was not increased in CRVO cases as compared with United States mortality rates. 
5	Oral indomethacin for acute renal colic. A number of studies have suggested that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents can relieve renal colic by a mechanism of action different from that of narcotics, offering the potential advantage of avoiding narcotic side-effects such as alteration of mental status. The authors prospectively administered oral indomethacin, 50 mg, to 25 nonvomiting patients with acute renal colic due to a documented stone. Eleven patients group (I) received the drug in an unblinded, nonrandomized fashion after failure of oral or parenteral narcotics to provide satisfactory pain relief, either at home or in the emergency department. In 14 additional patients group (II) indomethacin was given as the only initial treatment. Pain intensity before and after treatment was reported using a 1-to-10 scale. In group I, pain decreased from 5.8 +/- 2.7 to 3.6 +/- 3.8 (P less than .02). Six of the 11 patients reported a decrease in pain intensity of 50% or more, which occurred within 25 +/- 11 minutes, and in 5 of these 6, pain decreased to a 0 or 1 level. In group II, pain decreased from 7.6 +/- 1.5 to 4.6 +/- 4.0 (P less than .008). Eight of the 14 patients reported a decrease in pain intensity of 50% or more, which occurred within 40 +/- 14 minutes, and in 5 of these 8 pain decreased to a 0 or 1 level. Among all 25 patients who received indomethacin, pain relief was not significantly associated with the duration of pain before treatment or with patient age or sex. There was a trend for pretreatment pain intensity to be higher among nonresponders (P = .07). 
2	Erythrocyte sedimentation as a measure of Crohn's disease activity: opposite trends in ileitis versus colitis. To test our hypothesis that the erythrocytic sedimentation rate (ESR) correlates well with clinical activity in inflammatory disease of the colon, but not of the small bowel, we stratified 49 Crohn's disease patients according to their anatomic involvement and then measured the correlations between ESR and clinical activity within each of these anatomical subgroups. For 18 patients with Crohn's disease involving primarily the colon, there was a trend toward a direct correlation between clinical score and ESR (p = 0.15). In the 14 patients with Crohn's disease limited to the colon, this direct correlation was even more pronounced and statistically significant (p less than 0.02). By contrast, an opposite trend was observed for patients with small bowel disease. For the 26 patients with disease involving predominantly the small bowel, as well as for the 22 with disease limited to small bowel, there were statistically significant inverse correlations between clinical score and ESR (p less than 0.04). This difference between the directions of the correlations for Crohn's colitis versus ileitis was statistically significant (p less than 0.05). This study provides further evidence for the importance of analyzing putative indications of disease activity separately for each of the protean forms in which Crohn's disease occurs. 
5	Familial hemifacial spasm associated with arterial compression of the facial nerve. Case report. This report of an 88-year-old woman with familial hemifacial spasm includes the first published postmortem description of hemifacial spasm with cross-compression of the seventh cranial nerve root exit zone by a redundant loop of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and associated vascular plexus. Histological examination of the seventh and eighth cranial nerve complex suggested nerve degeneration because increased numbers of corpora amylacea were present just distal to the compression concavity. There was no evidence of demyelination or gliosis of the nerve. This case suggests that vascular compression of the nerve root exit zone is an important condition in the etiology of most of these cases. This is the third reported case of familial hemifacial spasm; to date, all such patients have had left facial involvement. The family pedigree in this case suggests a pattern of autosomal-dominant inheritance with partial penetrance. The genetic basis for familial hemifacial spasm may involve anatomical variants or anomalies of the posterior circulation, since both posterior inferior cerebellar arteries were congenitally absent in this case. 
5	Myeloma of the head of the pancreas. A case report. A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, IgA-kappa, in 1975. Thirteen years later he presented with obstructive jaundice. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 6-cm mass in the head of the pancreas. Needle aspiration showed myeloma. The jaundice resolved after treatment with radiotherapy. Extraosseous involvement by myeloma is frequently found at autopsy but obstructive jaundice from myeloma of the head of the pancreas is quite rare. This atypical complication of myeloma may be related to the patient's long survival. 
1	Cytogenetic studies in untreated Hodgkin's disease. Very little data have been published on cytogenetic abnormalities in Hodgkin's disease (HD) and their correlation with clinicopathologic features are scanty. We have performed chromosomal analysis of lymph nodes from 60 previously untreated HD patients and obtained analyzable metaphases in 49 patients (82%). Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 33 patients (55%) but only 31 karyotypes could be, at least partially, described. Twenty-nine cases showed numerical abnormalities that involved all chromosomes with the exception of chromosomes 13 and Y, which were gained less frequently and lost more frequently than other chromosomes. Structural abnormalities were found in 30 cases, involving all chromosomes except Y. Chromosomal regions 12p11-13, 13p11-13, 3q26-28, 6q15-16, and 7q31-35 were rearranged in more than 20% of the analyzable cases. No correlation was found between cytogenetic findings and initial characteristics. When compared with diffuse B-cell lymphomas, defects in regions 2p25 (P less than .01), 12p11-13 (P less than .01), 13p11-13 (P less than .01), 14p11 (P less than .01), 15p11-13 (P less than .02), and 20q12-13 (P less than .05) were more frequent in HD. When compared with T-cell lymphomas, only defects in regions 12p12-13 (P less than .01) and 13p11-13 (P less than .01) were more frequent in HD. Failure to obtain analyzable metaphases was correlated with stage IV of the disease (P less than .05) and with a poor survival (P less than .01), but cytogenetic results showed no other correlation with clinical outcome. We conclude that molecular studies in HD should be focused on the short arms of chromosomes 12 and 13. Determination of the clinical significance of cytogenetic findings will require a larger number of patients and a longer follow-up period. 
4	Late streptokinase infusion and antithrombotic treatment in myocardial infarction reduce subsequent myocardial ischemia. Of 255 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction, 111 were eligible for attempted late thrombolysis. They were randomly assigned to either thrombolytic and antithrombotic treatment (treatment group) or routine treatment (control group). Patients in the treatment group received streptokinase initiated late (mean 32 hours; range 12 to 49) after the onset of symptoms, followed by heparin infusion for at least 5 days and warfarin and dipyridamole for at least 3 months. Patients were examined clinically and by bicycle ergometry on discharge from the hospital and after 3 and 12 months. The two groups did not differ with respect to deaths or reinfarctions. There was a trend toward a lower incidence of angina pectoris in the treatment group. Exercise tolerance in this group was significantly higher than in the control group (at 3 months 124 +/- 39 W vs 107 +/- 41 W; p less than 0.05). The difference was entirely accounted for by patients with no previous history of infarction or angina pectoris (at 3 months 142 +/- 37 W vs 112 +/- 45 W; p = 0.01). ECG signs of myocardial ischemia, silent or symptomatic, occurred at significantly lower levels of exercise among patients in the control group compared with patients in the treatment group. The results support the notion that thrombolytic therapy given as late as 12 to 49 hours after the onset of symptoms may reduce the incidence of residual ischemia during the postinfarction period. 
3	The auditory P300 event-related potential: an objective marker of the encephalopathy of chronic liver disease. Recently many variants of electroencephalogram-evoked responses have been studied as potential diagnostic aids in the detection and evaluation of hepatic encephalopathy. This study assesses the value of the auditory P300 event-related potential--a slow component of the auditory evoked response--as a tool in this field. Twenty-one nonencephalopathic and 12 encephalopathic (grade 1/2) cirrhotic patients and 26 controls were assessed clinically and psychometrically. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis and visual evoked response recordings were also conducted. An auditory P300 wave was elicited using the standard two-tone discrimination paradigm. The latency and amplitude of this wave were measured. The latency of the P300 was found to be significantly increased in the encephalopathic patients compared with both nonencephalopathic cirrhotic and control groups (p less than 0.05). Amplitude of the wave was decreased in both nonencephalopathic and encephalopathic patients, but this was not statistically significant. This study suggests that the latency of the P300 is a good marker of grades 1 and 2 clinical hepatic encephalopathy. The delays in the P300 latency may indicate that encephalopathic patients have a deterioration of their stimulus evaluation abilities. 
1	Neuromesenchymal hamartoma of the small bowel. We present the case of a long small bowel stricture with pathological features similar to those described as "neuromuscular and vascular hamartoma," showing in addition extensive fatty submucosal infiltration and fibrous intramural nodules. In the controversy about the nature of this disorder, we consider it a separate entity. Taking into account that other mesenchymal tissues than the originally described can participate, we propose the alternative term of "neuromesenchymal hamartoma" of the small bowel. 
1	Photoelectric quantitative evaluation of argon laser treatment of port wine stains. Sixty patients with port wine stains were treated with the argon laser and graded visually into four subjective categories for changes in skin colour. For objective quantitative evaluation a photoelectric colorimeter was used. Reproducible definition of the lightness of the lesions into numbers was obtained. Differentials in lightness between normal contralateral skin and the port wine stain before and after treatment were quantified for each individual. The objective evaluation revealed a statistically significant difference between the four categories (P less than 0.05). The best clinical therapeutic effect was found to correlate with only 80-90% blanching. The average lightening obtained was 46.5%. Local heating of port wine stains in 12 patients showed no measurable darkening in the colour of the lesions, whereas the normal contralateral skin reacted with marked reddening. Determination of changes in lightness by photoelectric colorimetry provides an objective, quantitative means to evaluate the effects of laser treatment of port wine stains. 
5	A new technique of surgical treatment of chronic duodenal ulcer without laparotomy by videocoelioscopy. We performed truncal posterior right vagotomy with lesser curve anterior gastric myotomy by videocoelioscopy on 10 patients (5 men and 5 women, ranging in age from 19 and 54 years, with a mean age of 32 years). All had a long history of chronic duodenal ulcer with a mean duration of symptoms of 3.8 years. The mean length of the operation was 60 minutes (range: 55 to 110 minutes). There was no morbidity, and all patients were discharged after 5 days. The acid secretion tests under basal conditions and under insulin stimulation preoperatively and 1 month postoperatively showed a mean decrease in the basal output of 79.3% and a mean decrease of 83.04% in the maximal output. The fibroscopic control at the second postoperative month showed a complete healing of the ulcer in nine patients and a residual ulcer scar in one. No patients had any abdominal complaints. Right truncal vagotomy and anterior lesser curve seromyotomy by videocoelioscopy is an efficient and elegant method of treating chronic duodenal ulcer, but it needs thorough experimental practice. 
5	Primary care patients who refuse specialized mental health services. The charts of 65 patients who completed mental health care referrals were compared with those of 65 patients who failed to complete such referrals. In the year before referral, the noncompliant patients made 37% more medical visits than the compliant patients. As compared with the compliant patients, a significantly greater proportion of the noncompliant patients' medical visits were for difficult-to-explain somatic symptoms. Mental health referrals from some physicians were much more successful than referrals from other physicians. By attending to their patients' pattern of health care utilization, primary care physicians may be able to identify patients at high risk for noncompliance with mental health referrals. 
5	A small animal model of human Helicobacter pylori active chronic gastritis. Isolation of a spiral-shaped bacterium closely related to Helicobacter pylori from the cat stomach made it possible to investigate new small animal models of gastric infection. Pure cultures of this bacterium, provisionally named "Helicobacter felis," were fed to germ-free mice. The organism colonized the stomach in large numbers in mucus and deep in the gastric pits and showed the same gastric trophism found with H. pylori. Significant histopathology was seen in all H. felis-infected mice. At 2 weeks postinfection, an acute inflammatory response was seen composed primarily of eosinophils and neutrophils. At 3 weeks, the polymorphonuclear response was more pronounced with large numbers of neutrophils in some areas forming small microabscesses. Lymphocytes also increased in number. By 8 weeks, several relatively large lymphoid nodules were present in the submucosa. Multiple small microabscesses were still present in the pyloric mucosa. This is the first animal model of bacterial gastritis to be described that shows progression from acute inflammation to persistent acute on chronic inflammation (active chronic) as is seen in human infection with H. pylori. 
1	Immunoprofile of mucoepidermoid carcinomas of minor salivary glands. Because the data on the antigenic phenotype of mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) are incomplete and somewhat disparate, 45 MECs were evaluated immunohistochemically for low- and high-molecular-weight keratins, vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, smooth muscle actin, and S-100 protein. Tumors stained uniformly for keratins and, on occasion, focally for vimentin. Tumors were nonreactive with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein and, with few exceptions, to muscle-specific actins and S-100 protein. Clear cell and papillary histologic variants were seen as potential diagnostic pitfalls. If used with hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections, limited potential is seen for this antibody panel in surgical pathology. Myoepithelial cell-associated antigens are expressed to a very limited extent in MECs. 
4	An evaluation of cocaine-induced chest pain STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if enzymatic evidence of acute myocardial injury is present in patients complaining of chest pain after cocaine use when the ECG is normal or nondiagnostic. DESIGN: Serial ECG and creatinine kinase (CK) and CK isoenzymes (CK-ISO) determinations were performed at time of emergency department presentation and every six hours over 12 hours on individuals complaining of chest pain within six hours of last cocaine use. SETTING: ED of an urban tertiary care center. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two individuals with a mean age of 28.5 years. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with positive CK-ISOs were admitted immediately to formally rule out myocardial infarction. Patients developing ECG changes during observation period also were admitted even if CK-ISOs were normal. Patients with unchanged ECGs and normal CK-ISOs were discharged after 12 hours of observation. RESULTS: Eight patients (19%) had elevated CK and CK-ISO values at presentation. Two of these patients had elevated values on three sequential determinations and were believed to have sustained acute myocardial infarction. Six patients had elevated CK and CK-ISOs at presentation only. ECGs remained normal or nondiagnostic in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Enzymatic evidence of acute myocardial injury may occur in patients who develop chest pain after cocaine use and have normal or nondiagnostic ECGs. This injury may reflect acute infarction or transient ischemia. Single or serial normal or nondiagnostic ECGs do not rule out ischemia or injury in this group of patients. 
5	Whither short-course chemotherapy for tuberculous meningitis? Short-course chemotherapy is well established for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis but not for extrapulmonary disease. We present a series of 35 cases in which chemotherapy for tuberculous meningitis was given for a period of less than 2 years. Short-term therapy was associated with recrudescence of tuberculous meningitis and, in some cases, with the development of deep cerebral infarcts and permanent neurological deficits. We think short-term chemotherapy for tuberculosis of the central nervous system is inadequate. 
3	Thymoma: results of 241 operated cases Clinical and histopathological aspects of 241 thymomas were reviewed. One hundred sixty of the patients with thymoma had myasthenia gravis and 15 had other autoimmune diseases; 55% of the thymomas were encapsulated and 45% invasive. Operation was radical resection in 87.5% of the patients, subtotal resection with residual tumor in 8.7%, and simple biopsy in 3.7%. A tumor relapse was observed in 24 patients (10%): 2 (1.5%) of 133 with encapsulated thymomas and 22 (20.4%) of 108 with invasive thymomas; among these patients, a relapse was found in 20.6% of the patients who received radiotherapy postoperatively and in 24.6% who did not. Adverse prognostic factors were clinical stage IVa (multiple pleural nodes), not feasible resection (for technical reasons), inoperable tumor relapse, and association with one of the following autoimmune diseases: pure red cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and lupus erythematosus. Conversely, myasthenia gravis is now a curable disease; it contributes to early discovery of associated thymoma, thus allowing a better survival for patients with thymoma who have myasthenia gravis compared with patients with thymoma but without myasthenia gravis (p less than 0.05). Postoperative radiotherapy does not seem necessary after removal of encapsulated thymomas, but it is advisable in case of invasive thymomas, regardless of the extent of the resection. 
4	Use of single internal mammary artery grafts in older patients. The indications for use of the internal mammary artery as a coronary bypass conduit in older patients are not clearly established. Between January 1985 and December 1988, 786 patients received single internal mammary artery grafts alone (717) or in conjunction with other procedures (69). Of these patients, 341 were 65 years of age or older (mean, 69.3 years). This group was compared with those patients less than 65 years of age (mean, 56.2 years). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of diabetes mellitus; the number of distal coronary anastomoses; left ventricular wall motion score; the frequency of isolated bypass procedures, reoperations, or emergent operations; or the durations of aortic clamping and cardiopulmonary bypass. The older group contained more women (34.9% versus 20.7%) and more patients with left main coronary artery disease (15.5% versus 9.4%) (p less than 0.01). No significant differences in the frequency of reoperation for hemorrhage, perioperative infarction, neurological deficits, requirements for intra-aortic balloon pumping, sternal wound infections, necessity for prolonged ventilatory support, or 30-day mortality (2.7% versus 3.2%) were observed. The length of postoperative hospitalization was greater in the older group (11.8 versus 10.2 days) (p = 0.02). Blinded histological examination of biopsies from 61 internal mammary artery grafts (34 patients less than 65 years, 27 patients greater than or equal to 65 years) showed no significant differences in luminal area or wall thickness. No significant degenerative changes were observed in either group. We conclude that the use of the internal mammary artery for bypass grafting in older patients is safe and may provide long-term benefit. 
2	The clinical significance of fluid collections in acute pancreatitis. Computed tomography (CT) displays fluid collections in patients with acute pancreatitis as well defined intra- or extrapancreatic homogeneous areas with low attenuation numbers. We followed, prospectively, the clinical courses of 128 patients who had CT during an episode of acute pancreatitis, to determine the natural history and clinical significance of any fluid collections that developed. Fluid collections were found in 48 (37%) of the 128 patients with pancreatitis. Thirty-eight developed in the 86 (44%) patients with alcoholic pancreatitis, five in the 33 (15%) with biliary pancreatitis and five in the nine (55%) with other causes of pancreatitis (excluding chronic pancreatitis, trauma, or malignancy). On clinical follow-up of the 48 patients with fluid collections, 21 patients required operation; two died before an operation was done and 25 did not require operation. Operations were done to treat pseudocysts (14), abscess (5), and necrosis (3). One patient had an operation for a pseudocyst and an abscess. All 14 patients requiring operation for pseudocyst had collections greater than 7 cm and 13 of these patients had alcoholic pancreatitis. Of the 25 patients not requiring operation, five were lost to follow-up, and 19 of the 20 who had spontaneous resolution of their fluid collection(s) had collections less than 6 cm in diameter. The eight patients who required operative pancreatic debridement for abscess or necrosis had multiple small fluid collections. In summary, fluid collections were found in one-third of patients with acute pancreatitis and were often associated with the development of local complications. 
5	DNA ploidy pattern in rectal carcinoid tumors. The nuclear DNA pattern of 22 rectal carcinoids was determined by cytophotometry of paraffin embedded tissues. The results were compared with clinical as well as histopathologic features of the tumor. Three of the carcinoids with synchronous or metachronous metastasis had aneuploid DNA pattern, whereas 19 tumors with no metastasis showed diploid DNA pattern. No other single clinical or pathologic feature of the tumor could predict more accurately the malignant potential and the subsequent course of the rectal carcinoid. It is concluded that DNA aneuploidy in rectal carcinoid tumors is not so rare as indicated by earlier studies and that it is a factor of significant prognostic value. 
2	Lymphomatoid granulomatosis presenting as ulcerodestructive gastrointestinal tract lesions in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. A new association. We describe cases of severe odynophagia, extensive oral ulcerations, and bowel perforation in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection that were caused by lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Such presentations in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals are usually ascribed to other causes and may be incorrectly treated on an empiric basis. In addition, deep tissue specimens obtained at the margin of ulcerative lesions are often necessary for definitive diagnosis. We review our limited treatment experience with zidovudine, interferon alfa, and H2 blockers in our patients. Based on the markedly increased frequency in which lymphomatoid granulomatosis is being diagnosed at our institution in the post-human immunodeficiency virus era, we postulated an association between these two entities. 
5	Hemodynamic events in a prospective randomized trial of propranolol versus placebo in the prevention of a first variceal hemorrhage. In a double-blind randomized trial, the hemodynamic events following the administration of propranolol (n = 51) or a placebo (n = 51) were prospectively studied in cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices. The hepatic venous pressure gradient, heart rate, and variceal size were determined at the baseline and 3, 12, and 24 months after the beginning of therapy. Baseline values were similar in both groups. At 3 months, the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased significantly in propranolol-treated patients (from 18.1 +/- 4.2 to 15.7 +/- 3.4 mm Hg; P less than 0.05) but not in patients receiving the placebo (19.6 +/- 6.8 to 17.5 +/- 5.3 mm Hg; NS). At subsequent time intervals this gradient decreased significantly from the baseline value in both groups. Heart rate decreased significantly in the propranolol-treated group at all times (P less than 0.001). Variceal hemorrhage occurred in 13 patients (11 placebo-, 2 propranolol-treated; P less than 0.01), all of whom had a hepatic venous pressure gradient greater than 12 mm Hg. In 21 patients (14 propranolol-, 7 placebo-treated) the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased to less than or equal to 12 mm Hg; none of them bled from esophageal varices, and their mortality rate also decreased. Because most of the bleeding events occurred during the first year (10 placebo-, 1 propranolol-treated; P less than 0.01), propranolol seems to have its protective effect during the period associated with the largest reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient. Because a reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient to less than 12 mm Hg protects from variceal bleeding and increases the rate of survival, this should be the aim of the pharmacological therapy of portal hypertension. 
5	Increased glucose metabolism in the medulla of patients with palatal myoclonus. Hypertrophic degeneration of the inferior olivary nuclei is the pathologic substrate for palatal myoclonus, but the physiologic correlate of this finding is uncertain. Using the 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and PET method, we determined the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose utilization in seven patients with palatal myoclonus (following stroke or infection, or idiopathic), one patient with oculopalatal myoclonus (following a stroke affecting the brainstem), and nine normal subjects. The metabolism of glucose in the medulla of the patients with palatal myoclonus was significantly greater than that of the normal subjects. This may well have been due to increased metabolism of the inferior olivary nuclei. Glucose metabolism in the medulla of the patient with oculopalatal myoclonus was normal. These findings suggest that the inferior olivary nuclei, or a region of the brainstem encompassing the inferior olivary nuclei, are hypermetabolic in palatal myoclonus and may be the generators of the involuntary movements in palatal myoclonus. 
3	Management of children with myelodysplasia: urological alternatives. Recent reports have suggested that the prophylactic use of clean intermittent catheterization in selected infants with myelodysplasia and with normal upper tracts may prevent their deterioration. The selection of these patients at risk depends on urodynamic criteria. We reviewed our experience with clean intermittent catheterization instituted when upper tract deterioration was found. Of 130 patients with myelodysplasia followed at our clinic 25 (19%) had or presented with radiological upper urinary tract deterioration. A total of 21 patients had vesicoureteral reflux and 4 had hydronephrosis without reflux. Treatment consisted of clean intermittent catheterization alone in 5 patients and combined with anticholinergic medication in 16. Four patients with no post-void residual urine were carefully observed without intervention. Urodynamic evaluation was performed selectively in 11 of these 25 patients for persistence of upper urinary tract deterioration or urinary incontinence after institution of treatment. Of the 21 children with reflux 19 (90%) had resolution or improvement for an average followup of 47 months. Hydronephrosis completely resolved in the 4 patients without reflux. Thus, the over-all resolution or improvement rate was 92% for an average of 41 months. Although these excellent results may not be superior to the prophylactic use of clean intermittent catheterization, they validate the assumption that upper tract deterioration can be reversed. The application of current urodynamic selection criteria may result in overtreating a significant number of infants who otherwise may not have upper tract deterioration. Further refinements in these criteria may be necessary to select better not only patients at risk but also to determine the frequency of imaging necessary in this urologically heterogeneous population. In addition, careful consideration should be given to urethral dilation as a third and equally viable alternative to prevent upper tract deterioration. 
5	Rupture of thoracic aorta caused by blunt trauma. A fifteen-year experience. During the 15 years from 1971 through 1985, 114 patients with rupture of the thoracic aorta caused by blunt trauma were admitted to the Shock Trauma Center of the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems. Mean age was 31.3 years (range, 15 to 80). Ninety were male and 24 were female, a 3.75:1 ratio. Of the 114, 89 (78.1%) survived initial resuscitation in the admitting area. Twenty five of the 89 initial survivors (28.1%) died during or after surgical repair. Paraplegia occurred in 11 of the 78 operating room survivors (14.1%). Further analysis was done of the 83 patients admitted in the 10-year period from 1976 through 1985. Mean Injury Severity Score, excluding aortic injury, was 18.2. Twenty-five of the 83 (30.1%) died during resuscitation in the admitting area or operating room. Seven others died during surgical repair and 12 died postoperatively, leaving 39 survivors (39/83 [47%] of total admissions and 39/58 [67.2%] of survivors of resuscitation). Paraplegia/paresis developed postoperatively in six of 34 (17.6%) cases involving shunt and four of 17 (23.5%) without shunt. Other major complications occurred in 21 of the operating room survivors. Statistically significant risk of death or major complication was associated with female sex, higher Injury Severity Score, lower admission blood pressure, larger hemothorax on admission, less qualified surgeon, major operation before aortic repair, use of shunt, and transfer directly from scene of injury. There was no advantage in this series to using or not using a shunt in preventing paraplegia. Mortality rates are realistic for a highly developed trauma system. Better techniques are needed to manage exsanguination and prevent paraplegia. 
4	Percutaneous balloon valvotomy for patients with mitral stenosis: initial and follow-up results. Percutaneous double balloon mitral valvotomy (PMV) was performed in 25 patients with severe mitral stenosis who were followed for at least 6 months after the procedure. There were 22 women and 3 men, with a mean age of 51 +/- 14 years (range, 27 to 74). Hemodynamic and angiographic findings were evaluated before and after PMV and clinical status was assessed at follow-up. There was a significant decrease in mitral gradient following PMV, from 15.4 +/- 5.1 to 5.0 +/- 2.6 mm Hg (p less than .0001); an increase in cardiac output, from 4.6 +/- 1.1 to 5.2 +/- 1.1 L/min (p less than .01); and an increase in calculated mitral valve area, from 0.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.2 +/- 0.6 cm2 (p less than 0.0001). Mitral regurgitation developed or increased in severity in six patients (24%). At the time of follow-up (mean, 12 +/- 5 months), three patients required elective mitral valve replacement for symptomatic mitral regurgitation and 91% (20 of 22) of the remaining patients had continued improvement in functional class. PMV can safely be performed in properly selected patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis with good immediate and follow-up results. 
5	Etiologic, clinical, and pathologic analysis of 31 fatal cases of acute respiratory tract infection in Argentinian children under 5 years of age. During a 3-year survey of 805 children with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) who were admitted to three hospitals in Buenos Aires, 31 fatal cases were recorded--a fatality rate of 3.8%. Of the 31 children who died, 77% were less than 1 year of age, 48% were boys, 58% were malnourished, 29% had previous respiratory disease, and 22% had previous congenital disease. All children who died had clinical diagnoses of pneumonia (71%) or bronchiolitis (29%). Autopsies were performed in 14 of the cases. Viral etiology was determined by both cell culture and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay of either nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) or lung tissue and bacterial etiology was determined by isolation of organisms from blood, lung tissue, and/or pleural fluid. NPA was examined for Bordetella pertussis by IIF. Pathogens were identified in 65% of fatal cases. Seven cases were bacterial; seven cases were viral; and six cases resulted from mixed infections. Lung tissue yielded positive etiologic results in 10 of 13 cases. Histopathologic examination performed on specimens from the 14 autopsied children revealed necrotizing bronchiolitis with intranuclear inclusions (n = 5) and multifocal pneumonia (n = 9). 
5	A prospective study of patients with sciatica. A comparison between conservatively treated patients and patients who have undergone operation, Part I: Patient characteristics and differences between groups. Based on a prospective study on 342 sciatica patients examined with rhizography, the aim was to determine which factors others than the rhizography finding and the grade and duration of symptoms were related to the selection of patients to undergo operation. Compared with surgically treated patients, conservatively treated patients who did not undergo operation and who had pathologic rhizography findings had pessimistic attitudes to possible surgery, often expressed a desire to retire, and considered their work as physically stressful. The women in this group were older and had lower pain indices than women who underwent operation. Conservatively treated patients with negative rhizography had more severe occupational handicaps, minor expectations of possible surgery, physically more strenuous jobs requiring difficult physical positions, and lower indices for pain and ADL than did the operated patients. The social and ergonomic background problems are emphasized in sciatica patients conservatively treated after rhizography. 
3	The stroke syndrome of striatocapsular infarction. Striatocapsular infarction has recently been described as a distinct stroke entity and forms an important subgroup of subcortical infarctions. In a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients over a 10 yr period with this syndrome, clinical and neuropsychological features, pathogenesis and outcome were studied to provide information concerning management and prognosis. The most common clinical presentation was that of a stroke affecting mainly the upper limb with cortical signs such as dysphasia, neglect or dyspraxia. Evidence from EEG, angiographic and neuropsychological data supported a vascular/haemodynamic basis for the presence of the acute neuropsychological changes, while the chronic changes were more likely to be due to diaschisis. A study of risk factors and cerebral angiography enabled 4 pathophysiological subgroups to be identified: (1) cardiac emboli to the origin of the middle cerebral artery; (2) severe extra-cranial cranial carotid artery occlusive disease with presumed embolism to the same site and/or involvement of haemodynamic factors; (3) proximal middle cerebral artery abnormalities causing occlusion of multiple lateral striate arteries at their origins; (4) normal angiography where pathogenesis was uncertain. The risk factors of cardiac disease and smoking were significantly increased as compared with age and sex-matched controls with other forms of ischaemic stroke. Stroke or vascular death rate was 2.7% per yr during a mean follow-up period of 2.25 yrs. Predictors of an excellent recovery with return to normal lifestyle were younger age, only brachial or brachiofacial weakness with absence of cortical signs at presentation and minimal change on angiography. This stroke entity deserves particular recognition in the spectrum of subcortical infarctions because of its specific pathogenesis, distinct neuropsychological features and reasonable prognosis. 
1	Relation of meat, fat, and fiber intake to the risk of colon cancer in a prospective study among women. BACKGROUND. The rates of colon cancer in various countries are strongly correlated with the per capita consumption of red meat and animal fat and, to a lesser degree, inversely associated with the consumption of fiber. METHODS. We conducted a prospective study among 88,751 women 34 to 59 years old and without a history of cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or familial polyposis who completed a dietary questionnaire in 1980. By 1986, during 512,488 person-years of follow-up, 150 incident cases of colon cancer had been documented. RESULTS. After adjustment for total energy intake, animal fat was positively associated with the risk of colon cancer (P for trend = 0.01); the relative risk for the highest as compared with the lowest quintile was 1.89 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 3.15). No association was found for vegetable fat. The relative risk of colon cancer in women who ate beef, pork, or lamb as a main dish every day was 2.49 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.24 to 5.03), as compared with those reporting consumption less than once a month. Processed meats and liver were also significantly associated with increased risk, whereas fish and chicken without skin were related to decreased risk. The ratio of the intake of red meat to the intake of chicken and fish was particularly strongly associated with an increased incidence of colon cancer (P for trend = 0.0005); the relative risk for women in the highest quintile of this ratio as compared with those in the lowest quintile was 2.49 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.50 to 4.13). A low intake of fiber from fruits appeared to contribute to the risk of colon cancer, but this relation was not statistically independent of meat intake. CONCLUSIONS. These prospective data provide evidence for the hypothesis that a high intake of animal fat increases the risk of colon cancer, and they support existing recommendations to substitute fish and chicken for meats high in fat. 
1	Pulmonary complications of combination therapy with cyclophosphamide and prednisone. Oral cyclophosphamide and prednisone are standard treatment for some neoplasms and necrotizing systemic vasculitis and are advocated with increasing frequency for idiopathic interstitial lung disease. During a 15-month period, we observed four cases of acute respiratory failure from Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in patients treated with oral cyclophosphamide and prednisone. One patient each had polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia with red blood cell aplasia. Hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin level less than 3.0 g/dl) and daily therapy were associated with increased risk for development of PCP (p less than 0.05). None of the patients had leukopenia (less than 3,500/cu mm) or neutropenia (less than 1,000/cumm) at diagnosis. All were negative for the human immunodeficiency virus. Patients receiving oral cyclophosphamide and prednisone may be at higher or increasing risk for PCP. A high index of suspicion and aggressive evaluation for opportunistic infection are needed in these patients; consideration for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and development of more quantitative measures of immunosuppression are needed. 
1	Debulking of pelvic and para-aortic lymph node metastases in ovarian cancer with the cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator. Six patients with metastatic ovarian cancer with extensive involvement of the pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes underwent surgical debulking with the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator. Intraoperative and postoperative morbidity was minimal. It is suggested that this technique may be used for cytoreductive surgery in combination with standard surgical techniques. 
4	Spontaneous rupture of liver during pregnancy: current therapy. Spontaneous hepatic rupture secondary to severe pregnancy-induced hypertension is associated with a high rate of maternal and fetal mortality. Numerous types of surgical management have been described, but a uniform surgical approach has not been accepted. The purpose of this review was to examine modes of surgical therapy reported in the literature since 1976, as well as the 11-year experience at our institution. Twenty-eight cases were extracted from the literature and seven more were identified at our institution. The incidence in our population was one per 45,145 live births. Among 27 cases managed by packing and drainage, an 82% overall survival was achieved, whereas only 25% of eight patients undergoing hepatic lobectomy survived (P = .006). Hepatic hemorrhage with persistent hypotension unresponsive to blood products should be managed by evacuating the hematoma, packing the damaged liver, and draining the operative site. More aggressive surgical techniques, such as hepatic artery ligation or hepatic lobectomy, should be reserved for refractory cases. 
4	Diurnal cardiovascular patterns in spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats. This study was designed to determine whether diurnal patterns of blood pressure, heart rate, or locomotor activity differed among two substrains of Wistar-Kyoto rats, derived originally from Charles River or Taconic Farms stock, or the spontaneously hypertensive rat. Cardiovascular parameters were continuously monitored over 24 hours. Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were statistically different among the three groups both during the lights-on (rest) and lights-off (active) phases of the cycle with blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats greater than that of Wistar-Kyoto rats from Taconic Farms, which was greater than that of Wistar-Kyoto rats from Charles River. The largest difference in arterial pressure between Wistar-Kyoto/Taconic Farms and Wistar-Kyoto/Charles River was during the lights-on period. Heart rates of all rats decreased during the lights-on period; Wistar-Kyoto/Charles River had the largest decrease (-70 +/- 5 beats/min), Wistar-Kyoto/Taconic Farms had the least (-17 +/- 2 beats/min), and in spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease was intermediate (-29 +/- 3 beats/min). The pronounced diurnal variation in pressure and heart rate exhibited by Wistar-Kyoto/Charles River was not present in either Wistar-Kyoto/Taconic Farms or spontaneously hypertensive rats. Blood pressure magnitude correlated with locomotor activity during both periods, although all groups showed minimal activity during the rest period. Observed differences between Wistar-Kyoto/Charles River and Wistar-Kyoto/Taconic Farms were not due to a lack of or an abnormality in baroreceptor reflex function. 
5	Antigen specific serum antibody response to Chlamydia trachomatis in patients with acute pelvic inflammatory disease. Sera from 35 patients with acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with and without Chlamydia trachomatis confirmed by culture and sera from 19 control patients with neither evidence of pelvic infection nor C trachomatis infection were studied for the presence of serum IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies to C trachomatis using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunoblotting techniques. There was no correlation between the antibody concentrations in the EIA and the spread of chlamydial infection, as determined by cervical, endometrial, and laparoscopic sampling for chlamydia. The immunoblot analysis showed antibodies to the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of C trachomatis elementary bodies in all patients who had had C trachomatis isolated. Reactivity was also frequently observed against the 68, 62, 60, 45, and 31 kilodalton antigens. About 20 antigenic polypeptides were identified. Differences in antibody prevalence to specific chlamydial antigens, however, were not related to the site of chlamydial isolation or serum antibody concentrations observed with the EIA. The results indicate that patients with PID with and without upper genital tract infection with C trachomatis cannot be differentiated by reactivity of sera to specific chlamydial polypeptide antigens. The determination of a specific serum IgA antibody response by EIA was the most effective single test to discriminate between patients with and without acute chlamydial infection. 
1	Elevated prostaglandin E2 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma. Understanding local pulmonary immunoregulatory mechanism(s) in patients with carcinoma of the lung is an important step towards the development of innovative methods of treatment. Prostaglandin E2 plays an integral role in immunoregulation. Therefore, we evaluated PGE2 concentrations in BALF from 18 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, compared to that from six patients with pulmonary diseases other than carcinoma and ten normal smokers of similar age. The level of PGE2 in patients with lung carcinoma (158.1 +/- 88.7 pg/ml) was significantly (p less than 0.001) higher than the other two groups (16.2 +/- 6.9 and 4.4 +/- 3.4 pg/ml). Levels of PGE2 also varied among patients with carcinoma of different cell types. Patients with SQCA had significantly (p less than 0.001) higher levels of PGE2 (242.7 +/- 29.4 pg/ml) than patients with ADCA or SCCA (82.3 +/- 27.9 and 66.3 +/- 15.2 pg/ml, respectively). Furthermore, there was a marked difference in PGE2 concentration between carcinomatous lung and clinically noninvolved lung in patients with SQCA and ADCA. Further study is warranted to determine the interactions between PGE2 and other cytokines (interleukin-1, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor), as well as the activity of cytolytic lymphocytes (LAK cells) in the lungs of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma. 
1	Psychological and behavioral implications of abnormal mammograms. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate women's psychological responses to abnormal mammograms and the effect on mammography adherence. To identify psychological responses and other factors that predict mammography adherence in women with normal or abnormal mammograms. DESIGN: Survey study with prospective analysis of factors associated with mammography adherence. SETTING: Health Maintenance Organization of Pennsylvania and New Jersey (HMO PA/NJ). PATIENTS: Study patients, members of HMO PA/NJ who were 50 years of age or older, and who had had mammography done 3 months earlier, included women with normal mammograms (n = 121), women with low-suspicion mammograms (n = 119), and women with high-suspicion mammograms (n = 68), but not women with breast cancer. MEASUREMENTS: Psychological responses 3 months after mammography and adherence to subsequent annual mammography were assessed. MAIN RESULTS: Women with high-suspicion mammograms had substantial mammography-related anxiety (47%) and worries about breast cancer (41%). Such worries affected the moods (26%) and daily functioning (17%) of these women, despite diagnostic evaluation excluding malignancy. For each variable, a consistent trend (P greater than 0.05) was seen with degree of mammogram abnormality. Sixty-eight percent of women with normal results, 78% of women with low-suspicion results, and 74% of women with high-suspicion results obtained their subsequent annual mammograms (P greater than 0.05). The number of previous mammograms (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6 to 6.2) and the effect of the previous results on concerns about breast cancer (odds ratio, 0.5; CI, 0.2 to 1.0) were independent predictors of adherence in logistic regression analyses (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of women with suspicious mammograms have psychological difficulties, even after learning that they do not have cancer. Such sequelae do not appear to interfere with subsequent adherence. 
5	Traumatic hyphaema: a retrospective study of 314 cases. A retrospective study was made of 314 consecutive cases of traumatic hyphaema in a mixed urban and rural Scottish population. Secondary haemorrhage occurred in 4.1% of cases and was not associated with a worsening of final visual acuity. There were no identifiable risk factors for secondary haemorrhage. Poor visual outcome was in most cases attributable to retinal pathology. The use of antifibrinolytic agents does not appear to be necessary in such a population, and the importance of detecting associated retinal detachment is emphasised. 
4	Diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome by pulsed Doppler ultrasound. Computed tomography and real-time ultrasonography may not be conclusive for the diagnosis of the Budd-Chiari syndrome; in many cases more information may be needed, especially on vascular alterations. Doppler ultrasonography provides qualitative data on flow direction and pattern, thereby contributing significantly to diagnosis. Eight cases in which hepatic vein patency was unclear and presence of intrahepatic vessels resembling hepatic veins raised problems of interpretation in real-time ultrasonography are described. In some cases, patency or occlusion of the upper portion of the inferior vena cava were difficult to identify with real-time ultrasonography. Doppler ultrasonographic investigation showed flow in the hepatic veins to be completely absent in two cases and reversed in another two. In the remaining four cases, a flat waveform was evident. Flow in the inferior vena cava was reversed in four cases and showed a flat waveform in three other cases. Portal vein thrombosis was detected in only one case, whereas the remaining seven patients showed slow hepatopetal flow. These findings demonstrate that absent or reversed flow in the hepatic veins and/or flat flow in the hepatic veins associated with reversed flow in the inferior vena cava may be considered diagnostic for the Budd-Chiari syndrome. For this series the sensitivity of Doppler ultrasonography was 87.5%. 
5	Infrainguinal bypass surgery: factors determining late graft patency. The results of 373 infrainguinal bypass grafts, in a single centre, between 1980 and 1988 are reviewed. One hundred and thirty in situ vein (ISV), 47 reversed saphenous vein (RSV), 118 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and 78 human umbilical vein (HUV) grafts were used. The indications for surgery were disabling claudication in 25 per cent of patients and limb salvage in 75 per cent. In 36 per cent of operations the distal anastomosis was above the knee and in 64 per cent it was below the knee. Overall 5-year patency rates and limb salvage rates respectively were, for ISV (41 and 69 per cent), RSV (62 and 90 per cent), PTFE (31 and 67 per cent) and HUV (29 and 59 per cent). There was no significant difference in patency among these grafts at the above-knee level, but significant differences between vein and prosthetic grafts were evident below the knee (P less than 0.001). Using a proportional hazards model the three factors that consistently correlated with late graft patency were graft type (P less than 0.001), site of distal anastomosis (P less than 0.001) and distal run-off (P less than 0.001). Overall, the results suggest that prosthetic grafts are a suitable alternative to autogenous vein when the distal anastomosis is above the knee, but vein should always be used, if available, below the knee joint. 
5	Effect of obesity on safe duration of apnea in anesthetized humans. Obese patients have a decreased functional residual capacity and, hence, a reduced oxygen supply during periods of apnea. To determine whether obese patients are at greater risk of developing hypoxemia during induction of anesthesia than patients of normal weight, 24 patients undergoing elective surgical procedures were studied. Group 1 (normal) were within 20% of their ideal body weight. Group 2 (obese) were more than 20% but less than 45.5 kg over ideal body weight. Group 3 (morbidly obese) were more than 45.5 kg over ideal body weight. Patients were preoxygenated for 5 min or until expired nitrogen was less than 5%. After induction of anesthesia and muscle relaxation the patients were allowed to remain apneic until arterial saturation as measured by pulse oximetry reached 90%. The time taken for oxygen saturation to decrease to 90% was 364 +/- 24 s in group 1, 247 +/- 21 s in group 2, and 163 +/- 15 s in group 3; these times are significantly different at P less than 0.05 between groups. Regression analysis of the data demonstrated a significant negative linear correlation (r = -0.83) between time to desaturation and increasing obesity. These results show that obese patients are at an increased risk of developing hypoxemia when apneic. 
4	Ischaemic heart disease among men in Norway during the period 1966-1985: two counties with different mortality time trends. We have examined regional differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease, including sudden, unexpected death (IHD/SUD), among Norwegian men aged 30-69 years, during the period 1966-1985. Mortality time trends were considered. The two counties with the most widely differing IHD/SUD mortality time trends were Rogaland and Oppland. Rogaland, located in south-western Norway, experienced a 24.1% IHD/SUD mortality rate decrease between 1966-1970 and 1981-1985, while Oppland, in central south-eastern Norway, experienced a mortality rate increase of 12.4%. Marked regional differences within these counties were found. The highest IHD/SUD mortality rate increase occurred in rural areas of Oppland. Urban areas of Rogaland had sharply decreasing rates. Knowledge of such regional mortality differences could provide useful information regarding aetiological factors and serve as a basis for preventive measures and health-care planning. 
5	Fetal imaging in the skeletal dysplasias. Second-trimester diagnosis of fetal skeletal dysplasia is becoming increasingly common. By careful examination of the fetus for skeletal mineralization, shape and size of long bones and cranium, and abnormalities of other organ systems, a definitive diagnosis can often be achieved by ultrasound. Fetal radiography is very helpful in giving more information about bone shape and mineralization as well as in confirming the diagnosis. Subsequent obstetric management should be dictated by the natural history of the disease, the parents' wishes, and the gestational age at diagnosis. Because many of these disorders have a high recurrence risk, genetic counseling and follow-up are an important part of the management of these patients. 
1	Magnetic resonance imaging of cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma. Quantifying the response to chemotherapy. This report illustrates the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify the initial extent of a cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma and, more importantly, its response to chemotherapy. Image slices spanning the heart and adjacent structures were analyzed using Simpson's rule applied to the image slices to estimate the tumor volume initially, then after 5 weeks, and again after 4 months of chemotherapy. A substantial, progressive reduction in tumor volume during chemotherapy was shown. After chemotherapy was discontinued, an increase in tumor volume was shown. It is suggested that, in addition to being useful in patient care, the technique may be useful in clinical investigations by providing an objective, quantitative measure of tumor response to therapy. 
3	Rosenthal fibers share epitopes with alpha B-crystallin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and ubiquitin, but not with vimentin. Immunoelectron microscopy with colloidal gold. Ultrastructural immunoreactivities of alpha B-crystallin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin, and vimentin in Rosenthal fibers (RFs) isolated from an Alexander's disease brain were investigated using nonosmium and low-temperature embedding technique. The morphology of RFs embedded in Lowicryl K4M resin was well preserved after treatment with 0.5% Triton X-100. alpha B-crystallin immunoreactivity was present in RFs of various sizes and was the strongest in loosely scattered deposits, which were considered to be the initial stage of RFs. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in RFs was heavy, homogeneous throughout RFs, and equivalent to that in networks of glial filaments. Immunoreactivities of both alpha B-crystallin and GFAP were mainly restricted to the high electron-dense areas within RFs and were proved to exist close to each other by double immunolabeling. Rosenthal fibers were negative for vimentin. Ubiquitin immunoreactivity was relatively homogeneous in RFs with small diameters, but in RFs with large diameters, the immunoreactivity diminished in the center. Based on these observations, combined with the tendency of self-aggregation of alpha B-crystallin, it is conceivable that RFs are huge aggregation products of alpha B-crystallin involving GFAP, and that ubiquitination may be a consequent phenomenon, as it may be in other intracytoplasmic inclusions, such as neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy bodies. 
1	Adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, vincristine and CCNU for patients with Dukes' C colorectal cancer. The Swedish Gastrointestinal Tumour Adjuvant Therapy Group. A prospective controlled randomized trial testing adjuvant postoperative combination chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, lomustine (CCNU) and vincristine) versus no adjuvant therapy in patients operated on for Dukes' C colorectal cancer is reported. In total 334 patients aged less than 70 years were recruited: 205 patients with colonic and 99 with rectal cancer, but there were three protocol violations and these cases are excluded from further consideration. Twenty-seven patients had a limited resection of their cancer. After 5 years' follow-up there was no significant difference in the tumour-free survival rate or in the survival rate between the treated and control groups. Twenty-nine of the 147 patients who started chemotherapy discontinued this treatment because of side-effects, mainly from the gastrointestinal tract. In 30 patients treatment was discontinued because of recurrent disease. The conclusion is that systemic administration of combination chemotherapy for colorectal cancer after operation is not worthwhile in routine clinical practice. 
4	Complement activation and use of a cell saver in cardiopulmonary bypass. Complement activation was evaluated in ten patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and intraoperative blood salvage with a cell saver (CS) to assess the inflammatory response related to the CS. The washed red blood cell concentrate was reinfused after protamine injection. Plasma C3a was measured by radioimmunoassay preoperatively, 5 min before CPB, at 5, 60, and 90 min during CPB, 5 min after protamine infusion, at the end of surgery, and after 24 hr. In addition, a clinical score based on renal, pulmonary, neurologic, and myocardial postoperative evolution was given (0-8) to every patient. Results were compared with the C3a changes and clinical scores obtained from 26 routine (no CS) cardiac surgical patients. Results showed maximal C3a generation after protamine and no further activation in cases of CS concentrate reinfusion, which ranged from 400 ml to 2,000 ml. No difference in clinical score was observed between the CS (1 +/- 1) and control (0.85 +/- 0.6) groups. The authors conclude that the CS does not enhance complement activation resulting from extracorporeal circulation and can be safely used as a blood saving strategy in cardiac surgery. 
4	Clues to the electrocardiographic diagnosis of subtle Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in children. The electrocardiographic diagnosis of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) may be missed because delta waves can be subtle in children, so we examined 66 electrocardiograms from patients with proven WPW, 24 from those with questionable WPW ("subtle WPW"), and 369 consecutive electrocardiograms from control patients to identify additional clues that WPW might be present. Three features were notable in WPW: no Q wave in left chest leads (88%), PR interval less than 100 milliseconds (80%), and left axis deviation (33%). In subtle WPW these findings were similar: 79%, 67%, and 46%, respectively. By comparison, 5% of control subjects had no Q wave, 16% had a PR interval of less than 100 milliseconds, and 4% had left axis deviation (all p less than 0.001). The coexistence of two of these features was common (74%) in WPW and subtle WPW (63%) but rare (2%) in control subjects (p less than 0.001). A PR interval of less than 100 milliseconds was less specific before 1 year of age, but 89% of patients with WPW had a QRS duration of greater than 80 milliseconds versus 2% of control subjects (p less than 0.001). Obvious WPW disappeared later in 11 patients; however, left axis deviation or lack of a Q wave persisted in eight (p less than 0.01). We conclude that the diagnosis of WPW in children, even when subtle, is suggested by the presence of these four changes. Preexcitation may persist in some patients in whom overt delta waves are no longer present. 
3	New approaches to research on the long-term consequences of prenatal exposure to alcohol. As the summary presentation of a symposium on prenatal alcohol-induced brain damage and long-term postnatal consequences, this paper proposes the establishment of two main research priorities--to begin to correlate long-term behavioral effects with alterations in underlying neural substrates, and to explore the mechanisms of neuroteratogenicity. To reach these goals, three objectives are described. First, animal and human research must become more interrelated. Second, experimental observations should be integrated into formal models that incorporate both neural structure and function. Third, researchers should choose well-defined dependent measures that are derived from models of brain function based on modern concepts of cognitive neuroscience. Examples of neuropsychological tests that may serve as the bases for structure/function relationships are presented. Incorporating these objectives into future research will facilitate understanding of the fundamental issues concerning prenatal alcohol exposure and will begin to provide the bases for rational intervention or treatment. 
1	Laryngeal metastasis from colonic adenocarcinoma. Metastases to the larynx from distant primaries are very rare. Usually the secondary lesion comes from an hypernephroma or malignant melanoma. A case of metastatic laryngeal tumour from a colonic adenocarcinoma, occurring in a 59-year-old woman, is presented and the routes for laryngeal spread are discussed. The poor survival-rate of these patients justified only conservative surgery. 
5	The ileosigmoid knot. The ileosigmoid knot (ISK) is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction. Unfamiliarity with the condition could have disastrous consequence at surgery. Over the past 20 years, we have encountered seven cases. Analyzing the data gathered from these, and on reviewing the literature, we found it possible to arrive at a preoperative diagnosis in two patients. Four patients were women, two of whom developed the obstruction in the postpartum period. One of the males was found to have an inflamed Meckel's diverticulum included in the knotting. The symptoms and the clinical findings were nonspecific. The characteristic x-ray findings of a double closed loop obstruction, was seen in only three patients. Resection of gangrenous bowel with anastomoses was feasible in four. Unlike in other series, primary anastomosis of the large gut was undertaken. There were two deaths early in the series. Guidelines to the management have been suggested. 
4	Whither electronic fetal monitoring? Largely based on promising animal studies, continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was introduced into clinical practice in the early 1970s. After almost 20 years of experience, it is now apparent that the anticipated benefits of this technology have not materialized. Undesirable side effects of EFM include inappropriate operative intervention for some patients and increased liability for physicians and hospitals, resulting in an increase in the costs of obstetric services. After reviewing several research studies, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concluded that EFM and intermittent auscultation are equivalent methods for intrapartum assessment. We have developed a protocol for the performance of intermittent auscultation, including indicated responses to different levels of bradycardia. This protocol has allowed us to substitute auscultation for EFM in a high percentage of patients using existing nursing personnel. Laboring patients should, at a minimum, receive information on both intermittent auscultation and EFM to enable them to make an informed choice of method for intrapartum fetal assessment. 
3	Methodology of head-up tilt testing in patients with unexplained syncope Prolonged 60 degree head-up tilt has been shown to be valuable in the investigation of unexplained syncope, diagnosing neurally mediated bradycardia/hypotension or malignant vasovagal syndrome. To evaluate the methodology of tilt testing, the following were examined: reproducibility of results, tilt duration, angle of tilt, method of tilt support and effect of age in patients and control subjects. Seventy-one patients with recurrent unexplained syncope underwent 60 min of 60 degree tilt; 53 (75%) had an abnormal test with vasovagal syncope at 24 +/- 10 min (mean +/- SD). Tilting to 60 degrees resulted in an abnormal test in only 2 (7%) of 27 control subjects without cardiovascular symptoms (p less than 0.001); and 5 (15%) of 34 patients with syncope and documented conduction tissue disease (p less than 0.001). Of 15 youthful fainters, 3 (20%) had vasovagal reactions as did 1 (8%) of 12 asymptomatic youthful control subjects. These 12 control subjects also underwent tilting with a saddle support and 7 (67%) had vasovagal reactions. It is concluded that the duration of tilting at 60 degrees should be 45 min (mean time to syncope +2 x SD in the 53 patients with abnormal results). Twenty percent of patients with an abnormal tilt test may not demonstrate syncope with repeat tilting. Saddle tilt testing in unexplained syncope may result in a loss of specificity. Tilting at less than 60 degrees results in a loss of sensitivity. Head-up tilt may be less useful in youthful subjects with vasovagal syncope than in other subjects. 
3	Retinal infarction during sleep and wakefulness. Brain and retinal infarctions during sleep have been attributed to focal hypoperfusion caused by systemic hypotension combined with underlying arterial stenosis, rather than to embolism. Because some retinal emboli may be visualized on ophthalmoscopy, we studied 24 consecutive patients (18 men and six women) aged 26-78 (mean 58) years with recent retinal infarction and determined whether the infarction had occurred during sleep or wakefulness. All patients underwent dilated ophthalmoscopy and a carotid artery study (arteriography in 20, duplex ultrasound in the remaining four), and 12 had echocardiography. Retinal infarction occurred during sleep at an unexpectedly rate (14 of 24 observed compared with eight of 24 expected, p = 0.02). Retinal cholesterol emboli were seen in one half of the patients regardless of whether the retinal infarction had occurred during sleep or wakefulness. Carotid artery disease was found in seven of the 14 patients in whom infarction had occurred during sleep and in eight of the 10 patients in whom infarction had occurred during wakefulness (p = 0.21). Cerebrovascular occlusive disease was not found in the five patients aged less than 50 years. Our findings suggest that embolism is a common mechanism of retinal infarction during sleep or wakefulness, that in patients aged greater than 50 years extracranial carotid artery disease is a common source of retinal emboli, and that the retina may be especially susceptible to infarction during sleep. 
1	Primary osteosarcoma of the lung. Report of two cases and review of the literature. Two cases of primary osteosarcoma of the lung are presented. In one case, the radiologic, clinical, and cytologic findings led to a preoperative diagnosis of undifferentiated carcinoma of the lung. In the second case, a lung nodule was discovered during postchemotherapy follow-up in a patient with lymphoma. Fine needle aspiration in the second case showed lymphoma, and further chemotherapy was instituted; however, persistent growth of the nodule prompted a resection. Microscopic examination of the resected tumors in both cases revealed histologic features of high-grade osteosarcoma. Flow cytometric analyses of the primary tumors showed abnormal hyperdiploid deoxyribonucleic acid populations in accordance with those seen in high-grade malignant neoplasms. Immunohistochemical studies supported a mesenchymal origin for these tumors. These tumors shared clinical features with other reported cases of primary osteosarcoma of the lung such as large size at diagnosis, occurrence in older individuals, and aggressive behavior. 
5	Adverse effects of aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen on immune function, viral shedding, and clinical status in rhinovirus-infected volunteers. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to study the effects of over-the-counter analgesic/antipyretic medications on virus shedding, immune response, and clinical status in the common cold. Sixty healthy volunteers were challenged intranasally with rhinovirus type 2 and randomized to one of four treatment arms: aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or placebo. Fifty-six volunteers were successfully infected and shed virus on at least 4 days after challenge. Virus shedding, antibody levels, clinical symptoms and signs, and blood leukocyte levels were carefully monitored. Use of aspirin and acetaminophen was associated with suppression of serum neutralizing antibody response (P less than .05 vs. placebo) and increased nasal symptoms and signs (P less than .05 vs. placebo). A concomitant rise in circulating monocytes suggested that the suppression of antibody response may be mediated through drug effects on monocytes and/or mononuclear phagocytes. There were no significant differences in viral shedding among the four groups, but a trend toward longer duration of virus shedding was observed in the aspirin and acetaminophen groups. 
2	The hands in alcoholic liver disease. Chronic liver disease is frequently associated with a hyperdynamic circulation, with warm hands and capillary pulsations. In our experience, however, a significant number of patients with alcoholic liver disease complain of cold hands. In this study, we have investigated the presence of the subjective feeling of hand temperature in 114 patients with alcoholic liver disease compared with 96 healthy controls, and studied possible correlations of this subjective feeling with the severity of liver disease. Significantly more patients with alcoholic liver disease complained of cold hands than did normals, and these differences were more prominent in the male group. The awareness of cold hands appears to be commoner in an intermediate group of patients, between those with noncirrhotic liver disease without varices and those with cirrhosis with varices. A similar pattern of awareness of hand temperature was found when patients were staged according to the severity of their liver disease. We conclude that a staging can be made; at an early stage of liver disease, patients tend to have warm hands, subsequently develop cold hands, and at a later stage, their hands become warm again. 
5	Sports-related and non-sports-related sudden cardiac death in young adults. Sports-related sudden cardiac deaths were compared with non-sports-related sudden cardiac death in individuals (14 to 40 years old) who were autopsied from 1981 to 1988 at the Maryland Medical Examiner's Office. Thirty-four of 690 total cases of sudden cardiac death were sports-related, which represents 5% of sudden cardiac death in this age group. Causes of death were severe atherosclerosis (nine), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with asymmetry (eight), coronary artery anomalies (four), idiopathic concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (three), myocarditis (two), arrhythmogenic right ventricle (one), Kawasaki disease (one), and unknown (six); two of the cases with unknown causes had tunnel arteries. Exercise-related deaths were more likely due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.0007) compared with 102 age-, sex-, and race-matched controls in the non-exercise group; there was no difference in the incidence of severe atherosclerosis (p = 0.4). The mean age of individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with asymmetry was less than that of those with severe atherosclerosis (24 vs 32 years, p = 0.03). Thus exercise precipitates sudden cardiac death in younger individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
5	Nontraumatic coma. Glasgow coma score and coma etiology as predictors of 2-week outcome. In 1987 and 1988, we carried out a prospective study of patients older than 10 years with nontraumatic coma in the intensive care units of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, NY. Of 188 patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) determinations within 72 hours, 61% were dead or in persistent coma by 2 weeks from onset. Age, sex, and ethnicity did not influence outcome. The 2-week outcome for patients with initial GCS of 3 to 5 was 14.8% awake; 85.2% were dead or in persistent coma. For the GCS 6 to 8 group, 53.1% were awake and 46.9% were dead or in persistent coma. Hypoxic or ischemic coma had the worst 2-week outcome (79% dead or comatose); coma caused by metabolic disease or sepsis (68%), focal cerebral lesions (66%), and general cerebral diseases (55%) were intermediate, while drug-induced coma had a favorable outcome (27% dead or comatose). The independent predictors of 2-week outcome were the first GCS and drug-induced coma. The predicted probability of waking at 2 weeks was eight times better for drug-induced coma than other causes when GCS was held constant. Patients with an initial GCS score of 6 to 8 were seven times more likely to waken than those with a score of 3 to 5. The motor subscore alone was a significant independent predictor of 2-week outcome. Modification of coma score to include etiology may give more accurate predictions of 2-week outcome after nontraumatic coma. 
4	Evidence for abnormal Na+/H+ antiport activity detected by phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in exercising skeletal muscle of patients with essential hypertension. 1. Exercise-induced pH changes in skeletal muscle were studied in a group of eight subjects with essential hypertension by using 31P n.m.r. spectroscopy. 2. Leucocyte Na+/H+ antiport activity was measured in vitro in the same subjects using a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye. 3. Resting skeletal muscle pH and unstimulated leucocyte pH values were similar to those in control subjects, but increased Na+/H+ antiport activity was demonstrated in the leucocytes from hypertensive subjects by acid loading in vitro. Decreased skeletal muscle acidification and an increased rate of pH recovery was also demonstrated in vivo in these same patients during an acid load induced by isotonic exercise. 4. These findings suggest that the increased cellular Na+/H+ antiport activity, which has been demonstrated in vitro in essential hypertension, also affects the biochemical response of skeletal muscle to physiological levels of exercise. This strengthens the argument that increased Na+/H+ antiport activity in hypertension is a generalized and physiologically relevant cellular abnormality. 
4	Digoxin for atrial fibrillation: a drug whose time has gone? For over 200 years digitalis compounds have been used to treat atrial fibrillation. The rapid ventricular response to atrial fibrillation is frequently treated with digoxin to produce a controlled heart rate. Digoxin has also been proposed as a treatment for terminating recent-onset atrial fibrillation, for maintaining sinus rhythm after an episode of atrial fibrillation, and as prophylactic therapy in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to prevent excessive tachycardia during a paroxysm. Perhaps because it has been used for so long, few of these indications have been studied scientifically until recently. Studies now suggest that in patients with atrial fibrillation, digoxin is a poor drug for controlling heart rate during exertion, has little or no effect in terminating the arrhythmia, and may occasionally aggravate paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Despite adequate digitalization, the heart rate at the onset of a paroxysm of fibrillation in patients receiving the drug does not differ from the heart rate in patients not receiving it. This article discusses the current role of digoxin in the management of patients with chronic, recent-onset, or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 
5	Outpatient microsurgical reversal of tubal sterilization by a combined approach of laparoscopy and minilaparotomy. A prospective study of 17 cases of microsurgical reversal of tubal sterilization by a combined approach of laparoscopy and minilaparotomy was performed. Inclusion criteria included age less than 43; weight less than ideal body weight plus 20%; documentation of ovulation; 2 cm of proximal oviduct on hysterosalpingography; and a normal semen analysis or postcoital test. A comparison group of the 5 cases of sterilization reversal performed by a standard inpatient technique during the same period was analyzed. The study technique was performed on an outpatient basis in 15 of the 17 cases, 12 patients (71%) conceived 13 intrauterine pregnancies, one ectopic pregnancy occurred, and total patient costs and time until return to work were significantly less with the study versus standard technique. 
5	Standards for analysis of ventricular late potentials using high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography. A statement by a Task Force Committee of the European Society of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the American College of Cardiology. Sufficient data are available to recommend the use of the high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiogram in patients recovering from myocardial infarction without bundle branch block to help determine their risk for developing sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, no data are available about the extent to which pharmacological or nonpharmacological interventions in patients with late potentials have an impact on the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Therefore, controlled, prospective studies are required before this issue can be resolved. As refinements in techniques evolve, it is anticipated that the clinical value of high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography will continue to increase. 
2	Achalasia in the elderly. Effects of aging on clinical presentation and outcome. Clinical and manometric data from 13 elderly subjects with idiopathic achalasia (mean age 79 +/- 2 years) were compared with findings from younger subjects with the same disease (n = 79) to see if aging altered the presentation and outcome of this motor disorder. Fewer elderly subjects complained of chest pain (27% vs 53%), and the pain was significantly less severe (P less than 0.01). Other presenting features (including sex, duration of symptoms, and presence and severity of dysphagia) did not differ between the groups. Across all patients, age weakly and inversely correlated with residual postdeglutitive lower esophageal sphincter; (LES) pressure (R = -0.34), and residual pressure was significantly lower in the older subjects (8.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg vs. 11.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; P = 0.02). No differences in basal LES pressure or esophageal-body contraction amplitudes were present between the groups. Initial success with pneumatic dilation was similar in the two subject groups, but the number of older subjects available for analysis was too small to draw strong conclusions. These results indicate that aging decreases the elevation of LES residual pressure that occurs with achalasia. As elderly achalasia patients also present with less chest pain, the findings may be interrelated. 
4	Renal hemodynamics in normal and hypertensive pregnancy: lessons from micropuncture. Rats are an excellent animal model in which to study the changes in renal hemodynamics associated with normal pregnancy. Midterm pregnant rats exhibit a maximal renal vasodilation leading to increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF). Micropuncture studies in midterm pregnant Munich-Wistar rats have shown that single-nephron GFR (SNGFR) increases, due entirely to increases in plasma flow and, importantly, glomerular capillary blood pressure (PGC) remains unchanged in normotensive pregnancy, due to parallel and proportionally similar reductions in preglomerular (RA) and efferent (RE) arteriolar resistance. Despite the chronic gestational renal vasodilation, pregnancy in normotensive rats with either normal kidneys or a variety of underlying diseases, causes no adverse changes in renal function, perhaps because the glomeruli are protected from damaging high PGC. In the presence of systemic hypertension, the renal vasodilation of pregnancy could put the maternal kidney at risk of injury due to increases in PGC. There are few renal functional studies in preexisting, essential hypertension, but micropuncture studies in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) have shown that repetitive pregnancies in SHRs cause no functional impairment. Surprisingly, SHRs demonstrated no gestational renal vasodilation, although gestational decreases in peripheral resistance certainly occur in the SHR. This absence of gestational renal vasodilation may be a protective mechanism; it remains to be determined whether hypertensive states in which renal vasodilation does occur are associated with increased risk to the maternal kidney. 
1	New concepts in the treatment of stage D1 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Stage D1 disease will be encountered in 20 per cent of patients by those who treat prostate cancer. There is marked heterogeneity among cancers discovered at this stage, with 5-year disease-free survival rates ranging from 0 to 95 per cent. Generally, when prostate cancer has escaped the confines of the gland, metastasis occurs, and widespread systemic disease prevails. Any significant chance for long-term cure will then depend on systemic therapy. From maturing data in retrospective reviews, preliminary data from prospective trials, and recent well-conducted animal studies, chemotherapy and hormonal deprivation appear most effective when tumor volumes are the smallest. This evidence supports the removal of all cancer possible and the early institution of systemic treatment. Caution must be exercised in extrapolating the aforementioned evidence to include cases of more extensive prostate cancer (i.e., patients with bulky pelvic or retroperitoneal disease, distant metastasis, or significant elevation of serum markers). It is doubtful that "debulking" with removal of the prostate and lymph nodes will provide any justifiable advantages in these patients. Whether removal of the prostate affords any local palliative benefit is an issue for debate. Certainly, the primary tumor, if left untreated, will progress locally and cause symptoms necessitating further procedures in more than half these patients, whereas the incidence of local recurrence and the adverse effects of these recurrences in patients with D1 disease after radical prostatectomy and adjuvant therapy is less than 10 per cent. Surgical refinements coupled with acceptably low morbidity now associated with radical prostatectomy have led some authors to endorse the palliative benefits of removing the primary tumor in selected patients. The purpose of this article is not to endorse or disparage the aggressive treatment of patients with stage D1 prostate cancer. The evidence suggests that if long-term survival is the endpoint used to compare treatment groups, then to date no treatment option offers significant advantages. On the contrary, if progression rates or disease-free survival are compared, then cytoreductive surgery and early systemic adjuvant treatment (testosterone deprivation or chemotherapy) provides significant advantages for selected patients with stage D1 disease. Although ploidy analysis, receptor mapping, and oncogene assays are promising, today, there is no practical way to identify patients who will benefit most from multimodality treatment approaches.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
4	The flail mitral valve: echocardiographic findings by precordial and transesophageal imaging and Doppler color flow mapping. To determine the echocardiographic and Doppler characteristics of mitral regurgitation associated with a flail mitral valve, precordial and transesophageal echocardiography with pulsed wave and Doppler color flow mapping was performed in 17 patients with a flail mitral valve leaflet due to ruptured chordae tendineae (Group I) and 22 patients with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation due to other causes (Group II). Echocardiograms were performed before or during cardiac surgery; cardiac catheterization was also performed in 28 patients (72%). Mitral valve disease was confirmed at cardiac surgery in all patients. By echocardiography, the presence of a flail mitral valve leaflet was defined by the presence of abnormal mitral leaflet coaptation or ruptured chordae. Using these criteria, transesophageal imaging showed a trend toward greater sensitivity and specificity than precordial imaging in the diagnosis of flail mitral valve leaflet. By Doppler color flow mapping, a flail mitral valve leaflet was also characterized by an eccentric, peripheral, circular mitral regurgitant jet that closely adhered to the walls of the left atrium. The direction of flow of the eccentric jet in the left atrium distinguished a flail anterior from a flail posterior leaflet. By transesophageal echocardiography with Doppler color flow mapping, the ratio of mitral regurgitant jet arc length to radius of curvature was significantly higher in Group I than Group II patients (5.0 +/- 2.3 versus 0.7 +/- 0.6, p less than 0.001); all of the Group I patients and none of the Group II patients had a ratio greater than 2.5. 
1	Induction of protein kinase C mRNA in cultured lymphoblastoid T cells by iron-transferrin but not by soluble iron. Iron-transferrin (FeTF) is an essential growth factor required for proliferation of lymphoid cells. FeTF activates protein kinase C (PKC) in the lymphoblastoid T-cell line, CCRF-CEM. We have treated CEM cells with human FeTF, then examined levels of PKC mRNA by hybridization analysis using cDNA probes specific for alpha-, beta-, and gamma-PKC subspecies. CEM cell mRNA hybridized with the beta-subspecies probe but not with probes for alpha- or gamma-subspecies. After exposure to FeTF an increase in PKC-beta mRNA was detectable at 10 minutes, peaked at 12 hours, and was sustained for 72 hours. Nuclear transcription assays demonstrated that rates of PKC-beta mRNA transcription were increased in FeTF-treated cells. By contrast, steady state levels of PKC-beta mRNA did not increase after treatment of cells with apotransferrin or gallium TF. Similarly, treatment with soluble iron as ferric ammonium citrate did not increase steady state levels of PKC-beta mRNA, despite producing a marked increase in cellular ferritin content. Ferritin increased from a baseline value of 63 ng/10(6) cells to 98 and 100 ng/10(6) cells in CEM cells treated for 1 hour with ferric ammonium citrate or FeTF, respectively. FeTF did not increase cytoplasmic-free calcium in CEM cells loaded with fura-2, indicating that binding of FeTF to transferrin receptors did not open membrane Ca2+ channels or release intracellular Ca2+. In addition, pretreatment of cells with desferrioxamine, but not ferrioxamine, blocked the FeTF-induced increase in PKC-beta transcripts. Therefore, iron as FeTF (not soluble iron or nonferric TF) stimulates transcription of the CEM cell PKC-beta gene. Transcriptional rate of the PKC-beta gene does not correlate with cellular iron content as judged by ferritin measurements. Furthermore, the requirement for FeTF does not appear to reflect activation of a classic agonist pathway as judged by stable cellular Ca2+. These data suggest that delivery of iron by FeTF to one or more specific cellular compartments may stimulate PKC-beta gene transcription in CEM cells. 
3	Assessment of brain death in children by means of P-31 MR spectroscopy: preliminary note. Work in progress. The authors examined the possibility of assessing cerebral damage with phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy in 24 patients (three infants, four children older than age 5 years, and 17 adults) who met the adult criteria for brain death. In all patients except patient 3 (an infant 8 months old), inorganic phosphate with phosphodiester was observed, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr), which are detectable in healthy brains, were not detected. In 22 of these 23 patients, cardiac death occurred within 7 days after clinical brain death, and in one infant 14 months old, cardiac death occurred 38 days after clinical brain death. In patient 3, ATP and PCr were detected with P-31 MR spectroscopy, and now, more than 20 months after brain death, cardiac death has not yet occurred. In children younger than age 5 years, P-31 MR spectroscopic findings were predictive of the patient's clinical outcome. These findings may help establish criteria for the diagnosis of brain death in children younger than age 5 years. 
5	Spinal cord stimulation: a contemporary series Forty-three patients with chronic pain disorders of different causes were selected for spinal cord stimulation. All underwent implantation of a ribbon electrode through a small laminotomy, under general anesthesia. Thirteen patients (30%) failed to obtain significant pain relief during a period of trial stimulation, and their electrodes were removed. The remainder underwent a definitive implant and were followed for a mean of 13 months (range, 3-33 months). Nineteen of them (63%) continued to experience pain relief. A detailed analysis of this series, as well as a literature review, is presented. 
1	Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma in Brazil and its relation to HTLV-I In a series of fourteen patients with adult T-cell lymphoma-leukaemia (ATLL) in Brazil the main features were lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, hypercalcaemia, and high leucocyte counts, with abnormal lymphoid cells which had irregular nuclei. The series included the youngest patient with ATLL so far (18 months). Analysis with monoclonal antibodies showed a mature T-cell phenotype (CD4+, CD8-). Antibodies to HTLV-I and/or integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA were found in eleven patients. In the other three HTLV-I DNA could not be demonstrated even by means of the polymerase chain reaction; they therefore had HTLV-I-negative ATLL. This report of ATLL in Brazil corroborates serological reports that HTLV-I may be endemic in some parts of that country. Follow-up studies are required to identify precisely the main route of transmission of HTLV-I in South America and the risk factors for the development of ATLL in carriers. 
4	Effect of captopril on renal function in hypertensive dogs with unilateral renal artery stenosis, studied with radionuclide dynamic scintigraphy. The kidneys of five hypertensive dogs with experimental unilateral renal artery stenosis were examined by 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and 131I-hippuran radionuclide dynamic scintigraphy at 10 and 40 min (respectively) following the administration of intravenous bolus injections of captopril. Doses of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg captopril reduced mean arterial pressure by 33 +/- 4, 31 +/- 7, and 51 +/- 4 mm Hg and increased plasma renin activity by 40.1 +/- 9.8, 57.6 +/- 3.2, and 34.4 +/- 15.2 ng A1/mL/h, respectively. The time-activity curves of both 99mTc-DTPA and 131I-hippuran indicated that renal excretory function in the stenotic kidney was compromised with all three doses of captopril. However, if nitroprusside was used to reduce the mean arterial pressure to a level comparable to that with captopril, there was no appreciable increase in plasma renin activity and renal excretory function was only partially affected in the stenotic kidney. One hour after the administration of 0.5 mg/kg captopril, the function of the stenotic kidneys was partially restored and, by two hours, the time-activity curves were comparable to control scans. These data demonstrate a reversible, time-limited suppression of stenotic kidney function by captopril in renovascular hypertension and provide support for the use of captopril in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension by radionuclide dynamic scintigraphy. 
4	The J-curve phenomenon and the treatment of hypertension. Is there a point beyond which pressure reduction is dangerous? We critically appraised the medical literature to evaluate whether there is a point beyond which blood pressure reduction in hypertensive subjects is no longer beneficial and possibly even deleterious. Thirteen studies that stratified cardiovascular outcomes by level of achieved blood pressure in treated hypertensive subjects who had been followed up for at least 1 year were critiqued by four independent reviewers. Data addressing population, protocol, and methodological characteristics were evaluated. Studies did not show a consistent J-shaped relationship between treated blood pressure and stroke, but they did demonstrate a consistent J-shaped relationship for cardiac events and diastolic blood pressure. The beneficial therapeutic threshold point was 85 mm Hg. We conclude that low treated diastolic blood pressure levels, ie, below 85 mm Hg, are associated with increased risk of cardiac events. 
5	Vertigo after epidural morphine. Severe complications from the use of epidural morphine for analgesia after Caesarean section are rare. A case is reported of extreme prostrating vertigo several hours after epidural morphine injection, where the time of onset of the symptom coincided with the expected time of arrival of the morphine within intra-cerebral cerebro-spinal fluid. 
4	Myocardial perfusion imaging with technetium-99m sestamibi SPECT in the evaluation of coronary artery disease. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi is a new myocardial perfusion imaging agent that offers significant advantages over thallium-201 (Tl-201) for myocardial perfusion imaging. The results of the current clinical trials using acquisition and processing parameters similar to those for Tl-201 and a separate (2-day) injection protocol suggest that Tc-99m sestamibi and Tl-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provide similar information with respect to detection of myocardial perfusion defects, assessment of the pattern of defect reversibility, overall detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) and detection of disease in individual coronary arteries. Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT appears to be superior to Tc-99m sestamibi planar imaging because the former provides a higher defect contrast and is more accurate for detection of disease in individual coronary arteries. Research is currently under way addressing optimization of acquisition and processing of Tc-99m sestamibi studies and development of quantitative algorithms for detection and localization of CAD and sizing of transmural and nontransmural myocardial perfusion defects. It is expected that with the implementation of the final results of these new developments, further significant improvement in image quality will be attained, which in turn will further increase the confidence in image interpretation. Development of algorithms for analysis of end-diastolic myocardial images may allow better evaluation of small and nontransmural myocardial defects. Furthermore, gated studies may provide valuable information with respect to regional myocardial wall motion and wall thickening. With the implementation of algorithms for attenuation and scatter correction, the overall specificity of Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT should improve significantly because of a substantial decrease in the occurrence of attenuation-related image artifacts. 
4	Comparison between perindopril and nifedipine in hypertensive and normotensive diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. Melbourne Diabetic Nephropathy Study Group OBJECTIVE--To compare the efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with calcium antagonism in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. DESIGN--Randomised study of diabetic patients with microalbuminuria treated with perindopril or nifedipine for 12 months and monitored for one or three months after stopping treatment depending on whether they were hypertensive or normotensive. Patients were randomised separately according to whether they were hypertensive or normotensive. SETTING--Diabetic clinics in three university teaching hospitals. PATIENTS--50 diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria. In all, 43 completed the study: 30 were normotensive and 13 hypertensive; 19 had type I diabetes and 24 had type II diabetes. INTERVENTIONS--For 12 months 20 patients were given perindopril 2-8 mg daily and 23 were given nifedipine 20-80 mg daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Albumin excretion rate, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS--Both perindopril and nifedipine significantly reduced mean blood pressure. During treatment there was no significant difference between those treated with perindopril and those treated with nifedipine with respect to albuminuria or mean blood pressure. Stopping treatment with both drugs was associated with a sustained increase in albuminuria and mean blood pressure. There was a significant correlation between mean blood pressure and albuminuria and also between the reduction in mean blood pressure and the decrease in albuminuria during treatment with both drugs. In hypertensive patients both drugs caused significant decreases in mean blood pressure and albuminuria. In normotensive patients there was no significant reduction in albuminuria with either regimen. CONCLUSIONS--In diabetic patients with microalbuminuria blood pressure seems to be an important determinant of urinary albumin excretion. Perindopril and nifedipine have similar effects on urinary albumin excretion, both preventing increases in albuminuria in normotensive patients and decreasing albuminuria in hypertensive patients. 
5	Endoscopic repair of supraglottic laryngeal clefts. We describe the technique of endoscopic diagnosis and endoscopic surgical repair used in the management of supraglottic interarytenoid laryngeal clefts in 11 children seen between 1981 and 1988 at the Hospital for Sick Children, London, England. Six of the children had primary type I clefts that required endoscopic repair. The symptoms included inspiratory stridor, choking during eating, and aspiration. Five of the children had previous transcervical repair of type II clefts that had partial breakdown in the interarytenoid area causing symptoms of aspiration, which required secondary repair endoscopically. All the patients had successful microlaryngoscopic closure; in two children, however, the breakdown of the repair necessitated repeated endoscopic correction. The only complication occurred in a case of postoperative supraglottitis, which was successfully managed with intubation and antibiotics. We conclude that endoscopic repair is a useful and reliable technique and an elegant alternative to the open transcervical approach for the closure of supraglottic laryngeal clefts. 
4	Medical management of chronic heart failure: inotropic, vasodilator, or inodilator drugs? On the basis of pathophysiologic mechanisms, the medical therapy of today for chronic heart failure is reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of the vasodilator drugs and the inotropic drugs are presented. Finally, the therapeutic value of the inodilator drugs, which combine the central myocardial effects of positive inotropic agents with those of peripheral vasodilators, is discussed. In particular, the orally available dopaminergic agents, such as ibopamine, which interact with beta-receptors in the heart (mediating a positive inotropic effect) as well as with dopaminergic receptors in the peripheral vessels (mediating a systemic vasodilator effect) and in the kidneys (potentiating the natriuretic effect of diuresis), seem to be an advancement in the modern medical therapy of chronic heart failure. Data are shown during long-term treatment with ibopamine, in which the sustained clinical benefit in heart failure was not diminished, despite a decrease of the adrenergic receptors in blood cells. Dopamine plasma concentration was permanently normalized during long-term treatment. The discrepancy between clinical improvement and the measured adrenergic downregulation may be due to the interference of the inodilator with neurohormonal systems at multiple sites and is probably independent of receptor activation. It is suggested that the biosynthesis of noradrenaline is improved by increasing intracellular dopamine transport. 
1	Liver tumor imaging. Liver tumor imaging is the paradigm of the dilemma of diagnostic decision-making in the current era of abundant high technology. In part, this is a reflection of the multiplicity of imaging techniques now in wide use worldwide. These include ultrasound (US), radionuclide scintigraphy (RNS), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and techniques especially designed for staging the extent of known liver cancer, such as computed tomography during arterial portography (CTAP) and intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS). Most authorities concede that CT scanning is the single test most closely fitting the designation "gold standard" for liver tumor imaging, although MRI, a less mature technique, is already preferred by some. Local factors profoundly influence the selection and sequence of imaging studies, including available equipment, radiologic skills, institutional interests, and especially the specific clinical circumstances of the patient. Thus, diagnostic algorithms or decision trees for sequential imaging workup of liver tumor suspects tend to be somewhat institution specific. 
5	Prognosis of acute myocardial infarction complicated by primary ventricular fibrillation. Principal Investigators of the SPRINT Study. In 5,839 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), hospitalized between July 1981 and July 1983 in 14 coronary care units in Israel, the incidence of primary ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 2.1%. Patients with primary VF resembled counterparts without VF in terms of age, gender, frequency of previous AMI and past cigarette smoking habits. The hospital course of patients with primary VF revealed increased incidence of primary atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular block. Increased serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase were noted among the patients with primary VF. In-hospital mortality rate was 18.8% in 122 patients with primary VF compared with 8.5% in 3,707 patients forming the reference group (p less than 0.01). Adjustment by age using logistic function yielded an estimate of 2.86 for relative mortality odds associated with primary VF, and further adjustment by gender, history of AMI, systemic hypertension, and by enzymatically estimated infarct size slightly reduced the estimated odds, at 2.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 4.46). Prognosis after discharge from the hospital was independent of primary VF. In conclusion, primary VF exerts an independent, significant effect on in-hospital mortality. 
1	Diagnostic significance of carcinoembryonic antigen in the differential diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. The histologic and cytologic distinction of malignant mesothelioma from carcinomas metastatic to the pleura or peritoneum is often problematic. For this reason immunologic methods are being increasingly used as diagnostic adjuncts. This review summarizes 40 studies on the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen in mesotheliomas and in lung and other carcinomas involving the pleura or peritoneum. Carcinoembryonic antigen was identified immunohistochemically in 11% of mesotheliomas and in 84% of carcinomas examined and immunocytochemically (in serous effusions) in 4% and 58%, respectively. In serum and in pleural or ascitic fluid, significantly elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen are commonly associated with (lung) carcinomas but rarely with mesotheliomas. Thus, together with identification of the antigen in serum, pleural fluid, or ascitic fluid, immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical techniques for detecting carcinoembryonic antigen provide a valuable aid for distinguishing malignant mesothelioma from metastatic carcinomas. 
1	Efficacy of doxazosin in specific hypertensive patient groups. In practice, some of the major problems for the physician who treats hypertension are patients who are resistant to treatment or who have other complicating risk syndromes. Therefore the overall efficacy of an antihypertensive agent must include an assessment of effect in patients with serious ancillary problems. In this article, doxazosin is reviewed for its efficacy in the treatment of severe essential hypertension and specific complications or conditions of mild or moderate essential hypertension, namely, left ventricular hypertrophy, hyperlipidemia, noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, pheochromocytoma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, and smoking. Doxazosin is particularly efficacious in many specific subgroups of patients with hypertension, and the results of relevant studies are discussed. 
4	Homocystinuria presenting as central retinal artery occlusion and longstanding thromboembolic disease. A case of central retinal artery occlusion in a patient with a 10-year history of unexplained thromboembolic disease due to a secondary hypercoagulable state is presented. Ophthalmological examination led to the final diagnosis. 
3	Surgical treatment of the retethered spinal cord after repair of lipomyelomeningocele. In a series of 75 patients with surgically treated lipomyelomeningoceles, the neurological condition of six patients deteriorated 6 months to 14 years after the operation due to repeat tethering of the spinal cord. The tethering resulted from postoperative dense adhesion between the cord and the overlying dura mater. Two of the six patients underwent conventional repeat untethering procedures, and the remaining four were successfully treated with a new surgical technique developed by the authors to prevent such dural adhesion. For this procedure, after complete untethering of the spinal cord, the lumbosacral cord is retained in the center of the dural sac by fine stay sutures between the pia mater of the conus medullaris and the ventral dura mater. In addition, the dura mater is tacked to the posterior arch which is reconstructed with bone grafts at one or two bifid vertebral levels. During a postoperative follow-up period of 1 to 3 years, no further deterioration has been observed and magnetic resonance studies have demonstrated a space filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the lumbosacral cord. The authors conclude that long-term observation, both neurological and radiological, is essential even after successful repair of a lipomyelomeningocele. This new surgical procedure can maintain a CSF bath around the lumbosacral cord, thus preventing dural adhesion. Application of this technique will hopefully be beneficial in lipomyelomeningocele patients with a high risk of cord retethering after initial repair. 
1	Leiomyosarcoma of bone. A clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural study of five cases. The authors identified five leiomyosarcomas (LMS) in a review of 13 nonmatrix-producing spindle cell sarcomas of bone. Only two were initially recognized as LMS; the others had been diagnosed as malignant fibrous histiocytoma (two) and fibrosarcoma (one). The patients, four of whom were women, ranged in age from 32 to 70 years. Sites included proximal humerus (two), distal femur (two), and rib (one). All tumors presented with clinical and radiographic features consistent with a diagnosis of primary bone neoplasms, although one probably represented a solitary metastasis from a primary uterine LMS. Radiographs showed lytic bone destruction with a moth-eaten appearance, and three cases had soft tissue extension. Histologically, all tumors showed broad, interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with pleomorphic nuclei, frequent mitoses, and necrosis. Two cases had a focal storiform pattern and bizarre multinucleated cells, and two other cases had focally prominent osteoclast-like giant cells. Extensive immunoreactivity for muscle actin was seen in all cases and for desmin in three. In each case, electron microscopy showed definite smooth muscle differentiation including cytoplasmic filaments with densities. At this writing, two patients are free of disease (including the patient with a presumed metastasis), one is alive with locally recurrent disease, and two are dead of disease. Experience suggests that LMS of bone is a distinct clinicopathologic entity that may be more common than previously recognized. Application of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to nonmatrix-producing bone sarcomas should facilitate diagnosis of additional cases. 
4	Verapamil increases serum alkaline phosphatase in hypertensive patients. In rats, verapamil decreases intestinal absorption of calcium, increases serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), and induces osteopenia. In this prospective study, verapamil 80-120 mg three times daily was given for 2 months to 20 patients with hypertension, and the effects on calcium homeostasis were recorded. This dose of verapamil significantly reduced supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (+/- SD) from 158/100 +/- 9/8 mmHg to 146/89 +/- 14/8 mmHg (P = 0.001). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased significantly from 2.77 +/- 1.06 mu kat l-1 to 3.19 +/- 1.22 mu kat l-1 (P = 0.004), and isoenzymes of ALP of skeletal origin appeared after verapamil treatment. The excretion of sodium in the urine increased (Na/creatinine ratio 8.95 +/- 6.01 before and 13.16 +/- 8.26 after verapamil; P = 0.04), while the excretion of calcium, phosphate and potassium was not changed. PTH was slightly increased at the end of verapamil treatment (1.09 +/- 0.54 vs. 0.98 +/- 0.74 microgram l-1; P = 0.07), and s-1,25(OH)2D3 was also somewhat increased (22.3 +/- 14.4 vs. 17.6 +/- 4.9 ng l-1; P = 0.26). Serum Ca was not affected by verapamil (before verapamil 2.43 +/- 0.11 mmol l-1, after verapamil 2.40 +/- 0.12 mmol l-1; P = 0.28). The increase in serum ALP demonstrates that verapamil affects bone cell metabolism in man. This effect could be secondary to the enhancement of PTH secretion. 
5	Dosage of haloperidol for schizophrenia. Eighty-seven newly admitted inpatients with schizophrenia were randomized to receive 10, 30, or 80 mg/d of oral haloperidol. They were treated under double-blind conditions for 6 weeks, less if their acute symptoms remitted sooner. Survival analysis showed no differences among the three treatments. Side effects were minimal in all three treatment groups, and there were no differences in side effects among the groups. These results suggest that dosages higher than 10 mg/d of haloperidol for most patients have no additional beneficial effect in the treatment of acute or exacerbated schizophrenia. 
2	Crohn's disease: what about the pancreas? [editorial] Crohn's disease (CD) is now accepted as a systemic illness. The importance of extraintestinal manifestations is underlined by the fact that such "complications" can be more prominent and even more difficult to control than the intestinal disease itself. Lately, evidence for a more than accidental association of pancreatitis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with CD is growing. This might have a significant impact on the treatment of abdominal pain and diarrhea in CD, symptoms which have so far been attributed exclusively to the intestinal rather than the extraintestinal manifestations of the disease. 
1	Bowenoid papulosis. Bowenoid papulosis is an uncommon genital dysplasia induced by human papillomavirus infection. Clinically, it usually resembles persistent warts, but histologically it may be suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. This unusual disorder and recent advances in our understanding of it are reviewed. 
4	Late outcome of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with left ventricular ejection fractions greater than or equal to 50% and without significant coronary arterial narrowing. In a retrospective survey of 1,195 survivors of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, 43 patients were identified in whom left ventricular ejection fraction was greater than or equal to 0.50 and in whom no coronary artery stenosis of greater than or equal to 50% luminal diameter were present. Thirteen (30%) of these patients had hypokinesia on left ventriculography, and 20 patients (47%) had a persistently abnormal electrocardiogram. Seven patients (16%) had recurrent out-of-hospital cardiac arrest during an average follow-up of 86 +/- 54 months. The presence of either wall motion or electrocardiographic abnormalities defined patients with a several-fold higher risk of recurrent cardiac arrest than those without such abnormalities. The risk for recurrent cardiac arrest within 5 years was 30% in those with abnormal electrocardiograms versus 5% in the others (p less than 0.03). Age was an independent predictor of recurrent cardiac arrest in this group (p less than 0.01); surprisingly, recurrent cardiac arrest was occurring more often among younger patients. Although cardiac arrest is unusual in patients without major structural heart disease, its recurrence in such survivors is common. Patients at relatively high risk for recurrent ventricular fibrillation can be identified by their youth and by abnormalities detected on the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram or by contrast left ventriculography. 
3	Mechanical restraint use among residents of skilled nursing facilities. Prevalence, patterns, and predictors The patterns of and risk factors for mechanical restraint use were determined in 12 skilled nursing facilities. Restraints were being used for 59% of residents at the beginning of the study; 31% of remaining residents were restrained during the follow-up year. No facility characteristic was associated with restraint use. The resident characteristics independently associated with initiation of restraints were older age, disorientation, dependence in dressing, greater participation in social activities, and nonuse of antidepressants. Unsteadiness (72%), disruptive behavior such as agitation (41%), and wandering (20%) were the most frequently cited reasons for initiation of restraints. 
1	Concomitant cisplatin chemotherapy and radiotherapy in advanced mucosal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Long-term results of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study 81-17. One hundred twenty-four eligible patients with advanced mucosal squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were entered into a pilot study of concomitant cisplatin (100 mg/m2 given every 3 weeks for three doses) and standard irradiation. The initial complete response (CR) was 71% with an additional two cases salvaged by surgery for an overall 73% CR. When no keratin was identified in the histologic specimen (41 patients) the CR was 90%. The nasopharynx showed the best CR (89%) among the sites. At 4 years after treatment, the estimated locoregional tumor control rate was 43% and the survival, 34%. When no keratin was present in the specimen, the estimated locoregional control of tumor was superior (56% versus 38% with keratin identified, P = 0.02) and the estimated survival was also superior (48% versus 26%, P = 0.008). Acute treatment-related toxicities included one death due to renal damage and two patients with life-threatening renal damage. The delivery of radiotherapy was not altered. Late toxicity included necrosis -3%, fibrosis -4%, and one fistula. The results of this study justify a randomized trial for the comparison of this combination of cisplatin and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in advanced mucosal carcinomas of the head and neck. 
2	Colonic glycoproteins in monozygotic twins with inflammatory bowel disease. Colonic glycoprotein composition was evaluated in monozygotic twins with inflammatory bowel disease using ion-exchange chromatography. Fifty-three individuals, 12 pairs and 1 single twin with ulcerative colitis and 14 pairs with Crohn's disease, were evaluated. Seven twin pairs were concordant for the presence of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, whereas twin siblings of 10 ulcerative colitis probands and 9 Crohn's disease probands were not known to have inflammatory bowel disease. Content of one chromatographically defined component of colonic mucin, designated HCM species IV, was reduced in both patients with ulcerative colitis (1040 +/- 300 cpm/10,000 cpm total HCM) and their apparently healthy twins (1340 +/- 540 cpm/10,000 cpm total HCM) compared with control subjects (4030 +/- 1,000 cpm/10,000 cpm total HCM). Composition of mucin in Crohn's disease patients and their nonaffected twins was not significantly different than in controls. These observations suggest that altered profiles of mucin glycoprotein may be present before the onset of ulcerative colitis and may be genetically defined. Conversely, it appears that alterations in glycoproteins only are not sufficient to initiate mucosal inflammation. 
5	Incidence of large oesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis: application to prophylaxis of first bleeding. Because several studies have suggested that beta blockers are effective in the prophylaxis of first variceal bleeding in cirrhosis, screening for oesophageal varices might be appropriate. We prospectively studied 84 cirrhotic patients without obvious evidence of large oesophageal varices and previous bleeding during a mean follow up of 16 months. At entry to the study 41 patients had no oesophageal varices and in 43 these were grade 1. The subsequent percentages of patients without large oesophageal varices were 74% at one year and 52% at two years. Univariate analysis showed that a longer duration of cirrhosis (p less than 0.05) and grade 1 oesophageal varices at entry (p less than 0.001) were predictive factors for the occurrence of large oesophageal varices, whereas, multivariate analysis showed that the initial size of the oesophageal varices (p less than 0.001), a high initial Child-Pugh score, and a smaller improvement in Child-Pugh score during the study were independent risk factors. Among patients with grades 0 and 1 oesophageal varices at the start of the study the proportions with large oesophageal varices at two years were 31% and 70% respectively. We have calculated that, accepting a maximum risk of first bleeding of 10% without prophylactic treatment, a patient without oesophageal varices should be screened endoscopically every other year, while a patient with grade 1 disease should benefit from one annual upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. 
5	An improved technique for development of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. The pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is the most commonly employed muscle skin transfer used in soft-tissue reconstruction of defects of the upper neck and jaw region. This article presents conceptual and technical changes in the development of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap that preserve a greater vascular pedicle and enhance the flap's arc of rotation. Data from 54 consecutive cases using this modified approach show a reduction in complications, a greater range of use, and consistent healing in radiated and nonradiated tissues without requiring sectioning or removing the clavicle or causing significant chest deformities. These modifications have produced a more predictable transfer compared with other reported techniques. 
5	Antiplatelet drugs in femoropopliteal vein bypasses: a multicenter trial. To evaluate the influence of antiplatelet drugs on patency in femoropopliteal vein bypasses, 48 vascular surgeons recruited 549 patients to a randomized double-blind trial of aspirin (300 mg) + dipyridamole (150 mg) or placebo twice daily starting 2 days before surgery and continuing indefinitely. Graft occlusion measured objectively by independent coordinators and cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or stroke) were studied, expressed by life table, and analyzed statistically by log rank and confidence intervals (95% CI). Randomization achieved comparable groups with 60% of grafts inserted for rest pain or gangrene. Operative complications on aspirin plus dipyridamole included 18 reoperations for bleeding and 12 hematomas compared with 9 and 14, respectively, on placebo (NS). Most of the 172 graft failures occurred early with failure rates of 43/1000 patient-months in the first 3 months, reducing to 17/1000 at 6 to 12 months, and under 10/1000 in subsequent years. Cumulative graft patency on placebo was 72%, 62%, and 60% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively, compared with 78%, 70%, and 61% on aspirin plus dipyridamole. The difference in patency of 6.1% (95% CI, -3% to 15.5%) at 1 year and 8.0% (95% CI, -5% to 21%) at 2 years failed to achieve significance (p = 0.43). On mean follow-up of 34 months, 53 (132/1000 patient-years) cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident) occurred in patients on placebo compared with only 35 (73/1000) on aspirin plus dipyridamole, a significant difference of 59/1000 (p = 0.004). Antiplatelet therapy had little influence on femoropopliteal vein patency, but subsequent myocardial infarction and stroke was reduced in these patients with peripheral vascular disease. 
4	Trends in systolic blood pressure, 24-hour sodium excretion, and stroke mortality in the elderly in Belgium. Data from six surveys of systolic blood pressure conducted in Belgium between 1967 and 1986 were analyzed. The mean ages of the six groups of 3,328 subjects ranged from 70 to 81 years. The prevalence of systolic blood pressure levels above 159 mm Hg decreased between 1967 and 1986 from 51% to 21% in men and 66% to 22% in women; severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 220 mm Hg) nearly disappeared. During the same period, body mass index increased 1.1 kg/m2 in men and was unchanged in women; mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 159 to 142 mm Hg in men and from 171 to 147 mm Hg in women; the proportion of subjects receiving treatment for hypertension increased from 10% to 36% in men and from 18% to 41% in women; and the mean standardized 24-hour sodium excretion decreased from 265 to 188 mmol in men and from 208 to 160 mmol in women. Systolic blood pressure levels were significantly and independently related to sodium excretion in the 1967 and 1972 studies. The decrease in systolic blood pressure in Belgium was influenced by the combined effects of more and better treatment for hypertension and a decrease in sodium intake. 
1	Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (TA-4) in penile carcinoma. TA-4 antigen, originally isolated from women with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, is elevated in the sera of patients with squamous cell carcinomas of several sites, including esophagus, lungs, and head and neck. In this study, we compared the serum levels of TA-4 in normal volunteers, patients with resected penile squamous cell carcinoma, and patients with metastatic penile squamous cell carcinoma. TA-4 values were elevated in 5 of 11 patients (45%) who had metastatic disease. In 2, TA-4 was normal the first time metastasis was clinically detected but rose as the disease progressed. Moreover, in 3 patients in whom serial determinations were made, serum TA-4 values correlated well with disease progression and response to treatment. We conclude that TA-4 values are elevated in some patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the penis and may become a useful marker for monitoring response to therapy. 
2	Daytime reduction of gastro-oesophageal reflux after healing of oesophagitis and its value as an indicator of favourable response to maintenance treatment. In order to investigate the response of gastro-oesophageal reflux after medically induced healing of oesophagitis and its relation to the occurrence of relapse during prophylactic treatment, 20 patients with erosive/ulcerative oesophagitis underwent 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring before and after healing achieved with 12 to 24 week treatment with ranitidine 150 or 300 mg twice daily. Compared with pretreatment values, after macroscopic healing, a significant reduction in daytime median percentage of reflux time (10.0 v 6.5; p less than 0.05) and median number of reflux episodes lasting more than 5 minutes (5-5 v 1.0; p less than 0.05) were observed, whereas during night time reflux frequency and severity did not change. During maintenance treatment with ranitidine 150 or 300 mg nocte, five of the six patients, who had shown no improvement in gastro-oesophageal reflux after acute healing, relapsed. These results suggest that, in contrast with previous work, a decrease in gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with reflux oesophagitis can be achieved after macroscopic healing, and that the occurrence of such a reduction after acute healing is predictive of a good response to longterm treatment. 
5	Angioplasty of renal arteries: a report of ten year's experience. Report of PTA of renal arteries in 288 patients. Primary results show good to optimal dilatation of the arteries (60.6% to 78.6%). One third of all cases achieved optimal blood pressures. In about 40% antihypertensive drugs had to be administered, in about 30% blood pressure remained unchanged although PTA was effective. PTA of renal arteries is the best method of treating renal hypertension, also because of the low rate of complications. 
5	Peroneal nerve palsy after total knee arthroplasty. The prognosis for peroneal palsy after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is poorly defined. Twenty-six postoperative peroneal palsies occurred after 8998 TKAs performed between 1972 and 1985. Eighteen patients had complete and eight had incomplete peroneal palsies. Twenty-three had both motor and sensory deficits, and three had only motor deficits. At an average of 5.1 years (range, one to 11 years) after arthroplasty, recovery was complete for 13 palsies and partial for 12. Complete recovery was more likely in those palsies that were incomplete initially. Patients with palsies that were initially partial had significantly higher knee scores than those with complete palsies, and patients whose eventual recovery was complete had significantly higher knee scores than those with incomplete recovery. This new prognostic information should be useful for surgeons who encounter this unfortunate yet persistent complication of TKA. 
5	Human immunodeficiency virus-associated eosinophilic folliculitis. A unique dermatosis associated with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. We studied 13 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and a chronic pruritic folliculitis that was unresponsive to systemic treatment with bactericidal anti-staphylococcal antibiotics. The skin eruption was characterized by multiple urticarial follicular papules scattered on the trunk (100%), the head and neck (85%), and the proximal aspect of the extremities (62%). Absolute peripheral eosinophil counts were increased in six of 13 patients; a relative peripheral eosinophilia was present in 10 of 13 patients. Serum IgE levels were elevated in all seven patients tested (range, 88 to 9050 IU). Histopathologic features included a folliculitis with eosinophils. Pathogenic bacteria were not consistently found by routine bacterial skin cultures, cultures of skin biopsy specimens, or histopathologic evaluation. CD4 counts were decreased in all of the 12 patients tested (less than 300 cells per cubic millimeter) and were below 250 cells per cubic millimeter in 10 patients. A clinical response was noted to astemizole, to ultraviolet light in the B range, and to topical clobetasol propionate. These observations demonstrate that HIV-associated eosinophilic folliculitis is a unique HIV-related cutaneous disorder that is characterized by a culture-negative, chronic, pruritic folliculitis and a characteristic histopathologic picture. Of special importance, because it is associated with CD4 counts of less than 250 to 300 cells per cubic millimeter, eosinophilic folliculitis appears to be an important clinical marker of HIV infection and, particularly, of patients at increased risk of developing opportunistic infections. We suggest that the term eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (Ofuji's disease), previously used to describe this dermatosis in HIV-infected patients, should be discarded. 
1	Paraneoplastic vasculitic neuropathy: a treatable neuropathy. Paraneoplastic vasculitic neuropathy has been recently described. We report the first case of this disorder which responded both clinically and electrophysiologically to cyclophosphamide treatment. A 54-year-old woman with a history of metastatic endometrial carcinoma in remission had asymmetrical polyneuropathy, electrophysiological findings consistent with a diffuse axonal neuropathy, high sedimentation rate and spinal fluid protein, and microvasculitis with axonal degeneration on nerve biopsy. The patient was treated with 150 mg of cyclophosphamide daily with gradual clinical and electrophysiological improvement. 
3	Psychologic and behavioral aspects of chronic headache. It is important for physicians to be aware of the expectations and psychologic needs patients have, to understand how psychologic and personality variables can impact care, to realize the importance of patient education, and to be cognizant of how environmental factors can influence headache pain behaviors. Empirical data indicate that the nonpharmacologic treatments of biofeedback, relaxation, and stress coping training can serve as useful adjunctive or alternative procedures, and that the combined use of medication and nonpharmacologic treatments yields the greatest clinical outcome. Certain headache types show minimal response to nondrug therapies alone (cluster, menstrual, and post-traumatic headache). Age and personality variables have a bearing on nondrug treatment outcome as well. 
4	Diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are chronic medical conditions that frequently coexist. In the United States, it is estimated that 10 million persons suffer from diabetes mellitus, 60 million from hypertension, and 3 million from the combination of the two. There may be a causal relationship between hypertension and diabetes. Obesity may be a precipitating factor for both hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Those with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus generally become hypertensive only with the onset of nephropathy. Glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia frequently occur with essential hypertension and may be aggravated by hypertension therapy, especially with diuretics and beta-blockers. Hyperinsulinemia may be an important common factor promoting sodium retention, sympathetic nervous system stimulation, and inhibition of the sodium pump. The Working Group on Hypertension in Diabetes has outlined a flexible modified version of the stepped-care approach to the treatment of hypertension in diabetes. Management is complex because diabetes is associated with autonomic neuropathy, sexual dysfunction, hyperlipidemia, and fluid and electrolyte disorders. All these problems can be exacerbated by antihypertensive treatment. Nonpharmacologic measures, which address weight reduction and sodium restriction, are logical, but aggressive antihypertensive medication is invariably necessary. Diuretics and/or beta-blockers were the mainstay of treatment until the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. These newer agents have no deleterious effects on carbohydrate metabolism and are generally better tolerated. Antihypertensive therapy may slow the rate of deterioration in diabetic nephropathy. This was first shown with diuretics, beta-blockers, and hydralazine and more recently with ACE inhibitors, which provide effective blood pressure control and a significant drop in albuminuria without affecting the glomerular filtration rate adversely. ACE inhibition may also lead to increased insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal rate. Long-term trials are needed to assess the effects of these new agents on the treatment of hypertension in the diabetic population. 
5	Hypomutability in Fanconi anemia cells is associated with increased deletion frequency at the HPRT locus. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited human disorder associated with a predisposition to cancer and characterized by anomalies in the processing of DNA cross-links and certain monoadducts. We reported previously that the frequency of psoralen-photoinduced mutations at the HPRT locus is lower in FA cells than in normal cells. This hypomutability is shown here to be associated with an increased frequency of deletions in the HPRT gene when either a mixture of cross-links and monoadducts or monoadducts alone are induced. Molecular analysis of mutants in the HPRT gene was carried out. In normal cells the majority of spontaneous and induced mutants are point mutations whereas in FA deletion mutations predominate. In that case a majority of mutants were found to lack individual exons or small clusters of exons whereas in normal cells large (complete or major gene loss) and small deletions are almost equally represented. Thus we propose that the FA defect lies in a mutagenic pathway that, in normal cells, involves bypassing lesions and subsequent gap filling by a recombinational process during replication. 
4	Causes of death in hospitalized intravenous drug abusers. The authors reviewed at autopsy the causes of death of 274 patients with evidence of intravenous drug abuse who had been admitted to a large public hospital. There were 127 who died from diseases unrelated to intravenous drug abuse, and in 41% of these, chronic alcoholism was implicated. Deaths from overdose syndromes and drug-related organ pathology comprised only 11% of all cases. The mean age at death was 39 years. There was a male/female ratio of 3.6:1. Half of all patients died from infection--72 from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) alone. These findings indicate that persons hospitalized with a history of intravenous drug abuse usually die from causes other than overdose and that AIDS and chronic alcoholism are significant problems. Emphasis should be placed upon detecting "hidden" intravenous drug deaths to provide more accurate statistical information. 
2	High-protein ascites in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Diseases of the liver or peritoneum resulting in ascites have been infrequently reported in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Since 1985, eight noncirrhotic patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome presenting with new onset high-protein ascites have been evaluated. All but one patient had nondiagnostic paracentesis studies. Laparoscopy with biopsy of identified abnormalities or percutaneous omental biopsy were diagnostic in four patients. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the cause in three patients, and disseminated cryptococcosis occurred in one patient. In the four other patients, chronic nonspecific peritonitis was found at laparoscopy; follow-up of these latter patients, including exploratory laparotomy in one patient and autopsy in two patients, disclosed no specific cause. Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and high-protein ascites of uncertain etiology should undergo directed peritoneal evaluation as a potentially treatable disorder may be found. However, despite extensive evaluation, a subset of patients in whom no specific cause can be identified still remains. 
5	A histological and flow cytometric study of dog brain endothelial cell injuries in delayed radiation necrosis. The pathogenesis of delayed cerebral radiation necrosis was studied histologically and biochemically in 25 dogs with special attention to vascular endothelial cell injuries. The dogs were sacrificed 3 to 30 months after irradiation with a single dose of 15 Gy to the head. Brain specimens were appropriately fixed for light and electron microscopic studies, and capillary endothelial cells were isolated for flow cytometric study. The endothelial cells were stained with acridine orange, then the cell ratios in the reproductive phase (S + G2 + M) were investigated with flow cytometry. Thereafter, Feulgen hydrolysis and computer analysis of the hydrolysis curves were performed to examine the qualitative changes in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of endothelial cells after irradiation. Under light microscopy, spongy degeneration with small cell infiltration was observed, especially in the frontal white matter, at 6 months after irradiation. At 9 months, necrotic foci appeared and developed until 15 months after irradiation. Blood vessels around the necrotic area showed luminal narrowing with endothelial hyperplasia and proliferation. At 30 months, no fresh necrotic lesions were observed. Under electron microscopy, endothelial cells of capillaries and small vessels around the necrotic area showed an increase of pinocytosis, and in the nuclei there was an increase of infoldings and euchromatin. The cell ratios in the reproductive phase were 14.5% to 23.3% (maximum at 9 months) in the irradiated group compared to 6.4% in the control group. The rate constant of apurinic acid production, a parameter correlating with DNA transcriptional activity, was minimum at 3 months and maximum at 9 months after irradiation. The data suggest that impairment of the microcirculation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of delayed radiation necrosis, and that the time of necrosis occurrence closely correlates with the cell cycle of vascular endothelial cells. 
4	Renal function in the elderly: results from the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly trial. Effects of antihypertensive treatment on renal function were analyzed in data from a prospective, double-blind investigation of 840 patients randomly assigned to placebo or to active treatment with a combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide. Baseline serum creatinine levels were significantly and positively correlated to age, gender (higher in men), systolic blood pressure, and history of cardiovascular complications. During a five-year follow-up period, serum creatinine levels increased significantly in treated patients but not in placebo patients. Five patients died of renal causes (one in the placebo group, four in the treated group), and five patients dropped out of the study because of an increase in serum creatinine of more than 100% (four received active treatment). The incidence of renal complications in the hypertensive elderly is small. The current data do not support the hypothesis that renal deterioration can be prevented by antihypertensive treatment. 
5	Lung sound nomenclature survey. We report the terms used by 223 pulmonary physicians and 54 physicians in other specialties to describe eight recorded examples of lung sounds. The participants listened to the lung sounds at the 1988 American College of Chest Physicians annual convention and wrote "free form" answers. Pulmonary physicians used the terms "crackles" and "rales" with equal frequency to describe discontinuous adventitious lung sounds (ALS) and not at all to describe continuous ALS. Other physicians preferred the term "rales" in describing discontinuous ALS. The terms "wheeze" and "stridor" were used only in describing continuous ALS; however, the term "rhonchi" was frequently used to describe continuous and discontinuous ALS. The majority of participants recognized the normal breath sounds but not the pleural friction rub. Most did not use a qualifying adjective to describe ALS, and there was little agreement among those who did. The lung sound terminology used by physicians is not well standardized and the recommendations of the ATS/ACCP nomenclature subcommittee are not widely accepted. 
5	Spontaneous aorto-left renal vein fistula: the "abdominal pain, hematuria, silent left kidney" syndrome. Spontaneous aorto-left renal vein fistula (ALRVF) is a rare occurrence; with this case, only 16 have been reported to date. Common features in patients with ALRVF include abdominal pain (81%), hematuria (100%), impaired renal function (85%), and nonvisualization of the left kidney (100%). Less common but also present in the majority of cases are a left sided bruit (73%), pulsatile abdominal mass (63%), and proteinuria (50%). Also important, 94% have a retroaortic left renal vein, unlike the six cases of traumatic ALRVF that have been reported. This magnifies the diagnostic value of contrast abdominal computed tomographic scanning, which demonstrates not only the anomalous location of the left renal vein but also the abdominal aortic aneurysm and poor enhancement of the left kidney. These findings rule out the possibility of the "nutcracker syndrome" (left renal vein compression between aorta and superior mesenteric artery). Although confirming the presence of a fistula by early caval opacification, aortography does not always distinguish ALRVF from the more common aortocaval fistula. This can be accomplished by Duplex scanning with deep probes and even preferably color coding of velocity signals. With such precise preoperative localization, surgical repair is relatively easy and safe. 
4	Prospective evaluation of a protocol for induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in patients referred to a tertiary centre. All eight stages of a stimulation protocol that used one then two extrastimuli from the right ventricular apex in sinus rhythm and three ventricular drive rates (100, 120, and 140 beats/min) were performed in 24 patients with recurrent spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia despite drug treatment. Twenty two of the patients had sustained a previous myocardial infarct and 18 were on long term treatment with amiodarone. Sustained (greater than 30 s) ventricular tachycardia was induced in all patients. Two extrastimuli were significantly more likely to induce sustained ventricular tachycardia than one extrastimulus, both overall and individually for the three ventricular drive rates. A ventricular drive rate of 140 beats/min was significantly more likely to induce ventricular tachycardia than ventricular drive rates of 100 and 120 beats/min which were significantly more effective than sinus rhythm. A ventricular drive rate of 140 beats/min with one or two extrastimuli induced ventricular tachycardia in 23/24 (95%) of the patients in this study. The full eight stage protocol was progressive separately for both extrastimuli and ventricular drive rate but the last two stages (ventricular drive rate of 140 beats/min with one or two extrastimuli) were as effective as the entire protocol in inducing ventricular tachycardia. 
3	An immunofluorescence study of cerebral malaria. A correlation with histopathology. Histopathologic and immunopathologic features of cerebral malaria have been defined in a study of six autopsy cases with severe Plasmodium falciparum infection. In five cases, immunofluorescent studies demonstrated intense deposition of P falciparum antigen, IgG, and fibrin in cerebral vessels associated with the histopathologic finding of hemorrhage in the white matter of cerebrum and cerebellum regardless of the presence of parasitized erythrocytes in the cerebral vessels. Immunofluorescent study also demonstrated the extravascular deposits of P falciparum granular antigen associated with acute inflammatory lesion in cerebral tissue in one case. These findings suggested that the immunopathogenic mechanism may in some way play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. 
3	Antiepileptic drug monitoring at the epilepsy clinic: a prospective evaluation. To assess the value of on site therapeutic drug monitoring at the epilepsy clinic, management decisions were recorded before and immediately after antiepileptic drug (AED) concentrations became available. In the first year of this prospective study, 632 [277 carbamazepine (CBZ), 170 phenytoin (PHT), 113 valproate (VPA), and 72 phenobarbital (PB)] assays were performed during 488 clinic attendances in 182 actively managed epileptic patients. The results of drug analysis led to alterations in management at 114 patients visits, i.e., 23% of those monitored. Dosage was increased in response to the circulating AED concentration in 12% of consultations and decreased in another 7.5%. Unsuspected poor compliance was uncovered in eight patients, and in three others an AED was added or discontinued on the basis of the assay result. The time of the next appointment was rearranged in 58 attendances. Only 50% of results were in the "therapeutic" ranges for the four major AEDs. Dosage was adjusted (50 up, 16 down) after 54% of low results. "Therapeutic" levels were followed by a change in AED dose (52 up, 31 down) in 26%. Only 29% of concentrations above the "therapeutic" range persuaded the doctor to alter the dosage regimen, and in 20% of these an increase in dose was recommended. On-site AED monitoring had an immediate impact on clinical decision-making in greater than 23% of consultations but in a form more subtle than the simple quest for a therapeutic result. 
4	Left ventricular hypertrophy in elderly hypertensive patients: a report from the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly trial. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 840 elderly hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to treatment with a combination of hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene or placebo; methyldopa or matching placebo was added to the treatment regimen if blood pressures remained high. After adjustment for age, gender, and body mass index, initial electrocardiographic (ECG) voltage measures of RaVL and SV1 + RV5 were significantly related to systolic blood pressure; RaVL was also related to diastolic blood pressure. After one year of treatment, the decrease in RaVL and SV1 + RV5 in the treated patients, adjusted for age and body mass index, were not correlated with the changes in systolic blood pressure, but the decreases in SV1 + RV5 were positively related to the decrease in diastolic blood pressure. After four years of treatment, the decreases in RaVL and SV1 + RV5 were significantly and positively related to the decrease in systolic blood pressure after adjustment for age and changes in body mass index. In a four-year cohort of 222 patients, most of the decreases in ECG voltages in the treated patients and the increases in the placebo patients were found to have occurred during the first year of treatment. The type of treatment (diuretics alone or diuretics plus methyldopa) did not affect ECG voltages during the first year of follow-up. Total and cardiovascular mortality were related to initial amplitude of RaVL, but the significant correlation disappeared after adjustment for age. 
4	Residual atrial septal perforation after percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy with Inoue balloon catheter. To estimate the incidence of residual atrial septal perforation (ASP) following percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) with the Inoue balloon catheter and to examine the factors contributing to ASP, we studied 46 patients with mitral stenosis undergoing PTMC. Residual ASP was evaluated by Doppler color flow imaging 1 day after PTMC, and was detected in 7 out of 46 patients (15.2%). We examined the relationship between the development of ASP (ASP+) and the age of the patient, the left atrial dimension before PTMC, the mean pressure difference between left and right atrium after PTMC, and the duration of the procedure from atrial septal puncture by the Brockenbrough method to balloon inflation. There was a good correlation between the development of residual ASP and the duration of the procedure (ASP+, 51.0 +/- 34.0 minutes; without ASP, 24.6 +/- 16.2 minutes; p less than 0.01). However, there was no significant correlation between the development of ASP and other factors. In the follow-up study, ASP disappeared in four patients within 3 months. ASP persisted in two patients for 1 year after PTMC. However, the shunt in these two patients was clinically insignificant. These data suggest that residual ASP may depend on the duration of the procedure, and that most cases of ASP disappear within 1 year after PTMC. 
3	Neurophysiological observations on corticospinal projections to the upper limb in subjects with Rett syndrome. The aim of the present study was to investigate the excitability of corticospinal neurons and the integrity of their projections to the alpha motor neurons through the corticospinal tract in subjects of different ages with Rett syndrome. Electromagnetic stimulation of the motor cortex and cervical motor roots was used to evoke motor action potentials in the biceps brachii and hypothenar muscles. The phasic stretch reflex in the biceps brachii was also recorded to study the excitability of spinal alpha motor neurons. Motor cortex stimulation evoked motor action potentials at low threshold and with abnormally short latencies and prolonged durations. In contrast cervical motor root stimulation resulted in responses of normal latency and duration. The phasic stretch reflex had a low threshold, short latency and prolonged duration. It is concluded that in Rett syndrome the corticospinal pathway is intact. The results suggest disordered synaptic control of the Betz cell of the motor cortex and/or the spinal alpha motor neuron, although the involvement of the latter might be a consequence of dysfunction in supraspinal descending motor pathways. 
5	The predictive value of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis and magnetic resonance imaging in acute isolated syndromes for subsequent development of multiple sclerosis. The intrathecal synthesis of IgM in patients presenting with acute monosymptomatic syndromes may be relevant in predicting eventual progression to multiple sclerosis but has not been previously evaluated. We undertook a prospective 18-month combined clinical, cerebrospinal fluid, and magnetic resonance imaging study of 45 patients who had presented with acute isolated lesions of brainstem and spinal cord to evaluate the predictive value of intrathecal synthesis of IgM and IgG (through the detection of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands) and magnetic resonance imaging brain lesions at presentation, for the subsequent progression to multiple sclerosis. Results indicate that the highest risk of developing multiple sclerosis is seen in patients who are positive for oligoclonal IgM and IgG bands and who have disseminated cerebral white matter magnetic resonance imaging lesions at the initial presentation. Oligoclonal IgM bands predict progression to multiple sclerosis more frequently than oligoclonal IgG or magnetic resonance imaging alone. Our results confirm and further extend previous reports, and indicate that detection of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal IgM bands at presentation is a valuable prognostic indicator in patients presenting with acute isolated brainstem or spinal cord syndromes. 
1	Pulmonary blastoma with malignant melanoma component. Pulmonary blastomas are rare primary tumors that consist of tubular or glandular structures embedded in an undifferentiated mesenchymal stroma. Focal cartilage, bone, and skeletal muscle as well as squamous differentiation have been described in these tumors. We report a unique case of a pulmonary blastoma showing a malignant melanoma component. Immunohistochemical stains for S100 protein and HMB-45 were positive in the areas of melanocytic differentiation. 
4	Misplaced caval filter and subsequent pericardial tamponade. Use of the Greenfield filter for partial caval interruption is generally accepted as the most reliable mechanical method of pulmonary embolus prophylaxis. However, there have been reports of a variety of (usually nonfatal) complications. We report here the near-fatal complication of acute pericardial tamponade after misplacement of a Greenfield filter. Because of the filter's unusual location, retrieval required cardiopulmonary bypass, profound hyperthermia, and circulatory arrest. 
5	Neurologic complications in chronic renal failure: a retrospective study. We have retrospectively examined 324 patients with chronic renal failure and evaluated the probable underlying causes of neurologic complications, laboratory data and therapeutic interventions. The common neurologic problems in our patients were alterations in consciousness (40.7%) and convulsions (35.1%). When BUN concentration was above 135 mg/dl and creatinine clearance was below 8 m/min/1.73 m2, alteration of consciousness was observed and when BUN concentration was 200 mg/dl and creatinine clearance was below 7 m/min/1.73 m2, abnormal convulsives appeared. Changes in deep tendon reflexes and pathologic reflexes were associated with hypertension. All of the patients with cortical atrophy using computerized cranial tomography aluminum hydroxide at least for 18 months, and six of them had hemodialysis. Fourteen patients who underwent dialysis developed convulsions and were thought to have disequilibrium syndrome. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that the metabolic and biochemical derangements associated with CRF may be particularly detrimental to the still developing CNS of the child. 
3	National General Practice Study of Epilepsy: newly diagnosed epileptic seizures in a general population. The National General Practice Study of Epilepsy is a prospective population-based cohort study of 1195 patients with newly diagnosed or suspected epileptic seizures. At the time of initial classification (6 months after notification), 104 patients were excluded. Of the remaining 1091 patients, 220 (20% [95% confidence interval 18-23%]) had febrile seizures, 564 (52% [49-55%]) definite epileptic seizures, and 228 (21% [19-23%]) possible epilepsy. In the definite epilepsy group the proportions of males and females were similar, 25% (21-28%) were younger than 15 years and 24% (21-28%) were 60 years or older. The definite seizures were classified as cryptogenic in 62% (58-66%), remote symptomatic in 21% (18-25%), and acute symptomatic in 15% (12-18%). The aetiology of epilepsy was vascular disease in 15% (12-18%) and tumour in 6% (4-8%). Among older subjects the proportion with an identifiable cause was much higher: 49% (41-58%) were due to vascular disease and 11% (6-16%) to tumour. Only 252 (45% [41-49%]) of the 564 patients with definite epileptic seizures were registered at the time of their first seizure. 52% (48-56%) of the patients had partial or secondarily generalised seizures, and only 39% (35-43%) seizures generalised from the outset. 
5	When do optic disc edema and peripheral neuropathy constitute poetry? [clinical conference] A patient with chronic, bilateral optic disc edema developed multiple systemic manifestations of POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, skin changes). A serum immunoelectrophoresis showed an abnormal serum IgG lambda protein, and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed a monoclonal lambda protein plus an IgG lambda fragment. Bone survey and MRI scan revealed a sclerotic lesion of the first lumbar vertebra, and lymph node biopsy showed changes consistent with Castleman's disease. Thus, his optic disc edema was the presenting feature of the POEMS syndrome and osteosclerotic myeloma. 
5	Body water measurement in growth disorders: a comparison of bioelectrical impedance and skinfold thickness techniques with isotope dilution. Total body water was estimated as part of the assessment of body composition in children with growth disorders, using the newly commercially available method of bioelectrical impedance. This was undertaken to compare the precision and accuracy of the results with those derived from skinfold thickness against measurement of stable isotopically labelled water (H2(18)O) dilution as a standard. The comparisons were carried out to see to what extent the impedance method could be applied with confidence to assessment of children with growth disorders. Total body water was derived from impedance (I) using an association with height (Ht2/I). Impedance and skinfold thickness estimates of total body water were equally precise when compared with values obtained from H2(18)O dilution (limits of agreement -1.9 to +1.3 and -1.7 to +2.0 kg respectively). The mean intraobserver coefficient of variation for repeat measurements of impedance was 0.9% compared with 4.6% for skinfold thickness with an interobserver coefficient of variation for impedance of 2.8%. Bioelectrical impedance estimation of body composition is likely to be of value in the growth clinic when expertise in measurement of skinfold thickness is limited or repeated measurements are to be undertaken by different observers. 
3	Outcome of cataract surgery in central India: a longitudinal follow-up study. An epidemiological follow-up study of patients who had intracapsular cataract extraction in a voluntary hospital and its associated eye camps in Central India has for the first time evaluated the outcome one year after surgery in terms of visual acuity, use of spectacles, and improvement in income and mobility. The findings indicate that under these fairly typical conditions, 92% of the cases have adequate vision of 6/18 or better one year after surgery. Information on high usage of spectacles and on considerable improvements in income and mobility after cataract surgery is also reported. The outcome for patients operated upon in eye camps was almost as favourable as for those operated upon in hospital. Although the small differences are not statistically significant, the comparative findings require cautious interpretation and give rise to the epidemiological issues which are briefly discussed in this paper. 
1	Decrease in cerebral metabolic rate of glucose after high-dose methotrexate in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia. We measured changes in the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRGlu) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography for the assessment of neurotoxicity in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia treated with high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) therapy. We studied 8 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (mean age: 9.6 years) treated with HD-MTX (200 mg/kg or 2,000 mg/M2) therapy. CMRGlu after HD-MTX therapy was most reduced (40%) in the patient who had central nervous system leukemia and was treated with the largest total doses of both intrathecal MTX (IT-MTX) and HD-MTX. CMRGlu in the whole brain after HD-MTX therapy was reduced by an average of 21% (P less than 0.05). The reductions of CMRGlu in 8 patients were correlated with total doses of both IT-MTX (r = 0.717; P less than 0.05) and systemic HD-MTX (r = 0.784; P less than 0.05). CMRGlu of the cerebral cortex, especially the frontal and occipital cortex, was reduced more noticeably than that of the basal ganglia and white matter. We suggest that the measurement of changes in rCMRGlu after HD-MTX therapy is useful for detecting accumulated MTX neurotoxicity. 
5	Pain experiences of intensive care unit patients. The purpose of this study was to describe various dimensions of the pain experiences of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A purposive, primarily surgical sample of 24 ICU patients from two hospitals was interviewed after transfer from ICU. All but one patient remembered their ICU stay. Although this and six other patients had no recall of pain, 63% of the sample rated their pain as being moderate to severe in intensity. In a subgroup of nine patients having cardiac surgery, mean morphine sulfate administration during the first three postoperative days was 14 mg/day. This group of patients reported a lack of total pain relief from analgesics. Patients also described various sources of their pain, difficulties they had in communicating their pain, and nonpharmacologic methods that helped relieve their pain. Results of this study clearly indicate that not only pain but its communication and treatment were significant problems for a substantial portion of this ICU sample. Further descriptive and experimental research of pain characteristics and treatment practices for ICU patients is urgently needed. Improvements in nursing practice that result from such research may make a substantial difference in the comfort and well-being of critically ill patients. 
1	Analysis of interleukin 2 and various effector cell populations in adoptive immunotherapy of 9L rat gliosarcoma: allogeneic cytotoxic T lymphocytes prevent tumor take. Recombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2) and various effector cell populations were used for adoptive immunotherapy in the Fischer strain 9L rat gliosarcoma model. The in vivo cytotoxicities of nonspecifically activated lymphocytes and specifically activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were assessed in a modified in vivo neutralization (Winn) assay. Effector cells (10(6)) and 9L tumor cells (10(5] were combined with 10(4) units of rIL-2 and stereotactically implanted into the right frontal centrum semiovale of the Fischer (F344) rat. At 7 and 14 days, additional effector cells (10(6] and rIL-2 (10(4) units) were administered through the same burr hole. Nonspecifically activated splenocytes were lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, both plastic-adherent and nonadherent, whereas specifically activated CTLs were either syngeneic (genetically identical) or allogeneic (genetically dissimilar). Syngeneic CTLs were T lymphocytes from Fischer rats primed in vivo with 9L cells and restimulated in vitro. Allogeneic CTLs were generated by exposing DA rat lymphocytes either to irradiated Fischer lymph node cells or to 9L Fisher tumor cells in vitro. Control groups included rats bearing 9L tumor who were untreated, those who received peripheral (i.p. or s.c.) administration of rIL-2, or those who received syngeneic unstimulated T lymphocytes and rIL-2. For a set of animals given the same inoculum of 9L tumor, significantly improved survival was shown for groups treated with nonadherent or adherent LAK cells (P less than or equal to 0.0003), syngeneic CTLs (P = 0.0327), or allogeneic CTLs (P = 0.0025) over untreated control animals by using Mantel-Haenzel nonparametric logrank equations. Only treatment with allogeneic CTLs prevented tumor take. 
5	Calcium absorption in bone disease associated with chronic cholestasis during childhood. Fractional absorption of calcium was determined in 9 children aged 4.9 to 16.9 yr with chronic cholestatic liver disease to determine the role of calcium malabsorption in the development of metabolic bone disease. Radiological evidence of rickets was absent in all patients, but bone density, measured by single beam photon absorptiometry of the distal radius, was reduced in eight of nine subjects. Serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations were normal in all except one subject. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was decreased compared with controls in only one of nine patients, but serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations were diminished in seven of nine subjects. In all subjects, dietary calcium and phosphorus intakes were greater than 80% of the RDA. Fractional absorption of calcium, determined by oral and intravenous administration of stable calcium isotopes, was similar in cholestatic compared with control subjects (37.1% +/- 12.5% vs. 34.0% +/- 16.4%). In the cholestatic subjects, calcium absorption correlated with serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (r = 0.871, p less than 0.002) but not 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Calcium balance, assessed by the duplicate diet method, was positive in four of five subjects. Anthropometric measurements were performed to examine the relationship between nutritional status and bone mineral content. Heights of all subjects were less than or equal to the 10th percentile and fat stores and somatic protein stores were less than the 25th percentile in six of nine subjects. We conclude that factors other than calcium malabsorption and decreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration contribute to diminished bone mass in children with cholestatic liver disease. 
3	Pharmacological versus non-pharmacological prophylaxis of recurrent migraine headache: a meta-analytic review of clinical trials. In order to generate information about the relative effectiveness of the most widely used pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for the prophylaxis of recurrent migraine (i.e., propranolol HCl and combined relaxation/thermal biofeedback training), meta-analysis was used to integrate results from 25 clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of propranolol and 35 clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of relaxation/biofeedback training (2445 patients, collectively). Meta-analysis revealed substantial, but very similar improvements have been obtained with propranolol and with relaxation/biofeedback training. When daily recordings have been used to assess treatment outcome, both propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback have yielded a 43% reduction in migraine headache activity in the average patient. When improvements have been assessed using other outcome measures (e.g., physician/therapist ratings), improvements observed with each treatment have been about 20% greater. In both cases, improvements observed with propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback have been significantly larger than improvement observed with placebo medication (14% reduction) or in untreated patients (no reduction). Meta-analysis thus revealed substantial empirical support for the effectiveness of both propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback training, but revealed no support for the contention that the two treatments differ in effectiveness. These results suggest that greater attention should be paid to determining the relative costs and benefits of widely used pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. 
4	Pulmonary embolism presenting as exercise-induced hypotension. A 68-year-old man with remote history of previous myocardial infarction presented with a four-week history of intermittent dyspnea. After developing hypotension during an exercise tolerance test, he underwent cardiac catheterization, revealing significant pulmonary hypertension and two-vessel coronary artery disease. Pulmonary angiography confirmed the presence of pulmonary emboli which partially resolved after thrombolytic therapy. Subsequent treadmill testing confirmed the absence of exercise-induced hypotension two months following treatment. This case underscores the importance of considering pulmonary embolism as a potential cause of exercise-induced hypotension, since it can be successfully treated with thrombolytic agents weeks after the initial onset of symptoms. 
3	Capillary prolactin measurement for diagnosis of seizures. Measurement of serum prolactin levels can be useful in the diagnosis of epilepsy, since prolactin levels often rise after seizures, but not after most imitators of epilepsy. Utility of the test is limited by the need to obtain blood 10 to 20 minutes after the episode. The present study documents the validity of prolactin measurements using capillary blood, which was obtained by the finger-stick method after a possible seizure and then applied to filter paper. Venous and capillary prolactin levels were determined 10 to 20 minutes after seizure-like episodes in 20 patients who were studied in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Venous and capillary prolactin values correlated, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.90. Using a criteria of any elevation above the laboratory upper limit of normal, capillary prolactin values correctly identified seizure versus pseudoseizure in 9 (100%) of 9 patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, in 5 (71%) of 7 patients with complex partial seizures, and 4 (100%) of 4 patients with pseudoseizures. Prolactin values were unaffected by leaving filter paper samples at room temperature for up to 1 week. This study suggests the utility of diagnostic capillary blood collection kits to assist in the diagnosis of epilepsy in outpatients. 
5	Impaired exercise capacity in adults with moderate scoliosis. We measured lung function and exercise tolerance in 15 adults with moderate kyphoscoliosis (thoracic curvatures between 25 degrees and 70 degrees, mean +/- SD = 46.93 degrees +/- 14.02 degrees). Forced vital capacity showed a slight reduction from values predicted from age and sex matched control subjects (3.39 +/- 1.06 vs 4.06 +/- 0.82 L, p less than 0.05). However, exercise tolerance was significantly lower than previously reported in healthy adults (VO2max = 31.60 +/- 9.12 vs 37.07 +/- 4.91 ml/kg/min, p less than 0.05). Despite the reduced exercise tolerance, the ratio of maximum tidal volume to vital capacity (VTmax/VC) was similar to that observed in healthy adults. The mean dyspnea index (VEmax/MVV) was also normal at 69.4 +/- 19.0. Hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses were within predicted normal limits at 0.67 +/- 0.37 L/min-1 fall in SaO2-1 and 1.67 +/- 0.92 L/min-1 mm Hg PCO2(-1). We conclude that the impairment of exercise performance found in adults with moderate scoliosis cannot be attributed to any important ventilatory limitation, abnormality in lung volume, or impaired chemoreceptor sensitivity. We suggest that the reduced VO2max likely arises from deconditioning and lack of regular aerobic exercise. 
1	Mammography and early breast cancer detection. Screening mammography has been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality. Both film-screen mammography and xeromammography are highly sensitive and specific. Mammography accreditation programs assure physicians and patients that a facility provides mammography of the highest quality, using the lowest possible radiation dose. Mammographic signs of early cancer include a small mass, calcifications, architectural distortion and a neodensity. Dense tissue may result in a false-negative examination even when a cancer is palpable, with adverse effects if biopsy is delayed. 
5	Febrile infants less than eight weeks old. Predictors of infection. Febrile infants less than eight weeks old frequently are admitted and receive parenteral antibiotics for treatment of possible sepsis. The authors assess 52 infants less than eight weeks old with a rectal temperature of 38.1 degrees C or higher as having either a readily identifiable focus of infection by physical examination, appearing "toxic" without a focus, or appearing well. The authors screened patients by using white blood cell (WBC) counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and chest radiographs in addition to blood, cerebrospinal fluid and urine cultures. The authors found a 9.6% incidence of bacteria in the 52 infants evaluated, with a 4.3% incidence in those febrile infants who appeared well. Five patients had positive blood cultures with Group B B Hemolytic streptococcus (four patients), and Viridans streptococcus (one patient). A clinical assessment of toxicity and a total band count greater than or equal to 0.5 x 10(3) cells/uL together were sensitive indicators of bacteremia, as were toxicity and a positive CRP. A "toxic" appearance, a WBC count greater than or equal to 15 x 10(3) cells/uL and an ESR greater than 30 were specific indicators of bacteria. Based on these data, identification of bacteremia in febrile infants may be possible with clinical assessment and screening laboratory tests. Because of the relatively small sampling size of this study, the authors feel that evaluation of a larger number of patients is warranted to evaluate these sensitivities in a more diffuse patient population. 
5	Differential reading recovery in patients with severe to moderate closed head injury. A differential recovery was seen when alternate forms of a nationally standardized test of Reading Vocabulary, Literal Reading Comprehension and Inferential Reading Comprehension was administered serially to 10 consecutive closed head injury admissions to a university rehabilitation hospital. Inferential Reading Comprehension was the most impaired and had the fastest recovery rate. Subtle cognitive deficits in Inferential Reading Comprehension were detected when Reading Vocabulary was at or better than a twelfth grade level. Maximal recovery of all three reading functions occurred within 4 months after trauma, with most occurring in the first 3 months. The reading recovery pattern parallels the recovery of intelligence scores in the literature. 
4	Selective evaluation and management of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. A 16-year experience. Reduction of cardiac mortality associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair remains an important goal. Five hundred consecutive urgent or elective operations for infrarenal nonruptured AAA were reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups based on preoperative cardiac status: group I (n = 260, 52%), no clinical or electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD); group II (n = 212, 42.2%), clinical or ECG evidence of CAD considered stable after further evaluation with studies such as dipyridamole-thallium scanning, echocardiography, or coronary arteriography; group III (n = 28, 5.6%), clinical or ECG evidence of CAD considered unstable after further evaluation. Group I had no further cardiac evaluation and groups I and II underwent AAA repair without invasive treatment of CAD. Group III underwent repair of cardiac disease before (n = 21) or coincident with (n = 7) AAA repair. In all instances, perioperative fluid volume management was based on left ventricular performance curves constructed before operation. The 30-day operative mortality rate for AAA repair in all 500 patients was 1.6% (n = 8). There was one (0.4%) cardiac-related operative death in group I, which was significantly less than the five (2.4%) in group II (p less than 0.02). Total mortality for the two groups were also significantly different, with one group I death (0.4%) and seven group II deaths (3.3%), (p less than 0.02). These data support the conclusions that (1) the leading cause of perioperative mortality in AAA repair is myocardial infarction, (2) correction of severe or unstable CAD before or coincident with AAA repair is effective in preventing operative mortality, (3) patients with known CAD should be investigated more thoroughly to identify those likely to develop perioperative myocardial ischemia so that their CAD can be corrected before AAA repair, and (4) patients with no clinical or ECG evidence of CAD rarely die of perioperative myocardial infarction, and thus selective evaluation of CAD based on clinical grounds in AAA patients is justified. 
5	A clarification on endodontic flare-ups [comment] In an article on endodontic flare-ups by Robert J. Matusow, our research and publications are discussed. Since we found what we consider to be distortions and misinterpretations of our work, it was decided to clarify the apparent discrepancies found in Matusow's article. 
5	Gastrointestinal disease and oral contraception. Oral contraceptive steroids play a major role in modern family planning. With the present tendency to decrease the doses of both estrogens and progestogens, any factor that reduces the bioavailability of the lower-dose preparations may have an impact on contraceptive protection. Although ethinyl estradiol, the most commonly used oral estrogen, is liable to an enterohepatic circulation as unchanged drug, the commonly used progestogens are not. At present, no convincing evidence exists in the human subject that disruption of the enterohepatic circulation by antibiotics or antacids does reduce contraceptive efficacy of the pill. Oral contraceptive steroids are mainly absorbed from the small bowel, and contraceptive efficacy depends on its absorptive capacity. Enhanced passage of gastrointestinal contents or impaired absorption may thus contribute to contraceptive failures in patients who have chronic inflammatory disease, diarrhea, ileostomy, or jejunoileal bypass. 
5	Pregnancy associated with Gorlin's syndrome. A pregnant woman with Gorlin's syndrome presented for the removal of malignant ovarian tumours. The main problem encountered by the anaesthetists was an unexpected increase in arterial blood pressure. This was most probably associated with surgical manipulation of the ovaries with an increase in prorenin/renin production. 
3	Resistance to d-tubocurarine in lower motor neuron injury is related to increased acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction The hypothesis that lower motor neuron injury, with its associated proliferation of acetylcholine receptors (AChR), induces resistance to the neuromuscular effects of d-tubocurarine (dTC) was tested in the rat. The left gastrocnemius was denervated by a 75-80% lesion of the sciatic nerve. The effective dose for 95% twitch depression (ED95) was studied in the denervated gastrocnemius and compared to the contralateral undenervated and sham-injured (control) gastrocnemius muscles approximately 2 weeks after injury. The AChR number was quantitated by the specific ligand 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin (125I-alpha-BT). Plasma dTC concentrations, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), were correlated to twitch tension during spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular blockade in the denervated animal. The ED95 (mean +/- SE) of dTC for the denervated leg was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher (0.26 +/- 0.06 mg.kg-1) than contralateral (0.16 +/- 0.03) and sham-operated left (0.13 +/- 0.03) legs. The twitch tension recovered to 50% of control twitch height at significantly (P less than 0.05) higher plasma dTC concentrations in the denervated (0.78 micrograms.ml-1) compared to contralateral (0.24 micrograms.ml-1) limb. The AChR number was significantly increased in the denervated limb (1041 +/- 96 fmol.mg protein-1) compared to contralateral right (109 +/- 4) and control left limb (113 +/- 11). There was a significant (P less than 0.05) positive correlation (R2 = 0.73) between ED95 and AChR number; that is, 73% of the variability in ED95 could be explained by changes in AChR. This study, therefore, confirms the hypothesis that proliferation of AChR after nerve denervation results in resistance to the neuromuscular effects of dTC. 
4	Coronary angioplasty of diffuse coronary artery disease. From January 1983 through December 1987, 98 patients underwent angioplasty of at least one diffusely diseased coronary artery. Diffuse coronary disease was described as: group I, narrowing greater than or equal to 50% that involved the entire vessel (40 patients), group II, long lesions greater than or equal to 2 cm in length (39 patients), group III, three or more lesions in the same vessel (19 patients). There were 65 men and 33 women, with a mean age of 60 years; 64 patients (65%) had unstable angina, 23 patients (23%) were diabetic, 31 (32%) had prior myocardial infarctions, and 12 had prior bypass surgery. Multivessel disease was present in 89% of patients. Angioplasty of only the diffusely diseased vessel was performed in 41 patients, and additional vessels were dilated in 57 patients. Overall, of 396 lesions (four per patient) and 197 vessels (two per patient) attempted, success was achieved in 382 lesions (96%) and 187 vessels (95%); angiographic success was achieved in 112 of 120 diffusely diseased vessels (93%). Clinical success was achieved in 91 patients (93%). The overall complication rate (death, myocardial infarction, urgent bypass surgery) was 8% (8 of 98): six patients (6%) had myocardial infarction (one Q wave, five non-Q wave), one patient (1%) had urgent bypass surgery, and two patients (2%) died (one during bypass surgery). The majority of complications (7 of 8 or 87%), including the two deaths, occurred in group I patients, with a 17.5% rate, versus 2.5% in group II and 0% in group III, p less than 0.002. 
2	Detection of hepatitis B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction in plasma of volunteer blood donors negative for hepatitis B surface antigen. Plasma samples from 206 volunteer blood donors were tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA by dot blot hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All donors were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and had normal serum alanine aminotransferase levels. None of the 206 plasma samples was positive for HBV DNA by dot blot hybridization assay. However, nine samples were positive for HBV DNA by PCR using two primer pairs specific for surface and core regions. Nine persons received the HBV-DNA-positive plasma, and one developed posttransfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis; the others remained well 6 months later. Therefore, approximately 4% of blood donors in Taiwan have low titers of HBV DNA, and a more sensitive method to screen donors may be needed in the future, although the current serologic test remains the most practical at present. 
1	Lower extremity weakness as the initial manifestation of lung cancer [published erratum appears in Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1991 Jan;72(1):61] A 55-year-old woman had progressive lower extremity weakness. She had an 80-pack-per-year history of cigarette smoking. Electromyographic findings were consistent with the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Despite a normal chest x-ray, normal laboratory studies, and negative bronchoscopy, investigation for lung cancer was pursued. The final thoracotomy and pathology reports indicated a diagnosis of oat cell carcinoma. After treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, clinical and electrophysiologic findings have resolved. Two years after diagnosis, the patient remains in good health without evidence of recurrence. 
4	A standard heparin nomogram for the management of heparin therapy. A nomogram for the adjustment of heparin dosage was developed to standardize heparin therapy and to reduce delays in achieving and maintaining a therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) result. Fifty consecutive patients with acute venous thromboembolism had their continuous intravenous heparin therapy adjusted according to this heparin nomogram. The effect of the nomogram on heparin therapy in these patients was compared with data from 53 historical control patients. The proportion of patients in the nomogram group who reached a therapeutic APTT at 24 hours after the start of heparin therapy was 66%, which increased to 81% at 48 hours. In contrast, 37% and 58% of the control patients reached a therapeutic APTT at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. The percentage of therapeutic APTT results of the total number of APTT determinations was greater in the nomogram patients than controls. The use of this heparin nomogram resulted in (1) achieving a therapeutic APTT at 24 and 48 hours in a large proportion of patients and (2) reduced periods of inadequate anticoagulation and overanticoagulation during heparin therapy. 
5	Two discharge patterns of carotid body chemoreceptors in the goat. Twenty-nine single carotid body chemoreceptor units recorded during normocapnic normoxia from 20 anesthetized goats were classified into two groups by discharge pattern. Thirteen fibers, which had interspike interval distributions with a prominent peak [24.0 +/- 9.8% (SD)] at 0- to 20-ms bin, were termed bursting fibers (BF). The 16 remaining fibers were termed nonbursting fibers (NBF); these had no notable peak in the interval distributions. During hypoxia and hypercapnia, the chemoreceptor fibers continued to discharge in their established patterns. The interval distribution of most NBF spike trains could be described with the Poisson process, but none of the BF could be. However, except for the intervals in the range of 0-20 ms, the interval distribution of the BF could be described as exponential. This study suggests that 1) there are two distinct populations of the goat chemoreceptor fiber, each with an inherent discharge pattern; 2) the chemoreceptor did not code information about arterial PO2 and PCO2 in different patterns; and 3) the basic chemotransduction mechanism is likely the same in BF and NBF, and the difference in discharge pattern is more likely to reflect processes downstream from the transducer. 
5	The encased ureter: bullet and bodkin pattern, a reliable radiographic sign. Among the causes of constricted ureter is benign or malignant encasement. The diagnosis of ureteric encasement is frequently overlooked, even by well informed clinicians and radiologists. The most common benign cause is retroperitoneal fibrosis and the most frequent malignant causes are extension from an adjacent primary tumour, true metastases to the ureter and lymphoma. Lack of recognition of the process may lead to mistaken diagnosis of an inflammatory stricture or infiltrating transitional cell tumour, with resultant inappropriate management. A sign which appears to be almost specific for encasement, the bullet and bodkin configuration, is described here. Newer imaging modalities such as computed tomography and ultrasound, while helpful, are probably less sensitive and less specific than the retrograde ureterogram because a detectable mass is not always present. 
3	Cerebral infarction: early detection by means of contrast-enhanced cerebral arteries at MR imaging. The authors describe a new magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sign of acute cerebral ischemia/infarction. Abnormally contrast material-enhanced curvilinear structures were demonstrated in eight patients in the evolving area of cerebral ischemia/infarction within 26 hours after the ictus on contrast-enhanced, high-field-strength (1.5-T), T1-weighted spin-echo images. The abnormal enhancement is considered to represent cortical arterial vessels of markedly slowed circulation in areas of underlying brain injury, which will eventually progress to frank brain infarction. This was demonstrated at computed tomographic (CT) and follow-up MR examinations. Characteristically, the degree of the contrast enhancement of vessels appeared most intense in the proximal portions, and the intensity of enhancement gradually diminished in the more distal portions of these vessels as they pass over the convexities and finally disappear. 
3	Intraspinal transplants. Transplants of embryonic central nervous system tissue have long been used to study axon growth during development and regeneration, and more recently to promote recovery in models of human diseases. Transplants of embryonic substantia nigra correct some of the deficits found in experimental Parkinson's disease, for example, by mechanisms that are thought to include release of neurotransmitter and reinnervation of host targets, as well as by stimulating growth of host axons. Similar mechanisms appear to allow intraspinal transplants of embryonic brainstem to reverse locomotor and autonomic deficits due to experimental spinal cord injuries. Embryonic spinal cord transplants offer an additional strategy for correcting the deficits of spinal cord injury because, by replacing damaged populations of neurons, they may mediate the restoration of connections between host neurons. We have found that spinal cord transplants permit regrowth of adult host axons resulting in reconstitution of synaptic complexes within the transplant that in many respects resemble normal synapses. Transplants of fetal spinal cord may also contribute to behavioral recovery by rescuing axotomized host neurons that otherwise would have died. Electrophysiological and behavioral investigations of functional recovery after intraspinal transplantation are preliminary, and the role of transplants in the treatment of human spinal cord injury is uncertain. Transplants are contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms of recovery, however, and are likely to play a role in the development of rational treatments. 
1	Fludarabine phosphate: a synthetic purine antimetabolite with significant activity against lymphoid malignancies. Fludarabine phosphate is the 2-fluoro, 5'-monophosphate derivative of vidarabine (ara-A) with the advantages of resistance to deamination by adenosine deaminase (ADA) and improved solubility. The mechanism of cytotoxic action of the compound appears to involve metabolic conversion to the active triphosphate. Fludarabine phosphate has substantial activity against lymphoid malignancies, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Its single-agent activity in CLL appears at least comparable to those of other conventional combination regimens. Its activity in Hodgkin's disease, mycosis fungoides, and macroglobulinemia, although suggestive, needs to be further defined and clinical trials are warranted in hairy cell leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia, and previously untreated myeloma. The compound does not appear active against most common solid tumors. Early clinical trials indicated significant myelosuppression and the potential for severe neurotoxicity. Toxicity on the currently used low-dose schedules includes transient and reversible myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, somnolence/fatigue, and elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum creatinine. Possible pulmonary toxicity has been suggested in several patients. The currently used low-doses of fludarabine phosphate, even with repeated administration, are well tolerated and appear safe with a negligible risk for severe neurotoxicity. Based on its single-agent activity and tolerability, the Food and Drug Administration recently granted group C designation of the drug for the treatment of patients with refractory CLL outside the clinical trials setting. The use of fludarabine phosphate in combination regimens and its impact on the natural history of the lymphoid malignancies is yet to be determined. Fludarabine phosphate may well occupy a pivotal role in the management of CLL and low-grade NHL. 
5	Iatrogenic illness in pediatric critical care. Iatrogenic illness may be an important determinant of the need for pediatric intensive care. We prospectively evaluated consecutive admissions to a pediatric ICU (PICU) over two time periods totaling 6 months. Twenty-five (4.6%) admissions were necessitated by iatrogenic illnesses. Drug-induced conditions accounted for eight (32%) of the iatrogenic patients, and complications of medical-surgical acts accounted for 17 (68%). Diagnoses included six respiratory failures due to seizure medications, six chronic upper airway complications of neonatal intensive care, four posttonsillectomy and postadenoidectomy complications, two chronic postcardiac surgery complications, two cardiac catheterization complications, and five miscellaneous conditions. One (3.7%) patient with iatrogenic illness died. As a group, patients with iatrogenic illness were at a risk of dying similar to other patients. We conclude that iatrogenic illness is a significant cause of PICU admission. 
4	Alternative technique for repair of sinus venosus atrial septal defect. A technique is described for closure of a sinus venosus atrial septal defect using a single patch held in place by sutures placed from outside the right atrium and underneath the superior vena cava. The superior vena cava does not require enlargement and potential damage to the artery to the sinoatrial node is avoided. 
4	Effects of calcium channel blockers on coronary vasoconstriction induced by endothelin-1 in closed chest pigs. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of endothelin-1 on the coronary vascular bed of closed chest pigs. Endothelin-1 (3 to 30 pmol/kg body weight) was selectively administered into the left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary blood flow and epicardial vessel diameter were measured by quantitative arteriography. Arterial pressure increased after a 30 pmol/kg dose and heart rate was not changed. Coronary blood flow and vessel diameter of the left anterior descending artery significantly decreased by 74% and 32%, respectively (p less than 0.01 versus control) after the 30 pmol/kg dose, whereas these variables modestly decreased in the left circumflex artery. Endothelin-1 in doses of 10 to 30 pmol/kg produced electrocardiographic ST segment elevation associated with decreased oxygen saturation of coronary sinus venous blood. Endothelin-induced coronary vasoconstriction was significantly inhibited after treatment with intravenous diltiazem (0.2 mg/kg, n = 6) or nifedipine (0.1 mg/kg, n = 5), but not after vehicle administration (n = 4). This study demonstrates that intracoronary administration of endothelin-1 causes significant myocardial ischemia through coronary vasoconstriction, which is inhibited by a calcium channel blocker. The data suggest that calcium influx into the smooth muscle cells appears to be involved at least in part in the mechanism of endothelin-induced coronary vasoconstriction in vivo. 
3	Selective myectomy for postparetic facial synkinesis. Synkinetic movements are secondary to facial palsy because they appear like a late sequela to spontaneously healing facial nerve injury. They are produced by an involuntary contraction of a muscle group simultaneous with contraction of other homologous muscle groups. The disorderly regeneration of severed axons is responsible for these movements. According to the Lippschitz theory, the regenerating nerve fibers sprout into the wrong peripheral branches. Between 1975 and 1986, 71 patients with facial paralysis were evaluated. Spontaneous recovery from the facial paralysis occurred in 28 of these patients; 14 (50 percent) developed synkinetic movements, and surgical treatment was sought by only 6 patients. In all patients, the lesion of the facial nerve was in the trunk, proximal to the principal ramification. The most frequent clinical finding was simultaneous activation between the orbicularis oculi and the elevators of the corner of the mouth (12 patients) or the elevators of the upper lip (2 patients). In 8 patients, in whom the slight synkinesis was not noticed by the patients, surgical correction was not necessary, but in the other 6 patients with severe aesthetic disturbances, surgical treatment for "disconnection" of the wrong impulses was realized. I obtained this "disconnection" through resection of the involved perioral muscle groups instead of paralysis of the orbicularis oculi. Follow-up of the 6 patients operated with the surgical treatment proposed herein for between 4 and 8 years has shown good aesthetic results without functional or aesthetic sequelae. 
4	Effects of nisoldipine on myocardial ischemia during exercise and during daily activity. The antiischemic properties of nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, were assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial by repeated exercise testing and 72-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in 82 patients with coronary artery disease. Patients with positive treadmill stress test results and greater than or equal to 2 ischemic episodes per 24 hours were included in this study. Administration of all chronic antiischemic medications except beta blockers were discontinued. During the first week all patients received placebo twice daily. During the second and third weeks, 41 patients received nisoldipine 10 mg and 41 patients received placebo twice daily. In the placebo group there were no changes in exercise parameters or in ambulatory electrocardiographic parameters. In the nisoldipine group, exercise duration increased from 403 to 448 seconds (p = 0.0035), time to 1 mm of ST depression increased from 224 to 298 seconds (p = 0.002), time to pain increased from 241 to 321 seconds (p = 0.01), and maximal ST depression was reduced from 2.6 to 2.3 mm (p = 0.002). Among the ambulatory electrocardiographic parameters in the nisoldipine group, only the number of episodes was reduced, from 14.4 to 11.6 (p = 0.0013) per patient. There was no significant reduction in total ischemic time (132 vs 120 minutes per patient). No significant side effects were observed. This is the largest clinical trial to date on the effects of nisoldipine on myocardial ischemia. The results indicate that nisoldipine was effective in improving all exercise parameters and only partially effective in suppressing ischemia during daily activity. 
4	Preclinical pharmacology of celiprolol: a cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist and mild vasodilator. Celiprolol is a new antihypertensive agent that represents a new generation of beta-blockers. It combines cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonism (beta 1) with a mild vasodilation via vasoselective beta-adrenergic agonism (beta 2). Results of animal studies show that celiprolol has beta 1-antagonist potency similar to that of propranolol and atenolol, and cardioselectivity slightly greater than that of atenolol. Celiprolol does not produce bronchoconstriction but has mild propranolol-resistant bronchodilatory properties in cats. The compound also relaxes vascular smooth muscle in a propranolol-sensitive fashion, suggesting a mechanism of beta 2-agonism. The beta 2-agonism results in a selective downregulation in beta 2-receptor number and response in tissue culture, as well as in peripheral tissue from celiprolol-treated volunteers. The decreases in beta 2-receptors are blocked by concomitant treatment with propranolol. Celiprolol is devoid of cardiac depressant activity and in fact has mild cardiostimulatory actions. The cardiostimulation is not via beta 1-stimulation, since it is not abolished by beta-blocking doses of propranolol. In a model of severe myocardial ischemia, celiprolol attenuates the ischemia-induced myocardial acidosis and improves the regional segment function. These results are suggestive of myocardial protection. In summary, celiprolol distinguishes itself from other beta-blockers by virtue of its cardioselectivity, vasorelaxation via beta 2-agonism, and the lack of bronchoconstriction and cardiodepression. These properties observed in animal studies have also been documented in clinical trials. 
2	Clinicopathologic features of hepatocellular carcinoma in young patients. To investigate clinicopathologic characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in young adults, excised tumors from 21 patients younger than 45 years (young group) were compared with findings in tumors from 204 patients older than 45 (old group). In the young group HCC showed (1) a high incidence of positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) (young 71.4% versus old 20.1%); (2) relatively well-preserved hepatocellular function (indocyanine green test; young 10.7 +/- 8.8% versus old 20.6 +/- 10.8%); (3) low incidence of histologically verified concomitant cirrhosis (young 52.4% versus old 78.4%); and (4) a more advanced stage of the disease in TNM classification (Stage III; young 52.4% versus old 18.1%). With respect to survival rates achieved by surgery, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Thus, hepatitis B virus may relate to the occurrence of HCC in the young patients. Despite the advanced stage in the young group, survival rate after surgery was comparable with that achieved in the old group. These observations mean that a close periodic surveillance of young adults with a positive HBsAg is required to detect HCC at an early stage. Treatment of patients with HBsAg using interferon or vidarabine and hepatitis B vaccine should be made to convert HBsAg to negative in these individuals. 
3	The relation of pain to depression among institutionalized aged. Nursing home and congregate apartment residents (N = 598) were classified on the basis of a DSM-IIIR symptom checklist as suffering possible major, minor, or no depression; they also completed the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Possible major depressives reported more intense pain and a greater number of localized pain complaints than did minor depressives; nondepressed individuals reported the least intense pain and fewest localized complaints. The effect remained strong even when functional disability and health status were controlled statistically. Both pain intensity and number of localized complaints were correlated with GDS and POMS factor scores, but strength and direction of associations varied with level of depression. Item-by-item examination of localized complaints again indicated that more depressed individuals were more likely to report pain, particularly where physicians had identified a physical problem that might account for the pain. Results are compared with previous research on pain among younger individuals. Implications for treatment of depressed elderly are discussed. 
5	Antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus in iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. Antibody titers to Epstein-Barr virus were determined in 13 patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and in 13 healthy race-, age-, and sex-matched controls. Both the geometric mean titer of IgG antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen and the proportion with high titers of IgG antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen (greater than or equal to 1:640) were significantly higher in 12 seropositive patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome than in 12 seropositive controls (1/761:1/202, P = .001; 83.3%:8.3%, P less than .001). Ten of 12 seropositive patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and five of 12 seropositive controls had antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus-induced early antigens (greater than or equal to 1:10) (Fisher's Exact Test, P less than .05), while four seropositive patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and one seropositive control had low to undetectable levels of antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus-associated nuclear antigen (less than or equal to 1:5) (P greater than .1). Antibody levels to cytomegalovirus or measles virus were not different between patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and controls. Additional studies showed no evidence of humoral immune disorder or collagen vascular disease in the patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. The serologic profiles suggest that the patients with iridocorneal endothelial syndrome examined had a cellular immune abnormality sufficient to permit reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr virus infection and imply, but do not establish, a role for Epstein-Barr virus infection in the pathogenesis of some cases of the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome. 
1	Evaluation of endosonography in TN staging of oesophageal cancer. Strategies for the treatment of cancer of the oesophagus depend on the tumour stage at the time of diagnosis. Resection, the only curative treatment, is confined to early tumour stages. Tumours with local infiltration are usually unresectable and require palliative treatment. Computed tomography has been widely used for preoperative staging but often fails to define this correctly. Endoscopic ultrasound allows direct visualisation of the parietal wall and may be useful in staging gastrointestinal tumours. In a comparative prospective study, 52 patients with tumours of the oesophagus were investigated preoperatively both by endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography to determine the stage of tumour infiltration and local lymph node involvement. Thirty seven of these patients underwent operation, resection, or dissection and entered the study. The intraoperative findings or the histopathological assessment, or both, were taken as a reference. For all TN stages of oesophageal tumours, correct preoperative staging was accomplished by endoscopic ultrasound in 89% for T stage and 69% for N stage compared with 51% and 51% respectively by computed tomography (highly significant using Fisher's exact test). This study shows that endoscopic ultrasound is useful in preoperative TN staging of tumours of the oesophagus. 
5	Thromboxane receptor blockade prevents pulmonary hypertension induced by heparin-protamine reactions in awake sheep We used competitive thromboxane A2-prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor blockade (SQ 30,741) as a probe to evaluate the role of thromboxane in ovine pulmonary vasoconstriction associated with protamine reversal of heparin anticoagulation. Control heparin-protamine reactions induced rapid release of thromboxane into arterial plasma (more than 1 ng/ml plasma), a 2.5-fold increase of pulmonary artery pressure, a 20% decrease of PaO2, and a 30% reduction in arterial white blood cell concentration. After giving SQ 30,741 despite similar thromboxane release into arterial plasma after heparin-protamine challenge, acute pulmonary hypertension was significantly reduced when 94% of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle thromboxane receptors were occupied with SQ 30,741 (p less than 0.01 at 1 minute after protamine versus control heparin-protamine reaction) and was completely abolished by a 10 mg/kg i.v. bolus (p less than 0.0001 at 1 minute after protamine versus control). Peripheral leukopenia was not affected by SQ 30,741 prophylaxis, but hypoxemia was prevented. We conclude that thromboxane causes pulmonary vasoconstriction in ovine heparin-protamine-induced pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vasoconstriction and hypoxemia can be completely prevented by thromboxane receptor blockade. 
3	Acute and long-term changes in serum lipids after acute stroke. We studied serum lipid profiles in 171 patients less than or equal to 48 hours after the onset of acute stroke and 3 months later. The 83 patients suffering cerebral infarction had significantly higher serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B and significantly lower serum concentrations of triglycerides and lipoprotein (a) less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus than 3 months later. The lipid profiles of the 53 patients suffering lacunar infarction were similar on both occasions, the only significant differences being higher total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus. No significant changes were observed among the 35 patients suffering cerebral hemorrhage apart from a significantly higher concentration of high density lipoprotein3-cholesterol less than or equal to 48 hours after ictus. Our study, with many patients classified according to stroke subtype, gives results different from those of previous studies with much fewer patients. We conclude that in studies of serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations as risk factors for cerebral infarction, comparing values obtained less than or equal to 48 hours after admission with control values may incorrectly identify certain lipid fractions as risk factors. 
5	Synovial membrane histology and immunopathology in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. In vivo effects of antirheumatic drugs. We examined the histologic and immunopathologic features of the synovial membrane of 18 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 12 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) who had undergone total knee arthroplasty. Patients were classified into 5 groups according to therapeutic regimen and disease: RA treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), RA treated with NSAIDs and prednisone, RA treated with NSAIDs and methotrexate (MTX), OA treated with analgesics, and OA treated with NSAIDs. There were no significant between-group differences in the percentages or the distribution pattern of the infiltrating T cell subsets (CD4, CD8), HLA-DR, or interleukin-2 receptor-bearing cells. However, inflammatory indices, which included the thickness of the lining cell layer and the density of the mononuclear cell infiltrate, were significantly higher in the RA patients treated with prednisone and those treated with MTX (P less than 0.05). Similarly, fibrosis was markedly reduced in these 2 groups. The RA patients treated with NSAIDs alone and the 2 groups of patients with OA demonstrated similar profiles. These data suggest that prednisone and MTX may inhibit the development of fibrosis without altering the subsets of the inflammatory cell population. This observation raises the possibility that the action of these 2 drugs may be partly mediated by the suppression of inflammatory mediators that are responsible for fibroblast activation. 
3	Clinical analyses and short-term prognoses of neonates with subependymal cysts. Twenty-one neonates with subependymal cysts detected by neurosonography soon after birth were prospectively examined. The clinical and cranial sonographic findings were evaluated with respect to short-term prognosis. The prognosis was poor in 6 patients with congenital viral infection (4 with cytomegalovirus infection and 2 with rubella infection). Five patients also had neurodevelopmental abnormalities (2 with neonatal epileptic seizures, 2 with chromosomal abnormalities, and 1 with lissencephaly). The remaining 10 patients had normal psychomotor development. The incidence of congenital viral infection was statistically correlated with a poor neurodevelopmental outcome. A correlation did not exist between the short-term prognosis and each of the other clinical factors or cranial sonographic findings. Our evidence suggests that further investigation of possible subependymal cyst etiologies is required during a careful, long-term follow-up period. 
5	Effects of prostaglandin I2, superoxide dismutase, and catalase on ischemia-reperfusion injury in liver transplantation. This study evaluated the effects of a prostaglandin I2 analogue (aPGI2), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) on hepatic injury after warm ischemia and reperfusion in terms of survival, mitochondrial function, serum enzymes, and histology. Hepatic ischemia was created in rats by clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament for 90 min with splenofemoral bypass. Reperfusion was induced by unclamping the vessels and disconnecting the splenofemoral bypass. Then aPGI2 (350 ng/kg/min) was infused for 60 min just before hepatic ischemia, and SOD and CAT (5,000 units/kg each) were administered immediately before the start of reperfusion. Serum enzyme and mitochondrial function assessments of livers were made just after ischemia, and after 2 hr of reperfusion. Survival rate was also assessed in a separate group of rats. Liver enzymes such as SGOT, SGPT, and LDH showed no correlation to liver viability. The administration of aPGI2 alone showed no effect on ischemically injured mitochondria; however, the free radical scavengers (SOD, CAT), in combination with aPGI2, showed significant improvement of mitochondrial function together with extension of survival. The ultrastructure of hepatocytes was better preserved in the treated groups. These agents improved the viability of ischemic-reperfused injured livers. 
1	The frequency of uterine leiomyomas. As a leading cause of hysterectomy in premenopausal women. uterine leiomyomas are a major public health problem. However, very little work has been done on their epidemiology. Indeed, their true frequency has never been established using systematic and meticulous methods. In this study, gross serial sectioning at 2-mm intervals was applied as an adjunct to routine pathology processing in 100 consecutive total hysterectomy specimens. This tripled the number of leiomyomas noted in routine pathology reports. There were 649 leiomyomas in 77 of 100 uteri, with multiplicity of leiomyomas in 84%. Although leiomyomas were more numerous and larger in women with a clinical diagnosis of myomatous uterus, the incidence was no higher than in uteri removed for other reasons. The postmenopausal incidence of leiomyomas was no lower than the premenopausal incidence, although postmenopausal leiomyomas were smaller and fewer. These findings suggest that epidemiologic studies of leiomyomas may not be valid if they are based only on clinical diagnoses or routine pathology reports. 
4	Endovascular management of arterial intimal defects: an experimental comparison by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasonography. To determine the feasibility of the endovascular management of intimal defects while comparing the accuracy of arteriography with angioscopy and intravascular ultrasonography, we developed an in vivo model of arterial intimal flaps. In 10 superficial femoral arteries of five anesthetized mongrel dogs, intimal flaps were constructed and then imaged by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. A flexible microbiopsy forceps was used to remove each intimal flap under angioscopic guidance. Arteriographic lumen diameters were measured and cross-sectional areas calculated. Corresponding measurements by angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound with reduction in luminal area at the flap were obtained by use of computerized planimetry. Uniplanar arteriography identified 60% (6/10) of the intimal flaps, whereas angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound demonstrated 100%. Lumen diameter (in millimeters) measured by arteriography (3.4 +/- 0.6) correlated significantly with measurements by angioscopy (3.5 +/- 0.5, r = 0.77) and intravascular ultrasound (3.5 +/- 0.6, r = 0.96). Similarly, lumen area (square millimeters) by arteriography (9.2 +/- 2.9) correlated with measurements by angioscopy (8.9 +/- 2.2, r = 0.82) and intravascular ultrasound (8.6 +/- 2.7, r = 0.91). Reduction in lumen area by the flap by angioscopy (37 +/- 7%) and intravascular ultrasound (33 +/- 8%) also correlated significantly (r = 0.72). The intimal flaps were removed successfully in all 10 arteries as confirmed by arteriography, angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. We conclude that the endovascular management of intimal defects is possible. Additionally, angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound accurately evaluate lumen diameter and area while providing direct assessment of intimal defects. 
4	How ancient is temporal arteritis? Realism is one of the characteristics of Amarnian art; some details of The Harpist represented in the tomb of Pa-Aton-Em-Heb (1350 BC, 18th Dynasty) might gives clues to a diagnosis: the eyes are closed with swollen lids, and the harpist appears to stare into space; he is round shouldered with a very wasted face, his temporal ara is heightened and hollowed by a broken line joining the extremity of the eyebrow with the corner of the eye. These details are not found elsewhere. Did the harpist's blindness result from temporal arteritis associated to polymyalgia rheumatica?. 
1	Genotypic analyses of Richter's syndrome. The authors report the immunogenotype of two cases of Richter's syndrome. The immunoglobulin gene rearrangement pattern obtained on Southern Blot analysis was found in both cases to be the same in leukemic blood cells and in the tissue involved by the lymphoma. The beta chain and gamma chain T-cell receptor gene rearrangement pattern exhibited a germ-line configuration in the peripheral blood cells and in the lymph node in Case 2, whereas in Case 1 the lymph node had a gene rearrangement in the beta chain, as well as in the gamma chain T-cell receptor, and the leukemic cells from bone marrow were found to be in a germ-line configuration for T-cell receptors (beta and gamma chains). 
1	Anesthesia for craniotomy: a double-blind comparison of alfentanil, fentanyl, and sufentanil. Using a prospective, randomized, and double-blind study design, alfentanil (n = 15), fentanyl (n = 14), or sufentanil (n = 16), in combination with N2O, were administered to patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial tumor resection. Physicians were given two syringes, one of which was labeled as "load" for the initial loading dose and the other as "maintenance" for continuous infusion. The concentration of drug in each syringe was adjusted to permit administration on a milliliter per kilogram basis. The target loading doses for alfentanil, fentanyl, and sufentanil were 75, 10, and 1 microgram/kg, respectively, and initial infusion rates were 33.5, 2.0, and 0.3 microgram.kg-1.h-1, respectively. Additional supplementary boluses and changes in maintenance infusion rate were made according to predetermined guidelines. Isoflurane, in increasing 0.2% inspired increments, was used only when the maximum allowed opioid dose had been given (i.e., supplementary bolus doses equal to 75% of the calculated loading dose or supplementary bolus doses equal to 50% of the calculated loading dose combined with a 50% increase in the maintenance infusion rate). Opioid infusions were stopped at the time of bone flap replacement. Antihypertensive medications and naloxone were subsequently given at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Group demographics were not different. Total volumes of drug were similar among groups indicating equipotent preparations. Administration of isoflurane, antihypertensive medications, and naloxone were not different among groups. Although decreases in blood pressure seen with induction were similar among groups, alfentanil-treated patients received ephedrine more frequently before intubation. Thirty minutes after entry into the postanesthesia recovery area, respiratory rate and pH were lowest in sufentanil-treated patients. 
1	Influence of organ environment on extracellular matrix degradative activity and metastasis of human colon carcinoma cells Orthotopic implantation of human colon carcinoma cells is useful for studying the behavior of metastatic subpopulations. We observed that the parental line and variants of human colon carcinoma KM12 cells were all tumorigenic following implantation into the subcutis or cecal wall of BALB/c nude mice. Their ability to metastasize to distant organ sites varied, however, with the site of growth. Subcutaneous (SC) tumors did not produce visceral metastases, whereas cecal tumors metastasized to the regional mesenteric lymph nodes and to the liver. To examine the influence of organ environment on the extracellular matrix-degrading activity of the tumors, we inoculated human colon carcinoma cells into the subcutis or cecal wall and after 7 weeks isolated and cultured the tumors in serum-free medium. The conditioned media of SC tumors contained very low levels of type IV collagenase (gelatinase) and heparanase (heparan sulfate-specific endo-beta-D-glucuronidase), whereas the media of the cecal wall tumors contained high levels of both. Zymograms of the media revealed that the intracecal human colon carcinomas secreted more than three times the amount of latent and active forms of 92-kd type IV collagenase than did the SC tumors. Moreover, only the conditioned media of intracecal tumors contained latent and active forms of 64-kd type IV collagenase. Histochemical analysis using rabbit antiserum raised against the synthetic peptides of 72-kd procollagenase type IV showed type IV collagenase in the intracecal tumors; human colon carcinoma growing SC, however, were not stained significantly. These results suggest that factors in the organ environment may affect production and secretion of tumor extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, and these factors may modify the metastatic behavior of human colon carcinoma cells in nude mice. 
1	The role of adrenalectomy in Cushing's syndrome. Forty-four patients with Cushing's syndrome were treated by adrenalectomy between 1975 and 1989. Twenty patients had adrenal adenomas: 13 with obvious Cushing's syndrome and 7 whose disease was subclinical, detected after evaluation of an incidentally discovered adrenal mass (es). Twelve patients underwent bilateral adrenalectomies for Cushing's disease after failed transsphenoidal explorations and pituitary irradiation. Six patients had primary adrenal hyperplasia, five as manifestations of Carney's complex. Two others underwent bilateral adrenalectomies for ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone from carcinoid tumors. Four patients had adrenocortical carcinoma treated with transabdominal adrenalectomy. Three are alive from 8 years to 5 months. There was one postoperative death (2.3%) caused by coagulopathy and multiple organ failure and three (7%) minor postoperative complications. Follow-up showed good to excellent results in 95% of patients. It is concluded that adrenalectomy provides prompt relief from the severe morbidity of Cushing's syndrome regardless of the cause. It is the treatment of choice for adrenal adenomas, carcinomas, primary hyperplasia, and selected patients with Cushing's disease. 
5	An unusual complication of silastic dural substitute: case report. A case is presented in which a patient developed an unusual complication after the use of Silastic dural substitute. In 1983, the patient underwent removal of a meningioma with the involved dura. Five years later, he developed around the graft material a very thick connective tissue capsule, which simulated a recurrent meningioma clinically and radiologically. 
2	Severe thrombocytopenia after paracetamol overdose. Two patients with severe thrombocytopenia after paracetamol overdose are described. The platelet count was lowest two days after the overdose. Neither leucopenia nor anaemia occurred.
