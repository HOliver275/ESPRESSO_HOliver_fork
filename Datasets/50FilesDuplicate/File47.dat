Pyoderma gangrenosum in inflammatory bowel disease. Since 1954, 34 patients have attended St. Mark's Hospital with pyoderma gangrenosum in association either with ulcerative colitis (22 patients) or Crohn's disease (12 patients). Lesions were multiple in 71 per cent and over half were situated below the knees. Ulcerative colitis was active in 11 patients (50 per cent) and Crohn's disease was active in nine (75 per cent) when pyoderma gangrenosum was diagnosed. Associated illnesses--most commonly a seronegative arthritis affecting large joints--were present in 55 per cent and 92 per cent of cases respectively. A diffuse pustular rash appeared in six patients, synchronously with pyoderma in five. In a further seven patients (two with ulcerative colitis, five with Crohn's disease) the onset or course of pyoderma might have been linked to the presence of non-dermatological suppuration. Pyoderma resolved without intestinal resection in two-thirds of patients. When present at the time of surgical resection (15 procedures in 13 patients), pyoderma healed promptly in six cases, only with additional therapy in four cases and very slowly or not at all in five cases. Pyoderma gangrenosum occurs in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Healing after intestinal resection is unpredictable both with respect to timing and extent of resection. 
Acute atherosis in pregnancies complicated by hypertension, small-for-gestational-age infants, and diabetes mellitus. A clinicohistologic study of acute atherosis in late complicated pregnancy was undertaken. Maternal vessels in the placental basal plate, underlying the amniochorial membranes and in placental bed biopsy specimens, were examined histologically. The earliest histologically convincing lesion acceptable as acute atherosis was fibrinoid necrosis with a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate, while lipophages were a late phenomenon. Any maternal uterine vessel that had not undergone physiologic vascular changes could be affected by acute atherosis. Acute atherosis was not seen in normal pregnancies or in pregnancies of diabetic women but was seen in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, small-for-gestational-age infants, or both. In pregnancies complicated by small-for-gestational-age infants, acute atherosis was not seen in the vessels in the decidua parietalis. 
Economic issues relating to access to medications. Millions of uninsured, low-income workers (a disproportionate number of them black) are financially unable to obtain prescription drugs for treatment of conditions such as hypertension. As a result, funds spent to diagnose their underlying illnesses may be wasted, and they are likely to suffer complications that require much more costly care. The tendency for income levels to be inversely correlated with blood pressure means that those least able to pay for antihypertensive medication are those most susceptible to complications. Since current programs are inadequate to help most of these patients, there is a need for a joint initiative by the federal government and the pharmaceutical industry to fund programs to make medications easily accessible for the medically indigent population. 
Role of mesothelial cells in peritoneal antibacterial defence. Whether phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus by polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes, and peritoneal macrophages takes place when the staphylococci are adherent to monolayers of human mesothelial cells in the absence of opsonins was investigated. Adherence of S aureus to mesothelial monolayers increased significantly when the bacteria were opsonised with pooled human serum, but phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes occurred independently. Phagocytosis by peritoneal macrophages, however, was only marginal. Pretreatment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils with inhibitors of cellular metabolism and motility reduced their phagocytic capacity. These results indicate that the surface of mesothelial cells provides favourable conditions for the elimination of staphylococci in the peritoneal cavity. Phagocytic motility seems to be important in surface phagocytosis. The inability of peritoneal macrophages to phagocytise staphylococci adherent to the mesothelial cells suggests that they contribute little to the antibacterial defence of the peritoneal membrane of patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. 
Single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of methionyl growth hormone in children with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of methionyl GH (metGH) were characterized in 20 newly diagnosed GH-deficient children (19 males; 12.9 +/- 3.3 yr old; initial height, 138.8 +/- 16.2 cm; weight, 32.1 +/- 13.1 kg) after the first dose (FD) of metGH and again after 4-5 weeks of multiple dosing (MD). All subjects received a total metGH dose of 0.3 mg/kg.week by sc administration, but were randomized to receive the drug daily (D; n = 12; dose, 0.043 mg/kg) or three times per week (TIW; n = 8; dose, 0.1 mg/kg). After drug administration, repeated blood samples (n = 14) were obtained over a 10-h period. Concentrations of metGH from each sample were determined using a monoclonal antibody radiometric assay (range of linearity, 0.5-40.0 ng/ml; coefficient of variation, less than 4%). Plasma concentration vs. time data were curve fit using a nonlinear weighted least squares algorithm which permitted calculation of the following PK parameters (mean +/- SEM; FD vs. MD group): elimination rate constant (0.23 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.04 h-1), absorption rate constant (0.43 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.48 +/- 0.04 h-1), elimination half-life (t1/2; 3.01 vs. 2.77 h), total plasma clearance (CL/F; 0.32 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.09 L/h.kg), and apparent volume of distribution (VDss/F; 2.2 +/- 0.14 vs. 3.15 +/- 0.28 L/kg). Both the CL/F and VDss/F of metGH were significantly greater when data from the entire study population were compared on the basis of FD vs. MD administration. With the exception of a larger VDss/F in subjects who received daily (3.6 +/- 0.4 L/kg) vs. TIW metGH (2.4 +/- 0.2 L/kg), no significant differences were found for the PK parameters between the D and TIW dosing groups. In all subjects, absorption of metGH was slow, with an average time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) of 4.4 h and an absorption t1/2 that ranged from 1.4-1.8 h. Proportionality was also found between the dose and the area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve, suggesting dose-independent PK of metGH. Our data demonstrate that the PK of metGH after sc administration to children are markedly different from those previously reported in adults and, also, do not vary as a consequence of dosing schedule (i.e. D vs. TIW). The apparent increase in CL/F and VDss/F for met GH with multiple dosing may reflect concentration-dependent changes in plasma binding of the drug or, alternatively, represent the effect of increased body mass on the pharmacokinetics of GH. 
The renin-angiotensin system: renal actions and blood pressure regulation. The RAS is part of an extremely powerful feedback system for long-term control of blood pressure and volume homeostasis. Disturbances that tend to lower blood pressure, such as heart failure, cirrhosis, and peripheral vasodilation, cause sodium and water retention until blood pressure returns to normal due, in large part, to the combined actions of ANGII and reduced arterial pressure. In response to increased sodium intake, decreased ANGII formation greatly amplifies the effectiveness of pressure natriuresis, thereby preventing large increases in body fluid volumes and blood pressure. In circumstances in which the RAS is inappropriately activated, the sodium retaining effects of ANGII necessitate increased blood pressure to maintain sodium balance via pressure natriuresis. Because the RAS is so powerful in regulating blood pressure, blockade of the system with ACE inhibitors offers a powerful therapeutic tool in diseases such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. The control of sodium excretion and blood pressure by ANGII is exerted through multiple intrarenal as well as extrarenal effects, including stimulation of aldosterone secretion, which can influence renal excretion. Current evidence suggests that the intrarenal effects of ANGII are quantitatively more important than those mediated by aldosterone in controlling blood pressure and renal excretion. The most important intrarenal effects of ANGII include efferent arteriolar constriction as well as direct effects on sodium transport. The constrictor effect on efferent arterioles also is important in preventing reductions in GFR in circumstances associated with impaired renal perfusion. Therefore blockade of ANGII formation in circumstances such as renal artery stenosis may caused marked reductions in GFR. However, in many patients efferent arteriolar vasodilation caused by ANGII blockade may not lower GFR markedly because of other autoregulatory mechanisms that compensate by causing parallel reductions in afferent arteriolar resistance. In these individuals, chronic ACE inhibition may prove to be beneficial in slowing the progression of renal disease because a reduction in glomerular hydrostatic pressure may help to prevent glomerular damage. 
A randomized clinical trial of ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin versus cefotaxime and clindamycin in children with ruptured appendicitis. This prospective, randomized, double-blind study compares the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin (AGC) or cefotaxime and clindamycin (CC) for the treatment of children with complicated appendicitis. Ninety-seven children were randomized. Forty-seven were assigned to the AGC regimen and 50 received CC. Forty-two patients in the AGC group had an appropriate therapeutic outcome, whereas 48 of 50 children who received CC completed the trial successfully (p = NS). There were no differences between the groups with reference to the duration of antibiotic administration, fever, leukocytosis or length of hospitalization. Complications of therapy were uncommon and neither regimen demonstrated a significant advantage from an economic standpoint. We concluded that, in childhood, complicated appendicitis can be treated with either CC or AGC with equal efficacy. 
Type I transforming growth factor-beta receptors on neutrophils mediate chemotaxis to transforming growth factor-beta. Participation of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the inflammatory response is mediated, in part, by soluble factors such as chemotactic peptides and cytokines. Although the cytokine, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), has been shown to recruit monocytes and promote the inflammatory process, its effects on neutrophils are unknown. In this investigation, [125I]TGF-beta 1 affinity binding studies were employed to show that neutrophils express TGF-beta receptors (350 +/- 20 receptors/cell), which exhibit high affinity for the ligand (dissociation constant, 50 pM). Affinity cross-linking studies identified the receptors to be primarily of the type I class. In contrast to the receptors on monocytes, neutrophil TGF-beta receptors were not down-regulated by exposure to specific inflammatory mediators. Additional studies examined whether exposure of neutrophils to TGF-beta could enhance specific functions, as occurs with monocytes. TGF-beta was shown to cause directed migration of neutrophils at femtomolar concentrations, thus it is the most potent neutrophil chemotactic factor yet identified. Neutrophil production of reactive oxygen intermediates was not stimulated by TGF-beta, nor did TGF-beta enhance or depress subsequent PMA- or FMLP-stimulated superoxide production. However, the stable expression of neutrophil TGF-beta receptors, and the capacity of this cytokine to stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis, suggest that the pro-inflammatory effects of TGF-beta are mediated by neutrophils in addition to monocytes. 
Bone modulation in sustained hematopoietic stimulation in mice. To understand the etiology of bone modulation and hypercalcemia observed in granulocytosis of a tumor-bearing animal model and to gain insight into the implication of sustained hematopoietic stimulation on the bone tissue, in vivo responses of normal mouse hematopoietic and bone tissues to long-term injections of recombinant human and murine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), murine granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), and human erythropoietin were quantitatively analyzed. Osteoclast activation was estimated by the osteoclast-endosteal ratio, determined by morphometric analyses of femoral sections. Medullary and bone areas were measured on transverse ground bone sections of the tibia. Recombinant murine G-CSF provoked marked granulocytosis associated with significant increases in the number of marrow granulocytes and their progenitors, and caused expansion of granulopoietic marrow into fatty marrow. The bone of G-CSF-treated mice showed a significant increase in endosteal osteoclast numbers with medullary area enlargement and a reduction in the bone thickness; indicative of endosteal bone resorption. Although GM-CSF had little effect on granulopoiesis, it caused peritoneal macrophages to increase and induced similar bone changes as those observed in G-CSF treatment. Enhanced erythropoiesis stimulated by erythropoietin was also associated with evidence of endosteal bone resorption. Bone changes induced by these growth factors were not associated with hypercalcemia. These animal studies document association of bone modulation in sustained stimulation of hematopoiesis, and implicate important physiologic effects of hematopoietic growth factors on skeletal tissue in vivo. 
Clinical application of PET for the evaluation of brain tumors. The combination of FDG and PET has demonstrated clinical utility in the evaluation of patients with brain tumors. At the time of diagnosis, FDG PET provides information concerning the degree of malignancy and patient prognosis. After therapy, FDG PET is able to assess persistence of tumor, determine degree of malignancy, monitor progression, differentiate recurrence from necrosis, and assess prognosis. Other studies using PET provide information that may be clinically useful. Determination of tumor blood flow and permeability of the blood-brain barrier may help in the selection of appropriate therapy. Amino acid imaging using 11C-methionine is being evaluated in patients with brain tumors and provides different information than FDG imaging. 
US-guided venipuncture for venography in the edematous leg. A technique for sonographic-guided venipuncture was developed especially for venography made difficult by gross leg edema. Five patients were evaluated in whom venography had been attempted but was initially unsuccessful because of difficult venous access. All five underwent successful venipuncture after sonographic localization of a vein. Ultrasound-guided venipuncture is simple and useful when venous access by palpation is difficult. 
P300 response to tones and speech sounds after cochlear implant: a case report. P300 potentials evoked by tones and spoken words were recorded from a 20-year-old man with a House-3M single-channel cochlear implant. Three months after cochlear implantation, there was a slight appearance of P300 response to both pure-tone stimuli and spoken-word stimuli; 6 months later, clearly identifiable P300 response to both pure-tone stimuli and spoken-word stimuli were obtained. These results are consistent with an encoding improvement for re-establishment of information processing after auditory rehabilitation. 
Behavioral treatment of dizziness secondary to benign positional vertigo following head trauma. Benign positional vertigo (BPV) represents a challenge to rehabilitation due to the subjective nature of the complaint of dizziness, frequent failure of pharmacologic intervention, and complicating psychologic factors. Behavioral therapy was used to treat a 26-year-old woman who complained of debilitating dizzy spells after mild head injury sustained in a motor vehicle accident. During a three-week baseline period before treatment, the patient reported a weekly average of 48 dizzy spells, which prevented participation in independent activities and kept her homebound and psychologically distressed. Nine-week behavioral treatment included biofeedback-assisted relaxation training, psychologic counseling, gaze-fixation practice, desensitization exercise, and generalization training. This protocol has been used successfully to train aviators to combat vertigo and nausea in flight. Our regimen included hourly recording of physical activity, notation of frequency of dizzy spells, and use of behavioral methods during nine weeks. The patient reported 90% reduction in dizzy spells and full resumption of independent activities including driving and athletics. Results are discussed in the context of behavioral problems associated with BPV and application of behavioral methods to the complaint of dizziness. 
Reviewing oral leukoplakia: clinical concepts for the 1990s. Microscopic evidence of dysplasia is not necessary to diagnose leukoplakia. Rather leukoplakia is clinically diagnosed not so much by defining appearances as by excluding other lesions also appearing as oral white plaques. 
Pancreaticobronchial fistula causing lung abscess: case report and brief discussion of the literature. A case report of a patient with an abscess of the lung caused by a pancreaticobronchial fistula is presented. The patient was treated by pulmonary resection and distal pancreatectomy-splenectomy. 
Chinese hamster ovarian cells transfected with the murine interleukin-6 gene cause hypercalcemia as well as cachexia, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis in tumor-bearing nude mice. The effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in vivo were assessed by inoculating Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells which were transfected with the murine IL-6 gene in nude mice. Nude mice bearing CHO cells expressing IL-6 developed hypercalcemia. Tumor-bearing mice also showed increases in white cell count, platelet count, and decreases in body weight. In nude mice carrying CHO tumors which had not been transfected with the IL-6 gene, there were no changes in these parameters. These results suggest that increased circulating concentrations of IL-6 in patients with malignant disease may contribute to a number of paraneoplastic syndromes including hypercalcemia, cachexia, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. 
IFN-gamma inhibits inflammatory cell recruitment and the evolution of bacterial cell wall-induced arthritis. Localization of streptococcal cell wall Ag (SCW) in the synovial tissue of treated rats induces an influx of leukocytes and a cell-mediated immune response leading to arthritis and joint destruction. Systemic administration of the T cell product, IFN-gamma (10(6) U/kg/day), suppresses the recruitment of leukocytes into the synovium and effectively inhibits the inflammation and pathology characteristic of SCW-induced arthritis (articular index 10.4 +/- 0.6 for SCW vs 2.0 +/- 0.7 for SCW with IFN-gamma, p less than 0.005). Monocyte-macrophages from animals treated with IFN-gamma exhibited defective chemotactic responses when tested in vitro and furthermore, monocytes cultured with IFN-gamma (25 to 500 U/ml) in vitro had significantly suppressed chemotactic responses to the complement fragment C5a (p less than 0.005). The decreased ability to migrate to C5a was associated with decreased binding of fluorochrome-conjugated C5a indicative of reduced expression of C5a receptors. Based on these data, IFN-gamma that induces monocyte maturation as reflected by increased Ia expression conversely inhibits C5a receptor expression. Although locally elevated IFN-gamma levels may serve to inhibit recruitment away from an inflammatory site, systemic exposure to IFN-gamma appears to inhibit leukocyte recruitment to the inflammatory site by its ability to induce premature maturation and concomitant inability to respond to certain chemotactic ligands. Inasmuch as monocyte recruitment to the synovium is pivotal in the development of SCW-induced polyarthritis, the ability of IFN-gamma to inhibit this event effectively inhibits the synovial pathology. 
Irreducible inguinal hernia in children below two years of age Eighty-five cases of irreducible inguinal hernia in children below 2 years of age were reviewed. Non-operative treatment was successful in 71 (84 per cent); 14 children required emergency surgery. The younger the child and the longer the duration of symptoms at presentation, the worse was the outcome of non-operative treatment. In 35 (41 per cent) children the diagnosis of inguinal hernia had been made before irreducibility. There is an increased incidence of postoperative complication associated with irreducibility, especially in preterm infants. Early diagnosis of inguinal hernia in young children and prompt referral for surgery is recommended. 
Preoperative radiation therapy followed by extrafascial hysterectomy in patients with stage II endometrial carcinoma. Seventy-four patients with Stage II endometrial cancer were treated by a combination of preoperative radiation therapy followed by extrafascial hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and paraaortic lymph node sampling at the University of Kentucky Medical Center from 1967 to 1988. All patients had histologically confirmed endometrial cancer with involvement of the endocervix. The cell types and numbers of the tumors treated were as follows: adenocarcinoma, 58; adenoacanthoma, six; adenosquamous carcinoma, nine; and clear cell carcinoma, one. Preoperative radiation consisted of 4500 cGy external therapy followed by one intracavitary implant providing an additional 2000 cGy to point A. Surgery was done 4 to 6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. Five patients (7.1%) had paraaortic lymph node metastases. Four were treated with extended-field radiation therapy and one with platinum-based combination chemotherapy. After treatment, the patients were followed at regular intervals from 2 to 22 years (mean, 5.4 years). Eleven patients (15%) had recurrent cancer, with the vagina and upper abdomen being the most common sites of spread. The estimated 5-year and 10-year disease-free survival rates of these patients are 88% and 76%, respectively. Cell type, depth of myometrial invasion, and lymph node status were the most important prognostic variables in the patients evaluated. These data confirm that the combination of preoperative radiation therapy and surgery produces excellent long-term survival in patients with Stage II endometrial cancer. 
Carpal tunnel syndrome in the mucopolysaccharidoses and related disorders. Eighteen patients with various mucopolysaccharidoses or mucolipidosis III were studied electrophysiologically to determine the presence or absence of carpal tunnel syndrome. In 17 patients this was clearly demonstrated, the only exception being a boy with mucopolysaccharidosis II, age 6 months at testing. All patients had a remarkable lack of symptoms. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a very common complication of the mucopolysaccharidoses and mucolipidosis III and should be actively looked for in affected patients. Early diagnosis and treatment offer the best chance of a good response to surgery. 
Expression of the c-myc protein is down-regulated at the terminal stages during in vitro differentiation of B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The translocated c-myc oncogene in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and murine plasmacytoma (MPC) has been proposed to be expressed at a stage of differentiation at which the gene is normally silent, resulting in a continuous proliferation and an inhibited terminal differentiation. To determine whether c-myc is differently expressed at the various stages of the differentiation pathway, we used B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells, representing resting B lymphocytes, inducible to proliferation and/or differentiation in vitro. The c-myc protein, and Ig lambda-light chain and PCA-1 antigen as markers of B-cell maturation, were analyzed in single, morphologically defined cells by immunocytochemical double-staining. The proliferation of individual cells was determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation and by analysis of Ki-67 antigen expression. The results show that the level of c-myc expression correlates to the stage of differentiation and to the proliferative activity. Uninduced resting cells did not express c-myc. The c-myc protein was observed in the highest amount at the proliferative B-lymphoblast stage of maturation and was reduced in plasmablasts and undetectable in plasma cells. The results suggest that maturation of B cells into nonproliferative, terminally differentiated plasma cells is associated with a downregulated c-myc expression and thus support the view that the deregulated c-myc gene in BL and MPC is expressed at an inappropriate stage of maturation and thereby inhibits terminal differentiation. 
Adrenal suppression and growth retardation after injection of periocular capillary hemangioma with corticosteroids. Adrenal suppression and/or growth retardation were noted in two patients after injection of periocular capillary hemangiomas with corticosteroids. Parents should be warned of these two potential complications of intralesional corticosteroid therapy. Baseline and posttreatment adrenal function should be monitored. If iatrogenic adrenal suppression occurs, supplemental systemic corticosteroids may be necessary in situations involving systemic stress such as infection or surgery. 
Trigeminal neuralgia secondary to tumor with normal exam, responsive to carbamazepine. Trigeminal neuralgia is most commonly idiopathic, although it can be associated with multiple sclerosis. Tumors are rare causes of trigeminal neuralgia. A case is presented of trigeminal neuralgia with normal neurological examination and responsive to carbamazepine, secondary to a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Literature relative to neoplastic etiologies of trigeminal neuralgia is reviewed. The role of electrodiagnostic testing in the evaluation of trigeminal neuralgia is considered. A normal neurological examination and responsiveness to carbamazepine do not exclude tumor as an etiology of trigeminal neuralgia. 
Is laterality important in neck node metastases in head and neck cancer? We present a series of 2219 previously untreated squamous carcinomas of the head and neck, 141 (6.5%) of whom had bilateral nodes at presentation. Bilateral nodes became progressively less common with increasing age but were not related to other host factors. They were also strongly related to the site of the primary tumour, its T-stage and its histological grade, being more common in tumours of the oro or naso-pharynx, in poorly or moderately differentiated tumours, and in tumour stages T3 or T4 at presentation. There were also interactions between these tumour factors, and patients with all three factors had a 25% incidence of bilateral nodes. 126 of these patients could be matched for the main prognostic factors with 126 patients with unilateral neck node disease. The survival rate of the latter group was 9% better than that of the unilateral group. Further breakdown showed that the survival of patients with nodes smaller than 6 cm is not affected by laterality, whereas it is for patients with massive nodes. 
Comparison of accuracy of transesophageal versus transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of mitral valve prolapse with ruptured chordae tendineae (flail mitral leaflet). The accuracy of transesophageal echocardiography was compared with that of transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of ruptured chordae tendineae (flail mitral leaflet) in 27 patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) who underwent valve repair or replacement for mitral regurgitation. Confirmation of the presence of ruptured chordae resulting in a flail leaflet was available at surgery in all cases. The echocardiographic studies were read blindly by 2 independent observers with any differences resolved by a third. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 63 +/- 13 years. Men (n = 20) outnumbered women (n = 7) (p less than 0.02), and tended to be younger (p = 0.06). Flail leaflets were identified in 20 of 27 patients. In 1 patient, both leaflets were involved and in the remaining 19 patients posterior leaflets (15 patients) were more frequently affected than anterior leaflets (4 patients). Transesophageal echocardiography correctly identified all 20 patients with flail leaflets, but 1 false positive study occurred among the 7 patients without a flail leaflet. In contrast, transthoracic echocardiography identified only 12 of 20 patients with flail leaflets, with no false positive studies. Transesophageal echocardiography was more accurate, correctly classifying 26 of 27 (96%) cases versus 19 of 27 (70%) by the transthoracic approach (p less than 0.01). This study suggests a higher incidence of chordal rupture to the posterior leaflet in patients with MVP and demonstrates improved accuracy of transesophageal over transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of flail leaflets. 
Carcinoma and DNA aneuploidy in Crohn's colitis--a histological and flow cytometric study. Twenty four patients with longstanding colonic Crohn's disease were examined prospectively with colonoscopy and multiple biopsy sampling in order to detect histological dysplasia or abnormal aneuploid DNA content, or both. Biopsy specimens were taken from 10 predetermined locations in the colon and rectum. No patient had definite dysplasia but three displayed DNA aneuploidy (12.5%), and one of these subsequently developed a carcinoma (Dukes' C at operation) in the ascending colon. No concomitant dysplasia was detected but the carcinoma as well as other parts of the mucosa were DNA aneuploid. It is concluded that dysplasia is rare in patients with Crohn's colitis, but findings of DNA aneuploidy warrant vigilance in follow up as this may indicate impending carcinoma. Further prospective studies are needed before the predictive value of DNA aneuploidy can be determined and before general recommendations of colonoscopic surveillance, as in longstanding ulcerative colitis, can be made. 
Quality of life after bypass surgery for unstable angina. 5-year follow-up results of a Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study To assess the effect of bypass surgery on outcome from unstable angina, 468 patients were randomized to medical treatment (237 patients) or surgery plus medical treatment (231 patients) and have been followed for comparison of survival, cardiac end points, and quality of life; the latter end point is discussed in the present report. Data were available at 3 and 5 years for 80% and 82% of patients in the medical group, respectively, and 77% and 80% of patients in the surgery group, respectively. At 3 months after randomization to therapy, 79.8% of patients in the surgery group reported subjective improvement, compared with 58% of the medical group, 12.6% of the surgery group reported no change compared with 24.5% of the medical group, and 5.5% of the surgery group reported worsening compared with 24.5% of the medical group (p less than 0.01 by chi 2). Similar data were found for chest pain status, and the benefit to the surgery group remained statistically significant through 5 years of follow-up. Crossover rate to surgery was 43% by 5 years. Treadmill duration was increased in the surgery group compared with the medical group (6.5 +/- 0.25 versus 5.3 +/- 0.25 minutes at 6 months, p less than 0.01), and a significant difference was again demonstrated at 3 and 5 years. A trend toward decreased recurrence of unstable angina was present in the surgery group at 1 year (six of 168 [3.6%] versus 13 of 187 [6.9%] in the medical group, p = 0.158), but the two groups were similar at 3 and 5 years. 
Nutritional assessment of patients with extended left ventricular assist device support. The nutritional status of nine patients with end-stage heart disease who were supported by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for more than 30 days while awaiting cardiac transplantation was evaluated. Nutritional status was indicated by the following scale: 0-2, adequate nourishment; 3-5, moderate malnourishment; greater than 5, severe malnourishment. This scale was based on serial assessments of albumin, transferrin, total lymphocyte count, percentage of ideal body weight, midarm circumference, triceps skinfold, and arm muscle circumference. Each variable was compared with established standards before implantation and before transplantation times and assessed 1 point if less than the normal value and 0 points if within the normal range. At the time of LVAD implantation, 5 patients had a score of 0-2, 3 patients had a score of 3-5, and 1 patient had a score greater than 5. At the time of cardiac transplantation, 7 patients had a score of 0-2, 2 patients had a score of 3-5, and no patients had a score greater than 5. The patients who were able to meet at least 50% of their daily caloric and protein requirements by oral intake alone were noted. At LVAD implantation, only 2 patients (22%) met this requirement; however, 6 patients (67%) met this requirement at the time of cardiac transplantation. All 9 patients underwent cardiac transplantation, and 8 survived. Thus, it appears that extended LVAD support and maintenance of hemodynamic stability allow patients to regain the desire and ability to achieve adequate nutritional status, which may considerably reduce their perioperative transplant risks. 
The origin of symptoms on the brain-gut axis in functional dyspepsia. It was hypothesized that symptoms in functional dyspepsia are originated by an altered mechanism at the brain-gut axis (one or several) in the process of gastric accommodation to a meal. To test the key mechanisms potentially involved in symptomatic gastric accommodation, the sensorial responses (on a 0-10 perception score) and the gastric tone responses (by electronic barostat) to either gastric accommodation (n = 10) or to cold stress (n = 10) were measured in 20 patients with functional dyspepsia and 20 healthy controls. The mechanical accommodation of the stomach to gastric distention (compliance) was similar in patients (52 +/- 8 mL/mm Hg) and controls (57 +/- 6 mL/mm Hg). However, isobaric gastric distention elicited more upper abdominal discomfort in dyspeptics than in controls (perception scores, 4.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.5, respectively; mean +/- SE; P less than 0.005). Cold stress induced a similar gastric relaxatory response in dyspeptics and controls (delta vol, 145 mL +/- 40 mL vs. 141 mL +/- 42 mL, respectively); hand perception (scores, 8.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.4, respectively) and autonomic responses were also similar. It is concluded that an abnormal afferent sensorial pathway (altered gastric perception) may be a major mechanism of symptom production in functional dyspepsia. 
Electrogram patterns predictive of successful catheter ablation of accessory pathways. Value of unipolar recording mode. BACKGROUND. Transcatheter electrical ablation has been used in the treatment of arrhythmias, and most experience has been obtained by ablating the normal atrioventricular conduction system. Less information is available on ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathways. METHODS AND RESULTS. Catheter ablation of overt accessory pathways was attempted in 135 patients with 142 distinct pathways, including 21 right parietal or anteroseptal, 47 posteroseptal, and 74 left lateral pathways. We sought to identify the type and value of electrophysiological parameters associated with successful ablation outcome. For this purpose, the unipolar recording mode was used in addition to bipolar anterograde and retrograde parameters. With a mean follow-up of 16 +/- 6 (mean +/- SD) months, fulguration was successful in eliminating preexcitation in 129 patients (96%), including all seven with two distinct accessory pathways. The first ablation attempt was successful in 110 patients, and two or more attempts were performed in 25 patients. Bipolar electrograms associated with success of fulguration showed a shorter atrioventricular conduction time (40 +/- 13 versus 53 +/- 17 msec, p less than 0.0001) and an earlier main ventricular deflection relative to delta wave onset (-1.7 +/- 10 versus 5 +/- 7 msec, p less than 0.001) than electrograms associated with unsuccessful outcome. The only parameter dealing with retrograde conduction (i.e., ventriculoatrial conduction time during reciprocating tachycardia) was not predictive (86 +/- 17 versus 93 +/- 17 msec). Neither was the atrial to ventricular electrogram amplitude ratio. Two unipolar parameters were found to be predictive of successful outcome: 1) The three different patterns PQS, P-QS, P-rS of unipolar waves recorded at the annulus were associated with respective success rates of 97%, 78%, and 55% (p less than 0.001). 2) Intrinsic deflection timing occurred -4 +/- 8 and 6 +/- 7 msec relative to delta wave onset in successful attempts and in failures, respectively (p less than 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed a single independent factor predictive of success, the unipolar pattern (p = 0.03), with an odds ratio of 7:1 (PQS pattern versus P-rS pattern). In the group of 18 patients who underwent a first unsuccessful but second successful attempt, comparison of electrograms revealed no difference in the ventriculoatrial conduction time but a significant improvement in anterograde parameters and unipolar pattern distribution. CONCLUSIONS. Some distinctive electrogram patterns concerning anterograde conduction are associated with success of accessory pathway fulguration. The unfiltered unipolar recording mode (PQS pattern) contributes significantly to optimizing the accuracy of accessory pathway localization. 
A prospective study of cholesterol, apolipoproteins, and the risk of myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. The independent contributions of subfractions of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL2 and HDL3) and apolipoproteins in predicting the risk of myocardial infarction are unclear. Prospective data are sparse, but HDL2 is widely believed to be a more important predictor than HDL3. METHODS. Blood samples were collected at base line from 14,916 men (ages, 40 to 84 years) who were participants in the Physicians' Health Study. After five years of follow-up, plasma samples from 246 men with new myocardial infarction (case subjects) were analyzed together with specimens from 246 men matched to them for age and smoking status who had not had a myocardial infarction. RESULTS. The levels of total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B-100 were significantly associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (data on levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were unavailable). Both HDL cholesterol and HDL2 levels were associated with a substantially decreased risk of myocardial infarction, but the HDL3 level was the strongest predictor; the relative risk was 0.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.6) for those in the fifth of the group with the highest HDL3 levels, as compared with the fifth with the lowest levels. The benefit of a higher HDL cholesterol level was most pronounced among those with lower total cholesterol levels. Levels of apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-II were also associated with decreased risk. However, the levels of HDL subfractions and apolipoproteins did not add significantly to the value of a multivariate model that included the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol in predicting myocardial infarction, whereas that ratio remained a significant independent predictor of risk. After adjustment for other risk factors, a change of one unit in the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol was associated with a 53 percent change in risk (95 percent confidence interval, 26 percent to 85 percent). CONCLUSIONS. This study underscores the importance of HDL cholesterol in predicting the risk of myocardial infarction and demonstrates protective effects of both the HDL3 and HDL2 subfractions of HDL cholesterol. We found little or no predictive value for the levels of apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, and B or HDL subfractions after conventional risk factors and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol were considered. 
The effect of streptokinase on chest pain in acute myocardial infarction. Treatment with intravenous streptokinase is known to restore blood flow to the ischaemic myocardium in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, little is known about its effect on chest pain. In a retrospective cohort study, 76 patients treated with streptokinase were compared to 76 patients not treated with streptokinase. All patients had acute myocardial infarction and less than 6 h of cardiac symptoms. Patients treated with streptokinase had a significantly lower need for nicomorphine (median 20 mg) than patients not treated with streptokinase (median 41 mg). Correspondingly, the median duration (3.5 h) of pain was reduced significantly in patients treated with streptokinase compared to patients not treated (24 h). We conclude that intravenous streptokinase given in the acute phase of myocardial infarction is effective in reducing the duration of cardiac chest pain. 
Tumor induction in a rat model for ureterosigmoidostomy without evidence of nitrosamine formation. Twenty rats were randomized into a vesicosigmoidostomy and an unoperated control group. In both groups the 24 hour excretion of secondary amines, nitrate, nitrite and nitrosamines was measured before and after gavage of proline and nitrate, piperazine and nitrate, N-nitrosoproline, mono-N-nitrosopiperazine. The urinary nitrosamine concentrations were not significantly different between both groups neither before nor after application of the several substances. Thirty rats were randomized into two vesicosigmoidostomy groups with and without antibiotic coverage and an unoperated control group. After ligation of distal rectum and mesosigmoid the rectosigmoids were removed. No significant concentrations of volatile nitrosamines could be measured in the rectosigmoid contents of the three groups. One hundred and twenty rats randomized into three groups following vesicosigmoidostomy received the potential nitrosamine antidotes sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate or sodiumpentosan-polysulfate or acted as controls. 12/118 (10.2%) developed adenomas and 25/118 (21.2%) adenocarcinomas at the vesico-colonic anastomosis with no significant differences between the three groups concerning tumor incidence or mortality. The results show that colon carcinomas occur in a rat model for ureterosigmoidostomy without evidence for thus induced nitrosamine formation. This and the missing effect of nitrosamine antidotes suggest that other factors than nitrosation must be responsible for colon carcinogenesis following urinary diversion via intestine. 
The role of serotonin-1A receptor activation and alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade in the hypotensive effect of 5-methyl-urapidil. Our study had three purposes: 1) to determine whether 5-methyl-urapidil, topically applied to the ventrolateral medulla, produces hypotension by activating serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptors, 2) to determine whether 5-methyl-urapidil given i.v. produces hypotension in part by activating 5-HT1A receptors in the ventrolateral medulla, and 3) to determine the specific site within the ventrolateral medulla where 5-methyl-urapidil elicits a hypotensive response. In terms of the first purpose, 5-methyl-urapidil applied bilaterally to the intermediate area of the ventral surface of the medulla (1.2 micrograms/side) of chloralose-anesthetized cats produced a decrease in mean arterial pressure of -39 +/- 4 mm Hg (N = 8). Prior blockade of 5-HT1A receptors at this site with bilateral application of spiperone (30 micrograms/side) prevented the hypotensive effect of 5-methyl-urapidil (mean blood pressure now increased by 5 +/- 4 mm Hg). Pretreatment with the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, did not prevent the hypotensive effect of 5-methyl-urapidil. In terms of the second purpose, spiperone applied bilaterally to the ventral surface of the medulla counteracted a significant portion of the hypotensive effect of 5-methyl-urapidil given by the i.v. route. The dose of 5-methyl-urapidil given intravenously was below the dose that produces alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade. In terms of the third purpose, microinjection of 5-methyl-urapidil into central nervous system sites associated with the intermediate area was found to have its greatest hypotensive effect at the subretrofacial nucleus. Mean arterial pressure decreased by 74 +/- 14 mm Hg (N = 3) after bilateral microinjection of 25 ng of the drug. 
Initial staging of non-small cell lung cancer: value of routine radioisotope bone scanning. The exclusion of bone metastases is important in the initial staging of non-small cell lung cancer, though there is debate about whether bone scans should be performed routinely or restricted to patients who present with clinical or laboratory indicators suggesting skeletal metastases. In a prospective study of 110 consecutive patients referred for initial staging of non-small cell lung cancer, we assessed the sensitivity of a group of clinical indicators (chest pain, skeletal pain, bone tenderness on physical examination, serum alkaline phosphatase, and serum calcium) for the presence of skeletal metastases as determined by bone scanning. The final staging result was validated with follow up data over at least three years. At the initial staging 37 of 110 bone scans (34%) showed areas of increased uptake, of which only nine were confirmed to be metastases (by tomography, computed tomography, or biopsy). Half the patients (55) had at least one clinical indicator suggesting skeletal metastases, including all patients with proved skeletal metastases. Thus the sensitivity of these clinical indicators was 100% and the specificity 54%. Within one year three of 27 patients with non-confirmed positive bone scans had skeletal metastases, one of which was in the area that had shown increased uptake initially. All these patients had clinical indicators for skeletal metastases and all had inoperable advanced tumours. Four of 69 patients with an initially negative bone scan developed skeletal metastases within one year. It is concluded that in non-small cell lung cancer bone scanning can be restricted to patients with clinical indicators for skeletal metastases. This approach reduces the number of bone scans and consecutive investigations without loss of sensitivity in the detection of skeletal metastases. 
FK 506 ameliorates the hepatic injury associated with ischemia and reperfusion in rats. The effect of FK 506 on regeneration of the liver was studied in rats after a two-thirds partial hepatectomy after 60 min of ischemia of the unresected liver. The animals were divided into three distinct groups of 10 rats each. Group 1 (controls) received 0.5 ml saline solution intravenously 30 min after the induction of ischemia. Groups 2 and 3 were injected with FK 506 (0.3 mg/kg) intravenously 30 min after and 24 min before the induction of hepatic ischemia, respectively. The hepatic content of ATP and serum levels of ALT and lactate dehydrogenase were determined on each animal. In addition, the histological appearance and mitotic activity of the remnant liver was determined at regular 24-hr intervals after hepatic ischemia. All 10 control animals died within 72 hr. Treatment with FK 506 resulted in improved survival in groups 2 and 3 (30% and 80%, respectively). The improved survival seen in the FK 506-treated animals was reflected by a restoration of hepatic ATP content, a reduction in the serum levels of ALT and lactate dehydrogenase, an amelioration of hepatic necrosis and neutrophilic infiltration and an increase in the mitotic activity of the liver. These results suggest that FK 506 ameliorates the hepatic injury associated with ischemia/reperfusion and has a potent stimulatory effect on liver cell regeneration that may make it valuable as a hepatoprotective agent when administered to organ donors before graft harvesting. 
Natural history of indeterminate colitis. The long-term outcome of patients with a pathological diagnosis of indeterminate colitis on a colectomy specimen was investigated. The case records of 46 such patients operated on for inflammatory bowel disease between 1960 and 1983 were reviewed. Using the preoperative clinical information, pathological and radiological reports, it was possible to divide the patients into three groups: group 1, probable Crohn's disease (19 cases); group 2, probable ulcerative colitis (11 cases); and group 3, indeterminate colitis (16 cases). The patients were followed for a minimum of 2.5 years (median 10, range 2.5-28 years). During this period the probable diagnosis changed in five cases only. One patient in group 1 (Crohn's disease) was subsequently considered to have ulcerative colitis (group 2). The other four patients were all in group 3. Three were reclassified as ulcerative colitis and the fourth as Crohn's disease on the finding of a single granuloma in a rectal biopsy. No case in group 3 required subsequent small bowel surgery. These data suggest that patients continuing with a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis in spite of careful preoperative and postoperative assessment are unlikely to show features of Crohn's disease in the long term. This may be important when considering a subsequent restorative proctectomy. 
Ventricular tachycardia originating from the right ventricular free wall in a patient with an old myocardial infarction. A 64-year-old woman with right ventricular infarction had ventricular tachycardia (VT) with left bundle-branch block morphology. Pace-mapping during sinus rhythm and the earliest ventricular potential during VT suggested that the VT originated in the inflow-inferior site of the right ventricular free wall. 
Autonomic nervous dysfunction in essential hypertension. Borderline hypertension, a condition in which the blood pressure oscillates between normal and high values, is a predictor of future more severe hypertension. Pathophysiologically, borderline hypertension is different from established hypertension. A large proportion of such patients have elevated cardiac output and a normal vascular resistance. In established hypertension, the output is normal and resistance is elevated. The elevation of cardiac output in borderline hypertension is neurogenic; it can be abolished by an autonomic blockade of the heart. In addition to an increased cardiac sympathetic drive, increased sympathetic tone to the kidney, arterioles, and veins has also been found. In parallel with the hypersympathetic state, patients with borderline hypertension also show decreased parasympathetic tone. The enhanced sympathetic tone leads to a decreased cardiac responsiveness, and eventually, the cardiac output returns to the normal range. High blood pressure causes vascular hypertrophy, and hypertrophic vessels are hyperresponsive to vasoconstriction. These secondary changes in the responsiveness of the heart and blood vessels are the basis of transition from a high cardiac output to high-resistance hypertension. These hemodynamic changes are associated with a downregulation of the sympathetic tone. A picture of an apparently nonneurogenic high-resistance hypertension emerges. Nevertheless, when assessed in regard to the enhanced pressor responsiveness, the sympathetic drive in such patients is still excessive. Despite the apparently normal tone, the sympathetic nervous system continues to play an important pathophysiological role in established hypertension. Borderline hypertension is associated with numerous metabolic abnormalities including obesity and insulin resistance. It is tempting to view all these abnormalities as a common expression of the increased sympathetic drive in hypertension. Explanation of the basis of the association of hypertension and metabolic abnormalities promises to bring new insights into the pathophysiology of two common diseases of civilization: hypertension and diabetes mellitus. 
The Western Washington Myocardial Infarction Registry and Emergency Department Tissue Plasminogen Activator Treatment Trial. This study comprised a registry and an emergency department treatment trial using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. During 1 year, 1,028 patients with documented acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were evaluated for eligibility for thrombolytic therapy. Of these, 221 patients (22%) were eligible for thrombolytic therapy under currently accepted criteria, 175 (79%) of them were correctly identified by emergency department physicians for thrombolytic therapy, and 160 were enrolled in the trial. Only 3 patients (2%) enrolled by emergency department physicians did not subsequently evolve documented AMI. In all, 807 patients (78%) were ineligible for thrombolytic therapy: 335 (33%) because of greater than or equal to 1 contraindications, 364 (36%) because of nondiagnostic electrocardiograms on presentation, and 105 (10%) because of age greater than 75 years, or greater than 6 hours of chest pain at presentation, or both. Mortality in treated patients at 14 days was 5.6%, and survival at 1 year was 92%. The mean time from hospital arrival to thrombolytic treatment was 55 +/- 27 minutes. Initial management of AMI with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the emergency department provided rapid and safe treatment comparable to that reported in trials that started treatment in the coronary care unit. The proportions of eligible patients could be increased from 1 in 5 to 1 in 3, if patients currently excluded only because of age greater than 75 years or because of greater than 6 hours of chest pain were offered treatment. 
Liver viability after ischemia-reperfusion. Lack of a reproducible model to quantitatively assess hepatocellular injury following ischemia has made it difficult to assess new strategies for minimizing hepatic injury. We studied the progression of hepatocellular injury after ischemia and ischemia with reperfusion in rats. Irreversible injury was quantitated using a triphenyltetrazolium chloride assay that was shown to correlate with ultrastructural changes. Adenosine triphosphate decreased to 36% of basal values after 30 minutes, but returned to normal with reperfusion with no decrease in viability. In contrast, viability fell by 30% after 60 minutes of ischemia, and by 64% when 60 minutes of ischemia was followed by reperfusion. We conclude that reperfusion of ischemic liver increases the degree of irreversible damage. The model employed here seems to be useful for studying ischemic and reperfusion injury in the liver. 
Assessment of systolic thickening with thallium-201 ECG-gated single-photon emission computed tomography: a parameter for local left ventricular function. We measured left ventricular (LV) systolic thickening expressed as a systolic thickening ratio in 28 patients, using 201Tl ECG-gated SPECT. Five normals, 15 patients with prior myocardial infarction, 5 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 3 with dilated cardiomyopathy were studied. The systolic thickening ratio was calculated as [(end-systolic--end-diastolic pixel counts) divided by end-diastolic pixel counts], using the circumferential profile technique of both end-diastolic and end-systolic short axial images. Functional images of the systolic thickening ratio were also displayed with the "bull's-eye" method. The mean systolic thickening ratio thus calculated were as follows: normals, 0.53 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- 1 s.d.); non-transmural prior myocardial infarction, 0.33 +/- 0.09; transmural prior myocardial infarction, 0.14 +/- 0.05; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in relatively nonhypertrophied areas, 0.56 +/- 0.11; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in hypertrophied areas, 0.23 +/- 0.07; and dilated cardiomyopathy, 0.19 +/- 0.02. The systolic thickening ratio analysis by gated thallium SPECT offers a unique approach for assessing LV function. 
Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic correlation of dipyridamole-thallium stress testing with isometric handgrip. To determine how frequently new wall-motion abnormalities that are indicative of ischemia accompany thallium redistribution, 47 consecutive patients underwent two-dimensional echocardiography during routine dipyridamole-thallium stress testing. A secondary aim of the study was to determine whether the addition of isometric handgrip exercises to the standard dipyridamole imaging protocol increased the frequency of wall-motion abnormalities or thallium redistribution. Echocardiograms and thallium scans were independently interpreted, and wall-motion abnormalities that appeared with dipyridamole, handgrip exercise, or both were compared with results of thallium imaging. Five of 24 patients with thallium redistribution had new wall-motion abnormalities, and the extent (number of segments) of thallium redistribution in these five patients was significantly greater than in those who did not have well-motion abnormalities (p less than 0.03). The addition of isometric handgrip exercises to the imaging protocol did not distinguish between patients with and without new wall-motion abnormalities or thallium redistribution. Thus new wall-motion abnormalities infrequently accompany thallium redistribution in routine dipyridamole stress testing in spite of the addition of handgrip exercises, but when new wall-motion abnormalities are present, they are associated with a greater area of thallium redistribution. 
An increased number of gamma/delta T-cells and gastric epithelial cell expression of the groEL stress-protein homologue in Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis of the antrum. Numerous studies have shown that the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the stomach is linked to the development of chronic gastritis most commonly seen in the antrum. However, the pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. In 23 of 31 patients, examined due to symptoms from the upper gastrointestinal tract, H. pylori-associated chronic gastritis of the antrum was diagnosed histologically and by growth of H. pylori. Immunoperoxidase staining on gastric biopsy specimens from these patients showed an increased number of gamma/delta T-cells within the epithelium. Furthermore, the Mab ML30 (raised against the 65 kDa heat shock protein of mycobacteria) demonstrated positive staining in the gastric epithelial cells in all H. pylori-positive but not in H. pylori-negative biopsy specimens. H. pylori also reacted with ML30, as detected by immunoperoxidase staining as well as by immunoblotting. Intraepithelial gamma/delta T cells may play a role in host defense against invading H. pylori, and the bacteria may trigger an autoimmune response to stress proteins expressed by the gastric epithelial cells. 
Endoscopic sonography of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic sonography was used to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract of 550 patients referred for evaluation of abnormal findings seen on conventional endoscopy, upper gastrointestinal series, and CT. This essay illustrates the potential uses and limitations of this technique. Special emphasis has been given to the use of landmarks to facilitate orientation of the transducer in both the esophagus and stomach. Specific examples demonstrate involvement of individual layers of the bowel wall in both benign and malignant processes. It is stressed that this is a combined procedure requiring both an endoscopist and a radiologist. Endoscopic sonography is a valuable new technology with substantial potential in the evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract. 
Effects of lidocaine on reperfusion arrhythmias and electrophysiological properties in an isolated ventricular muscle model of ischemia and reperfusion. Transmembrane electrical activity was recorded from endo- and epicardium of isolated segments of guinea pig right ventricles with standard microelectrode techniques. An ECG was also recorded by two electrodes placed at opposite ends of the tissue bath. Regular stimulation was delivered to the endocardium. Tissues were exposed to simulated ischemia for 15 min and then were reperfused with "normal" Tyrode's solution. Rapid sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy or trigeminy with characteristics of transmural reentry occurred in early reperfusion in 14 of 20 hearts (70%). Arrhythmias were accompanied by prolongation of transmural conduction time and abbreviation of endocardial effective refractory period. With lidocaine, at 1, 5, 10 and 50 microM, reperfusion arrhythmias occurred in 53.3, 22.2, 20.8 and 14.3% of hearts, respectively. The decreased incidence of arrhythmias was statistically significant for 5 to 50 microM lidocaine (P less than .01). The antiarrhythmic effect did not correlate with changes in transmural conduction time, endocardial effective refractory period, or endocardial excitability. However, antiarrhythmic concentrations of lidocaine selectively depressed epicardial excitability and significantly increased endo- to epicardial conduction block during late ischemic and early reperfusion periods. Epicardial inexcitability extended to late diastole and conduction block was not restricted to premature beats. Thus, in transmural reentry in which the epicardium is an essential component of the circuit, lidocaine may interrupt the circuit by selectively rendering this component inexcitable. 
Intermittent pneumatic compression versus coumadin. Prevention of deep vein thrombosis in lower-extremity total joint arthroplasty. One hundred forty-nine consecutive patients requiring lower extremity total joint arthroplasty were randomized to either coumadin (52 patients) or intermittent pneumatic compression (48 patients) as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Forty-nine patients were excluded. When fully ambulatory, the presence or absence of DVT was diagnosed by ascending venography (90% of patients), nuclear venography, venous dopplers, or impedence plethysmography. The two groups were similar in average age (64 years), indication for arthroplasty (pain because of arthritis in 90%), gender (98% male), and average number of risk factors (2.4). Twenty-five percent of patients on coumadin and 25% of patients on intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) developed DVT. IPC was more effective than coumadin following primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) (16% versus 24% incidence DVT); coumadin was more effective than IPC following primary total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) (19% versus 32% incidence of DVT). DVT developed in 36% of patients following revision arthroplasty. Seventy-five percent of all thrombi were proximal. Both IPC and coumadin were found to be safe; there was no increased perioperative bleeding in the coumadin group. Of three postoperative deaths, one was possibly due to pulmonary embolism (PE). 
Cerebral hyperemia during spontaneous cluster headaches with excessive cerebral vasoconstriction to hyperoxia. Values for local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) were measured in three dimensions utilizing xenon enhanced computerized tomography among patients during spontaneously occurring cluster headaches, during headache-free intervals and immediately after terminating attacks by inhalation of 100% oxygen. Results were compared with values measured among age-matched normal volunteers. LCBF values measured in five cluster patients while headache-free did not differ from similar measures among age-matched normal volunteers. In three patients during attacks of spontaneously occurring cluster headache, LCBF values for temporal cortex, basal ganglia and subcortical white matter were increased. Immediately after terminating attacks of cluster by 100% oxygen inhalation for five minutes, LCBF values for temporal cortex and basal ganglia became significantly decreased below normal values in five patients with spontaneously occurring cluster headache. Prompt relief of head pain by inhalation of 100% oxygen is associated with abolition of the hyperperfusion of both cortical and subcortical brain structures that occurs during spontaneously occurring cluster headaches and is followed by excessive cerebrovascular constriction. It remains to be determined whether the cerebral hyperemia occurring during cluster headaches is causally related to the head pain or is secondary to the pain itself. Rapid termination of head pain by hyperoxia associated with excessive cerebral vasoconstriction suggests that this vascular phenomenon is unique to cluster headache and offers clues to its pathogenesis. 
Characterization of severely and profoundly hearing impaired adults attending an audiology clinic. Despite the fact that around 12 per cent of adult patients attending an audiology department will be severely hearing impaired (pure tone averages of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz of 70 dB HL or worse in the better hearing ear), their clinical and audiometric characteristics have not been well documented. These characteristics were collected prospectively in 132 adult patients attending a Severe Impairment Clinic, set up to manage their specific problems. The inability to provide sufficient masking makes audiometric assessment of the severity of the impairment uncertain in the poorer hearing ear in 52 per cent of these patients. In addition, the limited bone conduction output makes it almost invariably impossible to assess the masked bone conduction thresholds and hence the air-bone gap in the poorer ear. Hence, accurate characterization is only practical of the better hearing ear in such patients. In 67 per cent of the better hearing ears, there was a mixed hearing impairment, the air-bone gap being 20 dB or greater. The aetiology of the conductive component was almost equally otosclerosis and chronic otitis media. In only 19 per cent was the impairment of a pure sensorineural type, broken down as 6 per cent congenitally acquired, 5 per cent due to meningitis and 9 per cent being adult in onset. In the remaining 14 per cent of patients the type of impairment could not be classified as the bone conductive thresholds were off scale. Having had experience of managing these patients at a special clinic and knowing the workload involved, it is argued that consideration be given to setting up such clinics in most departments. 
An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 colitis associated with consumption of precooked meat patties. An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 hemorrhagic colitis at a Minnesota junior high school in October 1988 comprised 32 cases among 1562 students (attack rate, 2.0%). Four children were hospitalized; none developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Case children were more likely than controls to have eaten heat-processed meat patties (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-20.1; P less than .001) in the school cafeteria on a specific day. The minimum estimated attack rate among students who ate these patties was 8%. The patties should have been sufficiently cooked by the manufacturer to destroy enteric pathogens before they were frozen and distributed. E. coli were cultured from frozen patties that were manufactured at the same plant on the same dates as the implicated patties, but serotype O157:H7 was not isolated. Heat-processed meat patties may serve as vehicles for E. coli O157:H7 infection, and currently there are no federal or state regulatory standards to ensure the safety of these products. 
Platelet-activating factor (PAF) stimulates the production of PAF acetylhydrolase by the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. The human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, secreted an activity that degrades platelet-activating factor (PAF) by the hydrolysis of the sn-2 acetyl group. This activity was Ca++ independent, inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate but not by p-bromophenacyl bromide, and resistant to treatment with trypsin or pronase. Separation of HepG2-conditioned medium by gel filtration disclosed that the activity was associated with lipoproteins. An antiserum against PAF acetylhydrolase immunoprecipitated this activity. It was not recognized by an antibody against lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which also is secreted by HepG2 cells. Therefore the phospholipase A2 activity of LCAT was excluded as a source of the observed activity. PAF added to the culture medium stimulated the secretion of the PAF-degrading activity by HepG2 cells, while lyso-PAF was inactive. Maximal stimulation was observed with 5 ng/ml PAF, which induced a fivefold increase. The presence of 5 ng/ml PAF, enhanced the secretion of [35S]methionine-labeled PAF acetylhydrolase and cycloheximide inhibited both the basal and PAF-stimulated secretion of the labeled enzyme. We conclude that HepG2 cells produce PAF acetylhydrolase. The liver may be a major source of plasma PAF acetylhydrolase, and PAF may induce the production of its inactivating enzyme by the liver. 
Prognosis in familial non-polyposis colorectal cancer. Familial cases of non-polyposis colorectal cancer have attracted much interest but little is known of their natural history. Using a population based study we have determined whether a positive family history of bowel cancer is an independent prognostic factor. All patients under 55 years with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer in Northern Ireland during the period 1976-8 were studied. The family history was validated in 95% of all nonpolyposis cases (n = 205). Medical history or cause of death were verified for 98% of 1811 first degree relatives. The strength of the family history was assessed using a score that compares the mortality from bowel cancer in the family against the average population mortality, taking account of family size and age structure. The family history score was not predictive of survival neither in univariate analysis or in a Cox's proportional hazards multivariate analysis controlling for age, sex, stage, site, and duration of symptoms. In conclusion, a positive family history does not independently influence prognosis in patients with bowel cancer. 
Nephrogenic rests in Wilms tumor patients with the Drash syndrome. The histological specimens from 12 patients with the Drash syndrome were identified from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group and reviewed for the presence of nephrogenic rests. Of 7 patients with the complete Drash syndrome 6 were evaluable for nephrogenic rests, including 5 (83%) who demonstrated intralobar nephrogenic rests. Of 5 (80%) partial Drash syndrome cases 4 (80%) were also intralobar nephrogenic rest positive. Neither group had perilobar nephrogenic rests identified. In a control population of Wilms tumor patients without the Drash syndrome only 39 of 274 (14%) with unilateral tumor had intralobar nephrogenic rests identified, whereas 26 of 92 (28%) bilateral cases had intralobar nephrogenic rests. There was a significantly higher rate of intralobar nephrogenic rests in complete and partial Drash syndrome cases than in the general Wilms tumor population (p less than 0.001). Wilms tumor patients with intralobar nephrogenic rests and the Drash syndrome present at a younger age and have a higher rate of bilaterality than rest negative Wilms tumor patients. The strong association of intralobar nephrogenic rests in the Drash syndrome approaches that found in the aniridia complex. However, in other syndromes associated with Wilms tumor, such as the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and hemihypertrophy, there is a high prevalence of perilobar nephrogenic rests. In view of the high incidence of intralobar nephrogenic rests in complete and partial Drash syndrome patients, it is probable that events leading to Wilms tumor in patients with the Drash syndrome occur at an early stage in nephrogenesis. 
Carboxyhaemoglobin concentrations, pulse oximetry and arterial blood-gas tensions during jet ventilation for Nd-YAG laser bronchoscopy. Oxygen saturation measured with pulse oximetry (SpO2) is overestimated in the presence of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb). Smoke produced during laser resection of tracheobronchial malignancies may increase concentrations of COHb. We have measured COHb concentrations in 14 patients undergoing laser resection and compared SpO2 with functional oxygen saturation (SaO2) to ascertain if pulse oximetry is an accurate monitor of oxygen saturation. During the procedure frequent changes occur in ventilatory mechanics. Arterial blood-gas tensions were measured to see if gas exchange was satisfactory. Mean preoperative COHb was 1.4%. There was no significant change in COHb in any patient at any stage during treatment. The highest value was 2.05%. The mean difference between SaO2 and SpO2 was 1.13% (95% confidence interval 0.70-1.56%). Oxygen saturation may therefore safely be monitored by pulse oximetry in patients managed by our technique. Empirical setting of a jet ventilator provided acceptable blood-gas tensions, although sometimes it was necessary to increase the FlO2 to greater than 0.3 to maintain oxygenation. 
Immunologic abnormalities accompanying acute and chronic viral infections. A number of viral infections induce profound alterations in immune function; these changes may or may not be related to direct infection of lymphoid cells. The immunologic abnormalities that occur during acute systemic viral infections such as measles or infectious mononucleosis include suppression of responses to tuberculin skin tests in vivo and suppression of mitogen responses in vitro, evidence of activation of the immune system with up-regulation of activation-associated cell-surface markers and soluble cellular products, and evidence of altered immune regulation with autoimmune disease and elevated IgE. These abnormalities are likely to be interrelated and can become chronic when the viral infection is not cleared and persists. 
Children with pervasive refusal. Four children are described with a potentially life threatening condition manifested by profound and pervasive refusal to eat, drink, walk, talk, or care for themselves in any way over a period of several months. The multiplicity and severity of the symptoms in these children do not fit comfortably into any existing diagnostic category. Long term and highly skilled nursing and psychiatric care is required to help these children to recover. The possible causes of this syndrome are discussed. 
Optimal right ventricular filling pressures and the role of pericardial constraint in right ventricular infarction in dogs. BACKGROUND. Previous studies have reported an important role for right ventricular function in the pathophysiology of the low cardiac output state that can accompany right ventricular infarction. Some studies have suggested that right ventricular distensibility impairs right ventricular filling and stroke output; others have demonstrated that the pericardium can mediate depressed left ventricular filling and stroke output. METHODS AND RESULTS. To determine the role of pericardial constraint and optimal volume loading in an experimental model of right ventricular wall infarction, six mongrel dogs were studied before and after right ventricular wall infarction and after volume loading. The pericardium was then opened in two phases. In the first phase, the pericardium was opened partially to allow the atria to distend freely, and in the second phase, the pericardium was opened completely. The animals were preinstrumented with two sets of piezoelectric crystals attached to the right ventricular free wall, one in the infarct and the other in the noninfarct territory. Left ventricular size was estimated by left ventricular crystals on the anterior wall of the left ventricle. Right ventricular and left ventricular Millar catheters were used to assess intracavitary pressure, and a flat balloon was used to assess intrapericardial pressure. Right ventricular infarction reduced cardiac output by 23% and stroke volume by 30%. End-diastolic segment length and transmural pressure of the left ventricle decreased. Volume loading restored cardiac output to baseline values and was mediated by a significant increase in end-diastolic length in the noninfarct territory. This was achieved by increasing right ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 9 +/- 2 to 16 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Partial opening of the pericardium mediated significant increases in both end-diastolic segment lengths of the left ventricle and the noninfarct territory. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased slightly by 3 mm Hg (p = NS). Complete opening of the pericardium increased cardiac output and stroke volume and mediated a significant decrease in right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures. Left ventricular transmural pressure and end-diastolic segment lengths of the left ventricle and the noninfarct territory increased. Left ventricular diastolic pressure-segment length relations were shifted upward by right ventricular infarction. A partial opening of the pericardium shifted this relation downward in all animals, and complete opening of the pericardium shifted the relation rightward and further downward. CONCLUSIONS. Cardiac output is restored to baseline values by volume loading sufficient to increase the right ventricular diastolic pressure to 16 +/- 3 mm Hg. Evidence of pericardial constraint was observed and appears to be mediated by an atrioventricular interaction in addition to the direct ventricular interaction. 
Limb-sparing surgery in skeletally immature patients with osteosarcoma. The use of an expandable prosthesis. Limb-sparing surgery has a definite role in the treatment of osteosarcoma in children. Increased survival, however, raises problems of limb-length discrepancy and prosthetic longevity. The concept of an expandable adjustable prosthesis addresses the problem of leg-length discrepancy. The problem of prosthesis longevity will require further long-term evaluation of current designs and methods of fixation, as well as the development of a permanent prosthesis or biologic replacement. At skeletal maturity, the expandable prosthesis may either be maintained or substituted with another implant or biological alternative if warranted by the clinical situation. 
Peripheral arterial occlusion in infants--a report of two cases treated conservatively. The occlusion of major arteries in newborns is usually associated with catheterization of the umbilical vessels. It occurs very rarely instead as a primary disorder, and the cause is still unclear. We present two new cases of newborns with this type of disease, which were resolved with the only medical treatment. The literature is reviewed, and the usefulness of the different diagnostic procedures is discussed. 
Calcium channel autoantibodies in the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. We have tested 36 patients with the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome for serum antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels by using an immunoprecipitation assay with [125I] omega-conotoxin-labeled voltage-gated calcium channels extracted from a human neuroblastoma cell line, SKN-SH. Forty-four percent of these patients had significant levels of antibody (30-1,466 pM) compared with healthy control individuals (less than 15 pM). The incidence of positive sera in patients without associated small cell lung carcinoma (61%) was greater than in those patients with small cell lung carcinoma (28%). Results correlated strongly with results obtained using voltage-gated calcium channels extracted from the small cell lung carcinoma line, MAR5. Anti-voltage-gated calcium channel antibody titers did not correlate with disease severity across individuals, but longitudinal studies in 2 patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy showed a clear inverse relation between antibody titer and an electromyographic index of disease severity. The incidence of positive sera among patients with other neurological disorders was not significant, but 8 of 12 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus had raised titers (30-82 pM). We conclude that the antibodies detected in this assay are heterogeneous and that some of them are likely to be implicated in this disorder of neuromuscular transmission. The assay should prove useful as an additional diagnostic aid in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. 
Noninvasive diagnostic assessment of peripheral vascular disease. Noninvasive techniques have assumed an increasingly important role in the management of patients with vascular disease. Both ultrasonic and plethysmographic instruments allow objective evaluation of vascular disorders by the measurement of segmental limb blood pressures, analysis of blood velocity disturbances, recording of digit or limb pulse waveforms, or imaging of vascular disease, with or without Doppler flow analysis or color-flow mapping. These techniques have been applied for screening asymptomatic individuals, diagnosis of symptomatic patients, monitoring of interventional or surgical procedures, and follow-up of the natural history or the efficacy of medical, interventional, or surgical therapy of vascular disease. This article reviews the clinical application of these modalities to patients with peripheral arterial disease and briefly discusses cost-effectiveness and potential abuses of noninvasive technology. 
The role of radiology in evaluation of the failing renal transplantation. Renal allograft transplantation frequently is the optimal treatment for patients in renal failure. This review discusses the current status of renal transplantation, emphasizing the medical and surgical processes that can interfere with normal renal function. Although many insults to the renal allograft are nonspecific, a logical approach to the identification of the decrease in renal function and appropriate treatment can be suggested by some imaging procedures. 
Abnormalities of gastrointestinal motility in children with nonulcer dyspepsia and in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease. In 11 children (mean age 44.2 months) with symptoms suggesting upper intestinal dysfunction (nonulcer dyspepsia), in nine children (mean age 27.3 months) with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease, and in seven controls (mean age 20.4 months) we investigated fasting [for 3 hr or until two migrating motor complexes (MMC) were observed] and fed (90 min) antroduodenal motility by means of perfused catheter system; furthermore, we measured both gastric emptying of a radiolabeled milk formula and fasting duodenogastric reflux during manometry by assessing bile salt concentration in gastric aspirates. No structural abnormalities of gastrointestinal tract and organic disorders were detected in the patients. In a high proportion of both groups of patients we found manometric abnormalities of interdigestive and fed motor patterns that were not seen in the controls: absence of antral phase III of MMC; significant decrease of antral and/or duodenal motor activity during fasting and/or fed periods; abnormal propagation or configuration of MMC phase III that was significantly shorter than in controls; bursts of sustained fasting and/or fed phasic duodenal activity, frequently uncoordinated with adjacent gut segments. When compared to controls, the mean intragastric concentration of bile salts during all MMC phases and the mean 1-hr percent gastric activity of the radiolabeled milk were significantly higher in the two groups of patients. We conclude that in a high proportion of children with nonulcer dyspepsia and of children with GER disease, gastrointestinal manometry may reveal significant irregularities of antral and duodenal motility, which are associated with increased duodenogastric reflux and delayed gastric emptying. 
Interleukin 6 activity in infants and children with bacterial meningitis. The Collaborative Study on Meningitis. Concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of infants and children with bacterial meningitis were determined and correlations were sought with other indices of inflammation and with outcome. Forty-two patients ages 1 month to 15 years (mean, 2.5 years) were studied. IL-6 activity was detectable (greater than 50 units/ml) in 30 of 36 CSF samples collected at admission from patients with meningitis and in 1 of 23 controls with fever and normal CSF findings. Mean values were 36,000 units/ml (range, 151-156,000). IL-6 activity in CSF persisted during the first 5 days of illness. IL-6 concentrations at admission were not associated with clinical findings, CSF leukocyte, protein and glucose concentrations, serum C-reactive protein concentration and neurologic complications or sequelae. IL-6 was also detected in the serum of 3 of 14 patients with meningitis and in 0 of 7 controls with no infectious disease. The presence of IL-6 was not associated with bacteremia or with duration of fever before admission. The presence of IL-6 in the CSF of pediatric patients with bacterial meningitis is in accordance with available data on other cytokines and suggests their role as mediators of meningeal inflammation. 
Seasonal variation in growth during growth hormone therapy. Seasonal variation in growth of normal children has been well described, although the mechanism by which it occurs has not been elucidated. The growth of 52 growth hormone-deficient children treated with synthetic human growth hormone was analyzed. A similar seasonal variation was observed, with mean (+/- SEM) peak growth occurring in the summer (8.2 +/- 0.3 cm/y) and winter (7.7 +/- 0.2 cm/y), and trough growth occurring in the autumn (6.9 +/- 0.3 cm/y). Forty-seven percent of subjects grew minimally during the autumn, and only two children showed peak growth in that season. Individual variations between maximal and minimal growth seasons amounted to 3.5 +/- 0.3 cm/y. The seasonal pattern was statistically significant for the group as a whole, for the prepubertal subgroup, and for the boys. The variation persisted when the first year of treatment was excluded to avoid bias of the initial growth spurt. The season of onset of therapy did not affect total growth during the first year. The demonstration of a seasonal pattern in growth of these children suggests that the seasonal variation may be mediated by peripheral rather than central factors. Paired clonidine-provoked growth hormone levels and an integrated concentration of 24-hour growth hormone levels and serum levels of insulinlike growth hormone I measured in a control group of normally growing children were also analyzed and showed no seasonal variation. This further suggests that peripheral rather than central factors are responsible for the seasonal variation in children's growth. 
Erythropoietic protoporphyria: unusual skin and neurological problems after liver transplantation. The case of a woman with protoporphyria who developed liver failure and underwent liver transplantation is described. During the pretransplant episode of liver failure she developed quadriparesis that rapidly progressed after transplantation to a severe polyneuropathy. Following transplantation she also developed a second-degree burn of the light-exposed abdominal wall. The neuropathy resembled that observed in other forms of porphyria, and it is proposed that the extreme disturbance of protoporphyrin levels associated with protoporphyrin-induced liver failure caused this neuropathy. Such a neuropathy has not previously been described in protoporphyria. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels remain high and fecal levels normal, although results of liver tests are normal. She remains photosensitive, which emphasizes that although liver transplantation may be lifesaving in this disorder, it is not curative, and care must be taken to prevent photosensitive damage to skin and light-exposed internal organs. 
Clinical course of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in children Previous studies in adults with dilated cardiomyopathy suggest that the presence of arrhythmia, especially ventricular tachycardia, correlates with increased mortality. We performed a retrospective analysis of 63 children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to determine the prognostic significance of arrhythmias and other findings with respect to mortality. The mean age at diagnosis of the cardiomyopathy was 4.96 +/- 5.3 years. The overall mortality rate was 16% over a 10 year follow-up period. Persistent congestive heart failure and ST-T wave changes correlated with increased mortality (p less than 0.05). No other variables affected outcome. Arrhythmias were found in 46% of the patients; of the arrhythmias, 48% were atrial arrhythmias. Ventricular tachycardia was present in six patients. Death occurred in 4 (14%) of 29 patients with known arrhythmia; 1 of the 5 died suddenly. The remaining 6 deaths in the series occurred in the 34 patients without a documented arrhythmia. It is concluded that 1) arrhythmias are frequently seen in children with dilated cardiomyopathy but are not predictive of outcome; 2) sudden death in children with this disease is rare; and 3) persistent congestive heart failure portends a poor prognosis. 
Intrascrotal adenomatoid tumors. Adenomatoid tumors are regarded as uncommon neoplasms of the paratesticular tissues, probably of mesothelial origin. The majority of cases reported have involved the epididymis. We report our experience with 8 cases of testicular tumors and 11 of epididymal adenomatoid tumors during a 13-year period, and review the relevant literature. The incidence of adenomatoid tumors relative to all tumors in the testis was 6.9% (8 of 116), exceeding that of Leydig cell tumors, which were previously believed to be the most common benign testicular neoplasms. The adenomatoid tumors included 38% epididymal tumors (11 of 29). The clinical course of the tumors was benign, without recurrences. Local excision is regarded as the treatment of choice for epididymal and testicular adenomatoid tumors. 
Microbiological analysis of sepsis complicating non-surgical biliary drainage in malignant obstruction. Cholangitis with sepsis is a common complication of non-surgical biliary drainage and represents a difficult management problem. Microbiological data for 18 septic episodes in 15 patients following endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD) and 14 septic episodes in 14 patients following percutaneous transhepatic drainage (PTD) were reviewed. In the EBD group, all 18 patient episodes of sepsis had blood cultures and 10 had bile cultures obtained. In total, 17 gram-negative isolates and 5 gram-positive isolates were grown in the EBD sepsis group. All of the 14 PTD patients had bile cultures and 13 had blood cultures. In total, 23 gram-negative isolates and 26 gram-positive isolates were grown in the PTD sepsis group. When PTD cultures were compared with EBD cultures, there were significantly more gram-positive cultures (26 vs. 5) associated with PTD sepsis than EBD sepsis (p less than 0.0005). Analysis of the antibiotic sensitivities revealed that a combination of ticarcillin clavulanate with gentamicin covered 20 of the 22 (91%) EBD organisms and 38 of the 49 (78%) PTD organisms. Based on this data, ticarcillin clavulanate with gentamicin is the therapy of choice for EBD and PTD sepsis at our institution. 
Traumatic carotid-cavernous sinus fistula associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm: a case report. A case of traumatic carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (CCF) associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm is reported. A 42-year-old man developed traumatic CCF after severe head trauma. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a direct CCF associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm at the C2 portion. Transarterial balloon embolization of the CCF caused severe subarachnoid hemorrhage. A CCF with an intradural pseudoaneurysm is life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. However, balloon occlusion in such cases is contraindicated because of possible rupture of a pseudoaneurysm. Trapping or a direct surgical approach is the treatment of choice. 
Contractile properties of lower leg muscles are normal in Parkinson's disease. Contraction parameters (time-to-peak and half relaxation time), responses to short tetani and resistance to stretch were studied in the lower leg muscles of Parkinsonian patients and in age-matched controls. It was possible to distinguish between muscle groups of different fibre type composition in normal subjects on the basis of their contraction and relaxation velocities. These parameters, however, failed to show any abnormalities in the patient group. The only abnormal finding in Parkinsonian subjects was an increased resistance to passive stretch under static conditions, presumably elastic in origin. The results are evidence against a contribution of altered contractile properties to muscular rigidity in Parkinsonism. 
Hazards of mattresses, beds and bedding in deaths of infants. Of 52 infants who had died suddenly and were referred to autopsy, nine had lain on adult water beds for the first time; five had died as a result of accidents; two had died on water beds; two were in beds with widely spaced slats; and one had died as a result of strangulation. Three deaths were due to overlying. Three other infants had been placed on sheepskin rugs for the first time and were found dead shortly thereafter. These infants ranged in age from 2 to 9 months, except for a severely mentally retarded nine-year-old with spastic paraplegia. We believe that a general warning should be issued concerning water beds and that soft bedding should not be used for infants. Infants should not be placed unattended or left to sleep on water beds; only beds recommended for infants should be used. Overlying of a young infant is most likely to occur on a water bed, or if the parent is obese or has consumed alcohol. 
Prevalence of proximal faecal stasis in active ulcerative colitis. Proximal faecal stasis may occur when faecal matter accumulates in the uninflamed colon above an area of active ulcerative colitis. This phenomenon is thought to be the cause of symptoms in some patients with distal disease. It is not known, however, how often patients with active distal colitis exhibit slow colonic transit. Fifty two consecutive patients with active ulcerative colitis each ingested 10 radio-opaque markers nightly for 14 days. Minimum colonic transit times were derived from counts of retained markers shown by plain abdominal radiography on the 15th day. The transit times for each patient were related to their disease extent and bowel frequency. Four patients had colonic transit times greater than one week and two others had evidence of relative stasis. The results indicate that approximately 10% of attacks of distal colitis are associated with faecal stasis. 
Ureteral obstruction after abdominal aortic surgery. Obstructive uropathy following abdominal aortic surgery can no longer be considered a rarity. Early hydronephrosis, developing in the first postoperative year, occurs in 10% to 20% of patients; it usually runs a benign, self-limiting course. The incidence of delayed ureteral obstruction, which develops or persists after the first postoperative year, is unknown because it is asymptomatic in most cases. Although spontaneous resolution is possible, it seems that this late form is more likely to persist. The diagnosis of postoperative hydronephrosis is not an indication for urologic intervention. This should seldom be necessary; it should be reserved only for patients with evidence of worsening obstruction or deteriorating renal function. Early and particularly, delayed hydronephrosis seems to be a marker for present or impending graft complications, such as infection or false aneurysms. A prolonged follow-up is therefore mandatory whenever the diagnosis is established as it may improve long-term survival and limb salvage. The need for routine screening for this condition remains to be established. With the availability of noninvasive methods, such a task could be easily accomplished. 
Reversible inactivation of the insular cortex by tetrodotoxin produces retrograde and anterograde amnesia for inhibitory avoidance and spatial learning. Tetrodotoxin (TTX; a voltage-sensitive sodium channel blocker) was microinjected bilaterally into the insular (IC), frontal (FC), or parietal (PC) cortex or the ventral caudate nucleus of rats either before or after they were trained in an inhibitory avoidance task. When administered either before or after training, injections of TTX into the IC impaired performance on a 48-hr retention test. Injections of TTX into the PC also impaired retention when administered before training. One week later, rats with cannulae in the IC, FC, and PC received microinjections of TTX either before or after training in a water maze (Morris) spatial learning task and retention was tested 24 hr later. TTX impaired retention when administered to the IC either before or after training. These findings indicate that a functionally intact IC during and after training in these tasks appears to be essential for the storage of long-term memory. 
Antimicrobial treatment of acute otitis media. No single antimicrobial drug is best suited for all patients with AOM. Amoxicillin and TMP-SMZ, however, remain first-line drugs in the initial treatment of uncomplicated AOM in the non-neonate. In other situations the drug selected depends on the patient's age, associated illnesses, recent history of otitis media, and drug hypersensitivity. Pharmacokinetic studies of AOM treatment are essential in generating more precise recommendations for antimicrobial drug use. 
The high risk of death by alcohol related diseases in subjects diagnosed as diabetic and impaired glucose tolerant: the Paris Prospective Study after 15 years of follow-up. The 15 year mortality rates and causes of death are reported for the Paris Prospective Study cohort of 7180 working men, aged between 44 and 55 years who attended the first follow-up examination. All subjects were classified as normoglycaemic, impaired glucose tolerant or diabetic according to the WHO criteria, following an oral glucose tolerance test. The relative risks of death in comparison to the normoglycaemic group were 1.6 for impaired glucose tolerant and 2.3 for diabetic subjects; for death due to coronary heart disease: 1.7 and 2.3 respectively; for death due to alcohol and cirrhosis: 7.0 and 13.3 respectively. It appears that in this cohort a proportion of subjects screened as diabetic have impaired liver function and disturbed carbohydrate metabolism, due to excessive alcohol consumption. Alcohol should be investigated as a possible risk factor for diabetes, particularly in epidemiological studies where diabetes is diagnosed by the oral glucose tolerance test and the population has a high consumption of alcohol. 
Reversal of a dense, persistent, holohemispheric neurological deficit after an endarterectomy of the carotid artery: case report. The role and timing of a carotid endarterectomy in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke-in-evolution remain controversial. Although computed tomographic (CT) scans typically show no abnormalities in the acute stage, it is generally agreed that a dense neurological deficit (hemiplegia) and/or multiple modality neurological disturbance (involving motor, sensory, gaze, and visual field impairment) represent contraindications to surgical intervention. We present a case of an acute right holohemispheric neurological deficit including dense hemiplegia, hemisensory loss, gaze disturbance, hemineglect, and impaired level of consciousness. This persisted for 4 days while serial CT scans showed no evidence of infarction. Angiography revealed pre-occlusive stenosis of the right internal carotid artery with sluggish antegrade flow. The anterior collaterals of the circle of Willis were impaired, and the right middle cerebral artery territory filled via the posterior communicating artery. Despite the dense neurological deficit persisting for 4 days, a carotid endarterectomy was performed. Gradual neurological improvement was noted within hours of the operation, and all neurological deficits resolved within the subsequent 3 days. This case is consistent with prolonged holohemispheric hemodynamic compromise below the threshold of neurological dysfunction, but above the threshold of tissue infarction ("idling neurons"). Features assisting in the recognition of this unusual scenario and the indications and risks of revascularization in this setting are discussed. 
A phase II study of high-dose continuous infusion interleukin-2 with lymphokine-activated killer cells in patients with metastatic melanoma. Thirty-three patients with metastatic melanoma were treated in a phase II study with an intravenous continuous infusion (IVCI) of interleukin-2 (IL2) given with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. The dose of IL2 was the optimal priming dose for LAK-cell induction, followed by the maximally tolerated LAK-cell dose that could be given by an IVCI schedule as determined by a previous phase I trial. The CI schedule was chosen for evaluation because of a postulated reduction in toxicity with the possibility of administering a more prolonged IL2 infusion and because greater rebound lymphocytosis and LAK-cell generation had been reported using this dose and schedule. The 33 patients were similar in age, performance status, and sites of disease to those treated in previous IL2 trials. All patients were assessable for response and toxicity. One patient (3%) achieved a partial response of 10 months duration. There were no other clinically significant responses. Significant toxicity included hypotension requiring pressors (45%), dyspnea (36%), renal insufficiency (24%), hepatic dysfunction (66%), and cardiac arrhythmias (18%). These toxicities reversed with cessation of the infusion. There were four deaths during the first 30 days of treatment, three from infection (one related to central line, one related to LAK cells, one related to tumor), and one from tumor-related hemorrhage. Toxicity was unexpectedly high and at least comparable to that seen in previous studies using a high-dose IV bolus schedule of IL2. When comparing the IVCI schedule with high-dose bolus IL2 to LAK cells in nonrandomized but sequential studies in patients with advanced melanoma, it appears that CI IL2 is less efficacious. 
Lower limb problems in diabetic patients. What are the causes? What are the remedies? Peripheral neuropathy, infection, and peripheral vascular disease can produce serious problems in diabetic patients, particularly in the lower limbs. Ulceration of the foot may progress to gangrene and ultimately necessitate amputation. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy causes sensory loss. Such loss in patients with peripheral vascular disease creates a high risk for foot ulcers, which are vulnerable to infection. Treatment includes relief of neuropathic pain and antibiotic therapy for infection. Pentoxifylline (Trental) improves microvascular flow and appears to be effective against peripheral vascular disease. Aldose reductase inhibitors are being investigated as therapy for diabetic neuropathy. Prevention is the mainstay of management in these patients. Patient education is essential to help maintain health and prevent the potential adverse effects of diabetes. 
Incremental prognostic value of exercise hemodynamic variables in chronic congestive heart failure secondary to coronary artery disease or to dilated cardiomyopathy. To determine the prognostic value of hemodynamic variables at rest and during exercise, 49 patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing hemodynamic evaluation at rest and during symptom-limited exercise were followed for 1 year. One-year mortality rate was 33%. On univariate analysis, nonsurvivors differed significantly from survivors in pulmonary arterial wedge pressure at rest (22 +/- 10 vs 15 +/- 10 mm Hg; p = 0.01) and during exercise (32 +/- 9 vs 24 +/- 9 mm Hg; p = 0.003), stroke work index at rest (19 +/- 6 vs 25 +/- 9 g-m/m2; p = 0.03) and during exercise (20 +/- 7 vs 32 +/- 14 g-m/m2; p = 0.001) and exercise-induced increment in stroke work index (0.5 +/- 0.4 vs 7 +/- 8 g-m/m2; p = 0.004), but not with respect to left ventricular ejection fraction, exercise duration, peak oxygen consumption or peak left ventricular hydraulic power. Patients with a peak exercise stroke work index less than 20 g-m/m2 had a 66% mortality rate compared with a mortality rate of 13% in patients with a peak exercise stroke work index greater than 20 g-m/m2 (p = 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified pulmonary arterial wedge pressure at rest and peak exercise stroke work index as the only independent predictors of mortality. A receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that peak exercise stroke work index provided significant incremental prognostic information over the resting hemodynamic variables. 
Unusual initial calcification of primary and metastatic seminomas. Detection by computed tomography. Rare large ab initio calcifications of a primary mediastinal seminoma in a 16-year-old boy and of para-aortic nodal metastatic ovarian seminoma in a 14-year-old girl are demonstrated with CT but not with conventional radiography. They are most likely dystrophic calcifications because of the absence of other germ cell tumor components and infective granulomatous disease. Routine use of CT might detect more such calcifications in untreated seminoma. 
Assessment of factors influencing the outcome of radiotherapy for bladder cancer. The results of treatment of 709 patients with carcinoma of the bladder are reported. Inclusion of the pelvic lymph nodes in the treatment volume failed to lead to any improvement in survival. The factors influencing survival were stage, tumour histology and differentiation. The presence of tumour at follow-up cystoscopy at 3 months was of great prognostic significance. 
Urological manifestations of the Melnick-Needles syndrome: a case report and review of the literature. In 1966 Melnick and Needles described a syndrome of multiple skeletal anomalies in a 3-year-old girl. A dilated ureter was noted but not associated with the disorder. Subsequent to this report there have been 8 additional cases published of patients with the Melnick-Needles syndrome in association with a variety of urogenital and abdominal wall abnormalities. A 10-year-old girl with this syndrome and bilateral ureteral ectasia is described and the literature on this association is reviewed. 
Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with lymphoid stroma (lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas) of the stomach. Report of three cases with Epstein-Barr virus genome demonstrated by the polymerase chain reaction. Lymphoepithelioma of the nasopharynx is an undifferentiated carcinoma with prominent lymphoid infiltration. Histologically similar tumors have been documented in the skin, lung, thymus, salivary gland, tonsil, and uterine cervix. The authors report three cases of gastric carcinoma that were histologically and immunohistochemically similar to lymphoepithelioma. The patients were elderly white persons (61, 76, and 77 years of age); two of them had previous partial gastric resections for benign ulcer disease. The tumors were located on the lesser gastric curvature (two cases) and at a previous anastomotic site (one case) and measured 3, 4, and 7 cm in largest dimension. Grossly, each neoplasm was a raised plaque-like lesion with a central ulcer. Microscopically, all three tumors were similar, with poorly differentiated polygonal tumor cells scattered throughout a dense lymphocytic background. In a few areas, tumor cells formed ill-defined cords. In two cases, the neoplasms invaded the gastric muscle layer but had a well-delineated (pushing) margin. The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for AE3-defined keratin, confirming their epithelial nature. The lymphocytes were a mixture of UCHL-1-positive T cells and L-26-positive B cells. Portions of the Epstein-Barr virus genome were present in all cases, as detected by the polymerase chain reaction. The morphologic features of these cases are similar to those of lymphoepithelioma in other anatomic sites, and these tumors represent a unique subtype of gastric carcinoma. 
Practice patterns in the treatment of acutely ill hospitalized asthmatic patients at three teaching hospitals. Variability in resource utilization. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the extent to which patterns of diagnostic and therapeutic practice differ among hospitals caring for acutely ill hospitalized asthmatic patients in a single city. DESIGN: Our study comprised a retrospective review of the records of patients admitted to the hospital for the treatment of acute asthma. SETTING: Three large teaching hospitals in Boston were the setting. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-seven patients between 18 and 50 years of age who were admitted to the medical services specifically for the treatment of asthma were studied. INTERVENTIONS: There were no interventions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For this group of patients with similar histories of asthma, clinical presentation, and severity of asthma, the diagnostic tests used within 12 hours of admission and the frequency and volume of diagnostic laboratory testing throughout the admission differed significantly among the three hospitals. Spirometry, the test bearing most directly on the severity of the asthmatic attack, was not used routinely as a criterion for admission or discharge at any of the hospitals. Other tests of uncertain efficacy, such as chest x-ray films, were used frequently at some of the hospitals. Patients at all three hospitals were treated similarly with intensive combined regimens of methylxanthines, sympathomimetics, and corticosteroids and had similar mean lengths of stay. The use of chest physical therapy, which has not yet been demonstrated to be effective in acute asthma, differed significantly among the three hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that considerable variability exists in the diagnostic evaluation of acutely ill hospitalized asthmatic patients in the three hospitals; little variability exists in the pharmacologic treatment of these patients. In the absence of data on outcome regarding functional improvement and reductions in morbidity, we are unable to recommend a preferred pattern of practice from this study. 
Correlation of emergency health care use, 911 volume, and jail activity with welfare check distribution. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among emergency health care use, 911 call volume, and jail admissions with the timing of the distribution of General Assistance, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, and Minnesota Supplemental Aid welfare checks. DESIGN: This was a retrospective study analyzing previously collected census and welfare check distribution data. SETTING: The data used in this study were obtained from the Hennepin County Medical Center, the Hennepin County jail and alcoholic receiving center, and Department of Economic Assistance. INTERVENTIONS: The daily census for the years 1986 through 1988 in the Hennepin County Medical Center emergency department, ED resuscitation room, pediatric ED, crisis intervention center, urgent care center, and alcoholic receiving center was obtained. The numbers of daily ambulance runs, nonelective hospital admissions, Hennepin County 911 calls, and Hennepin County jail admissions for the same years also were obtained. Means for each day of the month were computed across the 36 months of observation. These data were correlated with the number of days elapsed since the monthly issuance of the General Assistance, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, and Minnesota Supplemental Aid welfare checks. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: There were significant correlations between the number of days after distribution of the checks and the average values of the census of the alcoholic receiving center (r = -.96, P less than .00001), the ED (r = -.80, P less than .0001), ambulance runs (r = -.68, P less than .0001), 911 calls (r = -.45, P = .01), jail admissions (r = -.45, P = .01), nonelective hospital admissions (r = -.44, P = .01), and the crisis intervention center visits (r = -.39, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that scheduling and staffing practices of various emergency service areas in Hennepin County reflect patient load variation associated with time of welfare check distribution. Systematic variation of time or amount of welfare could lead to improved distribution and reduction of emergency services demand. 
Intraoperative radiation therapy for recurrent head and neck cancer. Forty-seven patients with recurrent head and neck cancer in a previously irradiated field were treated with surgical resection and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). Recurrent disease occurred at a median of 18 months from primary treatment, and was at the primary tumor site in 31 and metastatic to regional lymph nodes in 16. Recurrences were squamous cell carcinomas in 42 and adenoid cystic in five. Surgical resection left microscopic residual disease in 41 and gross residual in six. All patients received IORT with a median of 20 Gy. Two-year actuarial survival is 54.9%, and 15 patients are alive and disease free with a median survival of 29 months. Two-year actuarial local control is 61.5%. A trend toward increased survival (P less than 0.09) and local recurrence control (P = 0.05) was noticed when treating microscopic residual disease as opposed to gross residual disease. Perioperative mortality was seen in 8.5% and there was no increase in morbidity secondary to IORT. The authors believe that surgical resection and IORT is an effective treatment modality for head and neck cancers recurrent in previously irradiated fields and is adaptable to tertiary care hospitals. 
When should patients with lethal ventricular arrhythmia resume driving? An analysis of state regulations and physician practices. Most states have specific laws governing whether patients with seizure disorders can drive. To learn whether similar laws exist for patients with lethal ventricular arrhythmias, we surveyed the Departments of Motor Vehicles in all 50 states. In addition, either an arrhythmia specialist (n = 25) or a general cardiologist (n = 25) was chosen randomly from each state and interviewed to study physician awareness of such laws and physician attitudes toward driving by patients with arrhythmias. Forty-two states (84%) have laws restricting driving by patients who have seizures; only 8 states (16%) have specific laws for patients with arrhythmias. No state makes a distinction between driving by patients with arrhythmias who are managed with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) compared with patients who are managed medically. Seventy-four percent of physicians did not know their own state's laws about driving by patients who have ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiologists were more likely to advise no driving restriction for medically treated patients than for ICD-treated patients. Cardiologists were also more likely to advise permanent restriction for patients with ICDs than for patients treated medically. We conclude that greater legal and medical consensus is needed to guide physicians in advising patients with lethal ventricular arrhythmias about driving restrictions. 
Occurrence of p53 gene abnormalities in gastric carcinoma tumors and cell lines. We explored the state of the p53 gene in gastric cancer. Using one or more methods, we examined 15 specimens from primary carcinomas (14 tumors, one cell line), five cell lines derived from metastases, and seven paired samples of nonmalignant gastric mucosa. Sequence analyses of complementary DNA containing the entire p53 gene open reading frame demonstrated abnormalities in one of five samples from primary tumors and in all five samples from metastases. The single cell line derived from a primary carcinoma had no abnormality of the gene. The six abnormalities included four point mutations, one base-pair deletion resulting in a frame shift, and a 24 base-pair deletion caused by an intronic point mutation (as determined by sequence analysis of genomic DNA). Four of the six mutations mapped to regions highly conserved among species or involved in simian virus 40 T-antigen binding. Restriction fragment length polymorphism studies confirmed that chromosome 17p allelic deletions occur only in a minority of primary tumors, but that they may occur more frequently in metastases. Northern blotting and ribonuclease protection assays detected only a fraction of the p53 gene abnormalities detected by sequencing. Our findings indicate that mutations of the p53 gene are relatively rare in primary gastric tumors but appear to be relatively frequent in cell lines derived from metastatic lesions. Our results may help in understanding the molecular events associated with progression and metastasis in gastric carcinoma. 
Comparison of the clinical pharmacology of (-)NPA and levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Direct acting dopamine agonists are generally less effective than levodopa in relieving symptoms of Parkinson's disease. In an attempt to quantitate and explain this situation, the acute motor responses to intravenous injections of the dopamine agonist, (-)-N-n-propyl-norapomorphine hydrochloride (NPA), were compared with those of the dopamine precursor, levodopa. At optimum dose levels, the acute anti-Parkinsonian efficacy of NPA averaged only about 50% of maximum, while essentially total symptom suppression was obtained with levodopa in patients previously treated with the amine precursor. Dyskinesia severity, however, was similar with the two drugs. These differences in anti-Parkinsonian efficacy may reflect the fact that while NPA acts mainly on D-2 dopamine receptors, levodopa results in stimulation of both the D-1 and D-2 subsets of receptors at a more physiological ratio. Future efforts to develop dopamine agonists for the treatment of Parkinsonian symptoms may thus have to consider focusing on drugs having pharmacological profile more similar to that of dopamine. 
Diagnostic and prognostic importance of comparing the initial to the previous electrocardiogram in patients admitted for suspected acute myocardial infarction. Two hundred fifty-eight patients were admitted to the hospital for suspected acute myocardial infarction. Electrocardiograms recorded on admission (initial ECG) and the most recent available electrocardiogram recorded before admission (previous ECG) were compared to determine whether changes from the previous to initial ECG predicted acute myocardial infarction or complications of coronary artery disease. Initial ECGs were classed as either positive or negative, with positive indicating either infarction, injury, ischemia, strain, left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, or paced rhythm. Negative ECGs were those that did not include any of the positive criteria. Positive and negative ECGs were subgrouped as showing change or no change from previous ECG. We found that patients with a negative initial ECG that had changed from the previous ECG had a 2.1 times greater risk for requiring interventions than those patients whose ECGs were unchanged. We also found that patients with a positive initial ECG that had changed from the previous ECG had a greater risk for interventions (2.0 times), complications (2.6 times), life-threatening complications (4.2 times), and acute myocardial infarction (6.6 times) than the sum of patients in all other ECG categories. We conclude that change is a useful predictor for interventions in patients with negative initial ECGs and a useful predictor for interventions, complications, and acute myocardial infarction in patients with positive initial ECGs. 
Clues and pitfalls in stereotactic biopsy of the central nervous system. We present a 6-year experience on 307 stereotactic biopsy specimens of the central nervous system using Leksell's and Talairach's systems independently and either Leksell or Sedan needles. Patients with deep cerebral lesions (basal ganglia, parasellar, pineal, or third ventricle), those located in highly functional areas or those poorly defined on imaging studies, as well as candidates for brachytherapy, were selected. Smear examination during surgery was a routine procedure followed by conventional histologic methods. Ages ranged from 8 months to 81 years (mean, 33.64 years). The series comprised 258 tumors, 28 nonneoplastic cases, and 21 nondiagnostic samples. Of the 258 tumors, 179 were supratentorial, 28 were infratentorial, 36 were of the pineal area, and 15 were from sellar and suprasellar regions. Results of the histologic examination showed the following: astrocytic tumors, 148 (57.36%); oligodendroglial, 25 (9.68%); ependymal, six (2.32%); primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 17, including 14 pineoblastomas (5.45%) and three medulloblastomas (1.16%), seven lymphomas (2.71%), seven meningiomas (2.71%), four schwannomas (1.55%), eight craniopharyngiomas (3.10%), 12 germinomas (4.65%), and 20 metastases (7.78%). Nontumoral cases included six arteriovenous malformations, six pyogenic lesions, seven infarcts, two hematomas, one multiple sclerosis plaque, one Fahr, one progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, one tuberculosis, one cysticercosis, and one Chagas' encephalitis. Awareness of the cerebellar granular layer in infratentorial targets as well as glial reaction around craniopharyngiomas is essential to avoid misdiagnosis. Difficulties were basically differential diagnosis between well-differentiated astrocytomas vs glial reaction, as well as poorly differentiated neoplasms vs metastases. 
Recombinant interferon beta: a phase I-II trial in children with recurrent brain tumors. A multicenter phase I-II trial of intravenous (IV) human recombinant interferon beta (rIFN-beta; Betaseron; Triton Bioscience Inc, Almeda, CA) was conducted in children with recurrent or progressive primary brain and spinal cord tumors. A total of 29 patients were enrolled: high-grade astrocytoma (12), brainstem glioma (nine), and primitive neuroectadermal tumor (three), ependymoma (two), germ cell (two), and spinal cord astrocytoma (one). Betaseron was given by IV infusion over 30 minutes 3 times per week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday [MWF]). Four dose levels were studied, and at least three patients were entered at each dose level. The treatment plan began with a three-step dose escalation for each patient over 6 weeks (initiation phase). The dose-escalation schema for the four dose levels was: 50-100-200, 100-200-400, 200-300-500, and 300-400-600 x 10(6) (M) IU/m2. Patients experiencing an objective response or stable disease after 6 weeks entered the maintenance phase at the final escalated dose, ie, 200, 400, 500, or 600 mlU/m2 (MWF). Common transient effects included chills, fever, and fatigue. Dose-limiting toxicities were hematologic, hepatic, and CNS. The maintenance maximum-tolerable dose (MTD) was 500 mlU/m2, ie, dose level 3. Response was assessed at completion of the initiation phase and at 2-month intervals during the maintenance phase. Objective partial responses were seen in patients with high-grade astrocytoma (two) and brain-stem glioma (two). Thus, four of 21 (19%) assessable patients had partial responses for a median of 4 months. Eight patients had stable disease for a median of 5+ (2 to 14+) months. Antineoplastic activity has been identified in children with high-grade astrocytomas and brainstem gliomas in a dose-intensive regimen. 
Cerebral vasoconstriction during head-upright tilt-induced vasovagal syncope. A paradoxic and unexpected response. BACKGROUND. To determine the effect of vasovagally mediated syncope on the cerebral circulation, transcranial Doppler sonography was used to assess changes in cerebral blood flow velocity during head-upright tilt-induced syncope. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thirty patients (17 men and 13 women; mean age, 43 +/- 22 years) with recurrent unexplained syncope were evaluated by use of an upright tilt-table test for 30 minutes, with or without an infusion of intravenous isoproterenol (1-4 micrograms/min), in an attempt to provoke bradycardia, hypotension, or both. Transcranial Doppler sonography was used to assess middle cerebral artery systolic velocity (Vs), diastolic velocity (Vd), ratio of systolic to diastolic velocities, pulsatility index (PI = Vs-Vd/Vmean), and resistance index (RI = Vs-Vd/Vs) before, during, and after tilt. Syncope occurred in six patients (20%) during the baseline tilt and 14 (46%) during isoproterenol infusion (total positives, 66%). In the tilt-positive patients, concomitant with the development of hypotension and bradycardia, transcranial Doppler sonography showed a 75 +/- 17% decrease in diastolic velocity, unchanged systolic velocity, a 46 +/- 17% decrease in mean velocity, a 295 +/- 227% increase in pulsatility index, and a 73 +/- 34% increase in resistance index. CONCLUSIONS. These findings reflect increased cerebrovascular resistance secondary to arteriolar vasoconstriction distal to the insonation point of the middle cerebral artery. This is paradoxic because the expected response of the cerebral circulation to hypotension is vasodilation. We conclude that abnormal baroreceptor responses triggered during vasovagal syncope result in a derangement of cerebral autoregulation with paradoxic vasoconstriction in the face of increasing hypotension. 
Intranodal leiomyoma. Another distinctive primary spindle cell neoplasm of lymph node. Two intranodal spindle cell neoplasms are described that were interpreted as leiomyomas. Both occurred in young men. The first case involved a single peripancreatic lymph node of a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who died of AIDS-related infection. The second case simulated a parotid gland tumor because of its location in an intraparotid lymph node in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Both neoplasms were composed of interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with blunt-ended nuclei that seemed to arise from the walls of blood vessels. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for muscle-specific actin but were desmin negative. These leiomyomas expand the clinical and morphologic spectrum of primary spindle cell neoplasms of lymph nodes. 
Autosomal recessive lethal infantile cytochrome C oxidase deficiency. Three bedouin children with mitochondrial myopathy due to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency presented with progressive muscle weakness, failure to thrive, proximal renal tubular acidosis, and lactic acidemia leading to death. Two died by age 5 months and one by age 16 months. Cytochrome c oxidase was markedly reduced in skeletal muscle extracts of all three. Three other children of the same family with most probably the same metabolic aberration are also described. We suggest an autosomal recessive inheritance for this lethal mitochondrial myopathy. 
Adult paratesticular sarcomas: a review of 21 cases. We reviewed 21 patients more than 16 years old who were seen with a diagnosis of paratesticular sarcoma from 1958 to 1987. Of the patients 14 presented with primary disease and 7 with recurrent disease. The survival of the primarily treated patients was 58% at 5 years, calculated by the product limit method. Of the 14 patients with primary disease 13 had grade 3/4 or 4/4 sarcoma and 13 of 14 underwent initial radical orchiectomy. In addition, 6 of the 14 patients underwent an adjuvant operation or radiotherapy to the groin, or groin and scrotum, and none had local relapse. Some patients also had chemotherapy. Three patients underwent adjuvant retroperitoneal node dissection and 2 had microscopically positive nodes. All 3 patients remain without relapse. Six patients had relapse: 2 locally, 2 in the retroperitoneal nodes and 2 with distant metastases. Only 1 patient (with scrotal recurrence) was salvaged. Of the 7 patients referred with recurrent disease none was salvaged. In this series there is a 2 of 14 (14%) risk of local failure and a 4 of 14 (28%) risk of retroperitoneal relapse after radical orchiectomy. Since salvage has not proved successful, patients with rhabdomyosarcoma, intermediate or high grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma, or fibrosarcoma should be considered for adjuvant retroperitoneal node dissection. All patients should undergo adjuvant dissection or irradiation of the ipsilateral pelvic and groin nodes, and scrotum. 
The IVBF dual-blade plate and its applications. A recently developed simple device, the intervertebral body fixation dual-blade plate, was used in 88 cases of different spinal disorders. This patients in the first series were operated on from 1984 to 1986. The device is biomechanically simple and its application safe and easy. Using a proper bone grafting technique, it is a reliable device to establish spinal stability in spine surgery through an anterior approach. Its application in cases of fractures and fracture-dislocations of the thoracolumbar spine with paraplegia, tuberculous spondylitis, and primary tumors of vertebral bodies is presented. The midterm results, covering a follow-up period of 24-49 months (mean, 32 months) were satisfactory; there were no serious complications directly related to the device. There were four cases of pseudarthrosis due to insufficient bone graft technique. Of these, there were three cases of failure of the dual-blade plate. 
Atrioventricular septal defect repair in infants. From September 1984 through August 1989, 33 consecutive infants (mean age, 9 months; 13 male) received a single-stage intracardiac repair of complete atrioventricular septal defect. Preoperative evaluation of valvar morphology and function involved echocardiograms in 21% (7/33) and echocardiograms with cineangiograms in 79% (26/33). All infants operated on were included in the analysis. Patients with other complicating abnormalities were not excluded. All operations used a two-patch technique for closure of the atrioventricular septal defect in association with mitral valve repair. The newly formed septal leaflet of the mitral valve was repaired using unpledgeted interrupted sutures. Preoperative and postoperative echocardiograms were used to evaluate mitral valve regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction as mild, moderate, or severe. The 30-day mortality was 6% (2/33). Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 60 months. Postoperative mitral valve insufficiency was mild in 84% versus 6% preoperatively, moderate in 3% versus 52% preoperatively, and severe in 13% versus 42% preoperatively. Mitral valve dysfunction necessitating reoperation occurred in 6% (2/31). Mitral valve function postoperatively was improved compared with preoperatively (p less than 0.001). The low 30-day operative mortality and the excellent late postoperative valvar function demonstrate the value of single-stage two-patch repair of atrioventricular septal defect early in life. 
Progressive deterioration of auditory evoked potentials after excision of an acoustic neurinoma: case report. The authors report the case of a 17-year-old girl who underwent excision of bilateral neurinomas of the cerebellopontine angle. Although her auditory evoked potentials were well maintained during the operation, they deteriorated gradually and progressively for the following 2 months. This seemed to reflect degeneration of the cochlear nerve fibers initiated by operative manipulation in the cerebellopontine angle in a patient who had no hearing when she awoke from surgery. 
Pure akinesia: an atypical manifestation of progressive supranuclear palsy. Two patients with "pure akinesia" who showed the characteristic changes of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) at necropsy are described. They had akinesia but no rigidity or tremor, and ophthalmoplegia was not observed during the course of illness. The symptoms of "pure akinesia" was not improved by levodopa therapy but was considerably improved by L-threo-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylserine. At necropsy, pathological findings were not different from those reported for PSP. It is suggested that "pure akinesia" is an atypical manifestation of PSP, and that norepinephrinergic neurons may be involved in some types of PSP. 
Treatable blindness in temporal arteritis. Temporal arteritis is a common cause of blindness. Prompt steroid treatment limits unilateral visual loss while protecting the contralateral eye. Established blindness is irreversible. We report a case of temporal arteritis in which an eye with no light perception secondary to an arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy regained 6/6 vision. 
Suprasellar and intraventricular blood predict elevated plasma atrial natriuretic factor in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Following subarachnoid hemorrhage, the plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic factor is elevated and appears to be independent of atrial stretch. While the hypothalamus and circumventricular organs contribute to sodium and intravascular volume regulation, their influence on atrial natriuretic factor is not known. We tested the hypothesis that, following subarachnoid hemorrhage, suprasellar cisternal blood, intraventricular blood, or ventricular enlargement would be associated with elevated plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor. Computed tomograms of 26 patients performed less than or equal to 3 days after hemorrhage were analyzed to determine the presence of suprasellar or intraventricular blood and enlargement of the third or lateral ventricle. These results were correlated with the plasma atrial natriuretic factor and serum sodium concentrations. The initial atrial natriuretic factor concentration was elevated and was higher in patients with suprasellar or intraventricular blood than in those without (suprasellar: 131 +/- 20 and 54 +/- 10 pg/ml, respectively; intraventricular: 137 +/- 25 and 84 +/- 31 pg/ml, respectively). The atrial natriuretic factor concentration remained higher over the week following hemorrhage in patients with suprasellar blood than in those without (127 +/- 16 and 68 +/- 12 pg/ml, respectively). The atrial natriuretic factor concentration was not correlated with hyponatremia (125-134 meq/l) or age-corrected ventricular size. Hyponatremia did not correlate with the presence of intraventricular or suprasellar blood. Our data suggest that suprasellar and intraventricular blood disturb hypothalamic function, resulting in an elevated plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration. The presence of a direct relation between atrial natriuretic factor and hyponatremia remains unclear. 
Factors associated with atrial fibrillation in Q wave anterior myocardial infarction. To elucidate the role of inflammatory and hemodynamic factors in the genesis of atrial fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction, 228 patients with a first Q wave anterior myocardial infarction were studied. Forty-nine patients had pericarditis (detection of pericardial rub by careful auscultation), and 36 patients had echocardiographically demonstrated hydropericardium (presence of pericardial effusion without pericardial rub). During the first 3 days after admission, transient episodes of atrial fibrillation were observed in 10 patients (20%) with pericarditis (group 1), 15 patients (42%) with hydropericardium (group 2), and 20 patients (14%) without pericarditis and hydropericardium (group 3). Although there was no significant difference in the incidence of atrial fibrillation between groups 1 and 3, patients in group 2 had a significantly higher incidence of atrial fibrillation than those in groups 1 and 3. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and the number of advanced asynergic segments were found to be the important factors discriminating the three groups by multivariate analysis. Therefore atrial fibrillation after acute Q wave anterior infarction was not related to the inflammatory infiltration involving the atria but to the increase in atrial pressure resulting from hemodynamic change caused by more extensive myocardial damage. 
Case report: hepatic hydrothorax without ascites. Pleural effusion due to hepatic cirrhosis and ascites is well known. We describe three patients with right-sided hepatic hydrothorax in the absence of ascites. The formation of pleural fluid in these patients is probably a result of fluid movement from peritoneal to pleural space across diaphragmatic defects before ascites can form. The differential diagnosis of a right-sided transudative pleural effusion in a patient with chronic liver disease with or without ascites includes congestive left ventricular failure and nephrotic syndrome. These diseases are usually ruled out with standard clinical tests. Patients with hepatic hydrothorax should be treated with fluid restriction and diuretics. Patients with severe symptoms due to refractory hepatic hydrothorax might benefit from pleural sclerosis and surgical closure of diaphragmatic defects. 
The subsequent risk of internal cancer with Bowen's disease. A population-based study OBJECTIVE--To address the subsequent risk of internal cancer in a population-based cohort of patients with Bowen's disease. DESIGN--Incident cases of skin cancers other than malignant melanoma occurring in a defined population were classified as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or Bowen's disease. Through medical records, all patients were followed up for the development of subsequent internal cancer until they died, moved from Rochester, Minn, or January 1, 1986, whichever came first. Incidence rates of skin cancer and subsequent cancer were computed; the subsequent rate of internal cancer was compared with that prevailing in the community. PATIENTS--Enrolled were all permanent residents in the population base of Rochester, Minn, who developed basal cell carcinoma (n = 657), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 169), or Bowen's disease (n = 71) on the basis of pathologic examination and clinical presentation from 1976 through 1984. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--The relative risk of subsequent internal cancer among patients with Bowen's disease compared with that of the population base from which they arose was 1.1 (95% confidence limits, 0.5, 1.6). RESULTS--Annual incidence rates, adjusted to the 1980 US white population, were 14.9 per 100,000 for Bowen's disease, 38.8 for squamous cell carcinoma, and 146 for basal cell carcinoma. The estimated relative risk for subsequent cancer was 0.9 (95% confidence limits, 0.5, 1.6) among patients with squamous cell carcinoma and 1.0 (95% confidence limits, 0.7, 1.3) for patients with basal cell carcinoma. These risks were not significantly different for various durations of follow-up or for sun-exposed vs sun-protected sites. CONCLUSIONS--We find no evidence in these population-based cohort data of and increased risk of subsequent internal cancer associated with Bowen's disease or other forms of nonmelanomatous skin cancer. 
Successful management of intractable cryptosporidial diarrhea with intravenous octreotide, a somatostatin analogue. A 38-year-old man with AIDS and intractable large-volume diarrhea due to a cryptosporidial infection was successfully treated with intravenous octreotide, a somatostatin analogue. The volume of diarrhea, 10-12 liters with 8-13 movements per day, was reduced to three to four semi-formed to formed stools per day when the patient was treated with 400 micrograms intravenous octreotide daily. The patient's intravenous hyperalimentation was discontinued and he returned to oral feeding. He quickly regained his normal weight and has now resumed his normal activities. For those patients who cannot tolerate subcutaneous administration, intravenous octreotide therapy may not only be life-saving but may also markedly increase the quality of life. Roxithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, was also administered to this patient with cryptosporidiosis but efficacy was not demonstrated. 
Leukemia and lymphoma immunophenotyping in cell smears with immunogold-silver staining. The potential of the immunogold-silver staining (IGSS) technique for immunophenotyping leukemia and lymphoma cells in cell smears was examined. Peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirates, lymph node biopsy specimens, fine-needle aspirates, and biologic fluids of 83 patients with acute or chronic leukemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, or Hodgkin's disease were labeled. Cell smears, cytocentrifuge preparations, or imprints were fixed, incubated with the reagents, and counterstained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa. Stable immunostaining and good morphologic characteristics allowed accurate cell identification and rapid enumeration of the positive cells. The immunophenotypes obtained with the use of 35 monoclonal antibodies with different specificities were similar to those determined by flow cytometry or immunohistochemical studies on the same samples. This IGSS method was especially useful for the examination of poor samples or complex cell suspensions with rare malignant cells. It could be an alternative to the immunoenzyme methods that generally are used for this purpose. 
A phase II study of mitoxantrone, etoposide, and thiotepa with autologous marrow support for patients with relapsed breast cancer. To further improve the effect of high-dose chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer, we sought to develop a second active high-dose noncross-resistant regimen to use in tandem with our customary high-dose regimen of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (CVP). We performed a phase II trial of high-dose mitoxantrone 30 mg/m2, etoposide 200 mg/m2 every 12 hours x 6, and thiotepa 250 mg/m2 x 3 days (MVT) in 31 patients with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer and one with locally advanced chemotherapy-refractory breast cancer. These patients were ineligible for high-dose CVP chemotherapy because of the amount of prior treatment and poor-response status. Of the 32 patients, 14 responded to cycle 1, did not experience any grade 4 toxicity, and received a second cycle of MVT. Overall, seven of 31 patients achieved a complete response (CR; 23%). Four of the 14, who were partial responders to the first cycle, achieved a CR after the second cycle. The overall response rate was 19 of 31 (61%) with an overall median freedom from progression of 4 to 5 months and an overall median survival of 9 months. Toxicity consisted primarily of mucositis (grade 3 or 4 in 69%). The results indicate that high-dose MVT produces significant activity, even in heavily pretreated patients. Administration of a second cycle of high-dose therapy with MVT increased the CR rate, and the morbidity and mortality from the second cycle were not greater than that for the first cycle. Because of the high incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis with this regimen, we are currently completing a follow-up study of high-dose mitoxantrone and thiotepa alone. 
Radiographic evaluation of intraosseous implants of endodontic materials. Following several case reports of cyst development after endodontic treatment of decidous teeth, the osseous response to formaldehyde- or phenol-based materials was evaluated by a standardized radiographic technique. Endodontic medicaments contained in Teflon carriers were implanted between feline deciduous canine and molar teeth and the permanent successional teeth. Persistent radiolucency surrounding formocresol implants and sequestration of Kri-paste implants were noted in contrast to apparent bony healing around the zinc oxide-eugenol controls and those implants containing glutaraldehyde. These results suggest a greater tissue tolerance to glutaraldehyde-containing agents in contrast to the more traditional endodontic agents used in deciduous teeth. 
Oncogene expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cancer of cervix. Expression of the oncogenes Ha-RAS, c-MYC, and ERB-2 was investigated with an automated image analysis system in 12 specimens of normal cervix, 10 of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1, 24 of CIN 3, and 10 of invasive cancer of the cervix. There was amplification of all three oncogenes in CIN 3 and invasive cancer compared with normal cervix and CIN 1. The difference was most pronounced with an antibody to the RAS p21 protein, with no overlap between CIN 3 and the normal range. This method might be useful in screening for cervical neoplasia, and for the determination of which CIN lesions require treatment. 
Reactivity to vasoactive agents of canine basilar arteries exposed to experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autologous blood was injected into the cisterna magna of mongrel dogs twice with an interval of 48 hours. They were killed 3 days, 1 week, or 4 weeks after the first injection of blood, and helical strips of the basilar artery were prepared. Contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and oxyhemoglobin were significantly potentiated. Relaxations caused by nicotine, K+, arachidonic acid, and prostaglandin I2 were suppressed, but the relaxant response to calcium ionophore A23187 and substance P did not change significantly. These results suggest that contractions mediated via activation of alpha, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and prostaglandin F2 alpha receptors are potentiated, and relaxations caused by stimulation of vasodilator nerves and by endogenous and exogenous prostaglandin I2 are attenuated in dog basilar arteries exposed to subarachnoid clot. On the other hand, certain relaxations possibly mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor do not appear to be significantly influenced. 
Invasive treatment for coronary artery disease in the elderly. The widespread availability of coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty presents important treatment options for the older patient. The findings from a number of surgical series of coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty are summarized. Certain trends are evident. Perioperative mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and other complications, while declining, remain somewhat higher in elderly patients. However, the impact of age alone is slight. In both coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, complications are more closely correlated with the presence of serious concomitant disease. Long-term survival and pain relief after coronary artery bypass grafting are excellent in older patients, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty may be the treatment of choice in some elderly patients with coronary artery disease. As in younger patients, prolongation of survival should not be the exclusive goal. Rather, a focus on quality of life and freedom from dependency should be seriously considered. 
Reduced cerebral grey matter observed in alcoholics using magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-eight chronic alcoholics and 36 age- and sex-matched non-alcoholic controls were examined with magnetic resonance imaging and brain morphometric analyses. Results confirmed large increases in subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume and mild ventricular enlargement in the alcoholics and revealed associated volume reductions of localized cortical and subcortical cerebral structures. Volume losses in the diencephalon, the caudate nucleus, dorsolateral frontal and parietal cortex, and mesial temporal lobe structures were the most prominent. Significant correlations between increments in cortical and ventricular CSF and decrements in the volume of cortical and subcortical grey matter were noted. Although there was little evidence for relationships between performance on neuropsychological tests and volume of grey matter structures, significant correlations between some cognitive measures and subcortical and cortical fluid volumes were found. The parallels between this pattern of affected structures and recent neuropathological findings are discussed. 
Influence of anesthesiology residents' noncognitive skills on the occurrence of critical incidents and the residents' overall clinical performances. The authors examined residents' clinical performances in five anesthesiology departments in U.S. teaching hospitals. The data were organized by daily use of the Clinical Anesthesia System of Evaluation, which categorizes and quantifies the narrative comments of faculty. The study was designed to identify predictor categories (particular performance characteristics of residents) for the residents' overall performances and their scores in handling critical incidents (those incidents that could or would have caused significant morbidity or mortality had faculty not intervened). More than 9,000 comments made by 163 faculty about 45 residents were analyzed. Residents' noncognitive skills that were predictors of overall performance were Conscientiousness, Management, Confidence, Critical Incidents, and Knowledge. Conscientiousness and Composure predicted two-thirds of the variability in critical incidents' scores. Path analysis verified causal relationships between the hypothesized predictors and critical incidents. For the residents studied, inadequate noncognitive performance in some areas was a powerful (p less than .0005) predictor of overall clinical performance and was related to the occurrence of critical incidents. 
Childhood blindness in the Republic of Ireland: a national survey. We completed a national study of blindness in children under 16. Approximately 80% of the blind children (that is, with vision of 3/60 or less) in the Republic of Ireland (172 children) were seen, 93 males and 79 females. The survey was carried out between July 1989 and June 1990. It is the first such study to be carried out. Ninety seven (56%) children had lesions due to factors acting before the perinatal period. Of these, 28 (16% of the total number surveyed) had lesions due to genetic causes; 69 (40%) had lesions due to factors operating in the prenatal period other than genetic factors. Forty six (27%) had lesions due to factors acting in the perinatal period. Twenty two (13%) had lesions due to factors acting in childhood. (4% could not be categorised in this way). The commonest single primary diagnoses were birth asphyxia in 19 (11%) cases and retinopathy of prematurity in 19 (11%) cases. 
Binding of anti-acetaldehyde IgG antibodies to hepatocytes with an acetaldehyde-phosphatidylethanolamine adduct on their surface. We have previously shown that antibodies raised against acetaldehyde adducts of protein cross-react with an acetaldehyde adduct of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, N-ethyl-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, when the latter is incorporated into hexagonal phase phospholipid micelles. In the present study we demonstrate that these same IgG antibodies cross-react with N-ethyl-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine when this adduct is incorporated into the surface of hepatocytes. Hapten-specific IgG antibodies were purified from the sera of rabbits sensitized to an albumin-acetaldehyde conjugate that had been reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride (N-ethyl-RSA). The N-ethyl-RSA was coupled to an Affi-Gel-10 column to affinity purify the IgG. Liposomes containing N-ethyl-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine were fused with isolated hepatocytes, the affinity purified primary IgG antibodies were added, then fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies were added, and antibody binding to hepatocytes was measured by flow cytometry. The fluorescence of these hepatocytes was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than control hepatocytes prepared with (1) pre-immune primary IgG antibodies with fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies, (2) no primary antibody but with fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies, and (3) no fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies. 
Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia after resection of thoracic esophageal cancer. The rate of occurrence of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia (PHB) following esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer was 67%, 115/171 cases, which was significantly higher than those following total gastrectomy (28%, 40/144 cases) and colectomy (12%, 7/59 cases). Among the operative procedures, right thoracotomy with extensive lymphoadenectomy had the highest rate of PHB (87%), perhaps due to the longest operation time and the largest intraoperative blood loss. Preoperative risk factors were glucose intolerance, reduced lymphocyte count, and poor nutritional state. The change in bile acid composition, as well as the elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, indicated the presence of postoperative cholestasis which was relevant to total parenteral nutrition. The results suggest that the development of PHB was related to the extent of surgery and the use of parenteral nutrition. 
Intrathoracic meningocele associated with neurofibromatosis: case report. The authors present a case of intrathoracic meningocele associated with neurofibromatosis. Computed tomography with metrizamide myelography proved valuable in locating the lesion, thus facilitating surgical intervention. With the preoperative diagnosis established and the severity of the meningocele known, the surgeons safely employed a subpleural approach at thoracotomy. 
Stapes surgery: complications and airway infection. From a group of 1,111 patients who had stapedectomy or stapedotomy performed in a 10-year period, a thorough investigation was made of 11 patients who had a total hearing loss and 8 patients who developed a partial sensorineural hearing loss after operation. The data obtained indicate that postoperative infection with influenza virus may be responsible for unexpected complications following stapedectomy. A close relation was found between the appearance of complications and periods of epidemics of influenza. 
Carotenoids and liposoluble vitamins in liver cirrhosis. The role played by carotenoids, retinol and tocopherol in quencing oxidative cellular damage and combatting tumor growth is well documented, but little is known about their activity in human liver cirrhosis (LC), where oxidative damage and tumoral complications are common-place. We investigated 59 patients with LC of different etiology on admission to hospital and compared them with 32 healthy controls, matched for age and sex. Nutritional (cutaneous skinfolds, creatinine-height index) and serum parameters were determined; of these, alpha- and beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lycopene, retinol and alpha-tocopherol were detected by an high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) technique, devised in our laboratory, which afforded an accurate and simultaneous resolution of all six compounds. The results point to a significant reduction in almost all the vitamin factors in LC, as well as in total serum lipids. In consequence, the ratio tocopherol/total serum lipids remains almost unchanged: 2.45 +/- 0.08 (m +/- se) in controls and 2.34 +/- 0.16 in patients. The effects of age, sex, nutritional habits, alcohol, malnutrition and the severity of the disease were also evaluated in relation to the vitamin-factor levels. It is suggested that the reduced levels observed in LC patients are due to a number of factors including portal hypertension and lymphatic circulation impairment, and it is concluded that thorough screening and improved diet are beneficial in the follow-up of LC. 
Intracellular compartmentation of cardiac troponin T and its release kinetics in patients with reperfused and nonreperfused myocardial infarction. In a previous study on the diagnostic efficiency of troponin T measurements in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the authors found a high variability of troponin T serum concentration changes on day 1 in patients with AMI who underwent thrombolytic treatment. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to investigate the intracellular compartmentation of troponin T and to analyze the effects of AMI reperfusion on the appearance kinetics of cardiac troponin T in serum. Cardiac troponin T was measured with a newly developed bideterminant sandwich assay using cardiospecific, affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies and peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody. An unbound cytosolic troponin T pool was found in ultracentrifuged homogenates of myocardial tissue of different species ranging from 0.013 to 0.036 mg/g wet weight. The soluble troponin T molecule had electrophoretic properties identical to troponin T compartmented in the myofibrils. The clinical study group comprised 57 patients with AMI undergoing thrombolytic treatment. Blood flow to the infarct zone and point of time of reperfusion were tested by immediate and late angiography. The appearance of troponin T in serum on day 1 after the onset of AMI depended strongly on reperfusion and on duration of ischemia before reperfusion. Thus, in patients with early reperfused AMI, a marked peak in troponin T serum concentrations was found at 14 hours after the onset of pain. This early troponin T peak was absent in patients with AMI reperfusion occurring greater than 5.5 hours after the onset of pain and in patients with nonreperfused AMI. By contrast, the kinetics of troponin T release after the first day after AMI were unaffected by reperfusion. 
Adenomatoid hyperplasia of minor salivary glands. Adenomatoid hyperplasia of minor salivary glands is an uncommon clinicopathologic entity. It comprises clinical swelling resembling a neoplasm with a histologic picture of aggregates of normal-appearing salivary gland tissue in excess of that anticipated for the anatomic site. The significance of this lesion is derived from its clinical resemblance to a neoplasm of salivary gland origin. This study adds 40 new cases to the literature and analyzes their clinical and histologic features. Most of the lesions were located on the hard and soft palates. The exact nature of the minor salivary gland hyperplasia is not clear. Some of the cases may represent a hamartoma or a reactive hyperplasia, but in most cases the nature of the hyperplasia is idiopathic. 
Sonography of focal lesions of the spleen. The sonographic appearances of benign and malignant splenic lesions in 154 patients are illustrated. Sixty-six of the 154 patients had malignant splenic lesions; 55 of these had malignant lymphoma and 11 had splenic metastatic lesions. The lesions were hypoechoic in 64 cases (97%), including all cases of malignant lymphoma, and were hyperechoic in two. Eighty-eight patients had benign splenic lesions; findings included cysts, infarcts, abscesses, hemangiomas, and calcifications. 
"Ex vivo" release of eicosanoid from human brain tissue: its relevance in the development of brain edema. The specific mechanism underlying the genesis of vasogenic brain edema is still debated: the role of arachidonic acid is considered extremely important, as it is a possible activator of self-maintaining reactions enhancing the release of vasoactive and cytotoxic compounds. The relationship between arachidonic acid metabolism and brain edema has been studied primarily in brain tissue samples or in the extracellular fluid, whereas the residual capacity of perilesional tissue to synthesize and release eicosanoids has not been investigated. In the present study, perilesional samples of brain tissue were available from 4 patients operated on for brain metastasis, from 8 patients who had malignant neuroepithelial tumors, from 4 with meningiomas, and from 5 with subarachnoid hemorrhage. A brain edema index was calculated from the preoperative computed tomographic scan. The "ex vivo" method allowed determination of the residual capacity of endogenous arachidonic acid metabolism. The edema index is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis (6.5 +/- 0.8) and neuroepithelial tumors (3.6 +/- 0.2) than in those with meningiomas (1.5 +/- 0.06), subarachnoid hemorrhage (1.7 +/- 0.18), and in controls. In patients with metastatic and neuroepithelial tumors there is a significant correlation between peritumoral brain edema and the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 (P less than 0.05); the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 is also significantly elevated after subarachnoid hemorrhage (13.91 +/- 2.6 ng/ml of incubation medium) when compared with control cases (5.56 +/- 0.91). The capacity to synthesize prostacyclin is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis than in those with neuroepithelial tumors and meningiomas (P less than 0.05). 
Loss of heterozygosity suggests multiple genetic alterations in pheochromocytomas and medullary thyroid carcinomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific loci may help localize tumor suppressor genes involved in the formation of various familial and sporadic tumors. In addition, the genetic loci for a number of familial tumor syndromes have been mapped by linkage analysis. To explore the possible role of tumor suppressor genes in endocrine tumors, we tested 41 pheochromocytomas (34 sporadic and 7 familial) and 11 medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) (10 sporadic and 1 familial) for LOH near a variety of potentially important genetic loci: (a) the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) locus on chromosome 10; (b) the von Hippel-Lindau locus on 3p; and (c) the p53 and neurofibromatosis 1 loci on 17. We also examined chromosomes 1p and 22q because previous studies in a small number of pheochromocytomas and MTCs suggested LOH in these regions. Background rates for LOH were assessed using several "random" probes. Finally, we examined a number of clinical and histologic characteristics of these tumors for possible correlations with specific genetic alterations. LOH in the region of the MEN 2A locus was uncommon (0% for MTCs, 5% for pheochromocytomas). However, we found significant allelic losses in pheochromocytomas on chromosomes 1p (42%), 3p (16%), 17p (24%), and 22q (31%). We also noted a correlation between LOH on 1p and urinary excretion of metanephrine by these patients (P = 0.02). LOH on 1p, 3p, and 17p also appeared to be associated with increased tumor volume. Analysis of the smaller number of MTCs demonstrated allelic losses on chromosomes 1p and 22q. Our results suggest that tumor formation and/or progression in pheochromocytomas and MTCs involves multiple genes, analogous with the model proposed for colon carcinoma. 
Differences in the leucine aminopeptidase activity in extracts from human prostatic carcinoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Extracts of tissue showed that prostatic carcinomas contain less leucine aminopeptidase activity than benign prostatic hyperplasia. This is true when activity is expressed as specific activity (P = 0.0033), specific activity/% epithelium (P = 0.0007), activity/wet weight of tissue (P = 0.0028), or activity/wet weight of tissue/% epithelium (P = 0.0005). Almost all histochemically demonstrable activity is located in the epithelium. Enzymatic activities in extracts and in histochemical preparations showed similar differences between carcinoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia and were related (R = -0.38, P = 0.0400) to Gleason's grades. The transurethrally resected prostate cancers studied contained no well-differentiated tumors and a high proportion of poorly differentiated tumors. Histochemical activity is absent in most prostatic carcinomas and decreased in others. This observation is particularly interesting in view of the growing knowledge of tumor suppressor genes. 
Dopaminergic induced changes in cognitive and motor processing in Parkinson's disease: an electrophysiological investigation. Event-related potentials and reaction time measures to auditory discrimination tasks of graded difficulty were used to separate cognitive from motor processing time in 27 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated Parkinson's disease and later on optimal levodopa treatment. Before treatment event-related potential P3 and task performance were normal but the reaction time was prolonged compared with age matched controls. After treatment P3 latency was significantly prolonged and the reaction time reduced suggesting a dopamine induced dissociation between cognitive and motor processing. In early Parkinson's disease cognitive processing time remains normal but the motor processing time is prolonged. Dopamine replacement is followed by significantly reduced motor processing time despite increased cognitive processing time. Motor processing may reflect the dopamine status of the putamen whereas dopaminergic over-stimulation of other regions may adversely affect cognitive processing in patients treated with levodopa. 
Thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in essential thrombocythemia. A retrospective study of 103 patients. A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events. 
Treatment of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia. Herpes zoster results from reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus. It is most common in elderly patients and immunosuppressed patients, especially those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Zoster is often the earliest indicator of HIV infection. The acute course of herpes zoster is generally benign, but systemic complications may be fatal. Postherpetic neuralgia is the major chronic complication and is a difficult management problem. High-dose acyclovir (800 mg orally five times daily) has recently been approved for treatment of herpes zoster and, if started early, decreases the duration and severity of symptoms. In the prevention of postherpetic neuralgia, acyclovir does not appear to be effective, and the efficacy of steroids is questionable. The best therapy currently available for postherpetic neuralgia is amitriptyline, topical capsaicin and transcutaneous electrical stimulation. 
Effect of octreotide (SMS 201-995) on meal-stimulated pancreatic secretion in three patients with external pancreatic fistula. Octreotide (SMS 201-995) is a long-acting somatostatin analogue that inhibits both basal and secretin-cholecystokinin-stimulated pancreatic secretion. This study assesses the effect of this compound on pancreatic secretion induced by ordinary meals. Three patients with stable secretion of pure pancreatic juice from high output pancreatic fistula were studied. In all three, meal ingestion caused a marked and prolonged increase in pancreatic juice flow, and in bicarbonate and protein output. The subcutaneous injection of 50 micrograms octreotide before meals almost totally prevented (by about 90%) this increase. The inhibitory effect of octreotide on postprandial pancreatic secretion appeared soon, and persisted for the duration of the study period (8 h). 
Treatment with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha protects rats against the lethality, hypotension, and hypothermia of gram-negative sepsis. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a peptide secreted by macrophages in response to endotoxin that can produce many of the changes seen in septic shock. After cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) rats gradually develop tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and hypothermia. At 5 h post-CLP, rats have a peak in serum levels of endotoxin and 60% of rats have blood cultures that grow Gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia). At 20 h post-CLP all rats develop positive blood cultures. Serum levels of TNF are not reproducibly measurable in rats following CLP. Rats undergoing CLP have a 50-80% mortality with deaths usually occurring 24-72 h postinjury. Repetitive (twice daily x 6 d) i.p. injection of sublethal doses of recombinant human TNF-alpha (100 micrograms/kg) to rats undergoing CLP 1 d after the treatment period resulted in a significant reduction in mortality compared to control rats previously unexposed to rTNF (P less than 0.03). Animals treated with rTNF had no hypotension or hypothermia after CLP and regained normal food intake faster than control rats. 12 h after CLP the gene expression for manganous superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an inducible mitochondrial metalloenzyme responsible for cellular resistance to injury from toxic reactive oxygen species, was higher in livers of rats treated with rTNF suggesting that the TNF treatment augmented expression of this protective enzyme. Unlike MnSOD, expression of the gene for copper-zinc SOD was not affected by CLP or rTNF treatment. The results suggest that prior treatment with recombinant TNF can ameliorate the lethality, hypotension, hypothermia, and anorexia of Gram-negative sepsis in rats and that the mechanism may be related to enhanced hepatic expression of the gene for MnSOD. Repeated administration of recombinant TNF may be a strategy to minimize mortality and morbidity of Gram-negative sepsis. 
Reflux esophagitis therapy: sucralfate versus ranitidine in a double blind multicenter trial. Sucralfate (Sc) suspension 6 g/day and ranitidine (Rn) tablets, 150 mg, were compared in 125 patients in a double-blind, multicenter, endoscopically controlled trial in the treatment of reflux esophagitis. Inclusion criteria were symptomatic reflux (number and severity of attacks) and endoscopic evidence of esophagitis (grades 1 to 4). Clinical assessments were performed on entry, and at 4 and at 8 weeks, and endoscopy was repeated at 8 weeks. Sc suspension and Rn placebo or Sc placebo and Rn tablets were taken on waking and immediately before retiring at night. Of the 125 patients, 27 were withdrawn because of default (Rn = 4; Sc = 14), noncompliance (Rn = 1; Sc = 2), or the development of congestive cardiac failure (Rn = 1), diarrhea (Rn = 1; Sc = 1), nausea (Sc = 1), constipation (Sc = 1), and hematemesis (Sc = 1). Analysis was performed on the remaining 98 patients, 43 of whom had been treated with Sc and 55 with Rn. Heartburn, acid regurgitation, epigastric pain, dysphagia, and chest pain were relieved in 34% vs 40%, 67% vs 72%, 71% vs 57%, and 86% vs 63% for Sc and Rn, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups. Endoscopic healing occurred in 47% of the Sc- and in 31% of the Rn-treated patients (chi 2 = 2.50), and healing or improvement was noted in 81% of the Sc- and 64% of the Rn-treated patients. This difference approached statistical significance (chi 2 = 3.73). There was no obvious endoscopic benefit in 8 of the 43 and 20 of the 55 patients in the groups treated with Sc and Rn, respectively. Although the findings with sucralfate and ranitidine in patients with reflux esophagitis completing the trial suggest a benefit of these agents, the absence of a placebo control group and the high default rates, particularly for those receiving sucralfate, preclude any firm conclusions as to relative or specific efficacy of these agents in this condition. 
Vestibular autorotation test asymmetry analysis of acoustic neuromas. The vestibular autorotation test (VAT) measures the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) response from 2 to 6 Hz, during 18 seconds of active head movements, while the patient attempts to fixate on a wall-mounted target. A new method of measuring eye velocity asymmetry from VAT data is presented, based on computer estimation of the 0th harmonics of discrete Fourier spectra over short segments of digital eye and head velocity records. Eye asymmetries greater than a 3% normal range are shown to be directionally correlated with the side of the lesions in patients with unilateral labyrinthectomies. Among patients with a diagnosis of acoustic neuroma, who were tested preoperatively with the VAT, nine of nine patients showed eye asymmetries greater than 3% toward the side of the neuroma. Those patients with acoustic neuromas who have sufficiently vigorous high-frequency head responses showed mean percentages of eye asymmetry that were linearly correlated with the size of the acoustic neuroma. These results suggest that VAT high-frequency asymmetry provides a useful method of diagnostic evaluation of the side and extent of unilateral peripheral lesions. 
Antiischemic and metabolic effects of glutamate during pacing in patients with stable angina pectoris secondary to either coronary artery disease or syndrome X. The effects of glutamate on anginal threshold, cardiac metabolism and hemodynamics were studied in 11 patients with stable angina pectoris, positive stress test results, and pacing-induced myocardial lactate release due to coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 9) or syndrome X (n = 2). Data were obtained before, during and after 2 identical periods of coronary sinus pacing, the second being preceded by an intravenous injection of monosodium glutamate 1.2 (n = 7) or 2.5 (n = 4) mg/kg body weight. After glutamate administration, pacing time to onset of angina increased from mean +/- standard deviation 103 +/- 53 to 166 +/- 71 seconds (p less than 0.01) and ST-segment depression after pacing decreased from 2.3 +/- 1.0 to 1.6 +/- 1.1 mm (p less than 0.01). Arterial glutamate concentration increased 60% (p less than 0.01) after the low dose and 150% (p less than 0.01) after the high dose of glutamate. Regardless of dose, myocardial glutamate uptake increased by 25% (p less than 0.01). Pacing-induced cardiac release of lactate diminished 50% (p less than 0.05), whereas the releases of xanthine and hypoxanthine were unchanged by glutamate. Arterial free fatty acids decreased 20% (p less than 0.01). Circulating levels and cardiac exchanges of alanine, glucose and citrate were unchanged. Glutamate did not influence heart rate, arterial blood pressure, coronary blood flow, coronary vascular resistance or myocardial oxygen consumption. One patient complained of short-lasting burning sensations after receiving the high glutamate dose. In conclusion, augmented provision of glutamate enhances pacing tolerance in stable angina, presumably by a metabolic improvement of cardiac energy production during ischemia. 
The effect of 'detailing' on physicians' prescribing behavior for postsurgical narcotic analgesia. Physicians have been frequently reported to prescribe inadequately pain medication in the hospitalized patient. A number of methods and techniques have been attempted to alter this phenomenon including audit, standard setting, drug utilization evaluation and sanctioning. The purpose of the following study was to demonstrate the behavioral efficacy of the technique of detailing. We reviewed the postsurgical records of 320 patients for pre-established criteria on the administration of meperidine before and after detailing of the proper prescribing with regard to timing and dose. The data show 30% of the sample meeting the criteria before detailing and 43% after detailing had been given. We conclude the method of detailing can be effective in altering physician's prescribing behavior for meperidine in postoperative surgical patients. 
A new approach to the assessment of tomographic thallium-201 scintigraphy in patients with left bundle branch block. To determine whether a new approach to interpretation could improve the accuracy of thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detection of left anterior descending coronary artery disease in patients with left bundle branch block, 69 patients were evaluated. Forty-four had angiographically proved coronary artery disease; the remaining 25 were considered to have a "low" (mean 13.5 +/- 6.4%, range 3.4% to 24.9%) likelihood of disease before thallium-201 scintigraphy. The conventional scintigraphic criterion for detection of left anterior descending artery disease (septal, anterior or apical defects) was compared with a new criterion that required the apex to be abnormal to indicate left anterior descending disease. The normalcy rates in the low likelihood patient group were significantly improved by using the new approach, from 16% to 80% (p less than 0.0001) by visual analysis and from 24% to 64% (p = 0.003) by quantitative SPECT polar map analysis. The sensitivity for left anterior descending disease was similar for the conventional and the new method by visual (100% vs. 94%) and quantitative (100% vs. 83%) analyses. In contrast, the specificity was significantly improved by using the new approach, from 14% to 79% (p = 0.0006) by visual analysis and 14% to 64% (p = 0.007) by quantitative analysis. In conclusion, septal and anterior thallium-201 SPECT defects are common in patients with left bundle branch block without coronary artery disease, resulting in low specificity for left anterior descending artery disease. The normalcy rates and accuracy for detection of left anterior descending coronary artery disease were significantly better when an apical defect was used as the criterion for disease. 
Fatty infiltration of the liver: quantification with phase-contrast MR imaging at 1.5 T vs biopsy. Quantification of hepatic fat content by application of MR phase-contrast imaging (Dixon method) at 1.5 T was compared with results of biopsy in 16 patients with a variety of liver abnormalities. Motion artifact was suppressed by employing six or eight averages of short TR in-phase (echo offset, 0 msec), out-of-phase (echo offset, 1.1 msec), and in-phase (echo offset, 2.2 msec) spin-echo pulse sequences. The 360 degree out-of-phase sequence was used to assess the impact of T2* decay on this method of estimating fat fraction. A standard two-echo long TR sequence also was obtained in all patients. Histologic preparations from the biopsy specimens were examined by a pathologist who had no knowledge of the MR results and were graded according to overall visual assessment as belonging to one of four categories of fat fraction. Results of the MR-calculated apparent fat fraction were compared directly with biopsy category and were also placed in MR fat fraction categories, allowing estimation of the statistical correlation between the biopsy and MR grading systems. Eight of eight patients with biopsy categories indicating a fat fraction of less than 0.25 were computed by MR to have a fat fraction of less than 0.1. Seven of eight patients with biopsy categories indicating a fat fraction of greater than 0.25 were computed by MR to have a fat fraction of at least 0.24. The MR-calculated apparent fat fraction category correlated significantly with the histologic biopsy category (r = .86, p less than .01). When compared with the in-phase image, decreased signal from liver was visually apparent on the 180 degree out-of-phase images in all cases in which the fat fraction was at least 0.24, but there was no indication of fatty liver on the standard T1- or T2-weighted images. Calculated T2 also showed no correlation with degree of fatty deposition. Correction for T2* decay by using the 360 degree out-of-phase acquisition in addition to the standard 0 degree and 180 degree out-of-phase images had little effect on fat fraction computation. Phase-contrast MR is a promising noninvasive method for quantitative assessment of fatty deposition in the liver. 
Brain in eclampsia: MR imaging with clinical correlation. Cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed on eight consecutive patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures caused by eclampsia. Each patient underwent serial neurologic examinations until all symptoms resolved. Six of those eight patients underwent follow-up MR imaging. These patients were compared with those in previous case reports of MR imaging abnormalities of the brain in eclampsia. MR imaging typically demonstrates bilateral hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images and iso- to hypointense lesions on T1-weighted images. MR imaging abnormalities are most commonly located in the distribution of the posterior cerebral circulation and are associated with visual disturbances. Basal ganglia and deep white matter lesions are less common and are associated with mental status changes. Most lesions seen at MR imaging in patients with eclampsia are reversible. 
Comparative rates of desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors by the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase and the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Three separate processes may contribute to rapid beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization: functional uncoupling from the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs, mediated by phosphorylation of the receptors by two distinct kinases, the specific beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) and the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), as well as a spatial uncoupling via sequestration of the receptors away from the cell surface. To evaluate the relative importance and potential role of the various processes in different physiological situations, a kinetic analysis of these three mechanisms was performed in permeabilized A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. To allow a separate analysis of each mechanism, inhibitors of the various desensitization mechanisms were used: heparin to inhibit beta ARK, the PKA inhibitor peptide PKI to inhibit PKA, and concanavalin A treatment to prevent sequestration. Isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of beta 2 receptors in these cells by beta ARK occurred with a t1/2 of less than 20 sec, whereas phosphorylation by PKA had a t1/2 of about 2 min. Similarly, beta ARK-mediated desensitization of the receptors proceeded with a t1/2 of less than 15 sec, and PKA-mediated desensitization with a t1/2 of about 3.5 min. Maximal desensitization mediated by the two kinases corresponded to a reduction of the signal-transduction capacity of the receptor/adenylyl cyclase system by about 60% in the case of beta ARK and by about 40% in the case of PKA. Receptor sequestration was much slower (t1/2 of about 10 min) and involved no more than 30% of the cell surface receptors. It is concluded that beta ARK-mediated phosphorylation is the most rapid and quantitatively most important factor contributing to the rapid desensitization. This rapidity of the beta ARK-mediated mechanism makes it particularly well suited to regulate beta-adrenergic receptor function in rapidly changing environments such as the synaptic cleft. 
Use of parenteral medium-chain triglyceride emulsion for maintaining seizure control in a 5-year-old girl with intractable diarrhea. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are an important component of an enteral ketogenic diet for seizure control. Previously, it was difficult to maintain ketosis when parenteral (iv) nutrition therapy was necessary. The use of iv MCT in a 5-year-old girl with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who had diarrhea and dehydration is reported. Conventional 20% iv fat emulsion (long-chain triglycerides, LCT) and dextrose free hyperalimentation (HAL) in a 4:1 ketogenic ratio did not maintain adequate ketosis during bowel rest. Compassionate use of iv MCT (Clintec Nutrition) infused as a 70:30 MCT/LCT ratio plus HAL maintained moderate ketosis. Seizures were well controlled during the iv MCT regimen, which allowed normal daily functioning. Complications included abnormal liver function tests and severe iron deficiency anemia of unknown etiology. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels increased to 1717 mg/dl and 614 mg/dl, respectively, but decreased with a reduction of lipid infusion and use of an antihyperlipemic drug. Nutritional status was maintained. In this case, iv MCT proved to be a relatively safe and effective short-term method of continuing parenteral nutrition while maintaining ketosis for seizure control. 
Management of traumatic injuries to the facial nerve. Penetrating and nonpenetrating trauma to the head and neck produces myriad injuries to the facial nerve. This article presents a rationale of management of neural injury, emphasizing extracranial and intratemporal trauma and techniques of neurorrhaphy. 
Defenses against oxidation in human erythrocytes: role of glutathione reductase in the activation of glucose decarboxylation by hemolytic drugs. We have used 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, a selective inhibitor of oxidized glutathione reductase (GSSG-R), to examine the role of this enzyme in regulating the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMS) and to explore how a variety of agents influence glucose decarboxylation in intact human red blood cells (RBCs). Substances tested included primaquine and several other drugs that are specially hemolytic and methemoglobinemic in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and related disorders. The results allowed us to distinguish and quantitate contrasting modes of HMS stimulation and to clarify how RBCs respond to different classes of oxidants. Some agents like methylene blue (MB), phenazine methosulfate, and pyrroline carboxylate do not require GSSG-R to increase CO2 production; they activate G6PD and 6-phosphogluconic dehydrogenase by directly oxidizing reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). Other compounds, like ascorbate, nitrofurantoin, and doxorubicin, oxidize GSH primarily; CO2 increases indirectly only when GSSG-R, activated by glutathione disulfide (GSSG), raises the level of NADP. Chemicals like primaquine, daunorubicin, and methylphenylazoformate trigger the HMS by independently oxidizing both NADPH and GSH. Unlike MB, most drugs that are hemolytic in G6PD deficiency activate the HMS in a manner that depends to a variable extent on GSSG-R. This variability may explain hitherto puzzling clinical and pharmacogenetic differences between primaquine and diaminodiphenylsulfone-induced hemolysis. 
Effect of transient coronary occlusion on coronary blood flow autoregulation, vasodilator reserve and response to adenosine in the dog. Myocardial ischemia of short duration (15 to 20 min) produces myocardial "stunning" during reperfusion. The vasoregulatory and contractile status of reperfused myocardium during normal and reduced perfusion pressures is of interest in the treatment of patients with unstable angina. In the present study the effects of 15 min of reversible ischemic injury on several aspects of coronary vasoregulation were assessed with use of pressure-flow curves in anesthetized open chest dogs. The left anterior descending coronary artery was cannulated and perfused with arterial blood with use of a servo-controlled roller pump. The autoregulatory gain and an adenosine dose-response curve for coronary flow before and after ischemia and reperfusion were obtained. The maximal autoregulatory gain values in the pressure range of 140 to 60 mm Hg were not significantly different before and after ischemia and reperfusion (0.41 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.06, p greater than 0.1). The adenosine dose-response curve was significantly shifted to the right after reperfusion; however, coronary blood flows during maximal adenosine vasodilation over a large range of perfusion pressures (140 to 60 mm Hg) were significantly greater after ischemia and reperfusion. The pressure-dependent decrease in segment shortening (sonomicrometry) over the coronary pressure range of 160 to 30 mm Hg was similar in myocardium before and after stunning. Contractile function in the stunned myocardium at normal (100 mm Hg) and low (40 mm Hg) coronary perfusion pressures was similarly and significantly enhanced by the administration of adenosine. It is concluded that 1) coronary autoregulation is unchanged after brief ischemia and reperfusion; 2) although maximal coronary vascular conductance assessed with adenosine is greater after ischemia, the coronary circulation shows a decreased coronary sensitivity to exogenous adenosine; 3) the relation of contractile function to coronary pressure before and after stunning is unchanged; and 4) enhancement of function in stunned myocardium by vasodilation with adenosine occurs at low and normal perfusion pressures. 
Ultrasonographic diagnosis of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis in pregnancy. Color flow imaging combined with compression ultrasonography were used to prospectively evaluate symptomatic patients first seen with suspected deep vein thrombosis during pregnancy. The incidence of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (7 of 10,000 deliveries) shown prospectively by ultrasonography was similar to that of historic controls who had a diagnosis confirmed by venography (11 of 26,191 deliveries). A preferential pattern of proximal left-sided iliac or femoral vein involvement was common to both cohorts, being seen in five of the seven cases diagnosed by ultrasonography and eight of the eleven cases diagnosed by venography. We conclude that ultrasonography, consisting of compression ultrasonography and color flow imaging, can replace venography in the diagnosis and evaluation of the extent of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis during pregnancy. 
Antenatal diagnosis of fetal splenic cyst. A case report. Antenatal ultrasonography detected a fetal splenic cyst at 35 weeks' gestation. Serial ultrasonography and follow-up neonatal ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a solitary splenic cyst. The finding of asymptomatic but potentially serious fetal lesions allows optimum management of the newborn infant and adds to the benefits of antenatal sonography. 
Ovulation induction by step-down administration of purified urinary follicle-stimulating hormone in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The step-down method can be an alternative method of ovulation induction in women with PCOS. This protocol can induce ovulation with a smaller dose of FSH and with lower incidence of excessive ovarian enlargement in comparison with the traditional fixed-dose administration method. 
Human hepatocyte growth factor in blood of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. I. Clinical aspects. The levels of human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) in sera obtained from patients with various liver diseases were determined using adult rat hepatocytes maintained in primary culture. The mean hHGF activity for 22 patients with fulminant hepatic failure was about nine times greater than that found in normal human serum. The increase in serum hHGF activity seen in two patients with "acute-on-chronic" hepatitis was similar to that found in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The serum level of hHGF from patients with acute hepatitis is related to the stage of their illness. The average value for 31 patients was about three times that of normal human serum. In some patients, the time course for the increase in serum hHGF activity was similar to that demonstrated for alpha-fetoprotein. The mean hHGF activity in serum for the 33 patients with chronic hepatitis and from 25 patients with liver cirrhosis was increased also compared with that of normal human serum. In addition, serum hHGF activity in three of seven patients studied after partial hepatectomy for a space-occupying lesion of the liver was increased. These data suggest that the increase in serum hHGF activity present in patients with various liver diseases reflects a self-defense mechanism that is involved in the process of liver cell regeneration. 
PUVA-induced lymphomatoid papulosis in a patient with mycosis fungoides. The occurrence of lymphomatoid papulosis in patients with cutaneous lymphoma, particularly mycosis fungoides, has been described in medical literature. A 68-year-old woman affected by mycosis fungoides in the plaque stage noticed that multiple papulonodular lesions of lymphomatoid papulosis developed suddenly after a few sessions of PUVA therapy. The PUVA induction of lymphomatoid papulosis was confirmed by the appearance of new lesions after a second cycle of PUVA exposure on a limited area of the body. Complete regression of all PUVA-induced lymphomatoid papulosis lesions was achieved within a few weeks with oral prednisone and topical steroids. During the entire treatment the patches and plaques of mycosis fungoides persisted unchanged. 
Possible Behcet's disease revealed by pulmonary aneurysms. Behcet's disease (BD) is a multisystem disease which may affect many organ systems in addition to the originally described triple symptom complex. Pulmonary aneurysm is one of the rare complications of the disease. We report a case of bilateral pulmonary aneurysm in which usual criteria for the clinical diagnosis of BD were absent and we believe that pulmonary aneurysm could be the first appearance of the disease. 
Ophthalmoplegia with headache. Be aware of diabetes. Cranial neuropathy affecting the eyes is a possible symptom of type II diabetes. In this article, Dr Dickerman describes a case in which diabetes was diagnosed in a 63-year-old woman who presented with unilateral headache and eye pain. 
Pulmonary and chest wall mechanics in anesthetized paralyzed humans. Pulmonary and chest wall mechanics were studied in 18 anesthetized paralyzed supine humans by use of the technique of rapid airway occlusion during constant-flow inflation. Analysis of the changes in transpulmonary pressure after flow interruption allowed partitioning of the overall resistance of the lung (RL) into two compartments, one (Rint,L) reflecting airway resistance and the other (delta RL) representing the viscoelastic properties of the pulmonary tissues. Similar analysis of the changes in esophageal pressure indicates that chest wall resistance (RW) was due entirely to the viscoelastic properties of the chest wall tissues (delta RW = RW). In line with previous measurements of airway resistance, Rint,L increased with increasing flow and decreased with increasing volume. The opposite was true for both delta RL and delta RW. This behavior was interpreted in terms of a viscoelastic model that allowed computation of the viscoelastic constants of the lung and chest wall. This model also accounts for frequency, volume, and flow dependence of elastance of the lung and chest wall. Static and dynamic elastances, as well as delta R, were higher for the lung than for the chest wall. 
Randomised study of antiepileptic drug withdrawal in patients in remission. Medical Research Council Antiepileptic Drug Withdrawal Study Group A prospective multicentre randomised study of continued antiepileptic treatment vs slow withdrawal was conducted in 1013 patients who had been free of seizures for at least 2 years. Comparison of randomised and eligible, but non-randomised, patients suggests the results should be applicable to a wider patient population. By 2 years after randomisation, 78% of patients in whom treatment was continued and 59% of those in whom it was withdrawn remained seizure free, but thereafter the differences between the two groups diminished. Non-compliance with continued treatment accounted for only a small proportion of the risk to the group continuing with treatment. The most important factors determining outcome were longer seizure-free periods (reducing the risk) and more than one antiepileptic drug and a history of tonic-clonic seizures (increasing the risk). Other factors (eg, history of neonatal seizures, specific electroencephalographic features) seemed to have smaller effects, but even in such a large study the confidence intervals for these observations were wide. 
Comparison of monoclonal immunocytochemical and immunoenzymatic methods for steroid receptor evaluation in breast cancer. The production of monoclonal antibodies against estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) has permitted the development of the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunocytochemical assay (ICA) for steroid receptor determination. The results obtained with these two techniques, using the same monoclonal antibodies, were compared in a large series of breast carcinomas (187 for ER and 100 for PR). The correlation between these methods was significant for ER (rs = 0.54) and PR (rs = 0.55) (P less than 0.001) but was lost when the receptor concentrations determined by EIA were less than or equal to 15 and less than or equal to 30 fmol/mg protein for ER and PR, respectively. When these values are considered as cutoffs, the concordance between the two methods was 84.5% for ER and 73% for PR. An analysis of discordant results revealed that low epithelial cellularity generally was present in ICA-positive, EIA-negative specimens, whereas only focal positivity with ICA, or positivity of only normal peripheral mammary ducts and lobules, frequently was found in ICA-negative, EIA-positive tumors. In conclusion, there is good correlation between the results obtained by EIA and ICA methods for detection of ER and PR. The authors suggest that biochemical and histochemical methods for steroid receptors could be considered complementary and used together for the analysis of breast cancer. 
Comparison of muscle sympathetic responses to hemorrhage and lower body negative pressure in humans. We compared changes in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) during graded lower body negative pressure (LBNP) and 450 ml of hemorrhage in nine healthy volunteers. During LBNP, central venous pressure (CVP) decreased from 6.1 +/- 0.4 to 4.5 +/- 0.5 (LBNP -5 mmHg), 3.4 +/- 0.6 (LBNP -10 mmHg), and 2.3 +/- 0.6 mmHg (LBNP -15 mmHg), and there were progressive increases in SNA at each level of LBNP. The slope relating percent change in SNA to change in CVP during LBNP (mean +/- SE) was 27 +/- 11%/mmHg. Hemorrhage of 450 ml at a mean rate of 71 +/- 5 ml/min decreased CVP from 6.1 +/- 0.5 to 3.7 +/- 0.5 mmHg and increased SNA by 47 +/- 11%. The increase in SNA during hemorrhage was not significantly different from the increase in SNA predicted by the slope relating percent change in SNA to change in CVP during LBNP. These data show that nonhypotensive hemorrhage causes sympathoexcitation and that sympathetic responses to LBNP and nonhypotensive hemorrhage are similar in humans. 
Mesenteric vein thrombosis associated with a familial deficiency of free protein S. Signs and symptoms of an acute intra-abdominal emergency developed in a 26-year-old man; this emergency prompted surgical exploration. It was discovered that he had a devitalized small bowel as a result of mesenteric vein thrombosis. An extensive evaluation for hypercoagulable states disclosed that he had a normal total protein S concentration, but by assay and on crossed immunoelectrophoresis studies, he had a decreased concentration of free protein S. A family study demonstrated protein S deficiency in his father and in a sister. On a subsequent determination, the propositus had a decreased concentration of total protein S. This case illustrates the association of protein S deficiency with mesenteric thrombosis and serves to caution that a single determination of total protein S is not an adequate evaluation when the index of suspicion for a hypercoagulable state is high. 
Cocaine-associated chest pain. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical and ECG features of cocaine abusers evaluated in the emergency department and admitted to the medical coronary care unit with chest pain consistent with myocardial ischemia. DESIGN: A four-month retrospective review of all cocaine abusers who presented to the ED with chest pain and a diagnosis of possible myocardial infarction. SETTING: Urban county hospital. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight adult cocaine abusers admitted with chest pain. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients included 34 men and 14 women with a mean age of 29 +/- 7.3 years. The average duration of cocaine abuse in 28 patients for whom it was reported was 5 +/- 4.8 years. Chest pain occurred within one hour of cocaine abuse in 13 admissions (27%), more than one hour after abuse in 13 admissions (27%), and it was not recorded in 23 admissions (47%). Initial ECGs were evaluated in all patients and revealed significant repolarization abnormalities consisting of abnormal ST segment elevations in 18 (37%) and T-wave inversions in 20 (41%) that often persisted on subsequent ECGs. Three patients sustained acute myocardial infarctions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm a small but significant incidence of myocardial infarction in cocaine abusers presenting to the ED with chest pain. The chronicity of cocaine abuse, the persistence of ECG abnormalities, and the variable temporal relationship of chest pain to cocaine abuse suggest possible chronic myocardial changes as etiologies of ischemia. 
Inhibition of early atherogenesis in transgenic mice by human apolipoprotein AI. Epidemiological surveys have identified a strong inverse relationship between the amount in the plasma of high density lipoproteins (HDL), apolipoprotein AI (ApoA-I), the major protein component of HDL, and the risk for atherosclerosis in humans. It is not known if this relationship arises from a direct antiatherogenic effect of these plasma components or if it is the result of other factors also associated with increases in ApoA-I and HDL levels. Because some strains of mice are susceptible to diet-induced formation of preatherosclerotic fatty streak lesions, and because of available techniques for the genetic manipulation of this organism, the murine system offers a unique setting in which to investigate the process of early atherogenesis. To test the hypothesis that induction of a high plasma concentration of ApoA-I and HDL would inhibit this process, we studied the effects of atherogenic diets on transgenic mice expressing high amounts of human ApoA-I. We report that transgenic mice with high plasma ApoA-I and HDL levels were significantly protected from the development of fatty streak lesions. 
Congenital mitral regurgitation associated with total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage. Report of a rare combination. A case of congenital mitral regurgitation associated with total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, successfully treated surgically, is reported. To our knowledge, this combination has not been reported in the literature. 
Cholecystokinin cholescintigraphy: detection of abnormal gallbladder motor function in patients with chronic acalculous gallbladder disease. CCK cholescintigrams were performed in 374 patients with recurrent postprandial right upper quadrant pain, biliary colic, and a normal gallbladder sonogram and/or cholecystogram. The results of these examinations were correlated with the patients' final medical/surgical diagnoses. Twenty-seven patients recruited as control volunteers without objective clinical evidence of biliary disease also underwent CCK cholescintigraphy to determine if the degree of gallbladder contraction post-CCK differs in symptomatic versus asymptomatic subjects. Decreased gallbladder motor function was identified (maximal gallbladder ejection fraction response to CCK less than 35%) in 94% of patients with histopathologically confirmed chronic acalculous cholecystitis or the cystic duct syndrome and in 88% of patients clinically believed to have chronic acalculous biliary disease. Decreased gallbladder motor function does not distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic gallbladder disease. 
DNA/RNA content and proliferative fractions of colorectal carcinomas: a five-year prospective study relating flow cytometry to survival. In our prospective study, flow cytometric analysis of cellular DNA and RNA content was performed on unfixed fresh specimens of colorectal adenocarcinoma taken from 176 patients. Of the 176 tumors, 113 (64%) were aneuploid. There was no correlation between aneuploidy and tumor stage, grade, location, or size. After a median follow-up of 5.6 years, no correlation between DNA or RNA content and patient survival was found. DNA content alone was not an independent prognostic factor when the colorectal carcinomas were segregated by curable and incurable stages. However, normal mucosa, diploid tumors, and aneuploid tumors showed progressively higher proliferation and higher RNA and DNA indices. Proliferative fraction--defined as the percentage of cells in S + G2 and M phases of the cell cycle--was significantly related to ploidy and to Dukes' stage. Despite these correlations, we did not detect a significant influence of proliferative fraction on survival when patients were segregated above or below the mean proliferative fraction for all tumors. More accurate methods of identifying the proliferative fraction of tumor cells are currently being pursued. While the role of flow cytometry in the evaluation and management of patients with colorectal carcinoma is still undefined for a number of other cellular parameters, it seems unlikely that DNA index, RNA index, or the proliferative fractions calculated from the DNA histogram, will, of themselves, represent independent prognostic factors. 
Nutrition and alcoholic liver disease. While the rate of malnutrition is relatively modest in alcoholic patients without alcoholic liver disease, the rate of malnutrition is virtually 100% in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and/or alcoholic cirrhosis. The reasons for malnutrition in the alcoholic hepatitis patient include various factors such as anorexia, poor diet, malabsorption, and altered metabolic state. When the patient is hospitalized, the malnutrition frequently worsens because of fasting for tests, continued anorexia, and complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with severe acute hepatitis appear to be both hypermetabolic and hypercatabolic, whereas data are much more conflicting concerning patients with more stable liver disease. Most studies suggest that patients with alcoholic liver disease require at least 60 g of protein per day to maintain positive nitrogen balance. Consistent alterations in plasma amino acid profiles occur in alcoholic liver disease, and specialized nutritional formulations have been devised to correct this amino acid profile with the intent of improving overall nutritional status, hepatic encephalopathy, and mortality. The effects of nutritional support (including use of specialized products) on outcome, on acute hepatic encephalopathy, and on chronic or latent portal systemic encephalopathy are reviewed. 
The hospital costs of diagnostic procedures for colorectal cancer. Diagnosis for colorectal cancer is commonly made using either colonoscopy or double contrast barium enema techniques. To data, little attention has been paid to the comparative costs of these two procedures and the paper presents estimates of hospital costs for each, using data from the colorectal study being undertaken in Nottingham, U.K. Consideration is also given to procedure sensitivity and the frequency of referral to the alternative technique in cases of incomplete diagnosis. The paper presents the conditions under which a given technique may be considered cost-superior to its alternative but concludes that the absence of conclusive clinical trial data and other considerations precludes the identification of a definitively optimum technique from the economic point of view. 
Eyelid leishmaniasis in a patient with neurogenic ptosis. A patient with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis of the upper eyelid. Infection of this site is rare because eyelid movements usually prevent the sandfly vector from biting the skin there. It is postulated that the relative immobility of the upper eyelid in this patient was a major predisposing factor for the infection. 
Relationships between block-of-twitch and train-of-four fade in the mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation. The relationships between the block-of-twitch and train-of-four fade in the presence of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs (d-tubocurarine, vecuronium and pancuronium) were examined in vitro by measuring the contractile tension from mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. The slope of the block/fade relationship differed between onset of and recovery from neuromuscular block following single doses of d-tubocurarine, vecuronium or pancuronium. Decreasing the dose of d-tubocurarine or using a divided dose technique to accelerate onset (i.e., priming) increased the amount of fade for a given amount of block. In addition, the block/fade relationships for cumulative dosing and sequential dilution were the same when measurements were made at steady-state for several doses. It is concluded that the block/fade relationship in the mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation is variable, and is related to the time course of the neuromuscular block. In addition, the block/fade relationships for d-tubocurarine, vecuronium and pancuronium did not differ when determined at steady-state. 
Recurrent aortic graft infection following descending thoracic aorta to femoral artery bypass. A case report and review. This paper presents a patient who developed a recurrent aortic graft infection after a descending thoracic aorta to femoral artery bypass. The patient had previously undergone successful management of an infected aortobifemoral bypass by removal of the graft and revascularization of the lower extremities with axillofemoral bypasses. A general discussion of the management of infected aortic grafts is presented and a discussion of the management of this particular patient is presented in detail. 
Chronic periaortitis presenting as common bile duct obstruction. The case of a 67 year old woman is reported who presented with cholestatic jaundice and was found to have, in addition, an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Only at necropsy did histopathology show chronic periaortitis as the aetiology of a pancreatic head mass which, during life, mimicked a pancreatic neoplasm obstructing the bile and pancreatic ducts. 
Long-term follow-up of slipped capital femoral epiphysis. The data on 155 hips in 124 patients who had slipped capital femoral epiphysis were retrospectively reviewed at a mean follow-up of forty-one years after the onset of symptoms. The slips were classified, by the duration of symptoms, as acute, chronic, or acute on chronic. As determined by the head-shaft angle, 42 per cent of the slips were mild; 32 per cent, moderate; and 26 per cent, severe. Reduction was performed in thirty-nine hips, and realignment was done in sixty-five hips. Treatment of chronic slips included symptomatic only in 25 per cent of the hips, a spica cast in 30 per cent, pinning in 24 per cent, and osteotomy in 20 per cent. The Iowa hip-rating and the radiographic classification of degenerative joint disease were determined at follow-up; both worsened with increasing severity of the slip and when reduction or realignment had been done. Osteonecrosis (12 per cent) and chondrolysis (16 per cent) also were more common with increasing severity of the slip and when reduction or realignment had been performed; both led to a poor result. Deterioration over time was most marked with increasing severity of the slip. The natural history of the malunited slip is mild deterioration related to the severity of the slip and complications. Techniques of realignment are associated with a risk of appreciable complications and adversely affect the natural history of the disease. Regardless of the severity of the slip, pinning in situ provided the best long-term function and delay of degenerative arthritis, with a low risk of complications. 
Hydroxyethyl starch macromolecule and superoxide dismutase effects on myocardial reperfusion injury. Myocardial reperfusion injury may be due to biophysical changes (e.g., endothelial cell junctional separations), as well as biochemical mechanisms (e.g., oxygen free radical activity). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), a free radical scavenger, may be effective in reducing chemical injury. Fractions of hydroxyethyl starch (HES-Pz), a large macromolecule, have been shown to decrease microvascular permeability associated with reperfusion-induced biophysical alterations. A comparison of SOD to HES-Pz was performed using a canine model of 1-hour left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) clamping followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. Amounts of the test solution equal to 10% of the dog's blood volume were administered intraatrially to the animals just before release of the LAD clamp. Six dogs received Ringer's lactate, 7 were given 600,000 IU of SOD, 13 received 6% HES-Pz, and 9 were given SOD and HES-Pz. The ratio of infarct to area at risk was 20 +/- 3% in the control dogs receiving Ringer's lactate, 16 +/- 4% in animals receiving SOD alone (p = NS), 6 +/- 3% in dogs receiving HES-Pz alone (p less than 0.05), and 8 +/- 3% in dogs given a combination of SOD and HES-Pz (p less than 0.05). HES-Pz alone and with SOD significantly reduced reperfusion injury, although addition of SOD to HES-Pz did not have an additive effect. Appropriate-sized macromolecules may act by reducing ischemia-induced microvascular permeability. 
Epidemiology of subarachnoid hemorrhage in Finland from 1983 to 1985. The age-standardized incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage was 33/100,000/yr among Finnish men and 25/100,000/yr among Finnish women. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represented 11% of all strokes detected during 1983-1985 in the community-based stroke register in three areas of Finland. Age-standardized mortality from subarachnoid hemorrhage was 18/100,000/yr among men and 12/100,000/yr among women aged 25-74 years, representing in men 22% and in women 23% of all deaths from stroke in the register. The case-fatality rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage was high: 35% among men and 33% among women within 2 days after the onset of the stroke attack and 48% in men and 46% in women at 1 month. Our findings suggest that the incidence and mortality of subarachnoid hemorrhage in Finland are among the highest worldwide, although differences in criteria, study methods, and classification procedures reduce the comparability of studies from different countries. The occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage in our present study is also higher than that previously reported in this country. We believe that this is more likely due to changes in diagnostic classification and improvements in detection of the disease than to a real increase in the morbidity and mortality of subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Neural network analysis of serial cardiac enzyme data. A clinical application of artificial machine intelligence. There has been a recent resurgence of interest in the study and application of computerized neural networks within the broad field of artificial intelligence. These "intelligent machines" are modeled after biological nervous systems and are fundamentally different from the many computerized expert systems that previously have been introduced as clinical decision-making aids. The authors describe a neural network designed and trained to predict the probability of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on the analysis of paired sets of cardiac enzymes. The neural network predicted 24 of 24 (100%) AMIs and 27 of 29 (93%) No-AMIs when compared with a pathologist's interpretation of the patient's laboratory data (P less than 0.000001). The authors attempted to validate the network's diagnoses by two independent methods. When compared with echocardiogram and EKG for diagnosis of AMI, the neural network agreed with the cardiologist's interpretation in 12 of 14 (86%) AMIs and 1 of 3 (33%) No-AMIs, but the correlation was not statistically significant. Using autopsy outcome for validation, the neural network agreed with the anatomic evidence in 24 of 26 (92%) AMIs and 4 of 6 (67%) No-AMIs (P = 0.001). The authors conclude that neural networks can be successfully applied to the analysis of cardiac enzyme data and suggest that broader applications exist within the domain of clinical decision support. 
Bilateral retinal hamartomas in neurofibromatosis type 2. We report a case of bilateral retinal hamartomas in a child with neurofibromatosis type 2. This unique case demonstrates that a diversity of retinal changes can occur in this disease. 
New technique of esophageal exclusion for chronic esophageal perforation. A new technique of near-total esophageal exclusion was used successfully in the treatment of 2 patients with chronic thoracic esophageal perforation and continuing sepsis. The most striking point of this technique is the use of cervical T-tube esophagostomy with the lower arm of the T tube circumfixed by chromic catgut tie to prevent swallowing of saliva. Whereas most of the previously reported procedures of cervical esophageal diversion require subsequent esophageal reconstruction, this technique is simple and effective and does not require a second operation. 
MR imaging of CSF-like choroidal fissure and parenchymal cysts of the brain. The purposes of this study were to delineate the MR characteristics of CSF-like parenchymal or fissural cysts of the brain and to correlate them with the clinical findings. Clinical data and MR images of 34 patients with these abnormalities were reviewed. Pathologic correlation was not available. Two types of cystic lesions were identified and separated by location: medial temporal lobe cysts arising in or near the choroidal fissure (26 patients) and parenchymal or pseudoparenchymal cysts not related to the choroidal fissure (eight patients). The choroidal fissure cysts simulated intraparenchymal cysts on axial images but their extraaxial location was well portrayed on the coronal images. Choroidal fissure cysts had a characteristic spindle shape on sagittal images. The other cysts were found in the temporal lobe (seven patients) or thalamus (one patient) and appeared parenchymal but situated close to the subarachnoid space. These lesions were round or ovoid. There was no abnormal enhancement in 10 patients studied with gadopentetate dimeglumine. Coronal images were most useful, revealing the cysts as focal CSF-intensity lesions expanding the choroidal fissure of the temporal lobe. All the cysts appeared to represent incidental findings that did not correlate with the clinical signs and/or symptoms that prompted the imaging evaluations. The MR characteristics of CSF-like cysts are important to recognize so that they are not confused with other, more serious entities, such as intraaxial cystic tumors, infarctions, or parasitic lesions. 
Beneficial effects of isovolemic hemodilution using a perfluorocarbon emulsion in a stroke model. In a clinically applicable cat stroke model, 16 purpose-bred adult animals were used to evaluate the beneficial effects of two treatment regimens: isovolemic hemodilution with either a perfluorocarbon emulsion or dextran 40 (a glucose polymer). Animals that received these treatment regimens were then compared with a control group of untreated animals. Focal cerebral infarctions were produced by transorbital ligation of the left middle cerebral artery. The randomly allocated treatment arms of the study were instituted 3 hours after ligation of the middle cerebral artery, thereby simulating a human clinical situation. In vivo mitochondrial metabolic activity of the peri-infarct cerebral tissue was continually assessed by means of a multiwavelength near-infrared spectrophotometer. This allowed measurement of cellular oxygenation at the cytochrome aa3 level, the terminal member of the cytochrome chain. Sequential proton-based magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure intracerebral water in vivo. Cardiac output, oxygen consumption/delivery, chemical, histologic, and rheologic parameters were also assessed. The data collected were analyzed by group means and standard statistical analyses, which revealed that the group treated with the perfluorocarbon emulsion had both less brain edema in the early post-infarct period (p less than 0.05), as well as a higher level of oxidation of cytochrome aa3 (p less than or equal to 0.025). This evidence supports the premise that isovolemic hemodilution with an oxygen-carrying hemodiluent may be beneficial in the treatment of ischemic strokes. 
Evolution of endoscopic urethropexy: seven-year experience with various techniques. The surgical techniques for correction of stress urinary incontinence continues to evolve particularly those utilizing the endoscopic approach. Various forms of endoscopic urethropexy have been performed in 142 women with a minimum of one-year follow-up. The cure rate for the entire series was 94 percent. In the last two years the no-incision technique was used whenever feasible (31 patients) with an identical cure rate of 94 percent. Varying degrees of urinary retention occurred in 58 percent and was even more prevalent following the no-incision technique (68%). Owing to the high incidence of urinary retention a punch suprapubic cystostomy is now used in most patients. We conclude that endoscopic urethropexy is an effective means of correcting stress urinary incontinence. The no-incision technique is associated with even less morbidity and a reduction in hospital stay without compromising the outcome. 
Successful treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis with a liposomal amphotericin B preparation. The case of a granulocytopenic patient with acute undifferentiated leukaemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who was refractory to conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B (AmpB) and 5-flucytosine therapy is reported. He experienced severe AmpB-related side-effects, and was subsequently successfully treated with a pharmaceutical preparation of AmpB (5.7 g) entrapped in sonicated liposomes, composed of lecithin, cholesterol and stearylamine in a molar ratio of 4:3:1. Three months later, during maintenance chemotherapy, liposomal AmpB (5.1 g) was reinstituted due to the finding of biopsies positive for Candida albicans at bronchoscopy. After healing of the patient's fungal infection a left upper lobe resection was performed, which showed advanced fibrosis with signs of inflammation, but no evidence of fungal disease. Since no acute side-effects and only moderate hypokalaemia were observed, it appears that liposomal AmpB is superior to conventional AmpB treatment in granulocytopenic patients with hepatosplenic candidiasis and unbearable therapy-related side-effects. 
Rasmussen encephalitis: epilepsia partialis continua secondary to chronic encephalitis. Rasmussen encephalitis is a disease consisting of chronic encephalitis with progressive neurologic deficits and focal intractable seizure activity. The etiology is unknown, but pathologic specimens revealed changes consistent with viral encephalitis. Even though neuro-imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, offer the prospect of specific, presurgical diagnostic criteria, the initial diagnosis usually is made on a clinical basis. Treatment modalities, including a wide variety of antiepileptic drug therapies and surgical interventions, may result in significant physical and mental impairments. We summarize the clinical presentation, diagnostic considerations, and different treatment protocols in a patient with this rare and debilitating disorder. 
Chronic inflammation is associated with an increased proportion of goblet cells recovered by bronchial lavage. To evaluate the possibility that bronchoalveolar lavage could provide sufficient respiratory epithelial cells to quantify changes in epithelial cell types associated with chronic inflammation, we examined the epithelial cells obtained in the first infused (20 ml) aliquots that were processed separately from later aliquots, a process known to enrich for bronchial contents. Epithelial cells, including ciliated cells, goblet cells, and fragments of desquamated epithelium, were easily identified after preparation by cytocentrifugation and staining with a modified Giemsa stain. Quantification of the columnar cell types revealed that those with chronic bronchitis and asymptomatic smokers have increased goblet cells as a percentage of the total columnar epithelial cells (chronic bronchitics 36 +/- 2 percent, asymptomatic smokers 22 +/- 2 percent) compared with normal subjects (9 +/- 1 percent, p less than 0.001, ANOVA). Significantly, the goblet cell percentage was strongly correlated with other measures of bronchitis and measures of airflow obstruction such as the bronchitis index, a visually derived score at bronchoscopy of airway inflammation (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001), the percent neutrophils in the first infused aliquots (r = 0.44, p less than 0.05), and the FEV1 percent (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001). Thus, bronchoalveolar lavage is capable of providing sufficient bronchial epithelial cells for analysis, and the changes seen in the spectrum of columnar epithelial cells may reflect important underlying pathologic changes. 
Oromandibular reconstruction using microvascular composite free flaps. Report of 71 cases and a new classification scheme for bony, soft-tissue, and neurologic defects. We describe 71 cases of oromandibular reconstruction using microvascular composite free flaps. There was an overall flap success rate of 94%, while 97% of the patients in this series had their mandibles reconstructed with free vascularized bone flaps. Fifteen patients were rehabilitated with implant-borne dental prostheses. Primary repair of discontinuity defects of the inferior-alveolar nerve using a variety of nerve grafts was performed in 16 patients. A new classification scheme for composite defects of the oral cavity involving bone, soft tissue, and neurologic defects is proposed and applied in the description of each of the patients in this series. 
Trisomy 12 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: an interphase cytogenetic study. Interphase cytogenetics by means of in situ hybridization with the chromosome 12-specific biotinylated alpha satellite DNA probe pSP 12-1 was used for the study of trisomy 12, the most common chromosomal abnormality in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In situ hybridization was performed on methanol/acetic acid fixed cells of conventional cytogenetic preparations from eight patients and on morphologically and immunologically classified cells of cytospin preparations from seven patients. The results show that trisomy 12 is more common than assumed on the basis of karyotype analysis of metaphase chromosomes: 2 of 13 patients with a normal karyotype in G-banding analysis were shown to have trisomy 12 by interphase cytogenetics. Immunophenotyping of the cells of one patient showed that the trisomy was restricted to cells with Ig light chain clonality. For the evaluation of the prognostic, therapeutic, and biologic significance of trisomy 12, in situ hybridization should be used in parallel with karyotype analysis because it allows the study of all cell populations of both interphase and mitotic cells, whether neoplastic or normal. 
Masseter muscle spasm in children: implications of continuing the triggering anesthetic. This retrospective study was undertaken to examine the management and outcome of children who developed isolated masseter muscle spasm (MMS) after the administration of intravenous succinylcholine during anesthetic induction. The inhalation anesthetics used for induction were continued in all of these cases. The medical records of 68 patients (male/female ratio, 1.7:1), identified from approximately 42,000 anesthetics given during the period 1980-1989, were reviewed. Fifty-seven children (2.3-12 yr old) were diagnosed as having isolated MMS, i.e., MMS without spasm of other muscles; 11 experienced generalized rigidity in combination with MMS. Anesthetic and postoperative management of these two groups differed. The overall incidence of MMS was 0.3% of inhalation anesthetics during which succinylcholine was given. Intraoperative arrhythmias occurred in 33% of the patients who developed isolated MMS and more frequently in older children. Most children experienced some degree of hypercarbia and/or metabolic acidosis, but the significance of these abnormalities in the spontaneously ventilating, fasting child is unknown. Serum creatine kinase levels when measured 18-24 h postoperatively were elevated in all but one child (n = 45). There was no long-term morbidity and no mortality. We conclude that failure of the masseter muscles to relax after succinylcholine is not uncommon in children. Based on our experience, and accepting that MMS may be part of the clinical spectrum of malignant hyperthermia, we believe that anesthesia can be continued safely in cases of isolated MMS when careful monitoring accompanies diagnostic evaluation. This differs from the current practice of discontinuing the anesthetic or switching to a nontriggering anesthetic technique. 
Osteomyelitis: characteristics and pitfalls of diagnosis with MR imaging. Prospective and retrospective magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (0.35-T) interpretations were compared with final diagnoses in 110 patients suspected to have osteomyelitis. Diagnostic criteria of dark marrow on T1-weighted images and bright marrow on short-tau inversion-recovery images yielded a prospective sensitivity of 98% and a prospective specificity of 75%. Sixty percent of uncomplicated septic joint effusions demonstrated abnormal marrow signal intensity that was mistaken for osteomyelitis. Retrospective review revealed that overall specificity could be improved to 82% without loss of sensitivity if increased marrow signal intensity on T2-weighted images were included as an additional criterion. Specificity may be further increased by use of knowledge of morphologic patterns that distinguish various forms of osteomyelitis. Ten patients (9%) had potential pitfall diagnoses (eg, fracture, infarction, healed infection) that mimic osteomyelitis. MR imaging can be sensitive and specific for osteomyelitis if characteristic appearances and pitfall diagnoses are incorporated into the diagnostic criteria. 
Genetic linkage of autosomal recessive canine narcolepsy with a mu immunoglobulin heavy-chain switch-like segment. Identification of genes determining narcolepsy susceptibility is important not only for understanding that disorder but also for possible clues to general sleep-control mechanisms. Studies in humans reveal at least one such gene related to the major histocompatibility complex and in dog an as-yet-unmapped single, autosomal recessive gene canarc-1. Gene markers for canarc-1 were therefore sought by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms in our colony of narcoleptic dogs. A human mu-switch immunoglobulin probe and the enzyme Hae III identified a gene cosegregating with canarc-1 in backcrossed animals (logarithm of odds scores: m = 24, Z max = 7.2 at theta = 0%). canarc-1 was also shown not to be tightly linked with the dog major histocompatibility complex (m = 40, Z less than -2 at theta less than 4.8%). These results represent the mapping of a non-major histocompatibility complex narcolepsy gene and strongly suggest involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of that disease. 
Aortic-ventricular tunnel in a neonate: diagnosis and management based on cross sectional and colour Doppler ultrasonography. A five day old symptom free neonate was referred for assessment of a to and fro murmur associated with large volume pulses. Cross sectional echocardiography and colour flow mapping confirmed the diagnosis of an aortic-ventricular tunnel with forward flow into the aorta and regurgitant flow into the ventricle through both the tunnel and the dilated aortic valve ring. Surgical correction by patch closure of the aortic end of the tunnel was successfully undertaken two weeks later without any additional investigations. Postoperative echocardiography and colour flow imaging showed no aortic regurgitation and normal left ventricular dimensions and function. 
Arm edema in conservatively managed breast cancer: obesity is a major predictive factor To identify risk factors in the development of arm edema (AE) after conservative management of breast cancer, the authors prospectively measured differences in upper and lower arm circumference in 282 patients with stage I or II breast cancer who received radiation. AE was defined as a difference of 2.5 cm or more in either measurement between treated and untreated arms. Median follow-up was 37 months (range, 7-109 months). The crude frequency of AE overall was 19.5% (55 patients). In 21 patients (7.4%) AE was transient; 34 patients (12.1%) had persistent AE, which is the focus of this article. The 5-year actuarial incidence of persistent AE was 16%. The crude risk of persistent severe AE was 3.9%. Various factors were examined for their ability to enable prediction of AE. Treatment-related factors did not significantly enable prediction of AE, whereas factors related to patient size, such as body mass index, were strongly associated with both the frequency and severity of AE. 
Health maintenance strategies for women of different ages. An overview. Preventive health strategies for screening for specific illnesses, counseling, and immunization are discussed. Emphasis is given to cardiovascular screening and risk reduction, screening for malignancies, and immunization practices. A framework for designing periodic health examinations for patients is detailed. 
Patient dose and associated risk due to radiological investigation of the internal auditory meatus. The radiation doses and associated somatic risks due to four radiological examinations for acoustic neuromata (AN) have been investigated. These examinations were (1) plain film radiography of the internal auditory meatus (IAM), (2) computed tomography (CT) of the IAM, (3) CT of the posterior fossa and (4) CT of the IAM with air contrast. Organ dose measurements were performed using lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosemeters loaded in a patient equivalent phantom. Dose equivalents to various organs are presented, together with the effective dose equivalent and collective effective dose equivalent for each examination. Hypothetical fatal somatic risks for each examination studied here have been estimated from the effective dose equivalents. The estimated number of hypothetical fatal cancers induced by radiological examinations for AN is between approximately 110 and 820 times lower than the number of detected AN, depending on the method of assessing the radiation dose to the remainder organs. It is concluded that in this particular study the radiological examinations are of net benefit to this group of patients. 
Edematous pancreatitis associated with intravenous pentamidine. A 37-year-old black man with presumed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who was treated with systemic IV pentamidine had fatal pancreatitis and massive hepatomegaly. Fatal pancreatitis can occur with no hemorrhagic changes seen at autopsy. Awareness of the relationship between pentamidine and pancreatitis should be emphasized. With current clinical trials testing other routes of administration, fatal complications associated with IV pentamidine therapy will be minimized. 
Vegetative state after closed-head injury. A Traumatic Coma Data Bank Report. To elucidate the clinical course of the vegetative state after severe closed-head injury, the Traumatic Coma Data Bank was analyzed for outcome at the time of discharge from the hospital and after follow-up intervals ranging up to 3 years after injury. Of 650 patients with closed-head injury available for analysis, 93 (14%) were discharged in a vegetative state. In comparison with conscious survivors, patients in a vegetative state sustained more severe closed-head injury as reflected by the Glasgow Coma Scale scores and pupillary findings and more frequently had diffuse injury complicated by swelling or shift in midline structures. Of 84 patients in a vegetative state who provided follow-up data, 41% became conscious by 6 months, 52% regained consciousness by 1 year, and 58% recovered consciousness within the 3-year follow-up interval. A logistic regression failed to identify predictors of recovery from the vegetative state. 
Relationships between requests for psychiatric consultations and psychiatric diagnoses in long-term-care facilities. OBJECTIVE: The authors' objective was to investigate reasons for referral of elderly nursing home residents for psychiatric consultation and the relationship of these reasons for referral to psychiatric diagnoses. METHOD: They examined 197 nursing home residents consecutively referred to a consulting team in a university-affiliated mental health center. These patients represented all patients evaluated by the consulting team at six nursing homes over a 2-year period (Sept. 1, 1984, through Aug. 30, 1986). RESULTS: Reasons for referral were diverse but fell into seven broad clusters: behavioral problems; mood-related problems; consultations requested by involuntary treatment services, patients, physicians, or other referring agencies; psychotic features; physical signs; impaired activities of daily living; and other. Behavioral problems were most commonly cited and tended to be associated with dementia diagnoses. Mood-related reasons for referral were most strongly associated with diagnoses of affective disorders, and diagnoses of schizophrenia and adjustment disorder were each associated with two or more reasons for referral. However, reasons for referral were distributed widely across diagnostic groups and were relatively weak predictors of diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: The results illustrate the variety of problems for which nursing home staff are willing to seek psychiatric consultation but emphasize the need for professional psychiatric evaluation to establish a diagnostic base on which treatment interventions can be built. 
A simple sore throat? Retropharyngeal emphysema secondary to free-basing cocaine. A case of retropharyngeal emphysema associated with drug abuse is presented. Although chest symptoms of pneumomediastinum have been widely reported with substance abuse, pain localized to the neck is rarely described. In the present case, localized dysphagia was the only complaint, and no free air could be demonstrated within the thorax. For uncomplicated cervical emphysema or pneumomediastinum due to substance abuse, extensive workup may be unnecessary, and conservative therapy, including administration of 100% oxygen and observation is recommended if resolution is prompt. 
Composition of fat in enteral diets can influence outcome in experimental peritonitis. An animal model of protracted acute peritonitis was used to study the effects on survival of different amounts and types of dietary fat. Guinea pigs (n = 132) were provided with gastrostomies and allowed to recover. Intraperitoneal osmotic pumps were then placed, allowing for effusion of viable bacteria during the next week. Three days after pump implantation, the animals were randomized to receive one of nine diets, differing only in fat content (3.5%, 14%, or 56% of total calories) and fat composition (100% Microlipid [primarily safflower oil, rich in linoleic acid], 100% MaxEPA [fish oil containing 35% omega-three fatty acids], or a 50:50 mixture of both oils). At the end of 2 weeks, survival rates were compared. Among all types of fat used, the level of fat did not affect outcome, with survival rates of 13% (6 of 45) at the low level of fat used, 30% (13 of 44) at the medium level, and 26% (11 of 43) at the high level (P greater than 0.10). However fat composition significantly influenced survival across all levels of fat, with a 39% (17 of 44) survival rate in the groups given equal amounts of Microlipid and MaxEPA, compared either to 21% (9 of 44) for the 100% Microlipid groups, or to 9% (4 of 44) for the 100% MaxEPA groups (p less than 0.05). A second experiment was performed with 58 animals fed five different mixtures of fats, all at 14% of total calories. Diets were made with fat ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100 Microlipid to MaxEPA. The survival rate in the 50:50 group was 83% (10 of 12), which is significantly higher than the survival rates with any of the others (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that the amount of fat in the diet does not strongly influence outcome in this model. However an equal mixture of safflower and fish oils significantly improves survival rates compared to diets made with single-oil preparations. 
An evaluation of clinical variables in determining the need for pelvic examination in the emergency department. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of multiple clinical variables to predict an increased or decreased probability of pelvic pathology, therefore determining when a pelvic examination is needed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: An urban emergency department. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: 246 female patients presenting with abdominal pain and undergoing pelvic examination. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 99 patients without pelvic pathology (40%) and group 2 consisted of 147 patients with pelvic pathology (60%). Pelvic pathology was defined as presence of infective discharge (with confirmation on wet mount/potassium hydroxide smear), presence of adnexal mass and/or tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, uterine enlargement and/or tenderness, blood in the vaginal vault, and culture report positive for Neisseria gonorrhea. The following variables achieved statistical significance (P less than .05) using a logistic regression model: history of vaginal discharge (odds ratio, 2.30 [95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 4.32]); history of dysmenorrhea/menorrhagia (4.35 [1.52 to 12.40]); right upper quadrant pain on physical examination (0.33 [0.13 to 0.85]); and left lower quadrant pain on physical examination or history (1.73 [0.94 to 3.19]). CONCLUSION: History of vaginal discharge, history of dysmenorrhea/menorrhagia, and left lower quadrant pain on physical examination act as risk variables predicting presence of pelvic disease. Right upper quadrant pain on physical examination acts as a protective variable to predict absence of pelvic disease. This information may aid the emergency physician in determining the need for a pelvic examination in women with abdominal pain. 
Preliminary report: activation of the cerebellum in essential tremor [published erratum appears in Lancet 1990 Nov 24;336(8726):1330] Several images of cerebral blood flow were recorded during inhalation of carbon-15-labelled carbon dioxide by positron emission tomography in four patients with essential tremor and four normal controls. Unilateral involuntary postural tremor in essential tremor patients was associated with blood flow significantly greater than that at rest in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, both lateral premotor regions, and both cerebellar hemispheres. Of these regions, only the cerebellum was not activated in normal controls holding a posture without tremor or in essential tremor patients undergoing passive wrist movement. The increased flow in the cerebellum therefore seems to represent neural activity involved in tremor generation. It is proposed that essential tremor is due to oscillation within cerebello-olivary pathways, relayed by way of the thalamus and motor cortex to the spinal cord. 
Enteroscopic diagnosis of small bowel ulceration in patients receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and who had chronic occult gastrointestinal bleeding underwent extended small bowel examination with a Sonde enteroscope. 7 patients (47%) were found to have jejunal or ileal ulceration. Small bowel enteroscopy may be a valuable technique for the investigation of undiagnosed gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Therapeutic administration of fibronectin: current uses and potential applications. Fibronectins are a class of multifunctional glycoproteins that exist in soluble and insoluble forms. These glycoproteins are found in nearly all body fluids and in tissue extracellular matrices. Alterations in the normal synthesis, release, and distribution of fibronectins are characteristic features of certain human pathophysiologic conditions. The therapeutic administration of plasma fibronectin to human patients with defects in corneal wound healing and critically ill adult patients with multisystem organ failure appears clinically beneficial, although confirmation is needed from additional trials in progress. In vitro data suggest a role for fibronectin in enhancing (directly and indirectly) the function of phagocytes isolated from the blood of newborn infants. Although as yet untested, it is possible that fibronectin administration to the immunologically immature human neonate may improve host defenses and reduce the risk of nosocomial infection. Additional research is needed to define the factors that regulate the synthesis, isoform expression, and clearance of endogenous fibronectins during normal fetal and neonatal development. Continued research to define the role of endogenous fibronectins in augmenting the inflammatory response of the neonatal host is also required before rational immunotherapeutic interventions can be initiated. 
Organ doses received by atomic bomb survivors during radiological examinations at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation. When evaluating the risks of oncogenesis and cancer mortality following exposure to the radiations of the atomic bombs (A-bombs), the medical X-ray doses received by the A-bomb survivors must also be estimated and considered. Using a human phantom, dosimetry was performed to estimate the X-ray doses received by A-bomb survivors during medical examinations at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) as part of the long-term follow-up on the Adult Health Study (AHS). These examinations have been estimated to represent nearly 45% of the survivors' cumulative medical irradiation dose. Doses to the salivary glands, thyroid gland, lung, breast, stomach and colon were measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters. The results, which are reported here, will aid in estimating organ doses received by individual AHS participants. 
Platelet dysfunction in Noonan's syndrome. A case with a platelet cyclooxygenase-like deficiency and chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Individuals with Noonan's syndrome are likely to have one or more coagulation abnormalities: complex platelet function defects, partial Factor XI deficiency, or von Willebrand's disease. A distinctive platelet function defect has not been identified. The authors describe a 24-year-old women with Noonan's syndrome, chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and a platelet function defect characterized by a greater than 15-minute bleeding time, failure of aggregation and release with 10 microM ADP, 10 microM epinephrine, 750 microM arachidonic acid or 0.019 g/L collagen. A mixture of aspirin-treated platelets with the patient's platelets failed to correct the defect. Addition of 2.5 microM U46619 (a PGG2 analogue) corrected the aggregation and release defect. An electron microscopic analysis failed to reveal structural abnormalities. Thus, the platelet function defect in this patient appears to be a functional deficiency of cyclooxygenase. The presence of autoantiplatelet antibodies in a clinical setting consistent with chronic ITP raises the possibility that the defect may be acquired. 
Autosomal dominant deletions of the mitochondrial genome in a case of progressive encephalomyopathy. Multiple deletions of the mitochondrial genome were found in a family in which the proband had ataxia and ketoacidotic comas. A progressive multiorgan involvement appeared in the course of the disease, and histopathological investigation demonstrated mitochondrial myopathy features with ragged red fibers. A defect of oxidative phosphorylation was found in both skeletal muscle and lymphocytes. It is surprising that various mtDNA deletions were detected both in the proband and in his healthy mother and maternal aunt but not in the rest of the maternal progeny. All the deletions were located between Cox II and cytochrome b genes, and short (4-5 bp) repeated sequences were consistently present at the boundaries of the rearrangements in different tissues. Therefore, the deletions appear not to be transmitted per se but to be inherited in a Mendelian manner, being possibly dominant. Both the Mendelian inheritance of the trait and the variety of the deletions in carriers suggest that a nuclearly encoded factor(s) might be involved in the triggering of the deletions. However, the presence of the rearrangements in healthy individuals raises the question of whether mtDNA deletions actually cause the clinical expression of the disease. 
Dehydration syndromes. Oral rehydration and fluid replacement. Dehydration caused by diarrhea remains a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Dehydration is a common clinical presentation seen by most physicians. Clinical diagnosis depends on the recognition of signs and symptoms as well as change in weight. Laboratory studies are helpful in categorizing the dehydration as isotonic, hyponatremic, or hypernatremic, which is necessary to plan appropriate therapy. In many situations, oral rehydration therapy is possible and desirable. Intravenous rehydration remains the standard of care for children with severe dehydration and shock. 
Frequency of inflammatory bowel disease in offspring of couples both presenting with inflammatory bowel disease. A private practice was surveyed for prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in husband-wife partners and in their children. Among approximately 2500 patients with IBD in our files, 19 couples were identified. They were subdivided into group A (n = 5) in which both partners had symptoms of IBD before marriage; group B (n = 7) in which only one spouse had IBD before marriage and the other partner experienced symptoms afterwards; and group C (n = 7) in which neither spouse had symptoms before marriage but IBD subsequently developed in both. In group B, the disease developed in the second spouse 2-16 years after marriage (mean, 6.4 years). In group C, IBD developed in the first spouse 0.3-41 years after marriage and in the second spouse 1-14 years after the first spouse (mean, 6.8 years). Thirty-five children have been born to 16 of the couples. Two children died before age 20. Of the surviving 33 children, IBD has already developed in 12 (36%). Among the other 21 unaffected children, 1 had uveitis at age 9 and 10 are still under the age of 21, perhaps too young to have yet developed IBD. The frequency of IBD in children was slightly higher if both parents had already developed IBD at the time of conception (67%) compared with when only 1 parent (50%) or neither parent (50%) had developed IBD when conception occurred. Although these data do not distinguish genetic from environmental factors, they show a higher risk of IBD in children when both parents have this illness. 
Regional differences in elastic recoil after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty: a quantitative angiographic study. The immediate result of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is influenced by both plastic and elastic changes of the vessel wall. To evaluate the amount of elastic recoil after coronary balloon angioplasty, the minimal luminal cross-sectional area of the largest balloon used at highest inflation pressure was compared with the minimal luminal vessel cross-sectional area directly after final balloon deflation in 607 lesions (526 patients). Elastic recoil was defined as the difference between balloon cross-sectional area and minimal luminal cross-sectional area of the dilated coronary segment immediately after balloon withdrawal. A videodensitometric analysis technique was used to avoid geometric assumptions on stenosis morphology directly after angioplasty. Mean balloon cross-sectional area was 5.3 +/- 1.6 mm2 and minimal luminal cross-sectional area after angioplasty was 2.8 +/- 1.4 mm2. Reference areas before and after angioplasty did not differ (6.0 +/- 2.6 and 6.2 +/- 2.6 mm2, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed that asymmetric lesions, lesions located in less angulated parts of the artery and lesions with a low plaque content showed more elastic recoil. Lesions located in distal parts of the coronary tree were also associated with more elastic recoil probably related to relative balloon oversizing in these distal lesions. 
Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander syndrome: serum creatine kinase and functional outcome. The medical records of 31 patients (19 male and 12 female) with clinical and electrophysiologic features of Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander syndrome were reviewed. The reported age at onset ranged from less than one year to 46 years, and the age at diagnosis ranged from three to 66 years. Proximal muscle weakness, especially of the lower extremities, and muscular atrophy were the predominant clinical features. Elevated serum creatine kinase levels were noted in four female and 12 male patients, and the degree of elevation was higher in the male patients (up to 32 times the upper limit of normal) than in the female patients. On initial evaluation, two patients were wheelchair-bound, whereas the others were ambulatory. On follow-up evaluation three to 32 years later (mean, 15.5 years), 11 patients used wheelchairs, although only three were wheelchair-bound. The disease followed a steady, slowly progressive course. The outcome of ambulatory status did not correlate with the initial creatine kinase determination. 
Use of aspiration cytology and frozen section examination for management of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Between January 1980 and December 1988, 161 patients underwent thyroidectomy with intraoperative frozen section consultation after fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a thyroid nodule. The FNA were insufficient in 15 instances (9%) and in error in 39 (24%). In 15 cases, the incorrect aspiration diagnosis could have led to excessive surgery and in ten cases to delayed therapy if it had been the only guide for therapy. The diagnosis was deferred to permanent section analysis in 30 (19%) frozen sections. Twenty-two errors (14% of cases) were made in the interpretation of frozen section material, and in an additional 15 patients (9%), the diagnosis suggested (but deferred at frozen section) was in error. In one patient, this error could have led to more extensive surgery than necessary; in 21 patients, the frozen section error could have led to undertreatment. When frozen section results were combined with those of FNA, no therapeutically important false-positive diagnoses were made. In five patients, the combination of both FNA and frozen section results would not have identified a carcinoma which, in three cases, was a small occult papillary carcinoma not found in the index nodule. 
Fc epsilon RI-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides in ghosts derived from rat basophilic leukemia cells. Aggregation of the high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) on mast cells by a polyvalent Ag leads to hydrolysis of phosphoinositides (PI) catalyzed by phospholipase C (PI-PLC). To understand this phenomenon in molecular terms, it is important to obtain active, cell-free preparations. In extensive preliminary studies, we could not demonstrate Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation of PI-PLC in plasma membranes prepared by conventional methods from rat basophilic leukemia cells. We now report a stepwise approach involving preparation of cytoplasts from such cells and then hypotonic lysis of the cytoplasts to obtain active membrane vesicles. These membranes, best described as "ghosts," appear to reseal after losing greater than 90% of their soluble, cytoplasmic components and contain receptors that when aggregated, activate PI-PLC to hydrolyze endogenous phospholipids. Per unit of plasma membrane, the ghosts retain approximately 25% of Fc epsilon RI-mediated stimulation of PI-PLC relative to the cells. This activity requires ATP, magnesium, phosphoenolpyruvate, and, to a limited degree, calcium. Although an adequate amount of phosphatidylinositol biphosphate is present, the predicted spike of (1,4,5)-inositol trisphosphate is not seen, and the predominant inositol phosphate isomer is (1,4)-inositol bisphosphate. This is the first report of Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation of PI-PLC in a cytoplasm-depleted system that demonstrates activation of endogenous enzyme acting on endogenous substrate. In addition, it is the first such report for any receptor of the Ig superfamily. 
Embolization of cardiac myxomas masquerading as polyarteritis nodosa. Cardiac myxomas are rare tumors which can mimic other diseases. We describe a 19-year-old man who presented clinically with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Muscle biopsy showed vasculitis, but corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy was initially effective. Cardiac myxomas were found by echocardiogram when the disease relapsed and were resected surgically. Segmental arterial aneurysms and stenoses were found on angiography after leg ischemia. We suggest that echocardiography should be performed in all cases of clinically suspected PAN. 
Virchow-Troisier's lymph node in hepatocellular carcinoma. Virchow-Troisier's lymph node is rarely found in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. When present, it may or may not accompany spread of the tumor to mediastinal lymph nodes. In a 20-year-old South African black man with hepatocellular carcinoma, a Virchow-Troisier's node was evident clinically and confirmed at necropsy. Mediastinal lymph nodes were not involved by tumor, and the malignant cells probably gained access to the thoracic duct by way of lymphatic spread to the hepatic lymph nodes in the porta hepatitis and the celiac nodes, both of which were seen at necropsy to be extensively invaded by tumor. 
How much testing is needed after myocardial infarction? Both physicians and patients should be encouraged by the tremendous progress made in the clinical care of patients with heart disease during the last 20 years. However, the number of invasive and noninvasive tests is vast, so they need to be applied judiciously, using a reasonable set of clinical principles to recognize the needs of the individual patient. In the case of myocardial infarction, one of the most important prognostic factors is left ventricular systolic function, which is commonly measured by the ejection fraction. This measurement can be made with a left ventriculogram, radionuclide ventriculogram, or two-dimensional echocardiogram, the choice depending on individual circumstances. 
Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly. Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is a common disorder in the elderly, carrying with it a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Environmental and age-related factors believed to contribute to ISH include obesity, declining physical activity, stress, and such dietary changes as increased salt intake and decreased intake of calcium and potassium. Increased rigidity of the aorta resulting in reduced compliance is an important hemodynamic feature, but factors that increase peripheral resistance also appear to play a role. Antihypertensive drugs have been shown to effectively and safely lower the systolic blood pressure elevations characteristic of ISH. To date, use of low drug doses and careful titration of dosage have avoided significant orthostatic hypotension and undue lowering of the diastolic pressure. Studies of relatively small groups of patients suggest that antihypertensive drugs can lower the risk of cardiovascular morbidity/mortality associated with ISH but the definitive answer awaits results of the ongoing large-scale Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program trial. In the interim, management should begin with conservative measures such as weight loss, salt restriction and, possibly, calcium supplementation. If this fails, drug therapy should be considered in patients with systolic blood pressures above 180 mm Hg and in those with systolic readings between 160 and 180 mm Hg who have concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. To date, no controlled trials of sufficient size have demonstrated that one drug class is more effective than another in treating ISH. Drug therapy should be tailored to the individual patient, starting with a low dose of a single drug and, if necessary, slowly increasing dosage until a systolic blood pressure under 160 mm Hg is attained. 
Helicobacter pylori: aggressor or innocent bystander? Helicobacter pylori seeks gastric mucosa, whether found in the stomach, duodenum, or Barrett's esophagus. Definitive diagnosis can be secured by appropriate stains of mucosal biopsies and culture, but the rapid urease test, breath isotope studies, and serologic testing are also useful. The frequency of colonization increases with advancing age, but infection occurs earlier in underdeveloped countries. Although the reservoir is uncertain, water or food transmission seems likely. There is sufficient evidence to assign an etiologic role to the bacteria in the causation of type B antral gastritis. H. pylori is found in areas of gastric metaplasia within the duodenum and is associated with duodenitis. Although acute infection leads to hypochlorhydria, chronic colonization has little effect on acid secretion. Studies have thus far failed to establish a convincing relationship between H. pylori and nonulcer dyspepsia, although the bacteria may play a role in selected patients. H. pylori is found in association with most idiopathic gastric and duodenal ulcers, but it is unclear as to whether the bacteria plays a causative or permissive role. The organism has a predilection for intercellular spaces and the mucous layer, thus affording relative isolation from luminally active antibiotics. Monotherapy with bismuth preparations transiently eliminates the bacteria, but recolonization is rapid, probably due to regrowth of sequestered organisms. A combination of metronidazole, bismuth, and tetracycline (or amoxicillin) affords the best eradication rate, but the potential side effects of this program should be considered. The present therapy of duodenal ulcer disease is effective and without significant risk. Treatment of H. pylori should be reserved for those patients who relapse on adequate maintenance therapy. If a safe and effective antibiotic becomes available, more frequent testing and earlier treatment intervention may become more attractive. H. pylori is probably an "innocent bystander" for most patients, but the bacteria may sufficiently impair the defenses of the antral and duodenal mucosa to facilitate the development and relapse of ulcer disease in subsets of patients. 
Retinoblastoma. The long-term appearance of radiated intraocular tumors. A retrospective analysis of 50 patients with retinoblastoma was undertaken to determine the appearance of intraocular retinoblastoma that had received external beam radiation a minimum of 10 years previously. Of the 91 tumors found in 59 eyes, 76 (84%) continued to be ophthalmoscopically visible after 10 years. The most common ophthalmoscopic appearance was a Type III regression pattern. The type of radiation regression pattern correlated with the pretreatment volume of the tumor. The largest tumors (mean, 10.0 disc diameter [dd]) became Type I regression patterns, whereas the smallest tumors (mean, 1.0 dd) completely disappeared. This represents the first long-term follow-up of the intraocular status of radiated retinoblastoma. 
L-type cardiac calcium channels in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy in rats morphological, biochemical, and functional correlations. Doxorubicin (DXR) is an effective antitumor agent in a wide spectrum of neoplasms. Chronic treatment is associated with cardiomyopathy and characteristic myocardial ultrastructural changes, which include swelling of the t tubules. Accordingly, we investigated excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyopathic rat heart resulting from chronic DXR treatment. Using the whole-cell patch clamp technique, we studied the L-type calcium channel in single cells enzymatically isolated from normal (CTRL) and DXR rat hearts. Despite similar cell dimensions, the total membrane capacitance was significantly smaller in the DXR cells (138 +/- 9 pF) than in the CTRL cells (169 +/- 11 pF) (mean +/- SEM, n = 9, P less than 0.05). The mean current and the current density-voltage relationships of the CTRL and the DXR cells were significantly different (n = 9, P less than 0.001) with the maximal peak L-type calcium current (ICa) density increased from 6.4 +/- 0.9 in CTRL cells to 10.5 +/- 2.4 microA/cm2 in the DXR cells (P less than 0.05). There was no shift either in the current-voltage relationship or the steady-state inactivation curve in the two cell groups. However, the fast time constant of inactivation was increased at a membrane voltage of -10 to 10 mV. Calcium channel antagonist equilibrium binding assays using [3H]-PN200-110 revealed no difference in the maximal receptor binding capacity (CTRL, 194 +/- 27 and DXR 211 +/- 24 fmol/mg protein; P greater than 0.05, n = 6) and in receptor affinity (CTRL, 0.15 +/- 0.05 and DXR 0.13 +/- 0.03 nM; P less than 0.05). These data suggest that a decrease in effective capacitance might be associated with t-tubular damage. Despite this decrease, ICa was increased in the DXR cells. Such an increase may result from an alteration in the properties of the calcium channels and/or recruitment of "hibernating" channels in the remaining surface and t-tubular membranes. 
Hypersomnia in bipolar depression: a comparison with narcolepsy using the multiple sleep latency test. OBJECTIVE: This study characterized objectively the hypersomnia frequently seen in the depressed phase of bipolar affective disorder. On the basis of previous work in sleep and affective disorders, it has been hypothesized that the hypersomnia is related to greater REM sleep. This hypothesis was tested by using a multiple sleep latency test to compare bipolar affective disorder with narcolepsy, a well-defined primary sleep disorder associated with known REM sleep dysfunction. METHOD: Twenty-five bipolar depressed patients were selected on the basis of complaints of hypersomnia. They underwent 2 nights of polysomnography followed by a multiple sleep latency test. Data on their nocturnal sleep and daytime naps were compared with similar data on 23 nondepressed narcoleptic patients referred for sleep evaluation. RESULTS: Despite their complaints of hypersomnia, no abnormalities were noted for the bipolar group in the results from the multiple sleep latency test. Contrary to the working hypothesis, REM sleep was notably absent during daytime naps in the depressed patients, in marked contrast to the findings for the narcoleptic group. CONCLUSIONS: The complaint of sleepiness in the hypersomnic bipolar depressed patient appears to be related to the lack of interest, withdrawal, decreased energy, or psychomotor retardation inherent in the anergic depressed condition, rather than an increase in true sleep propensity or REM sleep propensity. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple symmetrical lipomatosis. Multiple symmetrical lipomatosis is a striking clinical finding associated with a variety of peripheral and central nervous system abnormalities. We describe 4 unrelated patients with evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. Multiple symmetrical lipomatosis is an additional, albeit unusual, manifestation of the expanding clinical spectrum of mitochondrial diseases. 
Overzealous resuscitation of an extremely malnourished patient with nutritional cardiomyopathy. Overzealous resuscitation of the severely malnourished patient may be associated with life-threatening complications. A variety of electrolyte, hemodynamic, septic, and nutritional derangements may result in sudden decompensation and even death. We present a case that dramatically illustrates these complications and focuses on the key role of underlying nutritional cardiomyopathy. 
The risk of ligation of the left renal vein in resection of the abdominal aortic aneurysm. The left renal vein can be ligated during aortic operation to attain better access to the perirenal aorta. This maneuver has been considered safe, with a low incidence of postoperative renal complications. This study was done to evaluate the risk of left renal vein ligation and its influence on renal function in patients with elective resection of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The records of 332 patients undergoing elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms during a five year period were reviewed. The clinical and operative data of patients who had left renal vein ligation and those who did not were similar. Left renal vein ligation was not associated with an increased mortality rate but was strongly associated with an increase in serum creatinine level and a clinical diagnosis of postoperative azotemia. Nine of 13 patients who had left renal vein ligation had postoperative azotemia compared with 21 of 319 patients without left renal vein ligation (p less than 0.001). The mean change of preoperative and postoperative creatinine value was an increase of 1.92 milligrams per deciliter in patients with left renal vein ligation in contrast with 0.26 milligram per deciliter in patients without ligation (p less than 0.00075). Thus, ligation of the left renal vein increases the risk of postoperative renal complications and its use should be selective. 
Role of quinsy tonsillectomy in the management of peritonsillar abscess. Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is the most frequent complication of acute tonsillitis requiring surgical intervention. Debate continues concerning optimal therapy in terms of patient morbidity and cost-effectiveness. A retrospective study was performed on 45 tonsillectomies for PTA in military personnel from December 1986 through December 1988. Twenty-three quinsy (abscess) tonsillectomies and 22 interval tonsillectomies were identified. Parameters studied were age, sex, abscess location, interval prior to operation, blood loss, operative time, operative experience, and combined hospital and convalescent days for the two groups. Significant differences were noted between the quinsy and interval tonsillectomy groups concerning the average number of days hospitalized (3.0 versus 4.5) and their respective convalescent periods (10.3 versus 17.3). We conclude that quinsy tonsillectomy is the best management for PTA in a young work force when the optimal treatment choice is between interval or acute tonsillectomy. 
Preventing death after traumatic rupture of the aorta. A chest film may help save a life. Traumatic rupture of the aorta is a life-threatening injury that necessitates immediate diagnosis and surgical repair. Diagnosis depends on recognition of findings on a plain chest film, specifically, mediastinal widening, left hemothorax, and an apical cap sign. Aortography should be done immediately to establish the diagnosis when clinical and/or radiographic findings suggest a rupture. 
Pediatric emergency transport and the private practitioner. A mail survey of 182 pediatricians and 92 family practitioners in Pennsylvania was conducted to determine their methods of transport of seriously ill children from their offices to referral centers and their involvement with professional transport services. Although most physicians (93.1%) stated that they had professional services available to them (at their office location), more than half (53.8%) indicated that the patient's family automobile was their most commonly used method of transport of ill children to tertiary care centers. This was true regardless of the disease entity involved, including suspected epiglottitis. Practice setting had little influence on transport method. However, in general, younger children were judged to need ambulance transport more often than older children. Reasons cited for not using professional transport from the office included a perceived better efficiency of the family car (61.8%), the prohibitively high expense of professional transport (9.8%), and failure to consider professional transport (6.5%). Further study of this component of office preparedness is suggested. 
Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome in a female with a balanced X;20 translocation: mapping of the X chromosome breakpoint. A Hispanic girl with Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome (OCRL), an X-linked recessive condition characterized by cataracts, glaucoma, mental retardation, and proteinuria, is reported. A balanced X;20 chromosomal translocation with the X chromosome breakpoint at q26.1 was found with high-resolution trypsin-Giemsa banding. Somatic cell hybridization was used to separate the X chromosome derivative and the chromosome 20 derivative in order to position, with respect to the translocation breakpoint, several DNA loci that are linked to the Lowe syndrome locus (Xq24-q26). DXS10 and DXS53 were found to be distal to the breakpoint, whereas DXS37 and DXS42 were located proximal to it. These studies suggest that the OCRL locus lies in the region between these probes. The translocation chromosome originated from an unaffected male without a visible translocation, indicating that the most likely cause of OCRL in this patient is the de novo translocation that disrupted the OCRL locus. 
Long-term clinical follow-up of adult idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis and celiac disease. A 22-year-old man with a history of repeated whole blood transfusions since the age of 7, was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea and blood-stained sputum. A complete blood cell count, a test for reticulin antibodies, an x-ray film of the chest, a transbronchial biopsy and a biopsy of the small bowel were performed and the results confirmed the diagnosis of IPH, associated with CD. The patient has been asymptomatic for four years on a gluten-free diet. In cases of IPH, it may be important to investigate the coexistence of CD because treatment of the latter could lead to a better prognosis. 
Hemifacial spasm in an infant due to fourth ventricular ganglioglioma. Case report. The case of an infant is reported in which hemifacial spasm due to a ganglioglioma of the fourth ventricle was relieved by surgery. Previously described causes of hemifacial spasm are summarized, and the relevance of this case to theories on the pathogenesis of the condition is discussed. 
Surgical strategies in the treatment of pancreatic necrosis and infection. Controversy still surrounds the management of necrotic and septic complications of acute pancreatitis. A review of the literature of the past decade dealing with the surgical treatment of pancreatic necrosis, pancreatic abscess and infected pancreatic necrosis has been undertaken. Three main patterns of management could be identified: (1) 'conventional treatment', consisting of pancreatic resection or necrosectomy with drainage; (2) 'local lavage', consisting of necrosectomy followed by regional lavage; and (3) 'open management', with resection or necrosectomy followed by planned multiple re-explorations. From this review it appears that local lavage and open management offer better survival prospects than conventional treatment. Open abdomen techniques, however, are associated with an increased risk of complications, such as colonic necrosis, intestinal fistula, and intra-abdominal bleeding. Excellent results can be achieved in specialized centres with any of the three methods, provided adequate debridement and prompt reoperations are undertaken if the septic state persists. 
Characterization of Bay U 3405, a novel thromboxane A2/endoperoxide receptor antagonist. The thromboxane A2-receptor antagonistic properties of Bay U 3405 [(3R)-3-(4-fluorophenylsulfonamido)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-carbaz o-lepropanoic acid] have been evaluated in various pharmacologic models. Bay U 3405 specifically inhibits platelet aggregation induced by U 46619, collagen, platelet-activating factor, and the second wave of ADP (IC50 0.5, 0.07, 0.3, 0.19 microM) in human plasma. The plasma phase of ADP-induced aggregation is not affected. U 46619-induced platelet aggregation is competitively antagonized (pA2 = 6.3). In humans, ex vivo platelet aggregation is inhibited after oral application of 2 or 50 mg Bay U 3405. Bay U 3405 also specifically and competitively antagonizes U 46619-induced contractions of rabbit aortic rings (pA2 = 7.4). In vivo, Bay U 3405 protects rabbits dose dependently from arachidonic acid or collagen-induced thromboembolism (ED50 1-3 mg/kg p.o). Chronic administration of Bay U 3405 to stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats reduces stroke-related mortality and diminishes the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhages. From these results, we conclude that Bay U 3405 is an orally active, selective, and competitive thromboxane A2-receptor antagonist that may be beneficial in the treatment of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. 
Prednisone inhibits the appearance of inflammatory mediators and the influx of eosinophils and basophils associated with the cutaneous late-phase response to allergen. To better define the effect of systemic glucocorticoids on the cutaneous early and late phase response (LPR), nine atopic subjects were examined in a double-blind cross-over study using skin chambers fixed over denuded skin blisters. A challenge was carried out by placing allergen in the chamber for 60 min in subjects who received either a 3-day pretreatment with 60 mg/day of prednisone or placebo. Skin chamber cell counts and inflammatory mediators (histamine, PGD2, and leukotriene C4 (LTC4)) were measured at hourly intervals for 12 h. Prednisone pretreatment did not alter the immediate skin erythema or release of histamine but ablated the late secondary erythema and rise in histamine. The median histamine values during h 10, 11, and 12 in the placebo and prednisone pretreatment visits were 3.73 and 0.22 ng/ml, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.02). Prednisone did not alter PGD2 production; however, LTC4 production was suppressed during the LPR. The cumulative median LTC4 values during h 7, 8, and 9 were 5.6-fold (p less than or equal to 0.05) more after placebo than after prednisone pretreatment. Prednisone altered cellular traffic more dramatically than it did inflammatory mediators. The influx of eosinophils, which peaked during the 9th and 10th h in placebo-treated patients, was completely blocked by prednisone (p less than or equal to 0.02) for every h from 6 through 12. The influx of basophils, which started during the 9th h and peaked during the 12th h in placebo-treated patients, was suppressed at all time points (p less than or equal to 0.02) in prednisone-treated patients. There was no significant alteration in neutrophil transit into the skin chambers induced by prednisone. We suggest that the selective blockade of eosinophil and basophil influx by prednisone and the associated decrease in inflammatory mediators may contribute to the blockade of the clinical expression of the cutaneous LPR. 
Separate sex-influenced and genetic components in spontaneously hypertensive rat hypertension. Previous results from our laboratory indicated two major genetic components of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) hypertension, an autosomal component and a Y chromosome component. Two new substrains, SHR/a and SHR/y, were developed using a series of backcrosses to isolate each of these components. The SHR/a substrain has the autosomal loci and X chromosome from the SHR strain and the Y chromosome from the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat strain. The SHR/y substrain has only the Y chromosome from the SHR and autosomal loci and X chromosome from the WKY strain. Throughout these breeding programs parents were chosen at random without selection for blood pressure. Males of both substrains maintained blood pressures over 180 mm Hg. Comparisons of blood pressure in these new substrains with the original parental strains can be used to determine the relative proportions of each genetic component in hypertension. The Y chromosome component contributes 34 mm Hg, which is the difference between SHR/y male and WKY male blood pressure. The total autosomal component contributes 46 mm Hg, which is the difference between SHR/a male and WKY male blood pressure. The autosomal component is a sex-influenced trait; males in the SHR/a strain have significantly higher pressures than SHR/a females. Of the 46 mm Hg estimated for the autosomal component, 41 mm Hg is the result of these loci interacting with male phenotypic sex. This sex-influenced component is separate and distinct from the Y chromosome component. 
Progressive loss of speech output and orofacial dyspraxia associated with frontal lobe hypometabolism. Three patients are described with slowly progressive loss of speech and dysarthria associated with orofacial dyspraxia, initially with intact written language, who subsequently developed more widespread cognitive abnormalities. Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed bifrontal hypometabolism in all of the patients, most marked in the inferior and lateral portions of both frontal lobes, with some extension into the parietal and temporal cortices in one case. These patients may represent a further example of focal progressive cortical degeneration. 
Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the limited form of Wegener's granulomatosis. A patient with the limited form of Wegener's granulomatosis is reported. The case is unusual because of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, severe ulceration of the respiratory and digestive tracts, and the rapidly fatal outcome. 
Elective total hip arthroplasty in patients older than 80 years of age. Elective total hip arthroplasties (THA) were performed in 91 patients (101 hips) older than 80 years of age at operation. A control group of 87 patients (102 hips) aged 64 to 67 years who had elective THA was chosen statistically to represent the average THA patient. There were 51 minor and eight major perioperative complications in the elderly group and 26 minor and two major complications in the control group. The only in-hospital death was in the control group. The mean hospital stay was two days longer in the elderly group. Five years postoperatively, 83% of the patients in both groups were ambulating without pain. The mean hip score improved from 49 to 84 points in the elderly group and from 52 to 88 points in the control group. These functional results justify elective THA in patients older than 80 years of age. 
Proarrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death in young patients receiving encainide and flecainide. The Pediatric Electrophysiology Group The potential for proarrhythmic responses to the class IC sodium channel-blocking drugs encainide and flecainide has not been well described in young patients. Therefore, data were retrospectively collected from 36 institutions regarding 579 young patients who were administered encainide or flecainide for treatment of supraventricular tachycardias (encainide 86 patients, flecainide 369 patients) or ventricular arrhythmias (encainide 21 patients, flecainide 103 patients) to assess the frequency of proarrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death during therapy (adverse events). The two drugs were similar in regard to efficacy (flecainide 71.4%, encainide 59.8%) and rate of proarrhythmic responses (flecainide 7.4%; encainide 7.5%). However, patients receiving encainide more frequently experienced cardiac arrest (encainide 7.5% vs. flecainide 2.3%, p less than 0.05) or died during treatment (encainide 7.5% vs. flecainide 2.1%, p less than 0.05). Detailed data were provided for 44 patients experiencing one or more adverse events. Patient age, previous drug trials, concomitant therapy and days of inpatient monitoring were similar for patients receiving encainide or flecainide. However, echocardiographic left ventricular shortening before treatment was lower among patients receiving encainide (0.23 +/- 0.09) than among those receiving flecainide (0.34 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.05). Plasma drug concentrations were rarely elevated. Cardiac arrest (12 patients) and deaths (13 patients) occurred predominantly among patients with underlying heart disease, particularly among patients receiving flecainide for supraventricular tachycardia (8.3% vs. 0.3%, p less than 0.001). Fifteen patients with an ostensibly normal heart and normal ventricular function experienced proarrhythmia during treatment for supraventricular tachycardia, but only 3 of the 15 had a cardiac arrest or died. The relatively high incidence of adverse events should be considered when contemplating treatment with encainide or flecainide, particularly among patients with underlying heart disease. 
Genetics of colon cancer. Strikingly rapid advances in the identification of genetic events that are important in colonic carcinogenesis have been made in the past several years. Specific inherited (adenomatous polyposis coli gene) and acquired (ras gene point mutations; c-myc gene amplification; allelic deletion at specific sites on chromosomes 5, 17, and 18) genetic abnormalities appear to be capable of mediating steps in the progression from normal to malignant colonic mucosa. Understanding these genetic factors and how they influence cellular function will have a profound effect on medical practice. High-risk populations will be (and are being) identified by genetic markers, thus allowing prevention and screening to be more precisely targeted to the population at risk; intervention strategies will be designed on the basis of the known cellular defects of neoplastic colonic mucosa; and new molecular preventive and therapeutic approaches can be developed. 
Fractures of the dens complicating ankylosing spondylitis with atlantooccipital fusion. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis are prone to fractures. Fractures tend to occur in the lower cervical spine disc space. We describe 2 patients with odontoid fractures. Both patients had atlantooccipital fusion which may have increased their susceptibility for dens fractures. One patient had Crohn's disease. 
Cytokine influence on killing of fresh chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by human leukocytes. The feasibility of combining the Lym-1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was evaluated. We used an in vitro tumor lysis model that incorporated fresh CLL cells from 21 different patients as targets for two distinct normal human leukocyte effector subsets, neutrophils, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Lym-1 antigen (Lym-1-Ag) expression varied greatly and did not correlate with the expression of other CLL-associated antigens such as CD5, CD19, or HLA-DR. CLL cells were not lysed by neutrophils alone or with IFN-gamma in the absence of Lym-1. Neutrophil Lym-1-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the absence of IFN-gamma was weak and inconsistent. IFN-gamma exposure induced MoAb-dependent lysis of 80% of 21 CLL targets and resulted in an eightfold augmentation of neutrophil ADCC against the remainder. Cytotoxicity correlated directly and positively with Lym-1-Ag expression. Confirmation of the need for interaction between neutrophil IgG Fc receptors (Fc gamma Rs) and the Fc portion of the Lym-1 MoAb was obtained by demonstrating that purified Staphylococcus aureus Protein A (SpA) inhibited ADCC. IFN-gamma exposure caused no consistent alternations in Lym-1-Ag expression on CLL cells so that target antigen upregulation was unlikely to account for augmentation of neutrophil ADCC. PBMCs alone, exposed to interkeukin-2 (IL-2) or IFN-gamma, or with Lym-1 in the presence or absence of IL-2 or IFN-gamma were unable to lyse CLL targets. PBMCs were able to kill Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells in conjunction with Lym-1, so their ability to interact with Lym-1-coated targets and their lytic functions appeared intact. These results emphasize the importance of examining fresh tumor cells with different leukocyte effector subsets before designing a clinical trial that combines a therapeutic MoAb with a cytokine. 
Esophagogastric neoplasms: palliation with a modified gianturco stent. Self-expanding metallic stents of a modified Gianturco design were used for palliative treatment of malignant esophagogastric strictures. Over a 10-month period, 10 stents were placed in nine patients. All patients with severe dysphagia due to malignant strictures in whom all other treatment options had failed were candidates for these stents. Neither extensive length of esophageal involvement nor complete esophageal obstruction was a contraindication. All stents were placed with fluoroscopic guidance without any technical failures or procedural morbidity or mortality. Mild reflux occurred in three patients in whom the stent tubes straddled the distal esophageal sphincter. Five patients were still alive after 1-8 months. The remaining four patients died 6-28 weeks after stent placement; all stents were patent at the time of death. These stents are easy to insert, safe, and reasonably effective for short-term palliative treatment of esophagogastric neoplasms. 
Transforming growth factor beta 1 is present at sites of extracellular matrix gene expression in human pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an inexorably fatal disorder characterized by connective tissue deposition within the terminal air spaces resulting in loss of lung function and eventual respiratory failure. Previously, we demonstrated that foci of activated fibroblasts expressing high levels of fibronectin, procollagen, and smooth muscle actin and thus resembling those found in healing wounds are responsible for the connective tissue deposition and scarring in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we now demonstrate the presence of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a potent profibrotic cytokine, in the foci containing these activated fibroblasts. These results suggest that matrix-associated TGF-beta 1 may serve as a stimulus for the persistent expression of connective tissue genes. One potential source of the TGF-beta 1 is the alveolar macrophage, and we demonstrate the expression of abundant TGF-beta 1 mRNA in alveolar macrophages in lung tissue from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
Vasopressin-dependent kidney hypertrophy: role of urinary concentration in protein-induced hypertrophy and in the progression of chronic renal failure. Recent experiments have shown that the kidney adapts to chronic variations in urine concentration. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), kidney weight relative to body weight, thickness of inner stripe of the outer medulla, volume of epithelium in early thick ascending limb, and internephron heterogeneity are all decreased by chronic water diuresis and increased by chronic stimulation of urine concentration. It was further shown that the intrarenal pattern of hypertrophy observed after high protein (HP) intake, but not that observed after compensatory hypertrophy or normal growth with age, is exactly similar to that observed after chronic stimulation of urine concentration. Since solute-free water reabsorption (TcH2O) is markedly enhanced by HP diet, this suggests that the increases in GFR and renal mass observed after HP intake are, at least in part, an adaptive response of the kidney to increased urinary concentrating activity. The beneficial effects are induced by protein restriction in chronic renal failure (CRF) could thus be due, in part, to the reduction of this concentrating activity. This hypothesis was confirmed by an experiment performed in rats with experimental chronic renal failure (CRF) in which a chronic increase in water intake, reducing urine osmolality and TcH2O, without any change in food composition or consumption, reduced proteinuria, systemic hypertension, kidney hypertrophy, incidence of glomerulosclerosis, and mortality. 
Inefficacy and proarrhythmic effects of flecainide and encainide for sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of encainide and flecainide in treating patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias. DESIGN: Patients were treated with encainide or flecainide. Efficacy was assessed by comparing the results of programmed ventricular stimulation while patients received therapy with the results while they were drug free. SETTING: The electrophysiology laboratory of the University of California at San Francisco. PATIENTS: Forty-nine patients with spontaneous or inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation for whom treatment with at least one class IA antiarrhythmic agent had failed. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with encainide, 35 to 50 mg three or four times daily, or flecainide, 100 to 200 mg twice daily. RESULTS: Arrhythmia worsened early in 5 of 16 patients receiving encainide and 3 of 33 patients receiving flecainide. Patients with poor left ventricular function were more likely to exhibit proarrhythmia (P = 0.02). Nine of eleven patients receiving encainide and 23 of 28 patients receiving flecainide who had repeat programmed ventricular stimulation while receiving drug therapy still had inducible, poorly tolerated ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSION: Encainide and flecainide have a low efficacy rate and a high incidence of worsening of arrhythmia in patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias, particularly when this condition is associated with poor left ventricular function. 
Stressful life events and symptom onset in HIV infection. OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal is to provide basic epidemiologic data on the issue of reactivity to stress and HIV symptom onset by studying the relationship between a broad set of naturally occurring stressor events and HIV natural history in a large longitudinal community sample of HIV-seropositive homosexual men. METHOD: Subjects were recruited from a cohort of 1,011 homosexual men enrolled in the Chicago site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study who also participated in the Coping and Change Study. The men were given self-administered questionnaires assessing behavioral, psychological, and psychosocial variables. Relationships between reports of stressful life events and longitudinal biomedical data measuring illness progression were examined. Life events were assessed by reports on the numbers of lovers, friends, and acquaintances who were diagnosed with AIDS or had died of AIDS and by scores on a checklist of 24 more general serious stressor events. The variables indicating progression of illness among initially asymptomatic men were a drop in T-helper lymphocyte percent (CD4%) between pairs of examinations of at least 25% and onset between examinations of thrush and/or fever lasting a minimum of 2 weeks. RESULTS: The authors found no evidence that serious stressor events have any meaningful effect on symptom onset indicated by either a drop in CD4% or onset of fever or thrush. CONCLUSIONS: There is no need for asymptomatic people with HIV infection to restrict their lives in order to avoid exposure to stressful life experiences or to develop special skills for coping with stress to forestall the progression of HIV illness. 
PAF-induced bowel necrosis. Effects of vasodilators. Ischemic bowel necrosis in the rat is produced by injecting platelet-activating factor (PAF) intravenously. Since intestinal hypoperfusion is observed after PAF injection, we hypothesize that mesenteric vasoconstriction is the mechanism of bowel injury. We thus studied the effects of vasodilators in this model. We found that: (1) Phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615 (leukotriene antagonist) and PGE1 counteracted the PAF-induced mesenteric flow reduction and ameliorated the bowel injury. However, phenoxybenzamine and prazosin were relatively ineffective in correcting PAF-induced hypotension, showing that bowel injury can be prevented independently of the hypotensive state. (2) Nitroglycerin failed to prevent bowel injury, although it improved the mesenteric blood flow. Thus, in opposition to our initial hypothesis, correction of the mesenteric flow reduction induced by PAF does not always prevent intestineal necrosis. (3) Only phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615, and PGE1 ameliorated PAF-induced hemoconcentration and bowel injury. This suggests a correlation between vascular injury (expressed by "leaky" vessels and the consequent hemoconcentration) and bowel necrosis. (4) Although both nitroglycerin and hydralazine relax smooth muscle, hydralazine seemed to aggravate bowel necrosis. The mechanism remains unclear. 
Familial aggregation and severity of epilepsy. Genetic models for complex diseases frequently assume that genetic factors play a greater role in severe forms than in mild forms of disease. This study examined familial aggregation of epilepsy in relation to two measures of severity: duration and remission. The study population comprised 358 offspring born in Rochester, MN, U.S.A., to parents with epilepsy who were diagnosed in Rochester between 1935 and 1979 and followed for greater than or equal to 5 years after the first seizure. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine the effects of duration of the parent's epilepsy (less than 5 vs. greater than or equal to 5 years) and remission of the parent's epilepsy (greater than or equal to 5 years seizure-free) on risk of unprovoked seizures in offspring. The univariate rate ratio (RR) for parent's duration (long vs. short) was 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.32-3.57). The RR for parent's remission was 2.5 (0.55-11.41), reflecting a higher risk for offspring of remitting parents, which was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis was used to control for three other parental attributes associated with offspring seizure risk: sex, age at onset of seizures (less than 20 vs. greater than or equal to 20 years), and seizure type (absence vs. other). The RR for duration was not substantially changed in this analysis (1.2; 0.37-4.16). However, the RR for remission dropped to 1.2 (0.25-5.97), suggesting that the higher risk in offspring of remitting parents was largely explained by confounding with other factors that influence offspring seizure risk. 
Fetal choroid plexus cysts in the second trimester of pregnancy: a cause for concern. Controversy surrounds the issue of recommending cytogenetic studies in second-trimester fetuses with fetal choroid plexus cysts. To assist in clarifying this issue, a prospective study was designed to describe the association between fetal choroid plexus cysts and aneuploidy in a large population. During a 3-year period 7350 women at 15 to 22 weeks' gestation underwent an ultrasonographic evaluation. Fetal choroid plexus cysts were diagnosed in 71 (0.96%) of these pregnancies. Sixty-two of the 71 patients elected to undergo amniocentesis. An abnormal karyotype was identified in four (6.4%) of these fetuses. One fetus had trisomy 21, and three fetuses were diagnosed with trisomy 18. These data indicate that it is reasonable to offer genetic counseling and cytogenetic studies in those patients identified as having a fetal choroid plexus cyst. 
Nutritional management of acute and chronic pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis often results in a catabolic state characterized by profound hemodynamic, metabolic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and renal aberrations. Parenteral nutrition and metabolic support are essential if morbidity and mortality are to be minimized. In chronic pancreatitis, nutritional management ranges from fundamental dietary manipulation with or without administration of appropriate digestive enzymes to enteral supplementation with modular chemically defined diets to total parenteral nutrition, depending on the stage, severity, and manifestations of the disease. In prescribing nutrient substrates in both acute and chronic pancreatitis, consideration must be given to their effects on pancreatic enzyme secretion if optimal results are to be achieved. 
Resting energy expenditure in patients with pancreatitis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the resting energy expenditure of hospitalized patients with pancreatitis. DESIGN: Prospective, case-referent study. SETTING: Nutrition support service in a university tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients referred to the Nutrition Support Service with the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Excluded from study entry included those with cancer, obesity (greater than 150% ideal body weight), those measured within 3 postoperative days, or patients requiring ventilator support with an FIO2 of greater than 0.5. Forty-eight patients with either acute pancreatitis (n = 13), chronic pancreatitis (n = 24), acute pancreatitis with sepsis (n = 7), or chronic pancreatitis with sepsis (n = 7) were studied. The two septic groups were combined into a single pancreatitis-with-sepsis group, since no significant differences among measured variables were observed between individual septic groups. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry and compared with the predicted energy expenditure, as determined by the Harris-Benedict equations. Resting energy expenditure (percent of predicted energy expenditure) was significantly (p less than .02) greater for patients with pancreatitis complicated by sepsis (120 +/- 11%) compared with the nonseptic chronic pancreatitis group (105 +/- 14%). Resting energy expenditure for the nonseptic acute pancreatitis patients (112 +/- 17%) was not significantly different from the other groups. The septic pancreatitis group had the largest percentage (82%) of hypermetabolic (resting energy expenditure greater than 110% of predicted energy expenditure) patients, whereas 61% and 33% of the acute and chronic pancreatitis groups were hypermetabolic, respectively (p less than .02). CONCLUSIONS: Resting energy expenditure is variable in patients with pancreatitis (77% to 139% of predicted energy expenditure). The Harris-Benedict equations are an unreliable estimate of caloric expenditure. Septic complications are associated with hypermetabolism and may be the most important factor influencing resting energy expenditure in pancreatitis patients. 
Plasma catecholamines in patients with presinusoidal portal hypertension: comparison with cirrhotic patients and nonportal hypertensive subjects. During a hemodynamic study, plasma catecholamine concentrations were measured in the pulmonary artery and in the hepatic vein in 18 presinusoidal portal hypertensive patients. Results were compared with those in 15 nonportal hypertensive subjects and in 24 cirrhotic patients in good condition (grade A, according to Pugh's classification). Plasma norepinephrine concentrations in the pulmonary artery or in the hepatic vein were not significantly different between nonportal hypertensive subjects (mean +/- S.E.M.: 271 +/- 36 and 83 +/- 11 pg/ml, respectively) and presinusoidal portal hypertensive patients (273 +/- 33 and 84 +/- 11 pg/ml, respectively). These concentrations were, however, elevated in cirrhotic patients (408 +/- 47 and 256 +/- 45 pg/ml, p less than 0.05 in comparison with the two other groups). These differences suggest that increased sympathetic nervous activity in cirrhosis is associated with the presence of liver disease or increase in sinusoidal pressure. Differences in plasma epinephrine concentrations were not significant among the three groups of patients. However, the existence of a significant correlation between pulmonary artery plasma epinephrine concentration and cardiac index (r2 = 0.46, p less than 0.01) in patients with presinusoidal portal hypertension suggests that the adrenal medulla could play a role in the pathophysiology of the hyperkinetic syndrome of these patients. 
Efficacy of fixed minidose warfarin prophylaxis in total hip replacement. OBJECTIVE--To determine whether a small fixed perioperative dose of warfarin would prevent deep vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. DESIGN--Prospective, randomised, double blind placebo controlled trial. SETTING--Winford Orthopaedic Hospital, Bristol. SUBJECTS--148 patients having primary total hip replacement. INTERVENTION--Warfarin 1 mg given daily for one week before and three weeks after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Deep vein thrombosis diagnosed by the iodine-125 labelled fibrinogen uptake method. RESULTS--Deep vein thrombosis occurred in 25 (34%) of the patients given warfarin and 19 (26%) of the controls (difference 8%; 95% confidence interval -6.8% to 22.8%). CONCLUSION--Fixed minidose warfarin does not prevent deep vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. 
Cisplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide salvage therapy for refractory or relapsing germ cell carcinoma. Thirty patients with metastatic progressive germ cell carcinoma who failed to be cured with first-line cisplatin chemotherapy were treated with a salvage regimen consisting of cisplatin 20 mg/m2, etoposide 100 mg/m2, and ifosfamide 1.2 g/m2 (PEI) intravenously (IV), days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks. Ten patients (33%) were tumor-free at the end of therapy. Complete response (CR) was achieved with chemotherapy alone in four patients and with additional surgery in six patients (two necroses, two mature teratomas, two carcinomas). Six patients (20%) had normalization of tumor markers but unresectable residual disease (Rm-), and the remaining 14 patients (46%) failed to respond. Of 10 patients with CR, nine (90%) relapsed again (eight carcinomas, one mature teratoma). The median duration of CR was 3.5 months. The median survival of the whole group was 311 days (range, 110 to 996+). Currently, seven of 30 patients are alive, and five of them are without signs of progressive tumor. The response to prior cisplatin therapy predicted for response and survival after PEI salvage therapy. Of 14 patients with prior CR, eight (57%) achieved a second CR compared with one of 11 (9%) with prior unfavorable response (P = .039). The median survival for patients with prior favorable response was 400 days, compared with 251 days for patients with prior unfavorable response (P less than .001). Myelosuppression was dose-limiting, with leukopenia greater than grade 2 in 84% and thrombocytopenia greater than grade 2 in 51% of all cycles. This three-drug regimen can induce a second CR in one third of patients with relapsed or refractory germ cell carcinoma. Only those patients with prior favorable responses can expect to be cured by this salvage regimen, while patients with prior unfavorable response should be considered for alternative salvage approaches. 
Scrub and murine typhus in children with obscure fever in the tropics. Between October, 1985, and February, 1987, 28 (8.7%) cases of scrub and murine typhus were diagnosed among 320 children with greater than or equal to 1 week history of obscure fever. Scrub typhus is a rural disease and characterized by fever, tachypnea and hepatosplenomegaly. Skin rash was rare and eschar was absent. Four patients had pneumonia and two had meningitis. Murine typhus, more an urban disease, was milder and half the patients presented exclusively because of night fever. Slightly enlarged liver and skin rash were the only significant physical signs. Lacking the classical textbook presentations, both rickettsioses often were missed or diagnosed as enteric fever. Recognition is important because patients with either disease respond well to treatment with chloramphenicol or doxycycline. 
Spectrum of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompetent patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a well-recognized complication in immunocompromised patients, especially those with neutropenia. We report four cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients whose main underlying disease was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Two patients had an acute fatal course, one had chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis ending in an acute fatal course, and the other had a semiacute disease that responded to amphotericin B. Autopsy on three patients showed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in both lungs, and tissue invasion was documented by transbronchial biopsy in the patient who survived. Retrospective review of all cultures that grew Aspergillus species from bronchoscopic specimens showed no false-positive results, and this procedure proved to be the most useful maneuver in making the diagnosis. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis should be in the differential diagnosis in patients with COPD and unexplained pulmonary infiltrates. 
The possibility of diagnosing small pancreatic cancer (less than 4.0 cm) by measuring various serum tumor markers. A retrospective study. Comparative studies measuring various tumor markers such as SPan-1, CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), DUPAN-2, and elastase I were done in 74 patients with small pancreatic cancer including 23 cases of T1 pancreatic cancer (tumor size less than 2.0 cm) and 51 cases of T2 pancreatic cancer (tumor size between 2.1 to 4.0 cm), retrospectively. Although the mean value of these tumor markers in T1 and T2 pancreatic cancer were higher than those of the control cutoff levels, their sensitivities were different. In T1 pancreatic cancer, 13 of 23 cases (56.5%) of SPan-1 and 14 of 23 cases of (60.7%) of CA 19-9 had levels above normal. Although the numbers of patients were small, sensitivities of CEA, DUPAN-2, and elastase I were 30.8%, 22.2%, and 28.6%, respectively. In T2 pancreatic cancer, 41 of 51 cases (80.4%) of SPan-1 and 40 of 51 cases (78.4%) of CA 19-9 showed higher levels than normal, but only 46.9% of CEA, 40.0% of DUPAN-2, and 52.6% of elastase I were positive. The overall sensitivities in small pancreatic cancer (less than 4.0 cm) were 73% for SPan-1 and CA 19-9 but were less for CEA, DUPAN-2, and elastase I. These results indicate that even small pancreatic cancers release detectable pancreatic cancer-associated antigens in serum in more than 70% of cases, especially SPan-1 and CA 19-9. The measurement of these two tumor markers makes it possible to detect small pancreatic cancers after using imaging diagnostic procedures. 
Paracentesis with intravenous infusion of albumin as compared with peritoneovenous shunting in cirrhosis with refractory ascites. BACKGROUND. There is no satisfactory treatment for refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Both peritoneovenous shunts and paracentesis have been used, but there is uncertainty about their relative merits. METHODS. We studied 89 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites who were randomly assigned to receive either repeated large-volume paracentesis plus intravenous albumin or a LeVeen peritoneovenous shunt. Patients in the paracentesis group in whom recurrent tense ascites developed during follow-up were treated with paracentesis, and those in the peritoneovenous-shunt group with diuretic agents or by the insertion of a new shunt if there was shunt obstruction. RESULTS. During the first hospitalization, ascites was removed in all 41 patients in the paracentesis group and in 44 of the 48 patients in the peritoneovenous-shunt group. The mean (+/- SD) duration of hospitalization in the two groups was 11 +/- 5 and 19 +/- 9 days, respectively (P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in the number of patients who had complications or died. During follow-up, 37 patients in each group were hospitalized again. In the paracentesis group, the number of rehospitalizations for any reason (174 vs. 97 in the peritoneovenous-shunt group) or for ascites (125 vs. 38) was significantly higher, and the median time to a first readmission for any reason (1 +/- 1 vs. 2 +/- 2 months) or for ascites (2 +/- 2 vs. 8 +/- 17 months) was significantly shorter than in the peritoneovenous-shunt group. The total times in the hospital during follow-up, however, were similar in the two groups (48 +/- 49 and 44 +/- 39 days, respectively). Three patients had obstructions of their peritoneovenous shunts during their first hospitalizations, and 15 patients had a total of 20 obstructions during follow-up. Survival was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS. The LeVeen shunt and paracentesis are equally effective in relieving refractory ascites. The former may provide better long-term control of ascites, but shunt occlusion is common and survival is not improved. 
Percutaneous placement of Hickman catheters: comparison of sonographically guided and blind techniques. We studied the value of sonographically guided puncture of the subclavian vein for placement of indwelling right atrial and permanent subcutaneously tunneled catheters (Hickman) for long-term venous access. The commonly used blind puncture is associated with complications such as pneumothorax, arterial puncture, and hemothorax. The results and complications of 40 sonographically guided punctures and fluoroscopically controlled catheterizations of the subclavian vein (group 1, 31 patients) performed in the radiology department were compared with those of 40 blind percutaneous punctures and fluoroscopically controlled catheterizations (group 2, 29 patients) performed in the operating room. The patients were selected consecutively. The groups were comparable in age, sex, and indication for catheter placement; administration of chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies was the major indication (group 1, 84%; group 2, 83%). All punctures in group 1 were successful; group 2 had two failures (5%). Puncture-related complications occurred significantly more in group 2 (10%) than in group 1 (0%) (p less than .05). These complications were pneumothorax in three cases and hemothorax in one. Complications not related to the puncture technique were prolonged bleeding at the entrance site (groups 1 and 2, two cases each), local infection (group 1, one case), thrombosis (group 1, three cases; group 2, two), catheter sepsis (group 1, 10 cases; group 2, 14), catheter occlusion (group 2, three cases), and catheter migration (groups 1 and 2, two cases each). We conclude that sonographically guided puncture increases the success rate and significantly decreases the puncture-related complications of percutaneous placement of Hickman catheters. 
Effect of incisional biopsy on subsequent histology of melanocytic naevi. We examined the effect of incisional biopsy on the subsequent histology of 15 benign melanocytic naevi. In all cases the histology of the residual lesion within the second specimen was unchanged apart from the presence of a surgical scar, and in general the definitive excision specimen showed a reduction in melanocytes at the dermo-epidermal junction overlying the scar. In no case were there any features suggestive of melanoma. 
A double-blind crossover study of the effect of concomitant diuretic therapy in hypertensive patients treated with amlodipine. Twelve patients with essential hypertension who were already on treatment with the long-acting calcium antagonist amlodipine (5 mg once daily) were entered into a double-blind, randomized crossover study of the addition of one month's treatment with either bendrofluazide (5 mg once daily) or matching placebo. The addition of bendrofluazide did not cause any statistically significant fall in the supine blood pressure compared to treatment with placebo (147.6/90.1 +/- 4.8/2.8 v 150.8/92.6 +/- 4.3/2.3 mm Hg, respectively). Plasma potassium was significantly lower on bendrofluazide as compared to placebo (3.11 +/- 0.14 v 3.62v +/- 0.13 mmol/L, P less than .001) and 10 of 12 patients had a fall in plasma potassium while on diuretic. The results of this study suggest that a thiazide diuretic has little additive effect on blood pressure in patients already on the long-acting dihydropyridine amlodipine, and may cause hypokalemia. 
Acute otitis media in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children. To evaluate the occurrence and outcome of acute otitis media (AOM) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children, a prospective comparative cohort study was performed. Twenty-seven HIV-infected children were individually matched with paired control subjects and followed up for 543 months (mean 19.4 +/- 11). Data collected were evaluated considering HIV-infected children both as a whole and as P1 and P2 patients according to Centers for Disease Control classification. During the observation period, 46 episodes of AOM were diagnosed in 15 HIV patients and 22 in 16 control children: 11 P1 had 27 AOM episodes vs 17 in 13 control children; 6 P2 had 19 AOM episodes vs 5 in 4 control children. Human immunodeficiency virus infection does not seem to modify the occurrence of AOM. Recurrent AOM (3 or more episodes in 6 months) was, however, significantly more common in P2 children. Amoxicillin, to which the bacteria isolated in P2 children were sensitive in vitro, cured 33 of 46 episodes in HIV-infected children compared with 20 of 22 in control children. Cure rate was similar in P1 children compared with control children but was significantly lower in P2 versus control children (47.3% vs 100%). Reasons for higher occurrence of failures in P2 children remain to be investigated. 
Angioscopic coronary macromorphology in patients with acute coronary disorders. To investigate the pathogenesis of acute coronary disorders and to clarify what type of plaque precedes these disorders, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioscopy, by means of a new angioscope, was carried out during catheterisation in 100 consecutive patients anatomically suitable for such investigations. The quality of the angioscopic image was good enough for analysis in 84 patients (14 with acute myocardial infarction [within 8 h of onset], 16 with recent myocardial infarction [3 days-2 months since onset], 24 with old myocardial infarctions, 10 with unstable angina, and 20 with stable angina). Thrombi were observed in most patients with acute coronary disorders (all 14 with acute myocardial infarction, 9 of 10 with unstable angina). Occlusive thrombi were more common in patients with acute myocardial infarction than in those with unstable angina (11 [79%] vs 1 [10%]; p less than 0.001), whereas mural (non-occlusive) thrombi were more common in the unstable angina than in the acute myocardial infarction group (8 [80%] vs 3 [21%]; p less than 0.001). Xanthomatous ulcerated plaques or ragged irregular surfaces were seen in patients with acute coronary disorders and in those with recent myocardial infarction. Xanthomatous plaques were more common in patients with acute coronary disorders (50%) than in those with stable angina (15%) or old myocardial infarction (8%). By contrast white and smooth plaques were seen in cases of stable angina and old myocardial infarction. Angioscopy could display the intracoronary lumen more precisely than could coronary arteriography. This angioscopic study suggested that, although a thrombus overlying a rupture in the lining of the plaque was common in both unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction, the character of the thrombus may differ between these disorders, and lipid-rich xanthomatous plaque may precede rupture. 
Cholecystectomy as a risk factor for colorectal adenomatous polyps and carcinoma. Multiple studies have suggested a possible relationship between prior cholecystectomy and the occurrence of subsequent colorectal carcinoma. This relationship has been particularly noticed among female patients and for right-sided lesions of the colon. In the current study, the authors undertook a case-control study among patients who underwent colonoscopy in three private practices in New York City between April 1986 and March 1988. Over this period, 302 adenomatous polyp cases, 106 colon cancer cases, and 507 controls were interviewed regarding their prior history of cholecystectomy. Overall, no significant association was observed between cholecystectomy and either colorectal adenomatous polyps or cancer. Cholecystectomy does not appear to be a significant risk factor for colorectal neoplasia. 
In vitro selection of a cell line for resistance to lysis by tumor necrosis factor-alpha selects for reduced tumorigenicity. Experimentally, TNF-alpha can mediate the hemorrhagic necrosis of certain tumors. Furthermore, evidence indicates that natural cytotoxic (NC) activity, a cell-mediated cytolytic activity that utilizes TNF-alpha in the lysis of target cells, is involved in preventing the outgrowth of certain NC/TNF-alpha-sensitive tumor cells. These observations raise the issue of whether soluble TNF-alpha normally serves as a tumor surveillance mechanism preventing the outgrowth of some tumors. To address this issue, we have used TNF-alpha to select TNF-alpha-resistant variants from the NC/TNF-alpha-sensitive mouse fibroblast cell line 10ME. Previously, we have demonstrated that 10ME is tumorigenic in immune-deficient mice but fails to form tumors in normal mice. Moreover, selection of NC-resistant variants from 10ME selects for both TNF-alpha resistance and tumorigenicity in normal mice. As cells that have been selected for NC resistance form tumors in normal mice, whereas the NC-sensitive parental cell line does not, it seems that escape from NC activity is sufficient to significantly increase the tumorigenic potential of the cell line. We show that the selection with TNF-alpha, although associated with NC resistance, does not increase the tumorigenic potential of 10ME cells but reduces it. Thus, NC activity appears to function as a mechanism to prevent tumor formation, and escape from NC activity allows for tumor formation; TNF-alpha does not have similar activity. Moreover, this suggests that NC activity is not equivalent to soluble TNF-alpha activity, but utilizes TNF-alpha more efficiently than soluble TNF-alpha, or NC activity involves both TNF-alpha and other effector mechanisms. 
Autoimmune enteropathy and nephropathy with circulating anti-epithelial cell antibodies. We describe a child with circulating anti-epithelial cell antibodies, autoimmune enteropathy with intestinal villous atrophy, and membranous glomerulonephritis. The patient had persistent diarrhea at 6 months of age, and a small bowel biopsy showed active enteritis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. When the patient was, 10 months of age, nephrotic syndrome developed because of membranous glomerulonephritis. Results of tests for circulating immune complexes were negative. Indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed a circulating antibody directed against renal epithelial cells. Circulating antibodies directed against normal small intestine epithelial cells were also detected by the immunoperoxidase technique. Western blot and immunoprecipitation identified a 55-kd antigen, in both small bowel and kidney, that reacted with an antibody in the patient's serum. High-dose prednisone therapy induced a clinical remission, resolution of the small bowel injury, and diminished serum anti-epithelial cell antibodies; after dose reduction, clinical relapse occurred with villous atrophy and reappearance of anti-epithelial cell antibodies. When the patient was 45 months of age, persistent diarrhea recurred despite intravenous administration of corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and total parenteral nutrition. Autoantibodies to a 55-kd epithelial cell protein are temporally related to the development of enteropathy and nephropathy. Study of similar patients is needed to determine the role of such antibodies in this disorder. 
A significant association of Ha-ras p21 in neuroblastoma cells with patient prognosis. A retrospective study of 103 cases. To evaluate biologic characteristics of neuroblastoma, the authors examined the expression of Ha-ras gene (Ha-ras p21) in 103 primary tumors obtained at the time of diagnosis. Higher expression of the Ha-ras p21 in tumor cells showed a significant association with lower clinical stage of the tumor at diagnosis (chi-square = 35.418, degrees of freedom [df] = 9, P less than 0.001) and survival of the patients (chi-square = 37.111, df = 3, P less than 0.001). Thirty-six (84%) of 43 patients with decreased Ha-ras p21 expression died of aggressive disease. The Ha-ras DNA was examined in the 32 tumors by Southern blot analysis. Neither augmentation nor deletion of the Ha-ras DNA was observed. Amplification of the N-myc DNA was also examined in 43 cases in comparison with Ha-ras p21 expression. N-myc amplification was detected in 12 (55%) of 22 patients who died, and 19 (86%) of the 22 patients showed a low expression of the Ha-ras p21 in tumor cells. Eighteen (86%) of 21 survivors showed a high expression of the Ha-ras p21. The expression of Ha-ras p21 was thought to be a clinically important marker for prognosis in children with neuroblastoma. 
The efficacy and tolerability of CV 205-502 (a nonergot dopaminergic drug) in macroprolactinoma patients and in prolactinoma patients intolerant to bromocriptine. We studied the effect of CV 205-502 in 12 patients with macroprolactinomas and 8 patients with PRL-secreting tumors, who were selected because of previous repeatedly shown intolerance to bromocriptine in even small doses. We also investigated serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels before and during CV 205-502 therapy. In 12 macroprolactinoma patients followed for 1 yr, 0.075-0.450 mg CV 205-502 lowered PRL levels by 91.2 +/- 5.4%. Only 3 of the patients had transient side-effects of nausea, dizziness, or fatigue. In eight patients with PRL-secreting tumors who were bromocriptine intolerant, CV 205-502 (0.075-0.300 mg daily) lowered PRL levels by 80.2 +/- 6.3%. Four of these patients showed transient side-effects (nausea, fatigue, and/or tachycardia). None of the patients discontinued therapy. There was a close correlation between pretreatment circulating PRL levels and tumor size, expressed in cubic millimeters. The decrease in pituitary tumor size after 52 weeks of CV 205-502 therapy (-74 +/- 6%) was also correlated with the decrease in PRL levels (P less than 0.01). In four patients with hypopituitarism, lowered IGF-I levels did not change during CV 205-502 therapy. However, in seven previously untreated patients with macroprolactinoma and normal CV 205-502 is a potent dopaminergic drug, which effectively controls PRL secretion and induces tumor shrinkage. At the doses used in our study, it causes only mild and transient side-effects in a minority of patients and can also be used to treat hyperprolactinemic patients who have shown intolerance to bromocriptine therapy. 
Chronic diffuse infiltrative lung disease: comparison of diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution and conventional CT. We compared the accuracies of high-resolution CT (HRCT) and conventional CT in determining the specific diagnoses in 75 consecutive patients with chronic diffuse infiltrative lung disease. Without knowledge of clinical or pathologic data, two reviewers independently assessed three separate sets of CT scans in random order: three HRCT scans, three 10-mm collimation CT scans obtained at the same levels as the HRCT scans, and a complete conventional CT scan. The HRCT scans were obtained at the level of the aortic arch, tracheal carina, and 1 cm above the right hemidiaphragm by using 1.5-mm collimation and a high spatial resolution algorithm. Observers gave the most likely diagnosis along with their degree of diagnostic confidence. The correct diagnosis, irrespective of confidence level, was reached with 71% of the HRCT scans and with 72% of both the corresponding 10-mm and complete conventional CT scans. Confidence level 1 (definite) was reached with 49% of HRCT scans, 31% of corresponding 10-mm scans, and 43% of complete conventional CT examinations; the correct diagnosis was made in 92%, 96%, and 94% of those examinations, respectively. In none of the patients were findings on the limited HRCT scan normal when findings on the conventional CT scan were abnormal. We conclude that in most patients with chronic infiltrative lung disease a specific diagnosis can be made by obtaining a limited number of HRCT scans. 
Stereotactic craniotomy in the resection of small arteriovenous malformations. Surgical resection of 10 obscure arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) was accomplished with craniotomy guided by computerized tomography (CT) or angiography and the use of the Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic frame. Stereotactic craniotomy was invaluable for resection of the following types of AVM's: 1) AVM's with a nidus less than 2 cm in diameter, 2) AVM's located in an eloquent area of the brain, and 3) AVM's located deep in the brain. Stereotactic localization of these AVM's on preoperative radiological studies provides a precise route to the nidus, often avoiding important areas of the brain. This series included six male and four female patients with a mean age of 32 years. All patients presented with an intracerebral hemorrhage, from which eight made a complete neurological recovery prior to surgery. Two AVM's were located on the cortex, three were found subcortically, and five were situated near the ventricles or in the deep white matter. As a guide, angiography was used in six cases and CT in four cases. In each instance, the study providing the best image of the AVM nidus was employed. Postoperatively, no neurological deficits were found in eight patients and, in the two patients with preoperative deficits, neurological improvement was observed after recovery from surgery. Postoperative studies revealed complete removal of the AVM in all patients, and all lesions were confirmed histologically. The authors conclude that stereotactic craniotomy provides the optimum operative approach for the localization and microsurgical resection of AVM's that are either obscure or located deep in the brain. 
Abnormal esophageal motility. An analysis of concurrent radiographic and manometric findings. The findings of concurrent esophageal videofluoroscopy and manometry in 15 patients with major disturbances of esophageal motor function were evaluated and the data were analyzed from a fluid mechanical perspective. Each of 153 fluoroscopic barium swallow sequences was analyzed on a swallow-by-swallow basis. Two distinct pressure domains were identified: intrabolus pressure and pressure within a bolus-free contracting esophageal segment. Analyses in terms of these pressure domains showed specific and consistent correlations between the radiographic and manometric findings. Radiography was insensitive to contractions occurring in esophageal segments devoid of bolus fluid, whereas manometry was insensitive to contractions that did not occlude the lumen. It is concluded that using fluid mechanical principles of bolus transport allows meaningful comparison of esophageal motility as recorded by radiography and intraluminal manometry. However, the inherent limitations in the range of physical phenomena recorded by each modality make these techniques complementary for evaluating esophageal motor function. 
Doppler estimation of changes in pulmonary artery pressure during hypoxic breathing. To assess the use of Doppler echocardiographic screening for abnormal pulmonary vasoreactivity, we measured pulmonary artery pressure in 10 adult patients and 11 normal subjects while recording Doppler right ventricular outflow acceleration time, pre-ejection period, and ejection time. In the normal subjects we also measured the changes in each parameter after 10 minutes of hypoxic breathing (FIO2 = 0.12). Mean pulmonary artery pressure increased by 39% during hypoxia (13 +/- 4.3 to 18 +/- 5.4 mm Hg). In the patients and normal subjects at rest, mean pulmonary artery-pressure correlated well with acceleration time (r = -0.84; standard error of the estimate, 6.6 mm Hg; p = 0.0001). Over the narrow range of mean pulmonary artery pressure in normal subjects at rest, mean pulmonary artery pressure did not correlate well with acceleration time, acceleration time/pre-ejection period, or acceleration time/right ventricular ejection time. However, changes in mean pulmonary artery pressure induced by hypoxic breathing did correlate with changes in acceleration time/right ventricular ejection time (r = 0.73; standard error of the estimate, 2.3 mm Hg; p = 0.01). Doppler ultrasound may offer a noninvasive means for detecting abnormal pulmonary vasoreactivity in asymptomatic individuals at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension. 
Laparoscopic trancystic choledocholithotomy as an adjunct to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is rapidly becoming the standard operation for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Initially, common duct stones presented a barrier to this treatment modality and are said to be unsuspected in 5-9 per cent of patients. A technique is described that removes common bile duct stones through the cystic duct with a flexible nephroureteroscope, thereby extending the range of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma. A worldwide problem and the major risk factors. Male sex, age, cirrhosis, and HBsAg are the major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The geographic distribution of HCC is highly uneven, such that three distinct incidence areas are recognized. To clarify the reason(s) for this geographic variability of HCC, the risk factors in each incidence area were assessed. In parallel with the geographic distribution of HCC, HBsAg prevalence was highest in both HCC patients and in general population in Africa and Asia, where mothers of HCC patients are frequently HBsAg-positive, suggesting that hepatitis B virus hyperendemicity and perinatal infection account for the high HCC incidence in these areas. Cirrhosis, which is found on autopsy in 80% of the cases of HCC patients worldwide, is the most prevalent risk factor for HCC in areas where hepatitis B virus infection is less common. However, HBsAg carriage adds to the HCC risk carried by cirrhosis and explains the higher incidence of HCC in cirrhotics from Africa and Asia as well as elsewhere. Available data suggest that chronic HCV infection is a risk factor for cirrhosis and HCC. HBV vaccination should decrease HCC incidence rates worldwide; however, HCC prevention in regions where HBsAg carriage is infrequent may also require prevention of the other causes of cirrhosis in order for HCC rates to decline. 
Linkage analysis of juvenile parkinsonism to tyrosine hydroxylase gene locus on chromosome 11. We performed linkage analyses of juvenile parkinsonism with autosomal recessive inheritance (AR-JP) to chromosome 11p15.5 locus including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), Harvey-ras-1 (HRAS), and insulin (INS) genes by analyzing genomic DNA from 28 members of seven Japanese AR-JP families containing 10 affected individuals. We used the methods of pairwise linkage analysis (LIPED) and multipoint linkage analysis (LINKAGE) for genetic linkage to the chromosome 11p15.5 markers and detected recombination events between AR-JP locus and TH gene. Multipoint linkage analysis excluded the linkage in the interval between TH and HRAS, as well as 11 cMo distal to TH and 8.5 cMo distal to HRAS, a total of approximately 23 cMo on chromosome 11p. 
Usefulness of leg-crossing for maintaining blood pressure in a sitting position in patients with orthostatic hypotension--case reports. The authors report a case with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension in which the patient prevents his blood pressure from falling to a symptomatic level by leg-crossing in a sitting position. Including 4 other patients with orthostatic hypotension and 5 normal subjects, their study found that the changes in blood pressure with leg-crossing inversely correlated with those induced by assuming seated posture from a supine position. Leg-crossing may, therefore, be one of the useful nonpharmacologic measures for maintaining blood pressure in a sitting position in patients with orthostatic hypotension. 
Intratumoral T lymphocytes from small cleaved follicular center cell lymphomas show unrestricted T-cell receptor alpha-chain variable region gene usage. The relationship between the reactive T cells and neoplastic B cells of follicular center cell lymphomas is unclear. It is not known whether the T cells are recruited nonspecifically by the neoplastic B cells or are responding through the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), to tumor-related antigen(s). This question was addressed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of TCR alpha chain variable (V) region gene expression in intratumoral T lymphocytes from three cases of small cleaved follicular center cell lymphoma. In all three cases studied, the tumor-associated T cells showed unrestricted expression of all 18 alpha-chain V region genes. These findings imply that the T cells admixed with the neoplastic B cells of small cleaved follicular center cell lymphomas are not recruited based on TCR recognition of a single or limited number of tumor-related antigens. 
Mechanisms and management of stroke in the elderly. OBJECTIVE: To highlight the mechanisms, common causes and management of stroke in the elderly. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE was searched for articles published from 1967 to 1990. The following key words were used: "stroke," "cerebrovascular disease," "elderly," "aging," "hypertension," "drug interactions," "etiology," "evaluation," "management" and "recovery of function." Original articles with large series of patients were reviewed in detail. STUDY SELECTION: Of about 750 original articles reviewed 116 were finally selected for detailed analysis. Those that dealt with cause, pathophysiologic features and management of stroke with emphasis on the elderly were chosen. DATA SYNTHESIS: With increasing age the incidence of stroke increases, cardiovascular reserve decreases, catecholamine responsiveness diminishes and cardiac arrhythmias become more common. Blood pressure, especially systolic, rises, and the benefits of its treatment become both more difficult to assess and less certain. In the elderly population embolic stroke, particularly that due to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, is seen with increasing frequency. Because of postural hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias and overmedication, watershed infarction occurs more frequently with increasing age. Amyloid angiopathy now represents the most common cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the altered drug metabolism and pharmacodynamics in the elderly the therapeutic armamentarium is growing, and so are the risks of such treatments. Stroke in the elderly poses unique problems that deserve distinctive solutions. Further research is needed to study the effect of cerebral ischemia to understand better how the older brain handles the stress of the ischemic insult. 
Gastro-oesophageal reflux in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. Long duration oesophageal pH recordings were performed on 42 mechanically ventilated and parenterally fed preterm infants for a mean (SD) of 94 (28) hours. Their mean (SD) gestational age was 31.5 (2.6) weeks and birth weight 1514 (448) g. Their mean postnatal age was 19 (10) hours at the onset of pH recording, which was performed with the babies supine. The mean hourly values for the total number of episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) was 2.3 (2.7), for acid GOR 1.2 (1.4), and for acid GOR longer than 5 minutes 0.08 (0.09). The time the pH was greater than 4 (the reflux index) was 3.5 (3.3)% and the mean airway pressure was 6.6 (5.1) cm H2O. Fifteen infants had a reflux index above 5%. GOR patterns were not significantly correlated to birth weight, gestational age, postconceptional age, ventilatory patterns, and duration of mechanical ventilation. We concluded that the reproducibility of the reflux index was low because the median of the absolute differences was 1% when two consecutive 12 hour periods were compared and reached 2.5% when the two periods were separated by 96 hours. A second 24 hour pH recording was performed in 30 of the 42 patients after weaning from the ventilator and at a time when patients were asymptomatic and enterally fed. Compared with the late postprandial period of the second pH recording, the first recording showed an increase in the number of episodes of GOR and a decrease in reflux index, without any difference in the number of episodes of acid GOR. 
A critical threshold of exercise capacity in the ventilatory response to exercise in heart failure. During exercise patients with chronic left heart failure ventilate more than normal individuals at the same workload; the ratio of minute ventilation to minute production of carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) is increased. The relation between increased VE/VCO2, severity of heart failure, and exercise capacity has not been defined. VE/VCO2 was measured in 47 patients with chronic left heart failure (New York Heart Association grades II and III) and in 1009 healthy controls. Exercise capacity was assessed by peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) during progressive exercise. In the controls VO2max ranged from 25 to 93 ml/kg/min; VE/VCO2 was 17-36 and did not correlate with VO2max. In chronic left heart failure the VO2max ranged from 9 to 29 ml/kg/min; VE/VCO2 was 22-42 and correlated strongly with VO2max. End tidal carbon dioxide and respiratory rate at peak exercise were similar in the controls and patients with chronic left heart failure. The increase in VE/VCO2 on exercise in chronic left heart failure indicates increased physiological dead space, presumably caused by a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. In the controls and patients with chronic left heart failure the relation of VE/VCO2 to VO2max was curvilinear with a threshold of VO2max below which VE/VCO2 started to rise above the normal range. This point of inflection may be explained by the existence of a critical level of cardiac function necessary to perfuse adequately all lung zones on exercise. 
Transsphenoidal management of Rathke's cleft cysts. A clinicopathological review of 10 cases. We report detailed data on 10 patients who underwent transsphenoidal microsurgical management of histopathologically confirmed Rathke's cleft cysts. Preoperatively, pituitary dysfunction was present in 90%, headaches in 80%, hyperprolactinemia in 70%, and visual interference in 40%. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging had 90% and 100% sensitivity, respectively, in disclosing the lesion. The mean follow-up duration was 22 months. There was no mortality. The only morbidity was sustained diabetes insipidus in one case. Resolution or improvement in preoperative dysfunction occurred in the majority of patients: headaches in 100%, visual deficits in 75%, normalization of hyperprolactinemia in 83%, and reversal of panhypopituitarism in 33%. We conclude that Rathke's cleft cysts can be managed safely and effectively with transsphenoidal drainage and partial excision of the wall. 
Correlation of technetium-99m-DISIDA hepatobiliary studies with biopsies in liver transplant patients. We compared 76 99mTc-DISIDA hepatobiliary studies with corresponding liver biopsies in 36 liver transplant patients to determine the histopathologic abnormalities that corresponded to scintigraphic abnormalities in uptake and excretion. Uptake was judged normal if the cardiac blood pool was barely visible or invisible on the ten minute image. Excretion was judged normal if images subsequent to the 15-min image showed a subjectively normal rate of decreasing parenchymal intensity. Biopsies were graded subjectively for hepatocyte damage and for findings of cholestasis. Uptake criteria were successful in differentiating high from low hepatocyte damage scores (p less than 0.0001), and excretion criteria were successful in differentiating high from low cholestasis scores (p = 0.002), while uptake criteria were not capable of differentiating high from low cholestasis scores, nor were excretion criteria capable of differentiating high from low hepatocyte damage scores (p's greater than 0.05). These results suggest that scintigraphy can distinguish intrahepatic cholestasis from pure hepatocyte damage. 
Psychologic factors associated with peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcer disease provides an excellent model for the study of mind-body interactions in the pathogenesis and course of an illness. Early psychodynamic explanations of the role of personality factors in the evolution of peptic ulcer disease have been supplemented in recent years by more scientifically based studies on the role of stress and coping ability. Multiple psychosocial variables have confounded the outcome of many of these studies. Yet, a clear need and guidelines exist for the comprehensive medical and psychosocial evaluation and treatment of patients with peptic ulcer disease. Concomitant psychiatric assessment and management, including psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic approaches, for those patients with refractory symptoms or ongoing psychiatric symptoms carried out in close collaboration with primary caregivers will significantly decrease overall morbidity and mortality. 
The preferential antagonism of pentylenetetrazole proconflict responses differentiates a class of anxiolytic benzodiazepines with potential antipanic action. With the use of the shock-induced suppression of water drinking in thirsty rats (Vogel's conflict paradigm) and the pentylenetetrazole-enhanced shock-induced suppression of drinking (proconflict paradigm) as animal models to test anxiolytic and antipanic agents, it was possible to distinguish two major classes of benzodiazepines (BZDs) and congeners on the basis of their antiproconflict index (ratio of anticonflict/antiproconflict potencies). Thus, typical low potency BZDs and congeners (diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem, alpidem) with anxiolytic/hypnotic properties have a low antiproconflict index (close to 1), whereas typical high potency BZDs (clonazepam, alprazolam, bretazenil) with reported antipanic properties have an antiproconflict index approximately 10-fold higher. The anticonflict and antiproconflict actions of BZDs with low or high antiproconflict indices are blocked by flumazenil but are potentiated differentially by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake blocker 1-2-[bis(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]-methoxyethyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-3- pyridine-carboxylic acid. Protracted administration of antianxiety and antipanic antidepressant drugs that do not act on GABAA receptors, directly, resulted in anticonflict and antiproconflict effects. However, the efficacy of these drugs is clearly inferior (20-30%) to that of BZDs. These data suggest that specific GABAA receptor subtypes mediate the pharmacological action of BZDs possessing low and high antiproconflict indices. 
Early loss of astrocytes in herpes simplex virus-induced central nervous system demyelination. Immunohistochemistry was used to study herpes simplex virus type 1-induced central nervous system demyelination in the trigeminal root entry zone of mice inoculated with herpes simplex virus type 1 by the corneal route. There was no change in peripheral nervous system myelin as shown by immunostaining for Po glycoprotein. Double immunoperoxidase staining for herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens and glial fibrillary acidic protein showed that most of the infected cells were astrocytes. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining was completely lost in the inferior medial portion of the trigeminal root entry zone at 6 days after herpes simplex virus type 1 inoculation, a time when central nervous system myelin was preserved as indicated by immunostaining for myelin basic protein. The pattern of glial fibrillary acidic protein staining did not change and herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens were no longer detected after day 8. There was a progressive loss of myelin basic protein staining within the area unstained by glial fibrillary acidic protein antisera on days 8 to 14. This pattern of astrocyte loss before central nervous system demyelination is strikingly different from the reactive astrocytosis seen in other demyelinating lesions, such as acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or acute multiple sclerosis. Herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in mice provides an unusual model of acute central nervous system demyelination preceded by a loss of astrocytes. 
Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity during delayed vasospasm in a canine model of subarachnoid hemorrhage. While the in vitro reactivity of cerebral conducting vessels following subarachnoid hemorrhage has been extensively studied, in vivo cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity has not been systematically investigated. We tested the hypothesis that, in the canine model of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the rise in cerebral blood flow normally seen with hypercapnia is blunted during delayed vasospasm. Four groups of animals were studied: one received two 4-ml subarachnoid injections of nonheparinized arterial blood into the cisterna magna (n = 8), one received three subarachnoid injections of 5 ml blood (n = 5), one received two subarachnoid injections of 4 ml saline (n = 5), and a control group (n = 5) had no subarachnoid injections or angiography. Basilar artery diameter was measured from baseline and follow-up angiography. We determined CO2 reactivity by randomly varying the concentration of inspired CO2 and measuring regional cerebral blood flow with radiolabeled microspheres. Basilar artery diameter was not affected by saline injection and was reduced by 26 +/- 2.9% in the two-hemorrhage group and 55 +/- 1.9% in the three-hemorrhage group. Baseline cerebral blood flow and CO2 reactivity were similar in all four groups. We conclude that, in this model of delayed vasospasm, regional cerebral vascular CO2 reactivity is intact and extrapolation of in vitro data regarding basilar artery diameter and reactivity to cerebral blood flow must be done cautiously. 
ABO blood groups and the risk of diarrhea due to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. To determine whether blood group O persons are at higher risk for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) diarrhea, a case-control study was done for 17 months among rural Bangladeshis who were under systematic surveillance for diarrhea. Cases were children less than 3 years old who presented between 1 January 1985 and 1 June 1986 for care of heat labile (LT) or heat stabile toxin-producing ETEC diarrhea. Controls were of similar ages and were randomly selected from three community-based serosurveys between July 1985 and May 1986. No association between blood group O and ETEC diarrhea was found for the 510 cases and 641 controls, nor was an association evident for cases of each toxin phenotype. Further refinement of the case definition to include only patients with LT-ETEC diarrhea, without enteric copathogens, also failed to reveal a substantial association with blood group O. These data suggest that a strong association with ABO groups, analogous to that for cholera, does not exist for ETEC diarrhea. 
Alleged brain damage, diminished capacity, mens rea, and misuse of medical concepts. As focus on the insanity defense diminishes, defendants may place emphasis on a lack of knowing or purposeful behavior in order to negate a criminal charge. This use of a mens rea defense in accord with Model Penal Code principles is exemplified by the current New Jersey statute. Such a defense may result in a lesser charge or a finding of not guilty. In addition to reviewing applicable law, this report presents a sex offense case in which remote brain damage was invoked as a purported basis for incapacity to formulate the required intent; the study also raises the issue of the inappropriate or questionable use of medical principles, a practice that diminishes professional credibility in the courts and in the community. 
Regulation of Ras-GAP and the neurofibromatosis-1 gene product by eicosanoids. Ras-GAP (GTPase activating protein) is a regulatory protein that stimulates the intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of the proto-oncogene product p21ras. A domain of the neurofibromatosis gene product (NF1) that has sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of Ras-GAP and to yeast IRA gene products also has a specific stimulatory activity toward p21ras GTPase. Arachidonic acid and phosphatidic acid inactivate GAP, but no agents have been identified that stimulate GAP and thereby switch p21ras off. With the use of recombinant Ha-c-Ras and Ras-GAP, NF1, and GAP catalytic domains, it was found that prostaglandins PGF2 alpha and PGA2 stimulated Ras-GAP and that prostacyclin PGI2 inhibited Ras-GAP. The stimulatory effect of PGF2 alpha was saturable and structure-specific and competed with the inhibitory effect of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid also inhibited the catalytic activity of NF1, but prostaglandins were not stimulatory. These results suggest a mechanism for the allosteric control of Ras function through the modulation of arachidonate metabolism. 
Treatment of male genital condylomatous lesions by carbon dioxide laser after failure of previous nonlaser methods. Carbon dioxide laser was used to treat 119 male patients with condylomata acuminata after other treatments had failed. In 82.3% of the patients, the treatment resulted in complete disappearance of the lesions, whereas in the others two to three treatments were required. Advantages of the laser treatment are discussed. 
Effects of quinapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on left ventricular failure and survival in the cardiomyopathic hamster. Hemodynamic, morphological, and biochemical correlates. The effect of chronic therapy with quinapril on the temporal progression of left ventricular failure and survival was assessed in the CHF 146 cardiomyopathic (CM) hamster, which is an idiopathic model of congestive heart failure. Age-matched Golden Syrian (GS) hamsters served as normal controls. Quinapril was administered in the drinking water at average daily doses of 10.2, 112.4, and 222.4 mg/kg/day. In untreated CM hamsters, in vitro left ventricular performance progressively deteriorated with increasing age beginning at roughly 180 days. This decline in left ventricular performance was accompanied by a decrease in coronary flow and an increase in left ventricular volume. Administration of quinapril from 180 to 300 days of age prevented the decline of in vitro left ventricular contractile performance and coronary flow and also reduced the age-dependent increases in left ventricular volume. The cardioprotective effects of quinapril were observed at doses of 112.4 and 222.4 mg/kg/day but not at 10.2 mg/kg/day. Lung angiotensin converting enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by quinapril in GS and CM hamsters at 240 and 300 days of age at all dose levels. In contrast, significant inhibition of ventricular angiotensin converting enzyme activity was observed consistently at doses of 112.4 and 222.4 mg/kg/day quinapril but not at 10.2 mg/kg/day. In the survival protocol, CM and GS hamsters were treated with vehicle or quinapril (100 mg/kg/day) from 180 to 522 days of age. During the initial 210 days of treatment (from 180 to 390 days of age) 78.3% of the vehicle-treated CM hamsters died compared with 27.7% of quinapril-treated CM hamsters. Quinapril increased the median survival time of CM hamsters by 32.9% (112 days). It is concluded that chronic quinapril therapy exerts a significant cardioprotective effect and also increases survival. 
Two-point fixation of the lumbar spine. Differential stability in rotation. Single vertebral motion segments were tested in torsion. The adjacent vertebrae were transfixed by two 3-mm Steinman pins placed vertically. These were applied in five different positions: between the anterior vertebral bodies, posterior vertebral bodies, pedicles, transverse processes, and lamina. Rotational displacement was limited the most by transfixation between the vertebral bodies (position one or two). Disrupting the anulus fibrosus significantly increased rotation in all positions except those in the vertebral body. These findings may imply that spinal fixation devices that engage the vertebral bodies may offer inherent advantages over purely posterior devices in stabilizing a vertebral motion segment. In addition, an interbody arthrodesis may prevent intervertebral motion better than a posterior or posterolateral fusion. 
The nutcracker syndrome: new aspects of pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to study vascular anatomy in 3 patients with the nutcracker syndrome and in 10 healthy volunteers. From these studies an abnormal branching of the superior mesenteric artery from the aorta was identified as being the cause of the nutcracker syndrome. Consequently, surgical transposition of the left renal vein to achieve an unobstructed renal venous backflow was performed successfully in 2 patients, while 1 underwent nephrectomy. In 1 patient adjuvant ureteral instrumentation became necessary to aid occlusion of persisting shunts between peripelvic venous varicosities and the urinary tract. Awareness of the pathophysiology of the nutcracker syndrome ensures an early diagnosis, which should be confirmed by a combination of diagnostic procedures, including MRI. 
Course of brittle diabetes: 12 year follow up. OBJECTIVE--To determine the course of brittle diabetes. DESIGN--12 year follow up of patients identified in 1977-9 as having brittle diabetes; retrospective review of the case notes. SETTING--Nottingham health district. SUBJECTS--25 brittle diabetic patients were identified in 1979-9; 11 (five men) had three or more admissions with ketoacidosis between June 1977 and 1979 and 14 (eight men) had three or more attendances at the accident and emergency department with hypoglycaemia in 1978. Two controls from our diabetic register were matched to each patient for age, sex, and duration of diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Frequency of ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycaemia in the 12 years after ascertainment; diabetic control and complications in 1988-90; retrospective attribution of the cause of brittleness. RESULTS--Patients with recurrent ketoacidosis had had a median (range) of 28 (8-67) episodes. One man died of a cerebral tumour but five of the surviving nine patients had not been admitted in the past two years, although diabetic control remained poor (median haemoglobin A1 concentration 14%). Seven patients had pure hypoglycaemic brittleness, and five had also had eight or more admissions with ketoacidosis (mixed brittleness). Two died of uraemia within a year after ascertainment and two others in hypoglycaemic coma seven and 12 years later. Brittle diabetes was in most cases related to a specific situation, usually unhappiness at home or school. CONCLUSIONS--Brittle diabetes is often episodic and almost always related to stressful life circumstances. Once the underlying cause is removed it tends to improve. Recurrent hypoglycaemic brittleness of psychological origin has a poor prognosis. 
Whole-abdominal irradiation for the management of gastrointestinal and abdominal manifestations of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. A patient with a long-standing history of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia developed weight loss and ascites secondary to gastric/small bowel infiltration and peritoneal implants of myeloid tissue. Moderate doses of radiation were very effective in controlling her gastrointestinal symptoms. In contrast to previous reports, clinical improvement after irradiation was a slow, gradual process, requiring 5 months for complete resolution of the patient's ascites. Hematologic suppression may be profound and careful attention to the rate of change in leukocyte and platelet counts is necessary to avoid severe toxicity. 
Twenty five years of case finding and audit in a socially deprived community. OBJECTIVE--To evaluate audit and case finding (whole population care) in a community over 25 years. DESIGN--Contemporary screening for and audits of care of chronic disease and risk factors; retrospective review of computerised practice records; and comparisons of mortality and social indices with neighbouring communities. SETTING--One general practice in Glyncorrwg, West Glamorgan. SUBJECTS--1800 people registered with the practice in 1987 and 558 people who died from 1964 to 1987, whose records had been retained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Detection of high blood pressure, smoking, airways obstruction, obesity, diabetes, and alcohol problems in adults aged 20-79; prevalence of smoking in this population and in hypertensive and diabetic groups; age standardised mortality ratios in relation to indices of social deprivation. RESULTS--In the population aged 20-79 (1207 patients) 249 (21%) had peak expiratory flow rate less than 50% of expected value or which improved by 15% or more with an inhaled beta agonist, 207 (17%) had body mass index at or over 30 kg/m2, 118 (10%) had untreated mean arterial pressures greater than 159/104 mm Hg (three readings), 80 (7%) (65 (16%) men, 15 (4%) women) had recognised alcohol problems, and 35 (3%) had diabetes. The proportion of men aged 20-64 who said they smoked fell from 61% (290/476) in 1968-70 to 36% (162/456) in 1985 whereas that of women who smoked was unchanged (43%, 187/436 v 42%, 190/448 respectively). In 116 screened hypertensive patients group mean blood pressure fell from 186/110 mm Hg before treatment to 146/84 mm Hg at 1987 audit, as did the proportion of smokers (56% v 20%), but body mass index and total cholesterol concentration showed no significant change. In 34 diabetic patients mean blood pressure and the proportion of smokers fell (171/93 mm Hg v 155/81 mm Hg; 44% v 12%). The age standardised mortality ratio in 1981-6 was lower than in a neighbouring village without a developed case finding programme (actual to expected deaths less than 65 = 21 to 22 in Glyncorrwg, 48 to 30 in control village). CONCLUSIONS--Whole population care through organised case finding and audit is feasible but only with a labour intensive approach combining accessibility, flexibility, and continuity, as well as a planned and structured approach, which requires substantial expansion of staff numbers and assiduous recording. It may reduce risks for at least some high risk groups. Despite their shortcomings the available data are consistent with the hypothesis that whole population care helps reduce mortality. Incentives in the new contract, which encourage the uncritical development of structured process, may diminish health outputs. 
Sensitivity of the gastric mucosa to acid and duodenal contents in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia. Nonulcer dyspepsia is a common clinical syndrome whose etiology is unknown. The sensitivity of the gastric mucosa to acid and duodenal contents in 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia was studied. The patients had a normal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy specimens were obtained for determination of Helicobacter pylori status. Fifteen of the 18 patients were infected with H. pylori. All patients underwent intubation with double-lumen tube and collection of cholecystokinin-stimulated pancretico-biliary secretions. Subsequently, normal saline, 0.1N hydrochloric acid, and autologous duodenal secretions were infused into the stomach in a randomized blinded fashion. A positive response was defined as the production of epigastric pain by acid and/or bile but not by saline. By this definition, only 6 patients (33%) had a positive response and none had reproduction of their usual symptoms. In patients with a negative response, only 4 remained asymptomatic during all infusions. The remaining 8 had symptoms during infusion of saline, 7 of whom also had symptoms during infusion of acid and/or duodenal secretions. Two of these patients had reproduction of their usual symptoms. In conclusion, the gastric mucosa in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia is not abnormally sensitive to acid or duodenal contents. 
Cell-cycle-related staining patterns of anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen monoclonal antibodies. Comparison with BrdUrd labeling and Ki-67 staining. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to nuclear antigens are increasingly used as tools to obtain valuable information concerning the proliferative characteristics of various types of cancer. Prerequisite for the application of these MAbs in surgical pathology is establishment of the level of expression and/or cellular distribution of the antigens in relation to distinct cell-cycle compartments. In this study the topologic distribution of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an auxiliary protein of DNA polymerase delta, as recognized by human autoantiserum (AK) and two recently developed MAbs (19A2 and 19F4), was evaluated. Using cultured human cancer cells as a model system, and providing optimal fixation/permeation procedures are applied, these antibodies display a high affinity for PCNA bound to nuclear replicon clusters, resulting in distinct granular staining patterns. A more diffuse nucleoplasmic PCNA staining was mainly restricted to non-S-phase cells; in methanol-fixed cells, staining intensity of this form relative to the replicon-bound form appeared higher after staining with 19A2 than with 19F4 or AK. Comparing PCNA expression (detected with 19A2) with the expression of the Ki-67 antigen, PCNA-negative cells are also Ki-67 negative. In MCF-7 human breast cancer cells treated with 10(-6) mol/l (molar) tamoxifen, the fraction of nuclei showing replication patterns decreased from 42% to 8% within 8 days, but PCNA and Ki-67 antigens remained detectable in most cells during this interval, indicating a relatively slow decrease of antigen expression in cells that have entered a quiescent state. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10(-6) mol/l methotrexate resulted in a rapid accumulation of cells with an early S-phase DNA content; PCNA replication patterns showing a frequency distribution reflecting this DNA content were observed up to 48 hours after treatment. This indicates that the presence of replication patterns as visualized with anti-PCNAs is not a measure of replicative activity per se. It is concluded that, providing nuclear non-S-phase PCNA staining is faint relative to staining of replicon clusters, anti-PCNA antibodies may be excellent markers to detect in situ cells with S-phase DNA contents. 
Acute myocardial infarction associated with prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 is rarely associated with serious maternal side effects when used for second-trimester pregnancy termination. Acute myocardial infarction complicating therapeutic pregnancy termination with prostaglandin E2 in a patient with chronic glomerulosclerosis and severe hypertension is reported. 
Continuous spinal anaesthesia for abdominal surgery in a patient receiving amiodarone. The perioperative management of a 57-yr-old patient receiving chronic amiodarone therapy with a continuous spinal anaesthetic for a low anterior resection of the colon is discussed. The most appropriate anaesthetic technique for patients receiving chronic amiodarone therapy remains controversial, but the avoidance of general anaesthesia may be beneficial because of the risk of postoperative pulmonary failure. In this patient continuous spinal anaesthesia was slowly titrated to the desired level, coincident haemodynamic alterations were easily treated as they developed, and high serum local anaesthetic concentrations which occur with other regional anaesthetic techniques were avoided. 
Submaximal endurance exercise performance during enalapril treatment in patients with essential hypertension. In a double-blind randomized crossover study of 10 patients with mild essential hypertension, the influence of antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (a single dose of 10 mg.day-1) on submaximal endurance exercise performance at a work rate eliciting a heart rate of 150 beats/min was studied. Resting and exercise blood pressure were significantly reduced during enalapril therapy. Heart rate was unaffected. Submaximal endurance exercise performance was reduced by 12% (p = 0.06). Plasma lactate concentrations were significantly increased and serum nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were decreased during exercise in patients receiving enalapril treatment. Plasma glucose and potassium levels and serum glycerol concentrations were not influenced by enalapril treatment. Because the impairment of endurance performance during enalapril treatment is relatively small compared with the reductions caused by other antihypertensive agents, such as beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents or diuretics, it is of minor clinical importance for most physically active patients with hypertension. 
Stage distribution of breast cancer: a basis for the evaluation of breast screening programmes. Stage at presentation can be predictive of future mortality rates. A change in stage distribution will be indicative of the effect of a programme. All registrations for 1985 aged over 50 years were staged from case notes and, to assess whether a stage drift is already occurring, cases that presented in 1975 were also staged. The accuracy and completeness of the Wessex Cancer Register for this particular cancer was assessed and further sources of registration identified. There was a significant difference between 1975 and 1985 stage distributions. If the Southampton and Salisbury service achieves the same success as the Gavleborg County trials, 4.61 deaths will be prevented at 5 years for each annual cohort of cases. For individual breast screening programmes, effectiveness is better monitored by analysis of stage distribution than of mortality rates. 
Transfalcine approach to a callosomarginal artery aneurysm. We describe a transfalcine approach to clipping and subsequently excising an expanding mycotic callosomarginal aneurysm. The patient had a devastating dominant (left) hemispheric spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage and was neurologically improving at the time of surgery nearly 2 months later. To avoid retracting the left hemisphere, we approached this left callosomarginal aneurysm from the nondominant side through the falx. The approach was straight-forward, and the result was satisfactory. 
Preherpetic neuralgia. We have encountered six zoster patients whose pain preceded rash by 7 to more than 100 days. Pain was severe, burning, and radicular, and located both in dermatomes different from, as well as in, the area of eventual rash. Two patients ultimately developed disseminated zoster with neurologic complications, one of zoster paresis, and the other, a fatal zoster encephalitis; both had been taking long-term, low-dose steroids. A third case of preherpetic neuralgia developed in a patient with prior metastatic carcinoma, and another case in a patient with an earlier episode of brachial neuritis. The final two cases of preherpetic neuralgia developed in individuals with no underlying disease. An extended period of pain before the onset of zoster rash has gone largely unrecognized. 
Amsacrine is safe and effective therapy for patients with myocardial dysfunction and acute leukemia. The role of amsacrine in inducing remission in patients with cardiac disease and acute leukemia was evaluated. There were 17 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), six with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and one with biphenotypic leukemia. In this series of 24 patients whose disease had relapsed and who had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, nine had a complete remission, seven with AML and two with ALL. In addition, four of six with newly diagnosed acute leukemia and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction also responded. Among nine patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsy, none had morphologic changes of sufficient degree to account for drug-induced heart failure. Patients with preexisting arrhythmias received amsacrine without incident if their serum potassium level was higher than 4.0 mEq/l at the time of drug administration. Amsacrine is safe and effective therapy for patients with acute leukemia and cardiac disease. 
Pagetoid carcinomatous involvement of the penile urethra in association with high-grade transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. We present a case of pagetoid carcinomatous involvement of the penile urethra and periurethral glands following cystoprostatectomy for high-grade transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Previously reported cases with involvement of the urethra are reviewed. This condition is believed to be a rare variant of transitional cell carcinoma in situ. 
Mechanisms of failure of mitral valve repair: an echocardiographic study. Surgical valve repair for mitral regurgitation has significant advantages over valve replacement, but little is known about the mechanisms of its failure. This echocardiographic study examined abnormalities leading to failed mitral valve repair in two populations: "immediate failure" of the valve repair in the operating room requiring a second run of cardiopulmonary bypass and "late failure" of valve repair necessitating reoperation on another occasion. Intraoperative echocardiography (IOE) after cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in 309 patients undergoing valve repair for mitral regurgitation over a 3-year period. Twenty-six (8%) of these patients had immediate failure of the repair demonstrated by IOE, requiring further repair or replacement during the same thoracotomy. The causes of immediate failure were left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (10 patients), incomplete correction (10 patients), and suture dehiscence (six patients). Echocardiography was performed on 17 patients requiring reoperation for recurrent mitral regurgitation who had undergone previous primary valve repair. These late failures resulted from progressive degenerative leaflet or chordal disease (n = 9) or suture dehiscence of the annular ring or the leaflet resection site (n = 6). In only two patients early in the series did the problem originate from inadequate initial surgery. IOE is an effective marker for unsuccessful mitral valve repair, and affords an understanding of the mechanism of the persistent dysfunction. Immediate failure of mitral repair may be reduced by greater attention to the mechanism of valve dysfunction and by changes in valvuloplasty technique to avoid outflow tract obstruction. Late failure after mitral repair occurs predominantly due to progression of disease, particularly in patients with severe myxomatous or annular abnormalities that are prone to progress. 
Localized Aspergillus infestation in primary lung carcinoma. Clinical and pathological contrasts with post-tuberculous intracavitary aspergilloma. Saprophytic infestation with Aspergillus was observed in pathologic specimens of primary squamous cell lung carcinoma. In one case, the fungus grew in cystic scarred parenchyma and bronchi distal to an obstructing carcinoma of a segment bronchus. In the other, fungi colonized the inner surface of a peripheral cavitary carcinoma. Neither patient had roentgenographic evidence of aspergilloma and neither experienced severe pulmonary hemorrhage or other complications attributable to the presence of fungus. Although both specimens showed colonizing growth within the abnormal air spaces, in neither had the colonies detached to form a separate intracavitary fungus ball. These patients, and eight patients with similar lesions reported in the literature, demonstrate that Aspergillus colonization of a lung neoplasm frequently lacks one or both of the features characteristic of post-inflammatory intracavitary aspergilloma, a loose fungus ball and antifungal serum antibodies. No patient, to date, has developed massive hemorrhage as a complication of this lesion. 
Scopolamine patch reduces postoperative emesis in paediatric patients following strabismus surgery. Scopolamine patch was evaluated for the prevention of postoperative emesis in 50 children undergoing strabismus surgery. All subjects were premedicated, with none receiving narcotic premedicants. Anaesthesia included controlled ventilation with the use of muscle relaxants, atropine, and halothane. Before operation, the subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a treatment group received a scopolamine patch at a dose of either 0.75 mg or 0.375 mg, and a control group received no patch. Both the incidence and frequency of vomiting in the scopolamine-treated group were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than in the control group. 
Recurrence risk of a new dominant mutation in children of unaffected parents. Extensions to models originally described by Hartl for predicting the recurrence risk of new dominant mutations are developed in this paper. Additions to the models are (1) possible somatic mosaicism in a parent in some families, (2) the possibility that the parental origin of the mutation may or may not be known, and (3) mutation rates which change as a function of sex and/or time. The models indicate that recurrence risks are most critically affected by (a) the amount of somatic mosaicism which can be tolerated in the parent without manifesting disease and (b) knowledge of the parental origin of the mutation. In addition, there is a moderate effect on recurrence risks if mutation rates increase in the father as a function of time. Recurrence risks are at least as large as the risk of trisomy 21 in a child of a mother of age 35 years or older, probably much higher (5%-10%) when the mutation is known to be of maternal origin or if substantial somatic mosaicism in the parent is compatible with a normal phenotype. The recurrence risk of a new mutation is high because of a very high ascertainment bias of families with substantial germ-line mosaicism. 
Smoking-attributable cancer mortality in 1991: is lung cancer now the leading cause of death among smokers in the United States? Findings from the new American Cancer Society prospective study of 1.2 million men and women indicate that mortality risks among smokers have increased substantially for most of the eight major cancer sites causally associated with cigarette smoking. Lung cancer risk for male smokers doubled, while the risk for females increased more than fourfold. On the basis of the new American Cancer Society relative risks, we project that cigarette smoking alone will contribute to slightly more than 157,000 of the 514,000 total cancer deaths expected to occur in the United States in 1991. Overall, smoking directly contributes to 21.5% of all cancer deaths in women but 45% of all cancer deaths in men. It would also appear that lung cancer has now displaced coronary heart disease as the single leading cause of excess mortality among smokers in the United States. 
Extracorporeal lithotripsy. An important adjunct in the nonoperative management of retained or recurrent bile duct stones. Retained or recurrent bile duct stones can be successfully removed in up to 80% to 85% of patients with the use of percutaneous or endoscopic techniques. However, problems related to difficult biliary access, large stones, and biliary strictures may decrease the success rate of this approach. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in 16 patients with complicated biliary stones treated prospectively over a 24-month period. Successful stone fragmentation was achieved in 15 patients (94%) using a Dornier HM3 lithotripter (average of 2290 shocks at 22 kV). Three patients (19%) required a second ESWL treatment. Biliary clearance of stone fragments was spontaneous in seven (43%) of the patients and required additional treatment in eight (57%) of the patients. Complications from ESWL were minor and included transient hematuria and ecchymoses at the skin entry site. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy failed in one patient (6%) with a biliary stricture and surgery was required. At hospital discharge, all patients were asymptomatic and stone free. Treatment with ESWL appears to be a safe and effective adjunct for selected patients with complex biliary stone disease. 
Purtscher's-like retinopathy after childbirth. Severe bilateral visual loss attributable to multiple retinal arteriolar occlusions occurred in four young women within 24 hours after childbirth. In two patients, labor was complicated by preeclampsia requiring cesarean section. One patient was suffering from pancreatitis. None had connective tissue disease or antecedent trauma. Ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography revealed evidence of multiple superficial peripapillary and macular patches of ischemic retinal whitening simulating Purtscher's retinopathy. By 8 weeks, the white patches were resolving in all eyes and visual acuity had significantly improved in three of the four patients. The pathogenesis of this disorder is unknown but may involve arteriolar obstruction by complement-induced leukoemboli formed during parturition. 
Seronegative symmetric polyarthritis in Sezary syndrome. We describe a patient with Sezary syndrome and seronegative symmetric polyarthritis. Detailed analysis of the synovial membrane, including T lymphocyte subset delineation, demonstrated that malignant synovial infiltration was the direct cause of arthritis in this patient. 
Cyclophosphamide cardiotoxicity in bone marrow transplantation: a prospective evaluation of new dosing regimens. Cyclophosphamide (CY) cardiotoxicity may be a lethal complication of bone marrow transplantation. Previous echocardiographic studies have reported that left ventricular dysfunction due to CY occurs in over 50% of patients undergoing transplantation. To evaluate the cardiotoxicity of new dosing protocols that included twice-daily rather than once-daily CY, 44 bone marrow transplantation patients were prospectively evaluated with serial ECGs and echocardiograms. Twenty-six patients received a once-daily lower-dose protocol (mean total 87 +/- 11 mg/kg), and 18 patients received a twice-daily higher-dose (mean total 174 +/- 34 mg/kg) CY regimen. In the higher-dose CY group, significant reductions in summed ECG voltage (-20%) (P less than .01) and increases in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (+10%) (P less than .05) were detected in the first week following therapy. These changes resolved by the third week following CY and were significantly greater than the changes noted in the lower-dose group. However, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) did not change significantly in either group. Five patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity (four, pericarditis; one, congestive heart failure); four of the five patients were in the higher-dose group (P = .14). Only a prior history of congestive heart failure or a baseline EF less than 50% was an independent correlate of clinical cardiotoxicity (P less than .05). Thus, dose-dependent cardiotoxicity following the use of CY for bone marrow transplantation is evident as reversible decreases in ECG voltage and increases in left ventricular mass, possibly reflecting myocardial edema or hemorrhage. However, systolic dysfunction is much less common with these new twice-daily dosing regimens when compared with earlier studies of high-dose once-daily CY. 
Engraftment after infusion of CD34+ marrow cells in patients with breast cancer or neuroblastoma. The CD34 antigen is expressed by 1% to 4% of human and baboon marrow cells, including virtually all hematopoietic progenitors detectable by in vitro assays. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that CD34+ marrow cells can engraft lethally irradiated baboons. Because the CD34 antigen has not been detected on most solid tumors, positive selection of CD34+ cells may be used to provide marrow cells capable of engraftment, but depleted of tumor cells. In seven patients with stage IV breast cancer and two patients with stage IV neuroblastoma, 2.5 to 17.5 x 10(9) marrow cells were separated by immunoadsorption with the anti-CD34 antibody 12-8 and 50 to 260 x 10(6) positively selected cells were recovered that were 64 +/- 16% (range 35% to 92%) CD34+. The patients received 1.0 to 5.2 x 10(6) CD34-enriched cells/kg after marrow ablative therapy. Six patients engrafted, achieving granulocyte counts of greater than 500/mm3 at 34 +/- 10 (range 21 to 47) days and platelets counts of greater than 20,000/mm3 at 46 +/- 14 (range 28 to 66) days posttransplant. Five of these patients showed durable engraftment until the time of death 82 to 386 days posttransplant. One patient failed to sustain engraftment associated with metastatic marrow disease. Three patients died at days 14, 14, and 17 posttransplant, two of whom had evidence of early engraftment. These studies suggest that CD34+ marrow cells are capable of reconstituting hematopoiesis in humans. 
Vasopressin levels in infants during the course of aseptic and bacterial meningitis. We measured urine vasopressin (VP) once daily on days 1 through 3 in 18 patients hospitalized with meningitis. Urine VP values were 215 +/- 100, 116 +/- 44, and 69 +/- 23 pg/mL on days 1 through 3, respectively, for children with bacterial meningitis and 34 +/- 14, 20 +/- 4, and 15 +/- 4 pg/mL for those with aseptic meningitis. Urinary VP levels of infants with bacterial meningitis were significantly greater than those of healthy ambulatory subjects (n = 18) on all three study days; VP values of infants with bacterial meningitis were also greater than those of infants with aseptic meningitis on study days 2 and 3. The VP levels for the subjects with aseptic meningitis were significantly greater than those of the controls on day 1 only. None of the infants exhibited the clinical syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. 
Femoral-distal bypass with in situ greater saphenous vein. Long-term results using the Mills valvulotome. During a 7-year period, 440 consecutive in situ saphenous vein grafts originating in the groin were performed in 371 patients, exposing the entire vein for valvulotomy with a modified Mills valvulotome. critical ischemia was the indication for bypass in 68%, and the distal anastomosis was to an infrapopliteal artery in 46%. Thirty-day operative mortality was 2.0%. Postoperative surveillance identified 18 stenotic grafts (4.1%), which were revised while still patent (primary revised patency); 36 grafts (8.2%) underwent revision after graft occlusion (secondary patency). Five-year life-table analysis showed overall primary revised patency of 78%, secondary patency of 83%, limb salvage of 88%, and patient survival of 66%. Femoroperoneal and inframalleolar bypasses fared well. The presence of diabetes did not diminish late graft patency. In contrast to reversed vein grafts, long infrapopliteal in situ grafts had long-term secondary patency similar to shorter femoropopliteal bypass grafts (p greater than 0.05). These results, coupled with the versatility and simplicity of the technique as used in the present series, suggest that in situ vein grafting is the procedure of choice for long infrapopliteal bypass. 
Disseminated malignant melanoma and recombinant interferon: analysis of seven consecutive phase II investigations. We have performed seven phase II trials with recombinant interferons (IFN) involving 191 patients with biopsy-proved, measurable disseminated malignant melanoma. The regimens and numbers of patients have included IFN-alpha 2A, 50 X 10(6) U/m2 subcutaneous (SQ) TIW (regimen A, 31 patients); IFN-alpha 2A, 12 X 10(6) U/m2 SQ TIW (regimen B, 30 patients); IFN-alpha 2A with cimetidine as an immunorestorative agent (regimen C, 35 patients); IFN-gamma (regimen E, 29 patients); IFN-alpha 2A with IFN gamma (Regimen E, 20 patients); IFN-alpha 2A with bis-chloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU) (regimen F, 30 patients); and IFN-alpha 2A with the biochemical modulator, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) (regimen G, 16 patients). The objective regression rates were as follows: A, 23%; B, 20%; C, 23%; D, 10%; E, 5%; F, 7%; G, 0%. Despite the higher response rate from regimen A, there appeared to be no survival advantage from any of these programs. The median time to progression was 1 month with a median survival time of 6 months. Most regressions involved soft tissue disease, were partial, and occurred within 2-3 months of treatment. Four patients received IFN for approximately 6 months and have manifested extraordinarily durable regressions of greater than 4+ years. The alpha-regimens produced a flu-type illness and anorexia which were dose-related. Leukopenia was most noteworthy with regimens containing gamma-interferon. Ongoing trials involving alternative and improved immune-related modalities are awaited with keen interest. 
Diffusion-weighted MR imaging of the brain: value of differentiating between extraaxial cysts and epidermoid tumors. This study demonstrates the use of diffusion-weighted MR imaging in improving the specificity of the diagnosis of extraaxial brain tumors. Three surgically proved lesions (one arachnoid cyst and two epidermoid tumors) and two nonsurgically proved lesions (arachnoid and ependymal cysts) were evaluated with T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo studies followed by intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MR imaging. The IVIM images of the lesions were displayed as an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) image obtained at 0.65 G/cm (maximum gradient b value = 100 sec/mm2) and compared with external oil and water phantoms. The ADC of arachnoid cysts was similar to stationary water whereas the ADC of epidermoid tumors was similar to brain parenchyma, indicating the solid nature and the slower diffusion rate of the epidermoid tumors. Cisternal CSF demonstrated uniformly high ADC, primarily because of bulk flow, which enhanced image contrast. Improved delineation of postsurgical changes was also possible. Our preliminary results show that diffusion-weighted MR imaging can be useful in distinguishing between arachnoid cysts and epidermoid tumors. 
The prophylactic use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors in recurrent herpes simplex infections. In an open study, continuous oral therapy with cyclooxygenase inhibitors (ibuprofen or indomethacin) reduced the incidence and frequency of recurrent eruptions in nine of 16 patients with herpes simplex virus infection. Retrospective analysis of seven cases indicated that natural killer cell enhancement assays might allow us to predict the clinical outcome of such treatment. 
Fusiform dilatations of the carotid artery following radical surgery of childhood craniopharyngiomas. Between 1982 and 1990, a series of 31 children with craniopharyngiomas underwent initial surgery at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with an attempt at total tumor removal. Nine (29%) of them were found to have fusiform dilatation of the supraclinoid carotid artery either at the time of surgery for recurrence (one patient) or on routine surveillance with enhanced computerized tomography 6 to 18 months postoperatively (eight patients). The finding of carotid enlargement was confirmed in seven cases with magnetic resonance angiography and in one case with a formal arteriogram. Eight of the nine patients remain alive at a mean of 3.7 years after diagnosis. None have experienced hemorrhage or other symptoms referrable to fusiform dilatation of the carotid artery, which is believed to result from surgical manipulation of the carotid artery. 
The effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on renal growth, function and arterial blood pressure in an animal model. The long-term effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) on children treated for renal calculi are unclear. To study the long-term bio-effects of this mode of treatment on the immature animal we evaluated 30 New Zealand white rabbits at 7 weeks of age for weight, serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, and arterial blood pressure after which they underwent left nephrectomy. Each group of 5 rabbits received ESWL of varying levels (500 to 3,000 shock waves) to the remaining right kidney using the Northgate SD3 lithotriptor (spark gap mediated). One control group received no shock waves. At maturity (16 weeks) the aforementioned parameters were measured again, and the kidneys and any grossly abnormal adjacent organs were examined. We found no significant change in total animal growth, renal growth, renal function or perirenal organs in the post-ESWL groups versus the control group. All post-ESWL groups had an increase in mean arterial blood pressure versus the control group with 3 of 6 groups showing significant increases (p less than 0.05). Histological renal changes, seen at all energy levels of ESWL delivered, included interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, glomeruli destruction, capsular thickening, perivascular fibrosis and mild arteriole wall thickening. Changes were proportional to the number of shocks received. We conclude that ESWL delivered to immature animals does not significantly affect renal growth and function but it can cause significant permanent histological renal changes even at low doses and may result in an increase in adult mean arterial blood pressure. 
Adenoid cystic carcinoma: DNA as a prognostic indicator. A retrospective study was performed on 20 patients with adenoid cystic carcinomas of major salivary glands to see if DNA patterns correlated with their prognoses. Fourteen tumors were found to be DNA diploid; 6 were DNA aneuploid. Histologically, all DNA-aneuploid tumors had solid components, compared with only 5 of the DNA-diploid tumors. All of the DNA-aneuploid tumors recurred, in contrast to only 2 of the DNA-diploid tumors; the difference was highly significant (P less than 0.001). All of the patients with no recurrences had DNA-diploid tumors. In our study, DNA measurements of adenoid cystic carcinomas gave statistically significant information about prognosis and correlated to histological grading. We propose that evaluation of DNA content may be performed before planning the treatment of adenoid cystic carcinomas. 
Ventriculoatrial shunts for hydrocephalus and cardiac valvulopathy: an echocardiographic evaluation. A group of 20 patients with ventriculoatrial shunts placed as surgical treatment for hydrocephalus were evaluated for cardiac lesions, particularly of the tricuspid valve. Patients with histories of septic or thromboembolic events were excluded. In each patient a clinical history, complete physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray film and M-mode, two-dimensional and pulsed continuous wave and color-coded Doppler echocardiography were performed. Eight patients were found to have cardiac abnormalities including tricuspid valve insufficiency, tricuspid stenosis and insufficiency, and the catheter passing through the foramen ovale into the left atrium. These findings demonstrate that tricuspid valvular lesions are frequent in patients with ventriculoatrial shunts, and that periodic echocardiographic evaluation should be performed routinely. 
Computed tomography of cranial metastatic malignant melanoma: features, early detection and unusual cases. The cranial computed tomographic (CT) scans reported as showing metastatic disease in patients with malignant melanoma (MM) seen at the Westminster Hospital over a 5 year period were reviewed. Ninety-eight patients with intracranial metastatic MM were identified. Twelve had an initial scan which was reported as normal and particular attention was given to these to see if, in retrospect, any early features of metastatic disease were discernible. Fifty-eight cases showed the "typical" features of intracranial MM; the remainder were unusual in appearance, behavior, or site. Radiological regression was shown in only seven cases on follow-up scans; all but one of these patients had one or two large metastases. No significant lesion was thought to have been missed on a scan after the administration of intravenous contrast medium, but the lesions of three patients were difficult to discern on plain scans. Thus when MM metastasis is suspected, the use of the contrast-only scan is advocated. 
Thalamic atrophy following cerebral infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. We investigated shrinkage of the ipsilateral thalamus following infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery in 33 patients who were admitted less than or equal to 2 days after the stroke and who were followed by computed tomography for greater than 1 year with no recurrences. The thalamic area was measured on the computed tomograms, and the ratio of the ipsilateral area to the contralateral area was calculated. All values were compared with values from the initial computed tomogram taken less than or equal to 2 days after the stroke. The values of the ratio on follow-up computed tomograms decreased gradually in 15 patients. In these cases, the area of the ipsilateral thalamus was significantly reduced after 1 year (p less than 0.01) and marked atrophy was observed. These results demonstrate the significance of remote changes over a long period of time after focal cerebral infarction. 
Efficacy and safety of prehospital rewarming techniques to treat accidental hypothermia. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of inhalation rewarming and peripheral rewarming for reducing the body core temperature afterdrop and accelerating rewarming rates. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized human experimentation. SETTING: Physiology laboratory with cooling during ice water immersion and rewarming in rescue sleeping bags in a windy, cold (2 C) air environment. Type of participants: Eight experimental subjects who were cooled to clinical hypothermia (35.0 C), rectal or esophageal temperature (Tr or Te). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Afterdrop was characterized as minimum Tr and Te plus recovery time to the Tr and Te levels at the onset of rewarming. Rewarming rates 30 and 60 minutes after maximum afterdrop for Tr and Te were measured. By analysis of variance, inhalation rewarming and peripheral rewarming evaluated separately or in combination did not significantly influence afterdrop duration, afterdrop recovery, or rewarming rates. CONCLUSION: With no physiological benefit and hazards identified (inhalation rewarming burning the face, peripheral rewarming eliminating carbon monoxide equal to 300 to 600 ppm), inhalation rewarming and peripheral rewarming are not recommended for the prehospital treatment of mild hypothermia. 
Reduction of infarct size by systemic amino acid supplementation during reperfusion. The amino acids aspartate and glutamate, in combination, were evaluated as a means of reducing infarct size and improving cardiac function during reperfusion in an intact pig having an acute anteroseptal infarct. Three groups of 6 pigs each were randomly studied in a blinded manner: control (no amino acids), aspartate/glutamate 3 mmol/L, and aspartate/glutamate 13 mmol/L. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded distal to its first diagonal branch for 60 minutes followed by reperfusion for 6 hours. Aspartate and glutamate were administered systemically immediately before reperfusion. The following parameters were measured: infarct size and percent area at risk, global metabolic function, global and regional myocardial function, and tissue parameters of metabolic function. The results clearly showed a significant decrease in infarct size from 60% of the area at risk in control pigs to 37% in both 3 mmol/L and 13 mmol/L amino acid groups. Cardiac output, coronary blood flow, and global oxygen consumption were not significantly affected by the use of amino acids relative to the control group. Global left ventricular mechanical function was also not adversely affected by the infarct and was not altered by amino acid administration. Regional function, however, was significantly decreased by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in all groups to near 20% and only significantly recovered to 64% in the 13 mmol/L amino acid group. Adenosine triphosphate and acetyl coenzyme A measurements documented significant increases in the 13 mmol/L amino acid group relative to the control group. The conclusions of this study strongly support aspartate/glutamate supplementation for stunned, reperfused myocardium. It is apparent that the effect of amino acid supplementation on glycolysis is directly translated into improved regional function and reduced infarct size. 
Can health education increase uptake of cervical smear testing among Asian women? OBJECTIVES--To determine the effects of three different methods of providing health education on the uptake of cervical smear testing among Asian women, and to evaluate the acceptability of different health education materials. DESIGN--Prospective cohort study over one year of effects of written materials by post, personal visit to give written materials, and personal visit to show a video on the uptake of smear testing. Techniques included a personally administered questionnaire. SETTING--Leicester, a city with a large Asian population. SUBJECTS--737 randomly selected Asian women aged 18 to 52 who were not recorded on the central cytology laboratory's computer as ever having had a cervical smear test. 159 declined to participate or were not contactable. INTERVENTIONS--Women were randomised into four groups: visited and shown a video (263), visited and shown a leaflet and fact sheet (219), posted a leaflet and fact sheet (131), not contacted at all (124). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cervical smear test recorded on computer within four months after intervention. RESULTS--57 (37%, 26% of group) of the women visited and given leaflets and 80 (47%, 30% of group) shown the video attended for cervical smears. Only six (5%) of those who were not contacted and 14 (11%) of those sent leaflets had a smear test during the study. CONCLUSION--Health education interventions increased the uptake of cervical cytology among Asian women in Leicester who had never been tested. Personal visits were most effective irrespective of the health education materials used, but there was some evidence that home viewed videos may be particularly effective in one of the most hard to reach groups: Urdu speaking, Pakistani Moslems. Written translated materials sent by post were ineffective. 
Assessment of myocardial damage in dilated-phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by using indium-111-antimyosin Fab myocardial scintigraphy. For the detection of myocardial cell damage, an 111In-antimyosin Fab study was carried out on seven patients (Group A) in the dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, seven patients (Group B) with dilated cardiomyopathy, and eight control patients (Group C). Imaging was done 48 hr after intravenous injection of 74 MBq of 111In-antimyosin Fab. Myocardial antimyosin uptake was visually graded as 0, +1, +2 or +3. A score of +2 or +3 was considered positive. The heart/lung ratio of antimyosin uptake (antimyosin index) also was determined. Antimyosin uptake was positive in seven (100%), nine (90%) and no (0%) patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. The antimyosin index in Groups A and B was 2.46 +/- 0.49 and 2.04 +/- 0.24, respectively, findings were significantly higher than that in Group C (1.51 +/- 0.13) (p less than 0.01). Positive biopsy findings were noted in only two patients in Group A. Thus, antimyosin uptake was increased in dilated phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy, which suggests ongoing necrotic changes in these patients. 
Assessment of blood echogenicity as an alternative measure to erythrocyte sedimentation rate. OBJECTIVE--To determine the relation between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood echogenicity and whether measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate could be replaced by measurement of blood echogenicity in monitoring acute phase reactions. DESIGN--Simultaneous measurement of echogenicity of flowing blood and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in blood samples and comparison of results. SETTING--A radiological department in a university hospital. SUBJECTS--83 patients with a suspected venous thrombosis and 36 healthy volunteers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Correlations between the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, packed cell volume, and echogenicity of flowing blood. RESULTS--Blood echogenicity correlated poorly with the packed cell volume, but strongly correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (when the packed cell volume was within reference limits) (correlation coefficient = 0.73). Blood samples with a greatly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate were highly echogenic. Only one of the 30 samples with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate below 10 mm in first hour had a higher echogenicity than the least echogenic sample of the 19 with a sedimentation rate above 30 mm in first hour. CONCLUSIONS--Echogenicity of flowing blood correlates with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and its measurement may compete with conventional methods for evaluating the long term changes in acute phase reactions. Also, it has the added advantage that non-invasive in vivo measurements of blood echogenicity may become possible. 
Increased MR signal intensity due to cervical myelopathy. Analysis of 29 surgical cases. The cases of 29 patients with cervical myelopathy, who had been treated by anterior spine fusion, were reviewed. The relationship between pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images was investigated with special reference to increased signal intensity in the spinal cord on the T2-weighted images and the relevance of this finding to clinical conditions. Preoperatively, there were areas of increased signal intensity in 12 patients whereas there were no areas of increased signal intensity in the other 17. The lesions were not clearly demonstrated on T1-weighted images. The pre- and postoperative clinical condition of the patients whose preoperative MR images showed areas of increased signal intensity in the spinal cord on T2-weighted images was worse than that of the patients who did not have areas of increased signal intensity. Of the 12 patients with regions of increased signal intensity preoperatively, five showed decreased signal intensity postoperatively compared to the preoperative levels and seven had no change. The postoperative recovery of the five patients who showed decreased signal intensity postoperatively was better than that of the seven patients who exhibited no change. The areas of increased MR signal in the spinal cord might be due to edema, cord gliosis, demyelination, or microcavities. 
Chlamydia trachomatis in the fallopian tubes of women without laparoscopic evidence of salpingitis. 23 women with lower abdominal pain and Chlamydia trachomatis in the cervix, urethra, or both sites were studied. Laparoscopy was done with sampling of the endometrium and fallopian tubes for detection of C trachomatis. 11 women had laparoscopic evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID); C trachomatis was detected in the upper genital tract of 8, but not in the upper tract of 5 who had laparoscopy again after treatment. The organism was also found in the upper genital tract of 9 of the 12 women without laparoscopic evidence of PID. Most of the women with abdominal pain or tenderness had tubal or endometrial C trachomatis infection, although only half had laparoscopic evidence of salpingitis. This finding suggests that antibiotic treatment should be given as soon as chlamydial infection is detected in the cervix and that pain does not necessarily point to C trachomatis in the upper genital tract. Laparoscopy may miss important pathogens in the upper genital tract, unless the procedure is complemented with detailed microbiological investigation. 
Left flank retroperitoneal exposure: a technical aid to complex aortic reconstruction. Over the last 5 years an extended left flank retroperitoneal approach was used in 85 of 531 (16%) aortic reconstructions deemed technically complex. Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was performed in 70 patients (82%), bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease was performed in 11 (13%), and aortic endarterectomy for mesenteric and/or renovascular disease was performed in 4 (5%). Indications for use of this approach included a "hostile" abdomen (43 patients), juxta/suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (35), large (greater than 10 cm) abdominal aortic aneurysm (12), extreme obesity (10), associated renal and/or visceral artery stenosis requiring endarterectomy (9), inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (2), and horseshoe kidney (2). Suprarenal or supraceliac aortic clamping, averaging 31 minutes, was required in 43 patients (50%). Postoperative recovery was rapid (average length of stay, 10.2 days), and morbidity was minimal despite the complex nature of these reconstructions. The perioperative mortality rate in elective operations was 1.2%. This approach facilitated proximal abdominal aortic exposure and anastomosis, especially in large, pararenal aneurysms or in situations unfavorable to a transabdominal approach. Whereas a left flank retroperitoneal approach can be used in most aortic reconstructions, it seems especially suited to those that pose significant technical challenges. 
A randomized study of chemotherapy with procarbazine, vincristine, and lomustine with and without radiation therapy for astrocytoma grades 3 and/or 4. The authors undertook a controlled, prospective, randomized study of 171 patients with supratentorial astrocytoma grades 3 and/or 4 (classified according to Kernohan). All patients were given chemotherapy consisting of procarbazine, vincristine, and lomustine (CCNU) (PVC). Half of the patients received whole-brain irradiation (RT) to a dose of 5800 cGy in the tumor-bearing hemisphere and 5000 cGy in the contralateral hemisphere. After diagnosis of progressive tumor growth, patients received individual treatment. The endpoint of the study was time to progression, but cases were followed until the patients died. Median time to progression (MTP) for the whole randomized population was 21 weeks. Median survival time (MST) was 53 weeks; 18% of patients survived for 2 years or longer. Survival analysis showed that patients less than 50 years of age treated with PVC plus RT had significantly longer MTP (81 weeks) and MST (124 weeks) than all other patients. For patients less than 50 years of age treated with PVC alone, MTP was 21 weeks and MST was 66 weeks. For patients more than 50 years of age treated with PVC plus RT, MTP was 23 weeks and MST was 51 weeks; in the PVC group, MTP was 17 weeks and MST was 39 weeks. Age, Karnofsky index, areas of Grade 2, and absence of extensive necrosis in the tumor were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analyses. Patients less than 50 years of age treated with PVC plus RT had significantly longer survival (P = 0.037) when correcting for these factors in a multi-variate analysis. 
Adverse effect of therapeutic vasoconstrictors in experimental acute pancreatitis. Alpha-adrenergic drugs commonly are used to treat hypotension resulting from severe acute pancreatitis. It was shown previously that although systemic arterial pressure is increased by phenylephrine, pancreatic microcirculatory perfusion is decreased. Because inadequate tissue perfusion may be critical in the progression of edematous pancreatitis to parenchymal necrosis, it was hypothesized that vasoconstrictors might be harmful in pancreatitis. Therefore the effect of phenylephrine on cerulein-induced mild pancreatitis were studied. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 54) were randomly allocated to 6 experimental groups and subjected to the following infusion regimens: (1) cerulein (cae) + phenylephrine (phe), (2) cae + saline (NS), (3) NS + phe, (4) cae + phenoxybenzamine (pbz) + phe, (5) NS + pbz + phe, and (6) NS. Initial and terminal hematocrit, serum amylase activity, and blood ionized calcium concentration were determined. The animals were killed 9 hours after starting the infusion. Macroscopic and histologic changes were scored by a 'blinded' pathologist. Phenylephrine increased the severity of cerulein-induced pancreatitis as manifested by statistically significant adverse changes in serum amylase, hematocrit, ionized calcium, peripancreatitic soap formation, and acinar cell vacuolization. These changes were antagonized by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded that phenylephrine is deleterious in acute experimental pancreatitis, the first demonstration of such an effect by a pharmacologic vasoconstrictor, and suggested that microcirculatory changes may be important in the transition of mild to severe pancreatitis. Caution in the use of vasoconstrictor drugs in patients with acute pancreatitis is recommended. 
Doppler echocardiographic transmitral peak early velocity does not directly reflect hemodynamic changes in humans: importance of normalization to mitral stroke volume Doppler echocardiographic transmitral peak early velocity normalized to the time-velocity integral during diastole is equivalent to volumetric peak filling rate normalized to stroke volume. To compare the pathophysiologic validity of normalized and nonnormalized peak early flow velocity, pulsed Doppler echocardiography with simultaneous high fidelity left ventricular pressure measurements was performed in 52 patients with coronary artery disease. Left ventricular loading conditions were changed by intravenous administration of norepinephrine in 15 patients and synthetic atrial natriuretic polypeptide in 15 others. Norepinephrine increased nonnormalized and normalized peak early flow velocities in association with significantly elevated end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve opening pressures and decelerated the time constant of left ventricular isovolumetric pressure decline. Atrial natriuretic polypeptide did not change either nonnormalized or normalized peak early flow velocity, despite significant reductions in end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve opening pressure and an accelerated time constant. Normalized peak early flow velocity showed the highest univariate correlation with long-term change in mitral valve opening pressure (n = 52, r = 0.67, p less than 0.0001). It provided a modest univariate correlation (n = 30, r = 0.74, p less than 0.0001) with immediate change in mitral valve opening pressure during norepinephrine infusion, whereas this correlation was lower (n = 30, r = 0.57, p less than 0.001) during polypeptide infusion. However, multivariate regression analysis relating normalized peak velocity with long- and short-term changes in end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve opening pressures, time constant and constant of left ventricular chamber stiffness improved the correlation coefficients (r = 0.80 to 0.85, all p less than 0.0001). In contrast, neither univariate nor multivariate correlations of nonnormalized velocity with long- and short-term changes in these hemodynamic variables were satisfactory. Thus, nonnormalized peak early flow velocity does not directly reflect underlying hemodynamic changes in humans. Normalization to mitral stroke volume clarifies the dependence of peak early flow velocity on the determinants of early diastolic filling. When left ventricular early diastolic filling is evaluated by Doppler echocardiography, normalized peak early flow velocity should be taken into consideration. 
Incidence of cerebral hemorrhage after treatment with tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase following embolic stroke in rabbits [corrected] [published erratum appears in Stroke 1991 Feb;22(2):285] We studied thrombolysis in an animal model of embolic stroke to determine the safety of tissue plasminogen activator and streptokinase. We occluded the middle cerebral arteries of 137 rabbits with radiolabeled blood clots and administered tissue plasminogen activator (n = 49), streptokinase (n = 40), or saline (n = 48) at various times after embolization. We assessed the rate of thrombolysis and cerebral hemorrhage 24 hours later. Both drugs were very effective in producing thrombolysis. Compared with saline, streptokinase caused a significant increase in the rate of cerebral hemorrhage (p less than 0.05), but tissue plasminogen activator did not. We conclude that thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke should be safer with tissue plasminogen activator than with streptokinase. 
Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study. Final results BACKGROUND. Atrial fibrillation in the absence of rheumatic valvular disease is associated with a fivefold to sevenfold increased risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS. The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study, a multicenter, randomized trial, compared 325 mg/day aspirin (double-blind) or warfarin with placebo for prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (primary events), and included 1,330 inpatients and outpatients with constant or intermittent atrial fibrillation. During a mean follow-up of 1.3 years, the rate of primary events in patients assigned to placebo was 6.3% per year and was reduced by 42% in those assigned to aspirin (3.6% per year; p = 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 9-63%). In the subgroup of warfarin-eligible patients (most less than 76 years old), warfarin dose-adjusted to prolong prothrombin time to 1.3-fold to 1.8-fold that of control reduced the risk of primary events by 67% (warfarin versus placebo, 2.3% versus 7.4% per year; p = 0.01; 95% confidence interval, 27-85%). Primary events or death were reduced 58% (p = 0.01) by warfarin and 32% (p = 0.02) by aspirin. The risk of significant bleeding was 1.5%, 1.4%, and 1.6% per year in patients assigned to warfarin, aspirin, and placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Aspirin and warfarin are both effective in reducing ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Because warfarin-eligible patients composed a subset of all aspirin-eligible patients, the magnitude of reduction in events by warfarin versus aspirin cannot be compared. Too few events occurred in warfarin-eligible patients to directly assess the relative benefit of aspirin compared with warfarin, and the trial is continuing to address this issue. Patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation who can safely take either aspirin or warfarin should receive prophylactic antithrombotic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke. 
Comparison of disease severity scoring systems in septic shock. OBJECTIVE: To compare six disease severity scoring systems as predictors of mortality in septic shock when used in the first 24 hrs of diagnosis. The six scoring systems tested were: Multiorgan Failure; the Acute Organ System Failure; the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II); the Multisystem Organ Failure scoring system; the Mortality Prediction Model; and the grading of sepsis. DESIGN: Retrospective, case series, consecutive sample. SETTING: Adult ICUs of three teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Seventy-one patients from 12 to 84 yrs, fulfilling specific criteria for the diagnosis of septic shock, who were admitted to the ICU during 15 consecutive months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Multiorgan Failure scoring system, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II), and Acute Organ System Failure scoring system were found, with our modifications, to be statistically significant predictors of mortality. Predictive data for these three scoring systems were as follows: Multiorgan Failure scoring system p = .008, mean number of points of survivors 5.2 +/- 1.5 (SD), mean number of points of nonsurvivors 6.3 +/- 1.5; APACHE II p = .013, mean number of points of survivors 21.1 +/- 5.9, mean number of points of nonsurvivors 24.6 +/- 6.0; and Acute Organ System Failure scoring system p = .011. None of the other three scoring systems showed significant predictive ability: Multisystem Organ Failure scoring system p = .072, Mortality Prediction Model p = 0.091, and the grading of sepsis p = .27. There was a significant (p = .004) difference in the survival rate of the three hospitals. CONCLUSION: The Multiorgan Failure scoring system, APACHE II, and the Acute Organ System Failure scoring system, with minor modifications, were found to be useful prognostic tools for patients with septic shock and allowed us to compare the performance and treatment programs of different ICUs. 
Trebling of the incidence of testicular cancer in victoria, Australia (1950-1985). Changes in the incidence of testicular cancer in Victoria, Australia were studied from 1950 to 1985. Cases from the period 1950 to 1978 were derived from many sources (1116 cases). Emphasis was placed on diagnostic reliability; 97% of cases were confirmed histologically, and of these, 86% were reviewed at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute. For the years 1982 to 1985, Victorian Cancer Registry data were used. The incidence rose by a factor of 2.9 from 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.73) per 100,000 in 1950 to 1954 to 4.16 (95% CI, 3.73 to 4.59) per 100,000 in 1982 to 1985. Between 1950 to 1954 and 1965 to 1969, there was a sharp rise, followed by a plateau or dip, then a further rise. Among seminomas, the rates rose in most adult age groups, whereas among nonseminomas, the rise was concentrated in younger age groups. There was a significant trend to earlier age of occurrence among nonseminomas (P = 0.0004) but not among seminomas (P = 0.89). Cohort analysis revealed a trend toward increasing rates for both seminomas and nonseminomas, and confirmed the trend toward earlier age of onset for nonseminomas. Disproportionate increases were observed for the 1915 to 1924 cohort of seminomas and the 1930 to 1939 cohort of nonseminomas. Analysis of available data from other Australian states indicated comparable rising incidence in New South Wales, Tasmania, and Western Australia. 
Valvular heart disease. A correctable cause of congestive heart failure. Surgical repair of mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves and balloon valvuloplasty for mitral stenosis are being done more and more often. These complex procedures require accurate and high-quality imaging techniques to guide the physician in decision making before surgery and in assessment of success during surgery. Dr Currie describes the use of echocardiography in diagnosis and management of patients with various forms of valvular heart disease. 
Thyroid diseases after treatment of Hodgkin's disease. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Thyroid disease, especially hypothyroidism, is common in patients with Hodgkin's disease who have been treated with irradiation. We reviewed the records of 1787 patients (740 women and 1047 men) with Hodgkin's disease who were treated with radiation therapy alone (810 patients), radiation and chemotherapy (920 patients), or chemotherapy alone (57 patients) at Stanford University between 1961 and 1989. Among these patients, 1533 were alive at the last follow-up, and 254 had died of causes other than Hodgkin's disease. (Four other patients were excluded from the analysis because they had undergone thyroidectomy before treatment for Hodgkin's disease. The thyroid was irradiated in 1677 patients. Follow-up averaged 9.9 years. RESULTS. A total of 573 patients had clinical or biochemical evidence of thyroid disease. Among the 1677 patients whose thyroid was irradiated, the actuarial risk of thyroid disease 20 years after treatment was 52 percent, and it was 67 percent at 26 years. Hypothyroidism was found in 513 patients. A total of 486 patients received thyroxine therapy for elevated serum thyrotropin concentrations and either low free thyroxine (208 patients) or normal free thyroxine values (278 patients); 27 had transient elevations of the serum thyrotropin level that were not treated. Graves' hyperthyroidism developed in 30 patients (2 of whom had not undergone thyroid irradiation), and ophthalmopathy developed in 17 of these patients. Ophthalmopathy developed in four other patients with Graves' disease during a period of hypothyroidism (n = 3) or euthyroidism (n = 1). The risk of Graves' disease was 7.2 to 20.4 times that for normal subjects. Silent thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis developed in six patients. Forty-four patients were found to have single or multiple thyroid nodules, 26 of whom underwent thyroidectomy. Six of the 44 had papillary or follicular cancers. Among the patients who did not undergo operation, 12 had small functioning nodules, 4 had cysts, and 2 had multinodular goiters. The actuarial risk of thyroid cancer was 1.7 percent. The risk of thyroid cancer was 15.6 times the expected risk. CONCLUSIONS. High risks of thyroid disease persist more than 25 years after patients have received radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease, reinforcing the need for continued clinical and biochemical evaluation. Prolonged follow-up confirms an elevated risk of thyroid cancer and Graves' disease as well as hypothyroidism in these patients. 
Detection and characterization of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) associated T-cell neoplasms in an HTLV-I nonendemic region by polymerase chain reaction. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) occurs endemically in southwestern Japan, the Caribbean, and West Africa, but occurs sporadically in most of the rest of the world. However, because ATLL and non-HTLV-I associated T-cell neoplasms share overlapping clinicopathologic features, the prevalence of ATLL in nonendemic regions is unknown. In this study, 75 T-cell neoplasms randomly procured from the metropolitan New York City area were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of integrated HTLV-I proviral sequences. HTLV-I genomic sequences were detected by PCR in 6 of the 75 cases (8%); this result was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. The clinicopathologic features of the HTLV-I positive and HTLV-I negative T-cell neoplasms were then compared. Although the clinicopathologic features of patients from these two groups overlapped, some findings were more commonly associated with HTLV-I positive neoplasms. Five of the six patients with HTLV-I positive neoplasms were from HTLV-I endemic areas, five were black, five were women, and five were less than 45 years of age, while the majority of the patients with HTLV-I negative T-cell malignancies were elderly white men. The incidence of hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions was significantly more common among patients with HTLV-I positive T-cell neoplasms (P less than .001 and P = .004, respectively). The immunophenotypes of the HTLV-I positive and negative tumors were similar; however, all HTLV-I positive neoplasms were CD7 negative (P less than .001). In summary, our findings: (1) demonstrate the special clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features of HTLV-I positive T-cell neoplasms, (2) suggest that most of the rare cases of HTLV-I-associated T-cell neoplasms occurring in HTLV-I nonendemic areas are actually endemic cases; and (3) that PCR is a sensitive, clinically useful technique for identifying HTLV-I associated T-cell neoplasms. 
Progress of fibrinolysis during tumor necrosis factor infusions in humans. Concomitant increase in tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1, and fibrin(ogen) degradation products. Several investigators have reported that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can alter the production of plasminogen activator type-1 (PAI-1) and plasminogen activators (PAs) by endothelial cells in vitro. We have examined the in vivo effects of recombinant human TNF administration on fibrinolysis as assessed by parameters in plasma during a 24-hour period of continuous TNF infusion to 17 cancer patients with active disease. The plasma levels of PAI activity increased sevenfold after 3 and 24 hours of TNF infusion. This was the result of an increase of PAI-1 antigen; PAI-2 antigen was not detectable. Plasma concentrations of tissue-type PA (t-PA) antigen increased twofold to fivefold after 3 and 24 hours of TNF infusion, whereas urokinase-type PA antigen levels in plasma remained unaltered. After 3 hours of TNF infusion the plasma levels of alpha 2-antiplasmin were slightly decreased, 5% on average, suggesting that fibrinolysis continued. After 24 hours of TNF infusion a highly significant increase in fibrin- plus fibrinogen-degradation products, and separately of fibrin degradation products and fibrinogen degradation products, was found. This indicates that fibrinolysis persisted, at least partly, in the presence of high levels of PAI activity. Whereas PAI-1 production increased, t-PA production by human endothelial cells in vitro remains unaltered or even decreases on TNF addition. It has been shown previously that TNF infusion in our patients results in thrombin and fibrin generation. Therefore, it is possible that thrombin, not TNF, is the actual stimulus for t-PA production in our patients. We speculate that fibrin is formed during TNF infusions and that plasmin is generated by t-PA action immediately on the initial formation of (soluble) fibrin molecules. Such a process may explain the generation of degradation products of both fibrin and fibrinogen during infusion of TNF in patients. 
Gastric emptying in human disease states. The application of new radioisotope methods in external in vivo scanning has increased our knowledge of how disease and treatment can effect gastric emptying (GE). Solids leave the stomach more slowly than liquids, and conditions causing gastroparesis affect solids before liquids. Gastric mucosal abnormalities and their treatment can affect GE. Diseases of the gastric musculature, including the inflammatory and endocrine myopathies, muscular dystrophies, and infiltrative disorders, can result in significant gastroparesis. Acute and chronic neuropathy may both affect gastric emptying. The latter neuropathies are now the subject of intense investigation with new prokinetic drugs. Finally, abnormal GE may be a major clinical feature of certain severe psychiatric disorders. 
Adrenal atrophy at autopsy in two asthmatic children. In two children dying in status asthmaticus, adrenocortical atrophy was demonstrable at autopsy. Both children had been treated since infancy with pulsed steroidal inhalers, short courses of oral or parenteral steroids, and steroidal skin preparations (for associated eczema). Adrenocortical atrophy has not been described previously in this clinical context. The increasing administration of steroids to asthmatic children may lead to the production of overt--or more frequently, subclinical--atrophy of the adrenal cortices with important consequences to mortality and morbidity. 
Recurrent spontaneous intrahepatic hemorrhage from peliosis hepatis. Peliosis hepatis is a rare and highly lethal liver lesion in which numerous blood-filled cavities or cystic spaces are dispersed throughout the hepatic parenchyma. The cause is unknown, although the condition is associated with several disease states and medications. Patients may present with hemorrhage, liver failure, the hepatorenal syndrome, cholestasis, or portal hypertension. We treated a patient who survived two separate hemorrhages from peliosis hepatis. The surgical intervention used, hepatic dearterialization, has allowed this patient to remain asymptomatic for 5 years. 
Severe late postsplenectomy infection. In all, 1490 patients underwent splenectomy in Western Australia between 1971 and 1983, giving 7825 person years exposure. Thirty-three patients developed severe late postsplenectomy infection (septicaemia, meningitis or pneumococcal pneumonia requiring hospitalization) and three developed overwhelming postsplenectomy infection. The incidence and mortality rates of severe late postsplenectomy infection were 0.42 and 0.08 per 100 person years exposure respectively and for overwhelming postsplenectomy infection the incidence and mortality rates were 0.04 per 100 person years exposure. There were 628 splenectomies after trauma, giving 3922 person years exposure. Eight patients developed severe late postsplenectomy infection of whom one had overwhelming postsplenectomy infection. Following trauma, the incidence of severe late postsplenectomy infection was 0.21 per 100 person years exposure, with the incidence and mortality rates of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection being 0.03 per 100 person years exposure. Patients undergoing splenectomy have a 12.6-fold increased risk of developing late septicaemia compared with the general population. Splenectomy following trauma gives an 8.6-fold increased risk of late septicaemia. The majority of severe late postsplenectomy infections did not occur within the first 2 years and 42 per cent of severe late postsplenectomy infections occurred greater than 5 years after splenectomy. The low incidence of severe late postsplenectomy infection and overwhelming postsplenectomy infection makes statistical evaluation of the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics, vaccination and splenic repair most difficult. 
Cystic adrenal masses in the neonate associated with hemihypertrophy and the relation to the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. We report 2 cases of unilateral, multilocular, cystic adrenal masses in neonates. Both patients demonstrated somatic hemihypertrophy, which is considered to have the same implications as the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome in terms of tumor risk. Pathological examination showed multiple, adrenal cysts without evidence of tumor or routine adrenal hemorrhage. This finding appears to represent a previously unreported association between the spectrum of hemihypertrophy/Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and benign cystic adrenal disease. 
FK 506 reverses acute graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in rats. Severe graft-versus-host disease was induced by transplantation of ACI rat bone marrow and spleen cells into irradiated Lewis rat recipients. Treatment with FK 506 or cyclosporine A (CsA) was started after clinical and histologic evidence of acute GVHD was present. A 14-day course of FK 506 at 1.0 mg/kg/day could rescue 100% of the animals suffering from GVHD. In contrast only one half of the animals treated with CsA at a high dose of 25 mg/kg/day recovered. After cessation of immunosuppressive therapy, FK 506-treated animals displayed a marked prolonged disease-free interval as compared to CsA-treated bone marrow recipients. Recurrence of the disease in these animals could be prevented when FK 506 treatment was continued after the induction period with a low maintenance dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day every other day. 
Local failure after definitive radiation or surgical therapy for carcinoma of the prostate and options for prevention and therapy. The incidence of local failure and its relation to distant failure following definitive therapy of carcinoma of the prostate is discussed. Local failure may arise from incomplete resection, tumor spillage, clones of radioresistant cells, development of new tumors in an organ left in situ, or inadequate treatment portals. The authors review the various measures used as prophylaxis or treatment of local failure in relation to clinical and pathologic stage. 
Oral soft tissues in hereditary epidermolysis bullosa. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is associated with diverse oral manifestations, which can potentially involve both hard and soft tissues, depending on the specific EB subtype. This study determined the frequency and extent of oral soft tissue involvement in the inherited forms of EB. Examination of 216 affected persons revealed significant differences in the oral soft tissue involvement among the various types of EB. The frequency of oral involvement was greater in the dominant dystrophic (81.1%) and simplex (generalized, 58.6%; localized, 34.7%) types than previously reported. The marked frequency of oral blistering was similar in both major subtypes of junctional (Herlitz, 83.3%; non-Herlitz, 91.6%) and recessive dystrophic EB (generalized, 100%; localized, 92.3%). Obliteration of the oral vestibule, ankyloglossia, and microstomia were consistent findings in generalized recessive dystrophic EB. Oral milia were present in all major EB categories, most prevalently in the dystrophic forms, but were not seen in all the distinct EB subtypes. These findings indicate that although there are no pathognomonic intraoral soft tissue manifestations in the various forms of inherited EB, there are predictable patterns of involvement associated with specific subtypes of this disease. Understanding the oral involvement associated with EB may aid clinicians in the development of more advanced therapeutic approaches that are compatible with and directed at the unique characteristics of each EB subtype. 
Chronic cluster headache associated with a vertebral artery aneurysm. This is a report of a patient with chronic cluster headache-like pain of 12 years duration. Investigation revealed an aneurysm at the junction of the vertebral and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries and after removal the patient experienced resolution of his cluster headache. The headache and aneurysm were both right sided suggesting a possible relationship. 
Fatal rupture of the intracranial carotid artery during transluminal angioplasty for vasospasm induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage. Case report. The authors report the clinical course, radiographic findings, and gross and microscopic pathology of a patient with fatal rupture of the supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery during transluminal angioplasty for subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced vasospasm. The rupture most likely resulted from a small portion of aneurysm neck which remained unclipped, thereby leaving an area of structural weakness in the arterial wall at the site of clipping. The area of structural weakness predisposed the artery to rupture upon the addition of transmural pressure induced by balloon inflation during transluminal angioplasty. Caution is advised when performing transluminal angioplasty in the region of aneurysm clipping since the vessel lumen "recreated" during the clipping procedure may contain some residual and structurally incomplete aneurysm neck in the vessel wall. 
Postresection autopsy findings in patients with cancer of the main hepatic duct junction. Extensive resection of the bile ducts combined with hepatic resection is the procedure of choice for carcinoma of the main hepatic duct junction. Currently this procedure is done without great risk, and increasing long-term survival is now the issue. For this purpose, it is necessary to elucidate the biologic properties of the cancer to take reasonable measures. Autopsy findings of patients who died of recurrence may offer a reliable guide. Autopsy findings were studied in 14 patients: eight who had undergone curative resection and six who had received noncurative resection. Cancer recurred at the liver hilum with invasion into adjacent organs. Peritoneal dissemination and lymph node metastases were infrequent. These were common findings in both curative and noncurative resection groups. Cancer cells in the connective tissue of the hepatoduodenal ligament may play a major role in recurrence. 
Infectious crystalline keratopathy occurring in an eye subsequent to glaucoma filtering surgery with postoperative subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil. We present a case of infectious crystalline keratopathy occurring after 5-fluorouracil filtering surgery. The patient had discrete, branching, white crystalline lesions in the anterior corneal stroma. Cultures grew Streptococcus viridans, and gram-positive cocci were demonstrated in corneal tissue biopsy specimens. Toxic and immunosuppressive properties of 5-fluorouracil may have participated in the pathogenesis of the infectious crystalline keratitis. 
Noncardiac chest pain in patients with heart disease. This is a retrospective study of cardiac patients with noncardiac chest pain referred for evaluation of esophageal motility. Sixty-eight patients with heart disease were compared with 210 patients without heart disease according to findings from symptom questionnaires and a psychologic test (Brief Symptom Inventory). More than 70% of each group qualified for an anxiety or depressive diagnosis on the symptom questionnaire. These diagnoses were supported by significant elevations of scores on the anxiety and depression scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Male gender and a diagnosis of panic disorder occurred significantly more often in the patients with heart disease. "Stress" was cited as the cause of illness in about half the sample, but this led to less than satisfactory rates of psychiatric evaluation or pharmacotherapy. This is of particular concern for the cardiac patients because of the known adverse effect of anxiety and depression in those with heart disease. 
t(11;14) (q13;q32) in B-cell lymphomas (intermediately differentiated lymphocytic and follicular). A report of four cases. The association of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities with certain types of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) provides important clues to their classification and pathogenesis. The t(11;14), an uncommon abnormality, has been reported in a variety of B-cell lymphomas, including the intermediately differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (IDLL). The authors report here the histologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic findings in four additional patients with such translocation. They represent 8% of 51 patients with NHL studied by cytogenetics in a provincial hospital of Western mainland Japan. Three of the patients had IDLL and one a follicular lymphoma of large cell type. These findings strengthen the association between t(11;14) and IDLL. Furthermore, the occurrence of t(11;14) in a follicular lymphoma, as the sole abnormality, along with histogenetic considerations, suggests the possible existence of a rarer subset of follicular lymphoma, not associated with the t(14;18) and histogenetically related to IDLL. 
Bone scan as a stratification variable in advanced prostate cancer. The serial technetium 99 (99Tc) bone scans of 76 patients with Stage D-2 prostate cancers were reviewed. Sites of metastases in skeletal areas in decreasing order were vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, long bones, and skull. Patients with one or two involved skeletal areas had a significantly longer progression-free interval and survival time than patients with three or more bony areas of uptake. Bone scans might be used as a stratification variable in future prospective clinical trials of Stage D-2 prostate cancer. 
Radionuclide angiography in the management of asymptomatic aortic regurgitation. Left ventricular systolic function is an important determinant of long-term prognosis in patients with chronic aortic regurgitation. In patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, those with preoperative left ventricular dysfunction have a greater risk of postoperative congestive heart failure and death than do those in whom preoperative left ventricular systolic function is normal. However, patients with preoperative left ventricular dysfunction are not a homogeneous group but may be further stratified according to risk on the basis of the severity of symptoms, exercise intolerance, and temporal duration of left ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, asymptomatic patients with reproducible and definite evidence of impaired left ventricular function should undergo operation without waiting for the development of symptoms or more severe left ventricular dysfunction. In addition, among asymptomatic patients with normal systolic function, indexes of left ventricular function are also helpful, especially when measured serially, in predicting the development of symptoms and the need for valve replacement surgery over the course of the next 5 to 10 years. Noninvasive imaging techniques should play a major role in this evaluation, and radionuclide angiography is ideally suited for the quantitative evaluation of systolic function in the volume-overloaded left ventricle. Although the prognostic value of left ventricular ejection fraction at rest is well established, ejection fraction during exercise has little value once age and left ventricular function at rest are accounted for and is of minor importance in formulating patient management decisions. 
HBV-DNA-related hepatocellular carcinoma occurring in childhood. Report of three cases. In a series of 325 HBV chronically infected children observed over an 18-year period, three developed HCC. These three children were born in southern Italy, a region characterized by a high endemic HBV infection rate; each had been infected perinatally, developed an acute hepatitis, and became a chronic carrier. Two of the three with cirrhosis were HBsAg positive at the time their HCC was detected. The remaining case had seroconverted to HBsAb but HBV-DNA integration could be demonstrated in the absence of cirrhosis; moreover HBV antigens were not expressed in the tissue of this case. The interval between HBV infection and HCC appearance in these three cases ranged from six to 11 years. A similarity between these three Italian cases and the majority of HCC arising in chronically infected children in the Far East is noted. 
Mucinous pancreatic tumors: ERCP findings Mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas are rare and difficult to diagnose neoplasms. To further characterize the nature of these lesions, four such cases are described here in which the diagnosis was suspected at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography by the presence of ampullary or intraductal mucus. In one patient, pancreatoscopy directly visualized the tumor. Ultrasound and computed tomography failed to suggest the presence of a neoplasm in the majority of these cases, but endoscopic ultrasound was performed in one and correctly identified the multi-cystic tumor. A high incidence of acute pancreatitis was seen in these cases and was felt to be secondary to intermittent ductal obstruction by mucus. The characteristic appearance of intra-ductal mucus provides an important clue to the presence of this type of pancreatic neoplasia. 
Appendicitis: prospective evaluation with high-resolution CT. Computed tomography (CT) was used to prospectively evaluate 100 patients with clinical indications for acute appendicitis. Examinations were performed with the terminal ileum and cecum filled with contrast material. Acute appendicitis was diagnosed when an abnormal appendix or inflammatory changes plus an appendicolith were detected. Failure to visualize an abnormal appendix or appendicolith in the presence of pericecal inflammatory changes was considered suspicious but nonspecific. CT results were correlated with surgical and pathologic results (74 patients) and other radiologic and clinical findings (26 patients). CT helped to diagnose appendicitis (64 patients) and nonspecific right lower quadrant inflammation (five patients) and to rule out appendicitis (31 patients). CT had a 98% sensitivity, an 83% specificity, and a 93% accuracy. In 17 of 31 patients without CT evidence of appendicitis, other conditions explaining their symptoms were detected. When the clinical diagnosis is in doubt, CT can be used successfully to evaluate patients with acute appendicitis. 
Combined portal vein and liver resection for carcinoma of the biliary tract. Twenty-nine patients with advanced carcinoma of the bile duct or gallbladder underwent combined portal vein and liver resection. Segmental excision of the portal vein was performed in 16 cases and wedge resection of the vessel wall in 13. The operative mortality rate was 17 per cent. The median survival for the 24 patients who left hospital was 19.8 months. Actuarial survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years for all 29 patients were 48 per cent, 29 per cent, and 6 per cent respectively, whereas the median survival for 46 patients with unresectable carcinoma was 3 months and the 1 and 3-year actuarial survival rates were 13 per cent and zero respectively. This difference in survival times between patients undergoing hepatectomy with portal vein resection and those with unresectable carcinoma were statistically significant (P less than 0.01). Combined portal vein and liver resection is recommended as a reasonable surgical approach in selected patients with advanced carcinoma of the biliary tract. 
The effect of nociceptive stimulation on the changes in hemodynamics and oxygen transport induced by hemorrhage in anesthetized pigs. The effects of somatic nociceptive afferent stimulation on aspects of cardiac function and oxygen transport were examined in a model of hemorrhage in anesthetized pigs. The brachial nerves were stimulated (BNS) alternately to obtain a rise in heart rate of 18% and in mean arterial pressure of 17%. This stimulation was started 75 minutes before the start of hemorrhage and maintained throughout and after the withdrawal of blood. The animals were bled at a rate of 0.75 ml/min.kg until a total of 30 ml/kg had been removed. At the end of hemorrhage the reductions in cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), and left ventricular stroke work (LVSW) were greater in the BNS group compared with controls. The nociceptive stimulation also elicited greater reductions in oxygen delivery (DO2I) and oxygen consumption (VO2) and a greater rise in the arterial plasma lactate concentration. Thus it seems that nociceptive stimulation exacerbates the changes in systemic oxygen transport and cardiac function induced by hemorrhage. 
Collagen stability and collagenolytic activity in the normal and aneurysmal human abdominal aorta. Two issues were addressed in this study. The first was whether a bona fide collagenase exists within the wall of the aorta. The second was whether the activity of this putative collagenase is greater in aneurysmal tissue. No collagenase could be extracted from the wall of the aorta under nondenaturing conditions. However, hydroxyproline was liberated from tissue samples allowed to autolyze at neutral pH under reaction conditions favoring the activity of collagenase. Such an activity was probably enzymic as it occurred in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion and was suppressed by chelators. In normal and stenotic tissue, activity was increased by adding aminophenylmercuric acetate, an activator of latent collagenase. Examination of the blanks revealed that the collagen of aneurysmal aorta was more soluble than normal. Furthermore, its digestion kinetics differed in a way that suggested that aneurysmal aorta possessed a labile component that was absent from normal tissue. Although the activity of the putative aortic collagenase was higher than normal in the aneurysmal tissue, our assays do not distinguish between changes in the amount or activity of the enzyme and alterations in the collagen. 
Successful use of topical vitamin E solution in the treatment of nail changes in yellow nail syndrome. A double-blind controlled study was performed on a patient with long-standing yellow nail syndrome to investigate the potential beneficial role of topical vitamin E solution for the nail changes seen in this disorder. Three nails received active solution containing DL-alpha-tocopherol in dimethyl sulfoxide; three nails received dimethyl sulfoxide only; and the remainder were untreated. After 6 months of therapy, the three nails treated with active solution showed marked clinical improvement and a corresponding increase in nail growth rates. Dimethyl sulfoxide alone produced a small increase in nail growth rate and slight clinical improvement. Active solution was then applied to all of the nails for a further 6 months, resulting in clinical improvement and increased nail growth rates in the remaining nails. These beneficial effects require further study. 
CD4+ lymphocyte subsets in the cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis and non-inflammatory neurological diseases. We studied paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from 18 inactive multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 10 with non-inflammatory neurological diseases. By means of a dual-colour cytofluorimetric micromethod we were able to count 1500 cells on average in each CSF sample. We found a significant reduction of CD45RA+ and CD4+CD45RA+ cells in the CSF of MS patients. Similarly, CD45RA+ and CD4+CD45RA+ CSF/PB ratios were lower compared with controls. The reduction of suppressor-inducer T-cells did not correlate with CD8+ cell levels in the CSF. The CD4+ subset ratio (CD4+CD45RA-/CD4+CD45RA+) was significantly increased in the CSF of MS patients. Our data suggest that the reduction of CD4+CD45RA+ cells in the PB is not due to a segregation of such cells in the CSF. Conversely, CSF changes reflect changes in the PB similar to these found for other T-cell subsets. 
A primate model of macular cyst. Perfluoropropane (C3F8) was injected into nine eyes of six cynomolgus monkeys. In all nine eyes, macular changes consistent with the development of a macular cyst were noted within 3 months after injection. On fluorescein angiography, there was no evidence of retinal vascular leakage associated with the macular cysts. Histopathologic evaluation of six eyes demonstrated microcystic changes throughout the perifoveal inner nuclear layer. These coalesced into larger cystic spaces in the outer plexiform layer of the central macula. These macular changes are previously unreported in patients or monkeys undergoing intravitreal injection of expansile gases. This model for macular cysts may be helpful in evaluating the pathogenesis and role of interventional strategies in patients with cystoid macular edema. 
Update: Salmonella enteritidis infections and shell eggs--United States, 1990. From January through October 1990, state health departments reported 49 outbreaks of Salmonella enteritidis (SE) in the United States to CDC. This report summarizes three SE outbreaks in 1990 that were associated with shell eggs. 
Symptomatic xanthogranuloma of choroid plexus with unilateral hydrocephalus. Case report. Xanthogranulomas involving the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles are generally asymptomatic lesions. The case is reported of a 50-year-old man in whom a xanthogranuloma of the choroid plexus had occluded the left trigone, causing unilateral hydrocephalus of the left temporal horn and neurological symptoms. A review of the literature shows that xanthogranulomas of the glomus of the lateral ventricles differ from the xanthomatous cystic lesions of the third ventricle, which are probably akin to colloid cysts. 
Orthotopic liver transplantation for incurable alveolar echinococcosis of the liver: report of 17 cases. Between 1986 and 1989, orthotopic liver transplantations were performed in our unit for 17 patients with incurable alveolar echinococcosis. Ten patients had hilar involvement (group I), and seven patients had posterior localization (five of them had chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome) (group II). The delay between diagnosis and the orthotopic liver transplantation was more than 48 mo in group Ia (six patients), less than 24 mo in group Ib (four patients) and less than 48 mo in group II. Previous operations were more common in group Ia than in group Ib and II. Five patients have died-four in group I and one in group II. The actuarial survival rate at 15 mo was 75%. Early reoperations were frequent (69%), mainly caused by rebleeding. Bacterial and fungal infections occurred only in group Ia (four cases) and group II (three cases). In eight patients (palliative group), residual foci of infected nonhepatic tissue occurred after surgery. The titer of specific antibodies decreased during the first 3 mo in all the patients but one. In patients with radical liver transplantation, the complete disappearance of specific antibodies occurred within 2 yr in four cases. In the remaining five patients, specific antibodies remained detectable, but no evidence of recurrence has been obtained up to now. In the palliative group, a peak of specific IgM occurred at 3 mo; an increase of specific IgG was observed later. The growth of residual parasitic foci was relatively slow, and all these patients remained asymptomatic with a mean follow-up of 19 mo. We conclude that orthotopic liver transplantation is feasible in incurable alveolar echinococcosis and could be proposed without delay to patients with parasitic Budd-Chiari syndrome or complicated secondary biliary cirrhosis. In the other cases, the best time to perform an orthotopic liver transplantation is more difficult to determine. Nevertheless, in the perspective of an orthotopic liver transplantation, the management of these patients has to change, and repetitive laparotomies for palliative surgical procedures have to be replaced by interventional radiology. 
Cavitary lesions close to heart valve rings. A necropsy study of 13 cases. Necropsy reports of 13 patients with 15 cavitary lesions situated close aortic or mitral valve rings were studied in patients who ranged in age from 1 month to 57 (mean 24.9) years; 10 patients were male. Infective endocarditis occurred in 7 patients, rheumatic heart disease in 4, congenital heart diseases in 4, previous valve replacement in 4, and syphilis in 1 patient. Diameters of the cavitary lesions ranged between 1.2 and 10.5 cm; the aortic valve ring was involved in 11 patients; cavitary thrombosis occurred in 2 cases; the orifice communicating the cardiac chamber with the cavitary lesions was situated above the aortic leaflet in 5 lesions, below the aortic leaflet in 4 lesions, and above and below the aortic leaflets in 3 lesions. The mitral valve ring was involved in 3 lesions. Thus, different etiologies may be involved in the pathogenesis of these lesions; positions of the lesion may vary in relation to the valve ring, and the lesions may be a morphological expression of the fragility of the fibrous skeleton of the heart. 
Foscarnet in the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection of the esophagus and colon in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Foscarnet, administered via a central line, was used for the treatment of 18 episodes of cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophageal ulceration in 15 patients, and in the treatment of 27 episodes of CMV colitis in 22 patients. In 15 of the 18 episodes of the esophageal disease, there was complete loss of symptoms within 2 wk. Only three of the 15 patients responding to foscarnet therapy had a relapse of their esophageal disease. Two of these patients were successfully retreated with foscarnet. Of the 22 patients receiving foscarnet for CMV colitis, four died during foscarnet therapy. Of the 18 patients completing the course of treatment with foscarnet for first-episode CMV colitis, 11 remitted completely and six had a partial remission. All patients with partial remission had a second pathogen responsible for the continuation of their diarrhea. Only one patient completing a course of foscarnet failed to respond microscopically to treatment. Three patients experienced relapse of their CMV colitis, two of whom responded to further courses of foscarnet. Foscarnet is an effective therapy for CMV disease of the gastrointestinal tract, with rapid resolution of clinical symptoms, long-term remission of esophageal disease, and shorter disease-free periods for CMV colitis. 
Histologic characteristics of carotid artery plaque. Carotid plaque characteristics associated with the production of symptoms were identified with quantification of carotid plaque constituents in high-grade stenotic asymptomatic (n = 8) and symptomatic (n = 44) plaques. Asymptomatic plaques contained significantly more fibrous/collagen material (88%) than symptomatic plaques (66%) (p less than 0.05). Hemorrhage constituted 2% and 1% of asymptomatic and symptomatic plaques, respectively. The predominant nonfibrous material was a pink amorphous material mixed with cholesterol, which composed 7% of asymptomatic and 27% of symptomatic plaques (p less than 0.05). No relationship was found between plaque composition and the number of ipsilateral ischemic neurologic events, nor was there evidence of a healing process. B-mode ultrasound scanning had a sensitivity of 94% in identifying plaque with greater than 80% fibrous content. We believe that plaque composition may be a useful discriminating factor in selecting asymptomatic patients for carotid endarterectomy. 
Resolution of Cryptosporidium infection in an AIDS patient after improvement of nutritional and immune status with octreotide. An AIDS patient with severe large volume diarrhea and malnutrition due to cryptosporidial infection is presented. The patient, who was not receiving zidovudine, was treated with octreotide with resolution of diarrhea leading to improvement in nutritional status, immune functions, and subsequently, resolution of the Cryptosporidium infection. This case points out the need for adequate nutrition in AIDS patients and highlights the relationship of nutrition and the immune system. 
The value of plain radiography in establishing the diagnosis of gastric lesions. Appreciation for the diagnostic value of plain (noncontrast) radiography of the gastrointestinal tract appears to have diminished with the advent of more sophisticated imaging techniques. A case in which scrutiny of the gastric air pattern on plain abdominal films suggested the underlying presence of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome emphasizes the potential diagnostic value of plain radiography of the abdomen for gastric disorders. 
In vitro radiation resistance among cell lines established from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Twenty-five squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines from 20 patients with head and neck cancer were assessed for radiosensitivity in vitro using a 96-well plate assay. Four non-SCC lines were also tested. Radiation sensitivity of individual cell lines was compared using the area under the survival curve (AUC) as a measure of the mean inactivation dose. Tumor lines were tested with either a cobalt-60 (60Co) gamma-irradiator having a dose rate of 100 cGy/minute or with a 4-meV photon beam having a dose rate of 200 cGy/minute. The mean AUC of the 25 SCC cell lines was 188 +/- 7 (SEM) cGy (range, 100 to 250 cGy) whereas the four non-SCC lines had a mean AUC of 225 +/- 9 cGy. The SCC cell lines with mean inactivation dose values greater than 188 cGy were classified as relatively radioresistant whereas those with values less than 188 cGy were considered relatively radiosensitive. In seven cases SCC cell lines were derived from patients who had already received radiation therapy. In four of these cases the tumor cell lines were radioresistant (AUC, 210 to 250) but in the other three cases the tumor lines were radiosensitive (AUC, 160 to 180). Thus, failure of a tumor to respond to radiation did not always select for radioresistant cells. The mean of the AUC for cell lines from previously irradiated patients (197 +/- 11 cGy) did not differ significantly from that of the cell lines from patients who received no prior radiation therapy (182 +/- 9 cGy). However, among radiation-resistant lines those from the four previously irradiated patients were significantly more resistant (mean AUC = 235 +/- 9) than seven other radioresistant lines from nonirradiated patients (mean AUC, 208 +/- 4) (P = 0.0194). In four cases more than one cell line was derived from different tumor specimens in the same patient. In each of these cases the lines from the same patients were similar to one another in their degree of radioresistance. Based on these observations the authors conclude that the degree of in vitro radiation resistance is an inherent property of some squamous cell tumors. 
Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced rapid acquisition spin-echo MR imaging of the liver. Rapid acquisition spin-echo (RASE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allows for coverage of the entire liver with highly T1-weighted SE images during a single 23-second breath-holding period. The RASE sequence was implemented in conjunction with rapid intravenous injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine to enable performance of dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging of the liver. Prospective evaluation of 24 patients with 62 liver lesions 1 cm or greater in diameter was performed. Images obtained with RASE were devoid of respiratory-related ghost artifacts or edge blurring. The dynamic contrast-enhanced RASE technique resulted in contrast-to-noise and contrast-to-artifact values and time efficiency measures significantly greater (P less than .05) than those obtained with use of conventional T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences, indicating a higher likelihood for lesion detectability. Lesion conspicuity was maximal during or immediately following bolus administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, with lesions often becoming obscured at delayed postcontrast imaging. 
Endothelin binding in brain of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The endothelins (ETs) are a recently discovered family of peptides which appear to be involved in hemodynamic regulation; they have potent vasoconstrictor properties and dose-related effects on blood pressure when administered peripherally. Little is known about the role of ET in the brain. The purpose of this study was to characterize the binding properties of various ETs in the brain of normotensive (Wistar-Kyoto) and hypertensive (spontaneously hypertensive) rats. [125I]ET 1 was prepared using the enzymobead lactoperoxidase method and purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Membrane fractions were prepared from homogenates of various brain regions. A differential distribution of ET binding was found among the 14 brain regions studied. The cerebellum, brainstem and area postrema/nucleus tractus solitarius had the highest binding, whereas the cortex, pituitary and septum had the least binding. Competition experiments performed with hypothalamus, brainstem and cerebellum demonstrated different Ki values for the ET studied. ET 2 had the highest affinity with a Ki of 4 x 10(-1) M, whereas the ET analog, Ala3,11-ET 1, had the lowest affinity with a Ki of 3 x 10(-10) M. Saturation experiments indicated a single class of high-affinity receptors in cerebellar (Kd = 2.5 x 10(-11) M, maximal binding Bmax = 1.25 x 10(-12) mol/mg) and hypothalamic membranes (Kd = 1.9 x 10(-11) M, Bmax = 0.93 x 10(-12) mol/mg). No differences in Kd or Bmax were detected between Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats hypothalamic and cerebellar tissues. The results of this study suggest a role for ET in the brain, but revealed no differences between normotensive and hypertensive strains. 
Antihypertensive effects of an aromatase inhibitor in inbred salt-sensitive rats. Rats susceptible to the hypertensive effect of dietary salt (SS/Jr) have excess urinary 19-nordeoxycorticosterone compared with salt-resistant control rats (SR/Jr). 19-Nordeoxycorticosterone is a hypertensinogenic mineralocorticoid, but whether it contributes to the salt sensitivity of SS/Jr is unknown. This study sought to evaluate the contribution of 19-nordeoxycorticosterone to the salt sensitivity of SS/Jr by lowering its production with an aromatase inhibitor, 10-propargyl-androst-4-ene,3,17-dione (19-acetylenic-androstenedione, 19-AA). This aromatase inhibitor also preferentially inhibits nonaromatizing adrenal 19-hydroxylation, an essential step in the formation of 19-nordeoxycorticosterone. To test this hypothesis, inhibitor (120 mg) or vehicle pellets were implanted into male and female weanling SS/Jr at 42 days of age. A high salt diet (8% NaCl) was started and two additional pellets were implanted at 52 and 62 days of age. Systolic blood pressure was measured in all animals and urinary corticosteroids in males. Compared with vehicle, the inhibitor lowered blood pressure at 50 days of age (when it could first be measured) until 64 days of age in females and 71 days of age in males. Corticosterone and aldosterone levels were not different between 19-AA- and vehicle-treated SS/Jr. 19-Nordeoxycorticosterone levels, however, were mildly reduced with the inhibitor (0.05 less than p less than 0.10). After 28 days of high salt diet all 23 of the 19-AA-treated SS/Jr were alive, whereas almost one half of the control animals had died. These data demonstrate that 19-AA attenuates the hypertension in SS/Jr; this effect may be through reduction in 19-nordeoxycorticosterone production. 
Bouveret's syndrome: an unusual twist on the classic cause. Bouveret's syndrome is a duodenal obstruction caused by a gallstone, manifested mostly as a gastric outlet obstruction. We have reported an instance of Bouveret's syndrome caused by two separate stones, either of which could independently have caused the obstruction. It is imperative to be sure that the obstruction is relieved before terminating the operative procedure. 
Cerebral vasospasm in elderly patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Cerebral vasospasm in elderly patients who were operated on the acute stage after subarachnoid hemorrhage was studied under strict criteria. The 138 patients were classified into three age groups: 59 years or younger (group A: 73 cases), 60 to 69 years (group B: 37 cases), and 70 years or older (group C: 28 cases). Severity of both the subarachnoid hemorrhages on computed tomography scan and the angiographic vasospasms was graded. The angiographic vasospasms were analyzed at the internal carotid artery, M1 segments of the middle cerebral artery, and A2 segments of the anterior cerebral. In all the relationships among the subarachnoid hemorrhage grades, the Hounsfield numbers, and the operative approaches to the angiographic vasospasm grade, there was a tendency for the angiographic vasospasm grades to be lower with increasing age in both the internal carotid artery and the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery. This tendency was more apparent in the larger vessels, that is, the internal carotid arteries. Close correlations of the angiographic vasospasm grades to the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and to low-density area on computed tomography scan were found in both the M1 and A2 territories in the three groups. However, there were no significant differences among the three groups in the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and low-density area on computed tomography scan. Regarding the surgical outcome, the older the patients, the higher were the mortality rates: 8% in group A, 11% in group B, and 25% in group C. 
Reduction by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor of fever and neutropenia induced by chemotherapy in patients with small-cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND. Neutropenia and infection are major dose-limiting side effects of chemotherapy. Previous studies have suggested that recombinant methionyl granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can reduce chemotherapy-related neutropenia in patients with cancer. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to test this hypothesis and the clinical implications. METHODS. Patients with small-cell lung cancer were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of recombinant methionyl G-CSF to study the incidence of infection as manifested by fever with neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, less than 1.0 x 10(9) per liter, with a temperature greater than or equal to 38.2 degrees C) resulting from up to six cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or G-CSF, with treatment beginning on day 4 and continuing through day 17 of a 21-day cycle. RESULTS. The safety of the study treatment could be evaluated in 207 of the 211 patients assigned to either drug, and its efficacy in 199. At least one episode of fever with neutropenia occurred in 77 percent of the placebo group, as compared with 40 percent of the G-CSF group (P less than 0.001). Over all cycles of chemotherapy, the median duration of grade IV neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, less than 0.5 x 10(9) per liter) was six days with placebo as compared with one day with G-CSF. During cycles of blinded treatment, the number of days of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, the number of days of hospitalization, and the incidence of confirmed infections were reduced by approximately 50 percent when G-CSF was given, as compared with placebo. Mild-to-moderate medullary bone pain occurred in 20 percent of the patients receiving G-CSF. CONCLUSIONS. The use of G-CSF as an adjunct to chemotherapy in patients with small-cell cancer of the lung was well tolerated and led to reductions in the incidence of fever with neutropenia and culture-confirmed infections; in the incidence, duration, and severity of grade IV neutropenia; and in the total number of days of treatment with intravenous antibiotics and days of hospitalization. 
Dimensions of pain-related cognitive coping: cross-validation of the factor structure of the Coping Strategy Questionnaire. Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between cognitive pain coping activity and adjustment in pain patients. The empirically derived dimensions of coping activity, as measured by scales from the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (CSQ), however, have varied across investigations. The purpose of this investigation was to determine both the content and number of dimensions of the CSQ and to explore the potential moderating influence that sociodemographic and patient history variables may have on the latent structure of the CSQ. A total of 620 patients from 5 different chronic pain patient samples were used to assess the generalizability of the dimensions across samples. Confirmatory factor analytic procedures identified a 3-factor solution in most of the samples that was robust across various demographic characteristics. Two factors appeared particularly robust: one reflected conscious use of cognitive coping strategies (with high loadings on ignoring pain and coping self-statements) and another reflected self-efficacy beliefs concerning pain (with high loadings on ability to control and decrease pain). A third factor, which was somewhat less stable, appeared to reflect avoidance of pain by attention to non-pain-related mental activity (with high loadings on diverting attention and praying and hoping). Scales reflecting catastrophizing cognitions and behavioral coping strategies did not consistently load on the above dimensions. Issues concerning the conceptualization and measurement of pain-related cognitive coping dimensions are discussed. 
Chronic treatment with tin normalizes blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. We have reported that short-term treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats with stannous chloride (SnCl2), which selectively depletes renal cytochrome P450, restores blood pressure to normal in young but not in adult SHR, and is without effect on blood pressure of either young or adult WKY rats. We report in the present study that chronic treatment with SnCl2, begun at age 5 weeks, prevented the development of hypertension in SHR over a period of 15 weeks at which time they were killed. Suspension of SnCl2 treatment after 8 weeks (i.e., at age 13 weeks) did not result in return of blood pressure to hypertensive levels in SHR. Age-matched WKY rats were not affected by tin treatment. These findings provide additional evidence that administration of tin, which stimulates heme oxygenase, thereby producing depletion of cytochrome P450, restores blood pressure to normal levels in SHR. 
Effect of cardiac tamponade on atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations: influence of stretch and pressure. 1. In order to study the role of atrial pressure and atrial stretch on the release of atrial natriuretic peptide we have measured plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, urine output and haemodynamic variables in eight patients during and 30 min after the relief of cardiac tamponade. This condition is characterized by high atrial pressure with little or no atrial stretch. 2. Relief of tamponade was associated with a rise in urine output (53 +/- 27.9 to 101 +/- 24.5 ml/h, mean +/- SEM; P = 0.09), systolic blood pressure (95 +/- 9.6 to 126 +/- 7.0 mmHg, P less than 0.0001), and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration (369.5 +/- 70.9 to 490.3 +/- 94.7 pg/ml, P less than 0.05) despite a large fall in right atrial pressure (18.6 +/- 1.6 to 9.5 +/- 1.3 mmHg, P less than 0.001). 3. These results suggest, therefore, that an increase in atrial stretch, rather than in atrial pressure, stimulates the release of atrial natriuretic peptide. 
Gamma-interferon induction in patients with chronic progressive MS. Although gamma interferon (gamma-IFN) may be involved in the pathogenesis of exacerbations of multiple sclerosis (MS), whether it plays a role in chronic progressive MS is not known. To investigate this, we retrospectively analyzed serum samples from nine chronic progressive MS patients who were treated with monthly intravenous infusions of the interferon inducer polyinosinic acid polycytidylic acid polylysine in carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC). Using a bioassay we found that the mean peak total interferon level was 177 U/ml 12 hours after infusion, and using a radioimmunoassay we found that the mean peak gamma-IFN level was 15.9 U/ml 12 hours after infusion, so that gamma-IFN made up approximately 10% of the total. Greater gamma-IFN induction did not correlate with clinical worsening; induced gamma-IFN levels were not higher in two patients who worsened on treatment, and the highest levels were found in a patient who remained stable. Either chronic progressive MS is not sensitive to gamma-IFN or the effects of gamma-IFN are masked by other mediators induced by poly ICLC. 
Colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. A prospective trial of optimal antibiotic management. The ideal prophylactic antibiotic regimen has not been established for patients undergoing colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and endorectal ileoanal anastomosis, a prolonged operation frequently accompanied by abdominal and pelvic contamination and associated with an infection rate up to 20%. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion, the efficacy of a short perioperative course compared to an extended postoperative course of intravenous antibiotics (cefoxitin) in patients undergoing colectomy with ileoanal anastomosis. Forty patients with ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis coli received a mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation and a standard three-dose perioperative course of intravenous cefoxitin. Patients then were randomized to receive intravenous cefoxitin, 1 g every 6 hours, or placebo for 5 days. No differences in overall postoperative morbidity were observed and neither group developed intra-abdominal, pelvic, or wound infections. It is concluded that a standard three-dose perioperative course of intravenous antibiotics provides adequate prophylaxis in the prevention of infectious complications in patients undergoing colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileoanal anastomosis. 
Variation in management based on type of choledochal cyst. The management of 23 patients treated for choledochal cysts at the Oregon Health Sciences University between 1969 and 1990 is reviewed. The median age was 27 years, with a range from 1 month to 90 years. Seventy-eight percent of patients presented with abdominal pain, and 35% were jaundiced. Three patients presented with cholangitis, two with cyst rupture, and one with recurrent pancreatitis. Nine patients had had previous biliary surgery. The diagnosis was made in all patients with ultrasound and/or cholangiography. Fifteen patients (65%) had type I cysts, 2 had a type II cyst, 5 (22%) had type III cysts, and 1 had a type IV cyst. Stones were present in four (17%) cysts, and all excised cysts were benign. Seventeen patients with type I and II choledochal cysts had complete cyst excision and choledochoenterostomy. Four of five patients with type III cysts had endoscopic cyst incision and drainage, while the fifth patient had transduodenal cyst excision and sphincteroplasty. The patient with a type IV cyst had extrahepatic cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy. There were no operative deaths. Two postoperative complications occurred: cholangitis and a prolonged ileus. All patients had resolution of their pain and jaundice. Two patients had late cholangitis. Cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy are the treatment of choice for types I and II choledochal cysts. Extrahepatic cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy may be adequate treatment for type IV cysts. Endoscopic incision and drainage is appropriate for selected patients with type III cysts. 
Natural history of acquired renal cystic disease in dialysis patients: a prospective longitudinal CT study. Patients with end-stage kidney disease, particularly those treated with dialysis, develop proliferative processes in their native kidneys that result in the formation of multiple acquired renal cysts, renal adenomas, and carcinomas. Data about these abnormalities have been acquired mainly from retrospective studies. We undertook a longitudinal prospective study in which the native kidneys of 30 dialysis patients were surveyed by serial CT during a 7-year period to study the natural history of acquired renal cystic disease and the frequency of associated complications. Acquired cysts were seen in 87% of patients at the end of the study compared with 57% at the study's onset, and a significant increase was seen in mean renal volume with time. Five patients (17%) developed large hemorrhagic renal cysts and four (13%) developed large perinephric hematomas. Renal cell carcinomas developed in two patients (7%) without renal symptoms. One carcinoma invaded the renal capsule, but did not cause metastases. The other carcinoma was widely metastatic. Our findings are consistent with those of earlier studies documenting an increased prevalence of renal cell carcinoma in dialysis patients as compared with the general population. However, our conclusions are limited because the study sample is small and no control population was studied. We conclude that acquired renal cystic disease in dialysis patients is a progressive disorder often associated with cyst hemorrhage. Dialysis patients may also have an increased prevalence of renal cell carcinoma. 
Mesenteric infarction secondary to tumor emboli from primary aortic sarcoma. Guidelines for diagnosis and management. Primary aortic tumors are rare, difficult to diagnose, and often fatal. This case and a review of the literature identified aortic tumors as a potential source of emboli leading to acute mesenteric insufficiency. The case showed the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing and determining the extent and location of an aortic tumor. 
Corrosion of modular hip prostheses. Nine uncemented hip prostheses of modular design were revised because of late infection (2 cases), femoral stem loosening or fracture (2), loosening of threaded cups (3) and protrusion of bipolar cups (2). At surgery we found tissue discoloration and macroscopic corrosion in four of the nine prostheses, located at the head-neck junction. Histological examination in most cases showed extensive necrosis associated with metal particles, indicating metal toxicity. Metallographic examination of the prosthetic heads revealed structural imperfections and inhomogeneity of the metal. We suggest that the crevice between the head and neck is a potential site of corrosion in modular designs. 
Abdominal aortic aneurysm in chronic thoracic dissection. Report of two cases. Two cases of lower abdominal aortic aneurysm in association with chronic thoracic dissections are reported. These infra-renal aortic aneurysms, superimposed on an abdominal extension of the dissection, always require surgical treatment because of their well known tendency to enlarge and rupture. The authors report their experience and discuss the management of this complication in chronic dissections treated surgically. 
Hormonal inhibition of the endometrium for resectoscopic endometrial ablation. Attempts at inhibiting the thickness and vascularity of the endometrium in preparation for endometrial ablation by using different types of hormones have been reported. To evaluate the effects of two different progestins, danazol, and leuprolide acetate on the endometrium, compared with the features of early proliferative endometrium, histologic studies were done for at least five patients treated with each hormone who then underwent resectoscopic endometrial ablation for treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. Significant and at times dramatic differences among the treatment groups were found, with progestin-prepared endometrium being the least successful and leuprolide-prepared endometrium the most successful. In addition, the prolonged suppression provided for a period of time after the procedure by depot leuprolide is likely to help inhibit endometrial regeneration and provide even better long-term success of the procedure. 
Venogenic impotence following dermal graft repair for Peyronie's disease. Peyronie's plaque excision with dermal grafting generally offers good cosmetic results for patients who require surgical intervention for Peyronie's disease. However, postoperative impotence has been reported in 12 to 100% of such patients. The mechanism of impotence in this setting is not well defined. We present 3 men who had venogenic impotence after plaque excision and dermal grafting for Peyronie's disease. One patient has subsequently responded well to dorsal vein ligation, 1 has chosen an effective nonoperative method of management and 1 continues to consider the options. We report venous leak as an organic cause of impotence after plaque excision and dermal grafting for Peyronie's disease, and its successful management by dorsal vein ligation. The implications of these findings in the surgical management of Peyronie's disease are discussed. 
Retrobulbar bupivacaine irrigation for postoperative pain after scleral buckling surgery. A prospective study. The authors conducted a prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial to determine if retrobulbar irrigation with bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.75% (Marcaine) has an effect on postoperative pain after scleral buckling surgery. Fifty consecutive patients undergoing scleral buckling under general anesthesia were randomized to receive either bupivacaine or balanced salt solution as a retrobulbar irrigation at the end of their retinal detachment procedure. Of the 25 patients who received bupivacaine, only three (12%) required parenteral pain relief in the first 24 hours after surgery. This was statistically significant when compared with the 18 (72%) of 25 patients requiring parenteral pain relief in the placebo group (P less than 0.0001). In addition, when questioned about their perception of the degree of postoperative pain, patients in the control group rated their level of pain as significantly more severe than did patients in the bupivacaine group. The authors conclude that retrobulbar irrigation with bupivacaine is a safe and effective way to achieve postoperative pain relief after surgery for scleral buckling. 
A cellular mechanism for impaired posthypoxic relaxation in isolated cardiac myocytes. Altered myofilament relaxation kinetics at reoxygenation. Single, isolated rat ventricular myocytes were made hypoxic for 10 minutes and then reoxygenated. During hypoxia, there was a marked abbreviation of the mechanical twitch, without a decrease in its amplitude. Immediately after reoxygenation, both the time to peak shortening and the duration of relaxation were markedly prolonged, and they remained prolonged for 10-50 minutes. The alterations in contraction and relaxation were not associated with any change in the time course of either the transmembrane action potential or the cytosolic calcium transient, as recorded with the fluorescent probe indo 1. Intracellular pH, measured with a fluorescent probe (carboxyseminaphthorhodofluor), showed an acid shift during hypoxia and an alkaline rebound immediately after reoxygenation. The time courses of intracellular pH and contraction duration were not parallel during hypoxia or reoxygenation, and simulation of the alkaline pH shift by lowering PCO2 or superfusing NH4Cl (in the absence of exposure to hypoxia) did not quantitatively reproduce the prolongation of relaxation seen after reoxygenation. The prolongation of contraction after reoxygenation could be overridden by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or the nonenzymatic phosphatase butanedione monoxime. We conclude that delayed relaxation after reoxygenation exists at the single cell level and is due to an alteration of the properties of the myofilaments. Intracellular pH is not the primary mediator of this alteration. We speculate that alteration of intracellular inorganic phosphate or covalent modification of the myofilaments might be involved. 
5-Fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cisplatin as treatment for adrenal cortical carcinoma. Fourteen patients with progressive metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma were treated with a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin, and cisplatin (FAP). All had a large tumor burden. Six patients had a hormone-producing tumor; mitotane treatment was given to five of them during chemotherapy for its possible antihormonal effects. Treatment could be evaluated in 13 patients. The overall response rate was 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5% to 54%). A complete remission, which lasted for 42 months, was achieved in one patient. Partial remissions, which lasted for 6 and 11 months, were achieved in two patients. Cardiotoxicity appeared in three patients, myelotoxicity in four, and nephrotoxicity in one. This confirms that this regimen is an active combination for the treatment of metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma. 
Fact and fancy. What can we really tell from the placenta? Considerable interest in the clinical significance of placental abnormalities has been fueled by malpractice claims when perinatal outcome is less than optimal. The pathologist must be aware of those placental lesions that may contribute to perinatal morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the abnormalities of placentation, placental weight, maternal uteroplacental blood flow, villous histological makeup, fetoplacental blood flow, the umbilical cord, and the membranes, as well as the problems of multiple pregnancy. The important contribution of abnormal uteroplacental blood flow to adverse perinatal outcome is emphasized, as is the need to determine the extent of placental damage when evaluating the contribution thereto of particular placental abnormalities. 
Heterozygous protein C deficiency associated with multiple congenital hemangiomas--a case report. Congenital protein C deficiency is described as associated with recurrent thrombotic manifestations. The proband, a fourteen-year-old female, has a history of severe and frequent thrombotic disease, moreover, she presents congenital multiple hemangiomas. Family history was positive for protein C deficiency since the mother of the proposita is also affected and has manifested deep venous thrombophlebitis. Two additional relatives on the maternal side were not available for study but were reported to be symptomatic. None of the family members presented angiomatosis. This case report represents the first description of the association of protein C deficiency with multiple hemangiomas. 
Clinical overview of management of chronic ischemic heart disease. The outcome of patients with chronic coronary artery disease is dependent on many factors; the most important ones include the severity and extent of coronary artery disease, state of left ventricular function at rest, extent and severity of myocardial ischemia, and the total amount of left ventricular myocardium that is at risk. To use noninvasive tests optimally, the clinician first must define the information needed. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of the test(s) in providing the necessary information, the additive value of the result of a test to the information already available, and the best combination of tests in providing the desired information help determine the choice of various noninvasive tests in a particular clinical circumstance. 
Combined nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation and rocking bed in chronic respiratory insufficiency. Nocturnal ventilatory support of a disabled person at home. The use of intermittent positive-pressure ventilation via nasal mask with a rocking bed provided the necessary ventilatory support for a person with quadriplegia living at home. This option was required to maintain an independent life-style of choice. The combination of techniques and the linkage of devices demonstrated an effective use of simple available technology for respiratory care at home and the adaptation of the respiratory prescription to the total needs of each person: medical, social, and financial. The further use of nasal mask ventilation in selected cases is encouraged by clinical research protocol. 
Metalloproteinases in degenerative aortic disease. 1. Atherosclerosis and aneurysm of the abdominal aorta are associated with thinning of the medial connective tissue. We have investigated the presence of the connective-tissue-degrading metalloproteinases in homogenates prepared from atherosclerotic, aneurysmal and control aortic media. 2. Gelatinase activity was much increased in homogenates from atherosclerotic and aneurysmal aorta [10.9 +/- 1.8 and 13.3 +/- 3.3 micrograms of gelatin hydrolysed h-1 (mg of protein)-1 respectively]. This gelatinase activity was highest at the luminal aspect of the aortic media, where the activity increased three- to five-fold after the destruction of alpha 2-macroglobulin. Zymograms demonstrated the principal gelatinase in atherosclerotic aorta to have a molecular mass of about 92 kDa, whereas in aneurysmal aorta there was a spectrum of gelatinase activity from 92 to 55 kDa. 3. Collagenase and stromelysin (proteoglycanase) could be detected by immunoblotting in homogenates of aneurysmal aorta, but rarely in atherosclerotic aorta and never in control aorta. Collagenase and stromelysin activities were low, but increased two- to three-fold after the destruction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. Collagenase and stromelysin activities were highest at the adventitial aspect of aneurysmal media. 4. The secretion of gelatinase by inflammatory cells at the intima of diseased aorta could have a pathological role in establishing atherosclerotic plaques and medial thinning. Secretion of collagenase, gelatinase and stromelysin from the adventitia could accelerate connective tissue degradation in the media of aneurysmal aorta. 
Variability of body weight and health outcomes in the Framingham population BACKGROUND. Fluctuation in body weight is a common phenomenon, due in part to the high prevalence of dieting. In this study we examined the associations between variability in body weight and health end points in subjects participating in the Framingham Heart Study, which involves follow-up examinations every two years after entry. METHODS. The degree of variability of body weight was expressed as the coefficient of variation of each subject's measured body-mass-index values at the first eight biennial examinations during the study and on their recalled weight at 25 years of age. Using the 32-year follow-up data, we analyzed total mortality, mortality from coronary heart disease, and morbidity due to coronary heart disease and cancer in relation to intraindividual variation in body weight, including only end points that occurred after the 10th biennial examination. We used age-adjusted proportional-hazards regression for the data analysis. RESULTS. Subjects with highly variable body weights had increased total mortality (P = 0.005 for men, P = 0.01 for women), mortality from coronary heart disease (P = 0.009 for men, P = 0.009 for women), and morbidity due to coronary heart disease (P = 0.0009 for men, P = 0.006 for women). Using a multivariate analysis that also controlled for obesity, trends in weight over time, and five indicators of cardiovascular risk, we found that the positive associations between fluctuations in body weight and end points related to mortality and coronary heart disease could not be attributed to these potential confounding factors. The relative risks of these end points in subjects whose weight varied substantially, as compared with those whose weight was relatively stable, ranged from 1.27 to 1.93. CONCLUSIONS. Fluctuations in body weight may have negative health consequences, independent of obesity and the trend of body weight over time. 
The serotonin syndrome. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: A review of the literature on the serotonin syndrome in animals and human beings was conducted, and 12 reports of 38 cases in human patients were then analyzed to determine the most frequently reported clinical features and drug interactions, as well as the incidence, treatment, and outcome of this syndrome. FINDINGS: The serotonin syndrome is most commonly the result of the interaction between serotonergic agents and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The most frequent clinical features are changes in mental status, restlessness, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, and tremor. The presumed pathophysiological mechanism involves brainstem and spinal cord activation of the 1A form of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) receptor. The incidence of the syndrome is not known. Both sexes have been affected, and patients' ages have ranged from 20 to 68 years. Discontinuation of the suspected serotonergic agent and institution of supportive measures are the primary treatment, although 5-HT receptor antagonists may also play a role. Once treatment is instituted, the syndrome typically resolves within 24 hours, but confusion can last for days, and death has been reported. CONCLUSIONS: The serotonin syndrome is a toxic condition requiring heightened clinical awareness for prevention, recognition, and prompt treatment. Further work is needed to establish the diagnostic criteria, incidence, and predisposing factors, to identify the role of 5-HT antagonists in treatment, and to differentiate the syndrome from neuroleptic malignant syndrome. 
Thrombolytic therapy in the management of acute limb ischaemia. Acute limb ischaemia poses a threat to both the limb and life of a patient. Until recently, attempted revascularization by thromboembolectomy or vascular reconstruction held the best chance of limb salvage. Thrombolytic techniques afford an alternative method of management for this condition and are effective in selected patients. Low-dose intra-arterial streptokinase is the most established method of thrombolysis, although the recently developed tissue plasminogen activator offers a promising alternative. Intra-arterial thrombolysis is not an easy option, being labour intensive and requiring close co-operation between surgeon and radiologist. Thrombolytic and surgical techniques are not mutually exclusive but are best used to complement each other. Ideally patients with acute limb ischaemia should be managed by surgeons with knowledge of, and access to, optimal current surgical and non-surgical techniques. 
Health implications of obesity in American Indians and Alaska Natives. American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are experiencing an epidemic of diabetes, increasing rates of coronary artery disease and hypertension, and poor survival rates for breast cancer that are likely partially attributable to the increasing prevalence of obesity over the past generation. Obesity may also contribute to the high rates of gallstones and to adverse outcomes of pregnancy in AI/ANs. Although overall mortality was not associated with obesity in Pima Indians (except in the most obese men), the relationship of obesity to longevity in other AI/AN groups is not known. Further study of the specific health effects of obesity in various groups of AI/ANs are needed. In the meantime, community-based programs to prevent obesity and its sequelae should be implemented in all AI/AN communities. 
Treatment of primary fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome with ibuprofen and alprazolam. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A multidimensional evaluation of 78 patients with primary fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) revealed no significant relationship between clinical measures of physical discomfort and psychological measures. This observation provided evidence against the notion that the pain of PFS has a psychological etiology. The same patients were randomized into 4 groups for treatment with ibuprofen and/or alprazolam in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Clinical improvement in patient rating of disease severity and in the severity of tenderness upon palpation was most apparent in the subgroup of patients who were receiving both ibuprofen and alprazolam. An 8-week, open-label study in which 52 patients received both drugs further documented improvement in outcome measures. These data indicate that treatment with a combination of ibuprofen and alprazolam can be beneficial for some patients with PFS. 
Respiratory complications in critically ill medical patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine types of respiratory complications encountered in critically ill patients with serious acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and to identify associated risk factors. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A university hospital medical ICU. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 86 patients admitted to the medical ICU over a 2 1/2-yr period of time, for 107 consecutive episodes of serious acute upper GI bleeding. Clinical features of patients who developed respiratory complications of pneumonia, witnessed aspiration of gastric contents, or who required intubation and mechanical ventilation for other reasons were compared with those features of patients without respiratory complications. MAIN RESULTS: Respiratory complications occurred during 23 (22%) serious upper GI bleeding episodes (mean transfusion requirement, 7 units of packed RBCs). Twelve patients developed pneumonia and all had evidence of advanced liver disease. Five patients were observed to aspirate gastric contents and six patients require intubation and mechanical ventilation for reasons other than pneumonia or aspiration. Esophageal sites of bleeding (esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal varices), advanced liver disease, age greater than 70 yrs, and an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score greater than 13 appeared to be risk factors. Mortality rate was increased in patients with respiratory complications: 70% of patients with respiratory complications died, compared with 4% of those patients without such problems (p less than .001). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory complications are common in critically ill medical patients with serious acute upper GI bleeding, and are associated with a poor outcome. Risk factors include advanced liver disease, esophageal site of bleeding, age greater than 70 yrs, and higher APACHE II score. 
Aphthoid ulceration of the colon in strongyloidiasis. In humans, infestation with Strongyloides stercoralis most commonly involves the upper small intestine. We describe a 65-yr-old woman who presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypoalbuminemia, and was found at colonoscopy to have patchy erythema with aphthoid ulcers scattered throughout the large intestine proximal to the splenic flexure. Biopsy of involved areas and examination of the colonic effluent revealed S. stercoralis larvae. Previous reports of colonic involvement with this nematode, and the differential diagnosis of aphthoid ulcers, a newly described lesion associated with S. stercoralis infestation, are discussed. 
Blood and bone marrow eosinophilia in malignant tumors. Role and nature of blood and tissue eosinophil colony-stimulating factor(s) in two patients. Eosinophilia of the blood and bone marrow may be encountered in patients with disseminated malignancies. It is unrelated to the histologic type of the tumor but usually reflects its aggressiveness and prognostic outlook. Its pathogenesis is controversial. The presence of eosinophil colony-stimulating factor(s) in serum and malignant tissue extracts was evaluated in two cases of malignancies accompanied by marked blood and bone marrow eosinophilia. When compared with controls, serum and tumor tissue extracts stimulated the growth of G, M, and Eo colonies in semisolid cultures of human bone marrow. Such stimulating effect was inhibited by the addition of antibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3. Thus, the colony-stimulating factor(s) play a role in the pathogenesis of the eosinophilia associated with some malignant tumors, and these factors appear to include GM-CSF, interleukin-3, and probably others. 
Tubuloglomerular feedback in one-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats. Previous studies have shown that hydropenic one-kidney, one-clip (1-K, 1-C) hypertensive HT rats exhibit impaired autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to reduced arterial perfusion pressure. We investigated the possible role of altered tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) activity in this phenomenon. Uninephrectomized Wistar rats were studied acutely 3 weeks after placing silver clips (0.2 mm) on the renal artery. Experiments were performed in 1-K,1-C HT rats and in uninephrectomized control animals. TGF activity was assessed as changes in proximal tubule stop-flow pressure (SFP) in response to orthograde microperfusion from 0 to 80 nl/min into late proximal tubule segments. Only the highest perfusion rates (approximately 40 nl/min) into late proximal tubule segments resulted in maximal decreases in SFP, indicating a marked rightward shift of overall TGF activity in 1-K,1-C HT rats. Similar responses were observed in the uninephrectomized animals. In contrast, changes of SFP were observed at lower perfusion rates in normal animals and maximal responses were observed at perfusion rates of approximately 20 nl/min. These observations are consistent with the possibility that altered TGF activity contributes to impaired autoregulation of GFR in 1-K,1-C HT rats in response to reduced renal perfusion pressure. In response to treatment with i.v. captopril, the 1-K,1-C HT rats exhibited marked decreases in systemic arterial pressure associated with decreases in SFP and virtually complete inhibition of TGF activity. It is attractive to hypothesize that these alterations in TGF characteristics in the 1-K,1-C HT rats play a significant pathophysiologic role in the acute renal dysfunction observed in response to acute decreases of blood pressure during conditions of augmented angiotensin activity. Additional future studies will allow us to address the precise role for intrarenal angiotensin in these phenomena. 
Characterization of syngeneic rat monoclonal antibodies to the HSN tumor using syngeneic monoclonal anti-idiotopic antibodies. Twelve syngeneic anti-idiotopic mAb (anti-idiotypic/idiotopic antibodies Ab2)) were prepared from CBH/Cbi rats immunized with one of three monoclonal anti-HSN antibodies (Ab1) (11/160, ALN/11/53, or ALN/16/53) specific for the HSN tumor. The sera of the rats used for hybridoma production and all of the monoclonal Ab2 specifically inhibited the binding to HSN of the immunizing Ab1 only. It is concluded that, in this completely syngeneic system, only the private idiotopes associated with the antibody-combining site were immunogenic. Analyses using Western blotting showed that the Ab2 bound to intact Ab1 and to isolated H chains where the intra-strand disulfide bonds remained intact. The Ab2 did not bind to L chains or to fully reduced H chains of the Ab1. It is concluded that the idiotopes expressed on the H chain were conformational. When a panel of 13 monoclonal Ab1 (including the three used for immunization) were tested for reactivity with the Ab2, three reacted specifically with their respective Ab2 and 8 gave no binding suggesting that each Ab1 had a distinct idiotypic specificity despite the fact that all the Ab1 competed with each other for binding to Ag. However, the two remaining Ab1 (ALN/9/94 and ALN/12/17) generated from different tumor-bearing rats, were found to possess the same idiotypic specificity as 11/160. A detailed analysis using seven Ab2 raised against 11/160 showed that while the idiotype of ALN/9/94 and 11/160 were very similar, that of ALN/12/17 showed some clear differences. These three Ab1 have been shown previously to bind a sequential epitope on the HSN Ag in Western blots and it is postulated that the common idiotype of these Ab1 reflects their recognition of a sequential epitope. This may also account for the relatively frequent occurrence in tumor bearer sera of antibodies with this Id. 
Salmonella: a rare cause of subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis. A 36 year old woman had emergency pericardectomy because of subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis. The pericardial fluid and tissue culture showed that this was caused by infection with Salmonella enteritidis. Cardiac involvement with salmonella does not usually present in such an aggressive manner and it has not previously been reported to cause this rare type of cardiac constriction. 
Urinary retention--an unusual dystonic reaction to continuous metoclopramide infusion. Vomiting is one of the most distressing adverse effects of cancer chemotherapy. Metoclopramide by continuous infusion (400 micrograms/kg/h after a loading dose of 2.5 mg/kg) is a novel administration method for optimizing efficacy. A two-year-old boy developed urinary retention on three occasions, once accompanied by priapism and slurred speech, while receiving a continuous infusion. This was reversed by procyclidine, suggesting that it may have been a dystonic reaction. 
Complications of the variable screw plate pedicle screw fixation. In this study, 124 consecutive cases of posterior spinal fusion with variable screw plate fixation were reviewed. In 33 patients (27%), 41 complications were identified. Urinary tract infection without sequelae developed in 13 patients. Dural tear occurred in seven patients and wound hematoma in five. Wound infection developed in three patients; one was subfascial requiring instrument and graft removal. Neurologic deficit developed in seven patients (6%), in five of whom the deficit was due to manipulation and reduction of neural elements. Two of the seven deficits were believed to be caused by misplaced pedicle screws. Variable screw plate fixation is a formidable procedure with a significant complications rate. 
Antibody-fluorescein conjugates for photoimmunodiagnosis of human colon carcinoma in nude mice. To improve the detectability of tumors by light-induced fluorescence, the use of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) as carriers of fluorescent molecules was studied. As a model for this approach, the biodistribution of an anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) MoAb coupled to fluorescein was studied in mice bearing a human colon carcinoma xenograft. In vitro, such conjugates with fluorescein-MoAb molar ratios ranging from four to 19, doubly labeled with 125I, showed more than 82% binding to immobilized CEA. In vivo, conjugates with a fluorescein-MoAb molar ratio of ten or less resulted in a tumor uptake of more than 30% of the injected dose of radioactivity per gram tumor at 24 hours. Tumor to liver, kidney, and muscle ratios of 20, 30 and 72, respectively, were obtained 48 hours after injection of the 125I-MoAb-(fluorescein)10 conjugate. The highest fluorescence intensity was always obtained for the tumor with the anti-CEA MoAb conjugate; whereas in control mice injected with fluoresceinated control immunoglobulin G1, no detectable increase in tumor fluorescence was observed. To compare these results with a classically used dye, mice bearing the same xenografts received 60 micrograms of Photofrin II. The intensity of the fluorescence signal of the tumor with this amount of Photofrin II was eight times lower than that obtained after an injection of 442 ng of fluorescein coupled with 20 micrograms of MoAb, which gave an absolute amount of fluorescein localized in the tumor of up to 125 ng/g of tumor. These results illustrate the possibility of improving the specificity of in vivo tumor localization of dyes for laser-induced fluorescence photodetection and phototherapy by coupling them to MoAb directed against tumor markers. 
Estimated prevalence of dementia among elderly black and white community residents. A stratified random sample of 83 black and 81 white community residents aged 65 years and older in a five-county area in the Piedmont region of North Carolina was evaluated for dementia, using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke--Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria. Of 164 subjects, 26 were found to be demented, resulting in an estimated prevalence rate of dementia in the five-county area of 16% (95% confidence interval, 7.92 to 24.08) for blacks and 3.05% (95% confidence interval, 0 to 6.91) for whites. The estimated prevalence of dementia for white women (2.9%) was similar to that for white men (3.3%), but the rate for black women was distinctly higher than for black men (19.9% and 8.9%, respectively). Blacks were more likely than whites to have a history of stroke, hypertension, and other chronic disorders that might have contributed to the development of dementia. Apart from differences in rates of institutionalization, no other relevant factors were identified that might explain the difference in the prevalence of dementia in these black and white community residents. 
Extended aortic root replacement with cryopreserved allografts: do they hold up? The extended aortic root replacement technique is used for the surgical repair of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction complicated by concurrent hypoplastic aortic annulus, multiple levels of obstruction, or aortic insufficiency. Extended aortic root replacement incorporates the concepts of aortic root replacement and aortoventriculoplasty to create a comparatively simple procedure. Unique features of the technique include the implantation of an allograft, which makes the need for anticoagulation obsolete, and use of the donor mitral leaflet to enlarge the outflow tract. Since 1985, 32 patients in Denver have undergone placement of a cryopreserved aortic valve allograft as part of extended aortic root replacement. There were four hospital deaths (13%), and 1 child underwent cardiac transplantation 30 hours after operation. In 6 months to 4.8 years of follow-up, a 14-year-old boy with familial hyperlipidemia required coronary artery bypass grafting, and 3 children experienced allograft calcification with progressive insufficiency, which prompted allograft replacement. The other 23 patients are clinically well. 
John Caffey Award paper. Avascular necrosis: early MR imaging and histologic findings in a canine model. To examine the early MR and histologic changes of avascular necrosis, we surgically devascularized the distal femur of adult beagle dogs and performed short TR/short TE MR imaging and histologic examinations. MR showed increasing areas of low signal, and histologic examination showed changes of fat necrosis, inflammatory infiltrate, and fibrocytic and bony repair. These processes were divided into four stages. Stage 1 is seen in the first days after surgery and consists of homogeneous high signal on MR and only subtle histologic changes of early fat necrosis. Stage 2, seen by 7 days after surgery, shows linear low-signal areas within the high-signal marrow on MR and fat necrosis and an inflammatory infiltrate on histologic sections. Stage 3, seen by 16 days after surgery, shows patchy low signal occupying more of the marrow on MR with a fibrocytic infiltrate on histologic sections. Stage 4, seen by 23 days after surgery, shows a more homogeneous low and intermediate signal on MR and histologic findings of more organized fibrocytes and the onset of new bone formation. Using this model, we have proved that MR imaging can show marrow changes as soon as 1 week after the onset of avascular necrosis. Whereas MR imaging showed a progression of increasing areas of low signal, the histologic findings seen during this time were diverse, including inflammatory infiltration (a previously unreported finding), fat necrosis, and fibrocytic and osseous repair. 
Low incidence of point mutation at codon 12 of K-ras proto-oncogene in squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. Forty-two cases of squamous cell carcinoma arising in the upper aerodigestive tract were examined to determine the incidence and type of point mutation in codon 12 of the c-K-ras gene by using the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotide hybridization techniques on DNA extracted from paraffin blocks. DNA sequencing, in addition, was performed in 4 cases. No point mutation was detected in codon 12 of c-K-ras in the 42 squamous cell carcinomas we examined. According to the results of DNA sequencing of 4 cases, codon 13 also revealed no point mutation. Thus, point mutational activation of codon 12 of c-K-ras oncogene is an uncommon event in human upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma. 
Destruction of tumour parenchyma in basal cell carcinoma by tumour-associated neutral proteases: a histochemical study. Proteolytic activity was demonstrated histochemically in frozen sections of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). After incubation of tissue sections in 0.1 M phosphate buffer with 0.25 M NaCl the tumour epithelium was almost completely destroyed. The basal and squamous cell layers of the epidermis disintegrated to varying degrees, particularly where they were directly in contact with tumour epithelium. Serine and metalloprotease inhibitors diminished this tissue destruction. Iodoacetate enhanced tumour destruction, urea and potassium thiocyanate even more so. The high proteolytic activity of BCC demonstrated in this study may be an important factor in the proliferative, invasive and destructive behaviour of this tumour. 
Giant, human immunodeficiency virus-related ulcers in the esophagus. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the esophagus has recently been implicated as a cause of giant esophageal ulcers in HIV-positive patients with odynophagia. The authors examined four patients in whom esophagograms (one single-contrast and three double-contrast studies) revealed giant, HIV-related ulcers indistinguishable from those of cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis. All four patients had severe odynophagia, one had an associated maculopapular rash, and two became HIV-positive at approximately the time of clinical presentation. In all patients, biopsy samples, brushings, and cultures obtained with endoscopy were negative for CMV or herpes simplex. One patient had positive brushings for candidiasis, but this may have resulted from fungal superinfection of the ulcer. Two patients were treated with orally administered steroids, and all four had swift clinical improvement; symptoms disappeared during an average period of 8.3 days from presentation. HIV-related esophageal ulcers should be distinguished from CMV ulcers, so that appropriate treatment can be initiated in these patients. 
Selegiline (deprenyl) treatment and death of nigral neurons in Parkinson's disease. We studied the effect of selegiline (deprenyl) treatment on the number of Lewy bodies and neuron counts in the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The number of medial nigral neurons was greater and the number of Lewy bodies fewer in those PD patients who had been treated with selegiline in combination with levodopa as compared with patients who had received levodopa alone. This suggests that selegiline treatment may retard the death of nigral neurons, but alternative explanations, such as the reduction of levodopa dosage in selegiline-treated patients, are possible. 
Simultaneous measurement of all thrombosis parameters from native human blood: usefulness in monitoring efficacy and complications of thrombolytic therapy. The sequelae of thrombus formation, both by shear forces and by collagen fiber, the subsequent coagulation, and the dislodgement of thrombi (thrombolysis) were measured from a small volume of nonanticoagulated blood sample, by a new instrument. Addition of streptokinase (SK) or tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to the blood sample eliminated the need for anticoagulation for thrombolysis measurement: clot lysis preceded and allowed thrombolysis to occur. The test revealed activation of platelets and coagulation by SK and rt-PA. Apart from this general trend, platelet reactivity in response to plasminogen activator showed great individual variation. Whether the greatly enhanced (42%) or prolonged hemostasis (13%), observed in different blood samples with rt-PA, could be used as a predictor of reocclusion or bleeding complications remains to be established. Thrombolysis did not occur in 12% of the samples tested. These thrombolysis models may be useful for developing new agents for the dissolution of platelet-rich thrombi. It is suggested that this technique be used for monitoring thrombolytic therapy. 
Carcinoma arising within fibroadenomas of the breast. A clinicopathologic study of 105 patients. The authors report the clinicopathologic features of 105 carcinomas arising within fibroadenomas (FAs) of the breast. The mean age of the patients was 44 years. The presentation and gross characteristics of these tumors rarely differed from those of uncomplicated FAs. Carcinoma in situ (CIS) was the predominant type of malignancy (95%) found to arise in FAs, and lobular and ductal types occurred with equal frequency. Nine of ten FAs harboring an invasive carcinoma also contained CIS supporting the origin of the infiltrative component in the FAs. CIS within FAs was associated with in situ malignancy in surrounding breast tissue in 21% of cases. Age, fibroadenoma size, and type and extent of CIS were similar in patients with disease limited to the FA and in those with associated malignant disease in the remainder of the breast. Axillary nodal metastases were not detected. Sixty-three patients were observed for a mean period of 8.4 years. Only one of 26 patients with CIS within an FA who was treated conservatively developed an ipsilateral carcinoma. None of the 26 developed contralateral carcinoma; however, 3 of 23 with similar lesions, who were treated by mastectomy, did so. The contralateral carcinomas were invasive in two patients, one of whom died with distant metastases. Seven patients with FAs harboring lobular CIS underwent bilateral mastectomy. Their postoperative course was uneventful. None of seven patients with invasive carcinoma arising in an FA, two of whom were treated conservatively, succumbed to disease. However, one developed contralateral carcinoma. The authors recommend breast-conserving therapy for CIS arising in an FA. 
A prostacyclin analog impairs the response to tissue-type plasminogen activator during coronary thrombolysis: evidence for a pharmacokinetic interaction. Inhibition of thromboxane (TX) A2 with aspirin enhances the response to coronary thrombolysis. However, experimental evidence suggests that platelet activation during coronary thrombolysis is mediated by a number of agonists, in addition to TXA2. As a consequence, greater benefit would be expected with antiplatelet agents that have a broader spectrum of activity. However, a recent clinical trial, combining tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) with the prostacyclin analog, iloprost, did not detect such a benefit. To address the mechanism of this response, we compared the effect of iloprost, a stable analog of prostacyclin, with GR32191, a TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist, on the response to i.v. t-PA in a closed chest, canine model of coronary thrombosis. GR32191 reduced the time to reperfusion by 47% (n = 6, P less than .05), consistent with a role for TXA2-mediated platelet activation in impairing thrombolysis. In contrast, iloprost increased the time to reperfusion by 50% (n = 5, P = NS) and in four of nine animals reperfusion failed to occur despite inhibition of platelet aggregation. In a separate series of experiments, steady-state plasma t-PA clearance increased by 38% (407 +/- 49 vs. 294 +/- 42 ml/min; n = 8, P less than .02) during infusion of iloprost and recovered after its withdrawal. This appeared to be a specific effect, as infusion of nitroglycerin at a dose which induced a similar fall in blood pressure altered neither the time to reperfusion nor plasma t-PA. Iloprost impairs the thrombolytic response to t-PA via an increase in the clearance of this agent. 
Mucosal cell proliferation of the rectal stump in ulcerative colitis patients after ileorectal anastomosis. The proliferative activity and polyamine levels of the rectal epithelium in unoperated ulcerative colitis patients and in ulcerative colitis patients after total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis were determined and compared with control subjects. Cell proliferation was evaluated in rectal biopsies by in vitro 3H thymidine incorporation by measuring the labeling index and the position of labeled cells along the crypt; polyamines were determined with a chromatographic method. In ulcerative colitis patients the labeling index was significantly increased, and labeled cells were shifted toward the upper part of the crypt when compared with controls. Ileorectal anastomosis patients showed a normalization of the labeling index and a distribution of labeled cells similar to controls. Polyamine levels were also increased in ulcerative colitis patients; in ileorectal anastomosis patients, the level of polyamines was decreased in respect to unoperated patients and return to normal values except for spermine. Because the increased proliferation and higher polyamine levels are related to increased colon cancer risk, our results confirm that ulcerative colitis is a risk factor for the development of carcinoma. Ileorectal anastomosis may reduce this risk through a normalization of mucosal cell proliferative activity and of some polyamine levels. 
Simultaneous ipsilateral vasal and epididymal reconstruction. Injuries to the spermatic cords, sustained during childhood inguinal hernioplasty, caused unilateral testicular atrophy, multiple bilateral excurrent duct obstruction and aspermia. Simultaneous unilateral vasal reconstruction and vaso-epididymostomy resulted in satisfactory semen parameters. It is expected that vasal integrity will be maintained after multiple reconstructive procedures at different locations if further injury to the vascular supply of the excurrent duct is avoided. 
Thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase stimulates collagen breakdown. BACKGROUND. Plasmin is capable of degrading extracellular matrix components such as collagen in vitro. To evaluate the significance of this for in vivo conditions, we set out to study the effect of streptokinase, which acts by converting plasminogen to plasmin, on the serum concentrations of the amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) and the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP). METHODS AND RESULTS. Twenty-three patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were included in the study; 17 of them received thrombolytic therapy, and six were treated conservatively. PIIINP and PICP were assayed with radioimmunoassays. Kinetics of creatine kinase-MB release were determined to differentiate reperfusers from nonreperfusers. Composite curves of creatine kinase-MB release were constructed for different patient subgroups. During streptokinase infusion the serum concentrations of PIIINP increased rapidly, with a maximum mean increase of 50% (from 2.2 +/- 0.2 to 3.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms/l) in 45 minutes. A similar increase was also observed in two patients who received thrombolytic therapy but did not subsequently develop any myocardial infarction determined on the basis of enzyme release. The relative increase in PIIINP during streptokinase treatment was higher in those acute myocardial infarction patients with probable reperfusion than those with nonprobable reperfusion. Corresponding changes in PIIINP were not seen in the control group. Two days later there was a second increase in serum PIIINP for both patient groups. This change coincided with a similar increase in PICP. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that streptokinase, probably by activation of plasminogen to plasmin, stimulates the breakdown of type III collagen during thrombolytic therapy. This phenomenon may decrease the risk of rethrombosis of the affected artery if the exposed collagen is responsible for thrombosis formation, but it could also be involved in the development of hemorrhagic complications during thrombolytic therapy. The second increase in PIIINP levels probably indicates type III collagen synthesis of the infarcted area. This investigation represents a pilot study, and more studies on the effects of various thrombolytic agents on interstitial collagen metabolism are obviously needed. 
Molecular basis of an autoantibody-associated restriction fragment length polymorphism that confers susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. Recently, combined serological and molecular studies of autoantibodies have revealed that these antibodies play an important role in the normal function of the immune system and in the development of the B cell repertoire. Accordingly, we hypothesized that a homozygous deletion of a critical autoantibody-associated Ig variable (V) gene may alter the immune system and thus predispose the host to autoimmune disorders. Initial experiments revealed several restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of the Humhv3005 gene, that is likely to encode heavy chains of rheumatoid factors, and the closely related 1.9III gene. By probing EcoR1-digested DNA with the Humhv3005/P1 probe, we found that one of the four major hybridizing bands was missing in approximately 20% of patients with either rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, but only 2% of normal subjects. To delineate the genetic basis of this polymorphism, we have now employed the PCR to amplify and analyze hv3005, 1.9III, and homologous genes in individuals with characteristic RFLP genotypes. Our results indicate that the human Vh gene repertoire contains several hv3005- and 1.9III-like genes, and that a complete deletion of the hv3005-like genes is relatively restricted to a subset of autoimmune patients. These findings provide initial evidence for deletion of developmentally regulated autoreactive V genes in autoimmune diseases. 
Prognosis for recovery from prolonged posttraumatic unawareness: logistic analysis. This study reviews the course and outcome of 130 patients who remained in a state of prolonged unawareness 30 days after severe cranio-cerebral trauma. Prognostic indicators and outcome were fitted by a logistic model. The significant prognostic factors observable in the first week after trauma were found to be ventilatory status, motor reactivity and significant extraneural trauma. The significant prognostic factors after the first month of unawareness were early ventilatory status, early motor reactivity, late epilepsy and hydrocephalus. The estimated probability of recovery of awareness (that is, consciousness) ranged from 0.94 in patients with early decorticate posturing in the absence of both extraneural trauma and ventilatory disturbance to 0.06 in patients with flaccidity, extraneural trauma and ventilatory disturbance in the first week after injury. 
Antibiotic management of outpatients with endocarditis due to penicillin-susceptible streptococci. Thirty patients with endocarditis caused by penicillin-susceptible streptococci were enrolled in one of two groups in this study. Fifteen patients received ceftriaxone (2 g once daily) for 4 weeks; the other 15 received the same dosage of ceftriaxone for 2 weeks and then received oral amoxicillin (1 g four times a day) for 2 weeks. For the 27 patients treated predominantly as outpatients, 380 days of hospitalization were avoided. Clinical cure was achieved for all patients in both groups. We conclude that ceftriaxone, alone or followed by a course of amoxicillin, is an efficacious mode of treatment for infective endocarditis caused by penicillin-susceptible streptococci. Treatment with these agents can be administered predominantly on an outpatient basis. 
Endoscopic pulsed dye laser lithotripsy of gallbladder calculi in vivo. We have evaluated the efficacy and safety of pulsed dye laser lithotripsy of gallbladder calculi using a percutaneous endoscopic technique in a porcine model. Fragmentation was readily achieved in vivo. Using a combination of laser lithotripsy and saline lavage, complete removal of all stone debris was feasible through a 24 F tract (N = 3). However, the degree of fragmentation required rendered removal through a smaller tract inefficient, a mean 53% of stone mass being retrievable through a 16 F tract (N = 11). Repeated laser activation at 1 mm from the gallbladder mucosa produced minimal injury, regardless of pulse energy. When the laser fiber was pressed against the mucosa, perforation of the gallbladder was possible at therapeutic pulse energy, but this did not lead to clinical sequelae. We conclude that the pulsed dye laser is a safe and effective means of fragmenting gallbladder calculi in vivo. 
Temporal arteritis with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is used to differentiate temporal arteritis from other forms of headache in the elderly. Though temporal arteritis can occur with a normal ESR, this is not generally appreciated in primary care. The case reported here is a 74-year-old woman with biopsy-proven temporal arteritis; her ESR was 22 mm/hr. Of note, her hematocrit was more than 40 percent, a condition previously reported to be associated with temporal arteritis and a normal ESR. This discussion focuses on the diagnosis of temporal arteritis and its associated symptoms. 
Giant neuroendocrine (Merkel cell) carcinoma of the skin. An 82-year-old woman had a dark red to purple tumor on the left buttock that had gradually enlarged during the last 5 years. Although routine histologic examination was not sufficient for diagnosis, neuroendocrine carcinoma was diagnosed by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies. Immunohistochemical-positive reactions to neurofilament, cytokeratin, neuron-specific enolase, and epithelial membrane antigen were noted. Electron microscopically, membrane-bound, dense core granules that yielded a positive uranaffin reaction and intermediate filaments in the perinuclear area were observed in the cytoplasm of most tumor cells. Desmosome-like structure between them was also found. Approximately 6 months after local excision, metastatic lesions developed in the regional lymph nodes and liver. 
Short-bowel syndrome in children. Quality of life in an era of improved survival. A number of disorders in childhood can result in short-bowel syndrome (small bowel length, less than 100 cm). Improved care has increased survival in patients with short-bowel syndrome, but the quality-of-life factors associated with such improved survival have not been examined, to our knowledge. Sixteen consecutive pediatric patients with short-bowel syndrome (bowel length range, 22 to 98 cm) were followed up for 2 to 10 years. The original diagnoses were as follows: necrotizing enterocolitis (n = 6), multiple intestinal atresias (n = 4), extensive aganglionosis (n = 2), meconium peritonitis (n = 2), and midgut volvulus (n = 2). The range of initial hospitalization was from 62 to 395 days, and 13 of 16 patients have required readmission (two to 14 times). All patients required multiple operations (range, two to 14 operations), including combinations of venous access, adhesiolysis, tapering enteroplasty, reversed intestinal segments, and pull-through procedure. Nine of 16 patients received home total parenteral nutrition, and 12 of 16 patients required home elemental diets, usually via pump feedings. Fifteen patients (94%) survived. Two survivors are deaf, and one of these has mild developmental delay. Seven survivors (age range, 6 to 10 years) attend a regular school, four while receiving total parenteral nutrition or an elemental diet. Ten of 15 survivors are off all nutritional support (including the child with a 22-cm small bowel), with four others weaning. The presence or absence of an ileocecal valve did not affect outcome. Modern nutritional support methods provide excellent survival and quality of life for children with short-bowel syndrome. 
Observations on massive retrieved human allografts. Radiographic and histological studies of sixteen massive retrieved human allografts were carried out after the allografts had been in situ for four to sixty-five months. The studies demonstrated that union between the allograft and the host took place slowly at cortical-cortical junctions by the formation of an external callus derived from the cortex of the host, and it took place more rapidly at cancellous-cancellous junctions by internal callus advancing from the host into the allograft. Internal repair took place very slowly, was confined to the superficial surface and the ends of the graft, and had involved only 20 per cent of the graft by five years. The deep unrepaired portions of the graft retained their architecture, and where bone cement had been used to fix a prosthetic stem or an intramedullary rod to the allograft, there was no evidence of resorption of bone or loosening of the device. Soft tissues of the host became attached to the graft by deposition of a thin seam of new bone on the surface of the graft. A previous fracture of two grafts had healed before the time of retrieval. Analysis of the articular cartilage revealed no evidence that any chondrocytes had survived, even when the graft had been cryoprotected before it was preserved by freezing. The necrotic cartilage functioned well for as long as five years, and as it degenerated, it was covered by a pannus of fibrovascular reparative tissue. Two allografts that had been removed because of rejection were surrounded by an envelope of chronic inflammatory tissue that prevented union, adherence of soft tissue, and internal repair. Internal repair was more advanced about sites of fracture and adjacent to recurrent tumors than in other portions of the graft. These findings suggest that large frozen allografts in humans are osteoconductive rather than osteoinductive. 
Diagnostic accuracy of exercise thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with left bundle branch block. Recent reports have proposed that abnormal apical or anterior wall perfusion with exercise thallium-201 imaging may increase diagnostic accuracy for disease of the left anterior descending artery in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB). To evaluate these suggestions, 83 patients with LBBB who underwent thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography and coronary angiography within an interval of 3 months were retrospectively reviewed. There were 59 men and 24 women aged 33 to 84 years (mean 65). Myocardial perfusion to the apex, anterior wall and anterior septum were scored qualitatively by consensus of 2 experienced observers and by quantitative analysis in comparison with a normal data base. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of perfusion defects in these segments were then expressed according to angiographic findings. Significant stenosis of vessels within the left anterior descending artery territory was present in 38 patients. By receiver-operator characteristic analysis, a fixed or reversible defect within the apex by the qualitative method was the best criterion for coronary artery disease. However, although highly sensitive (79 and 85% by the qualitative and quantitative methods, respectively), an apical defect was neither specific (38 and 16%, respectively), nor accurate (57 and 46%, respectively). Perfusion abnormalities in the anterior wall and septum were also of limited diagnostic accuracy. Thus, modified interpretative criteria in patients with LBBB are not clinically useful in the assessment of left anterior descending artery disease. 
Inner ear deafness in Wegener's granulomatosis. Autoimmune deafness represents a heterogeneous group of disorders in which there is though to be inner ear and/or middle ear damage mediated by various immunological abnormalities. We describe a patient with Wegener's granulomatosis in whom there was evidence of significant inner ear damage caused by vasculitis, which was completely reversed by cyclophosphamide and prednisolone. We propose that Wegener's granulomatosis is a cause of autoimmune deafness. 
NIT-1, a pancreatic beta-cell line established from a transgenic NOD/Lt mouse. NOD/Lt mice harboring a hybrid rat insulin-promoter/SV40 large T-antigen gene spontaneously develop beta-cell adenomas. NIT-1 is a pancreatic beta-cell line established from one of these transgenic mice. Immunocytochemical staining of passage 18 cells showed most contained insulin, with less than 5% containing glucagon, and none containing pancreatic polypeptide or somatostatin. Glucagon content radioimmunoassayed in cell extracts was only 0.27% of the insulin content. Two-hour insulin secretion at 16.5 mM glucose was 638 ng/10(6) cells (41% of intracellular content) compared to only 1.3 ng glucagon (32% of intracellular content). Stimulated insulin secretion was consistently observed in response to 11 and 16.5 mM glucose between passages 11 and 19. At passage 19, both theophylline and tolbutamide stimulated insulin secretion at 5.5 mM glucose. Northern-blot analysis confirmed high levels of insulin mRNA but only trace glucagon mRNA and undetectable somatostatin mRNA. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced MHC class I RNA expression was correlated with markedly increased antigen expression at the cell surface. Similarly, a MHC-linked "occult" class I-like antigen detected by Cr release assay only after exposure of standard NOD/Lt islet cells to IFN-gamma was strongly induced by IFN-gamma in NIT-1 cells. Cell surface MHC class II antigen was not constitutively expressed on NIT-1 cells and could not be detected after IFN-gamma incubation, despite demonstration of IFN-gamma-induced Aa, Ab, and Li invariant-chain RNA transcripts. Similarly IFN-gamma induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (Icam-1) transcripts was not accompanied by demonstrable cell surface expression of ICAM-1 antigen. 
The frequency and significance of ECG changes after transurethral prostate resection. Although many clinicians routinely recommend a base-line preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) and obtain frequent postoperative ECGs to screen for myocardial infarction or ischemia, the diagnostic utility of screening perioperative ECGs is unknown. The present analysis evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of the perioperative ECG and examines its value as a predictor of early postoperative cardiac events and outcomes during the postoperative year. ECGs obtained preoperatively and on the first 3 postoperative days in 206 men undergoing transurethral prostate resection were analyzed using the Minnesota Code. The occurrence of cardiac events during the operative stay was assessed by measurement of the cardiospecific MB creatine kinase isoenzyme on the first 3 postoperative days and review of the entire clinical course. Twenty-one percent of patients developed postoperative ECG changes, mostly involving the T wave; none had cardiac symptoms or sustained creatine kinase MB elevation. Changes were not significantly more common in men known to have coronary disease. The single patient who had a perioperative myocardial infarction confirmed by enzymes had no codable ECG changes. The specificity of any ECG change for perioperative infarction was 78%; of ST segment changes only, 95%. Only one of the patients (2%) who had postoperative ECG changes had a cardiac event in the year after surgery. Routine perioperative ECGs is of little diagnostic/predictive utility in situations in which the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction is low. 
Niemann-Pick type B disease. Identification of a single codon deletion in the acid sphingomyelinase gene and genotype/phenotype correlations in type A and B patients. Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease both result from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase (E.C. 3.1.4.12). Type A Niemann-Pick disease is a severe neurodegenerative disorder of infancy which leads to death by three years of age, whereas Type B disease has a later age at onset, little or no neurologic involvement, and most patients survive into adulthood. To investigate the molecular basis for the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, the nature of the mutations causing Type B Niemann-Pick disease in Ashkenazi Jewish patients was determined. The entire acid sphingomyelinase coding region from an Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patient was polymerase chain reaction-amplified, subcloned, and completely sequenced. A three-base deletion was identified of nucleotides 1821-1823 in the cDNA which predicted the removal of an arginine residue from position 608 of the acid sphingomyelinase polypeptide (delta R608). The other cDNA clones from this patient had the R496L mutation previously identified in Type A Niemann-Pick disease patients. Both Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patients were heteroallelic for the delta R608 mutation, whereas this allele was not present in 15 unrelated non-Jewish Type B patients, with the notable exception of one mildly affected patient of Arabic descent who was homoallelic for the delta R608 mutation. These results indicate that the delta R608 mutation predicts the Type B Niemann-Pick disease phenotype, even in the presence of the R496L Type A allele, thereby providing the first genotype/phenotype correlation for this lysosomal storage disease. Although only two patients have been studied, it appears that the delta R608 mutation occurs frequently in Type B Niemann-Pick disease patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. 
Development of a highly specific and sensitive molecular probe for detection of cutaneous lymphoma. Using DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of a patient with mycosis fungoides, a highly specific and sensitive molecular probe for the malignant lymphoid cells of this patient was developed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to selectively amplify the region of the rearrangement of TCR-gamma genes. Randomly inserted nucleotides between rearranged segments (N-region) were used as a specific marker for the malignant lymphoid clone of this patient. Clonal cells in paraffin-embedded tissue of previous and later biopsies were detected. This technique provides a new and unique tool for retrospective detection of early evolving cutaneous lymphoma, as well as for detection of minimal residual and systemic disease. 
Intraoperative transesophageal Doppler color flow imaging used to guide patient selection and operative treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation. BACKGROUND. Intraoperative transesophageal Doppler color flow imaging (TDCF) affords the opportunity to assess mitral valve competency immediately before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of TDCF to assist in the selection and operative treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR). METHODS AND RESULTS. Two hundred forty-six patients undergoing surgery for ischemic heart disease were prospectively studied. All had preoperative cardiac catheterization. Catheterization and pre-CPB TDCF were discordant in their estimation of MR in 112 patients (46%). Compared with patients in whom both techniques agreed in estimation of MR, patients with discordance in MR were more likely to have had unstable clinical syndromes at the time of catheterization (79% versus 40%, p less than 0.05) or to have received thrombolytics (16% versus 8%, p less than 0.05). Pre-CPB TDCF resulted in a change in the operative plan with respect to the mitral valve in 27 patients (11%). Because less MR was found by TDCF than catheterization, 22 patients had only coronary bypass grafting when combined coronary bypass and mitral valve surgery had been planned. Because more MR was found by TDCF than catheterization, five patients had combined coronary bypass and mitral valve surgery when coronary bypass alone had been planned. Unsatisfactory results noted by TDCF following mitral valve surgery in five patients resulted in immediate corrective surgery. Cox regression analysis identified residual MR at the completion of surgery to be an important predictor of survival (chi 2 = 21.4) after surgery--more important than patient age (chi 2 = 8.3) or left ventricular ejection fraction (chi 2 = 5.3). CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that TDCF is useful in guiding patient selection and operative treatment of ischemic MR and that in such patients, intraoperative TDCF should be performed routinely. 
Special considerations in the physical exam of older patients. For diagnostic utility, aspects of the standard physical examination are modified for elderly patients. Special attention is paid to problems that interfere with function, such as gait disorders, incontinence, and hearing and visual loss. Certain findings in cardiac and pulmonary examinations of the elderly require different interpretations. The examination should include the head and neck, chest, back, abdomen, breasts and pelvic area in women, prostate in men, extremities, and skin, as well as mental status. A number of diagnostic maneuvers are used to distinguish changes of normal aging from those associated with disease. 
Thumbtack use for control of presacral bleeding, with description of an instrument for thumbtack application. There is well-known difficulty in controlling hemorrhage from presacral vessels. There are reports on the use of thumbtacks to secure hemostasis in the face of presacral hemorrhage. This communication reports the successful use of thumbtacks to establish presacral hemostasis and describes a simple instrument designed to afford easier and more precise anterior sacral application of thumbtacks. The instrument is easy to make. It was devised because of difficulty encountered with manual placement of hemostatic thumbtacks and the absence of totally satisfactory delivery by any of the standard surgical instruments available. 
Suburethral paraganglioma. Masses presenting beneath the urethra are not uncommon. Besides ureteral diverticula, which account for the vast majority of these masses, a multiplicity of heterogeneous benign and malignant tumors have been encountered in this region. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of a neuroendocrine tumor, a paraganglioma, discovered in the anatomical compartment between the urethra and vagina. When evaluating a patient with a suburethral mass, it is important to consider paraganglioma as part of the differential diagnosis because unwitting surgical removal of a functional catecholamine-secreting tumor may precipitate a severe hypotensive episode and/or death. 
The use of anterior Caspar plate fixation in acute cervical spine injury. Optimal management of cervical cord injury in the presence of documented instability and/or compression of neural elements remains a controversial topic. Surgery and internal stabilization of cervical spine fracture/dislocations are effective and well accepted, but controversy exists on the relative merits of the anterior versus the posterior approach as well as the optimal timing of surgical intervention. We report our experience with the Caspar technique and instrumentation for anterior stabilization in 54 patients for acute cervical spine injury. Our series consists of 38 male and 16 female patients whose ages ranged from 16 to 68 years, with a mean age of 29.2 years. Thirty-two of these patients had complete neurological sensory/motor deficits at the time of presentation, eight were neurologically intact, and 14 had preservation of some motor and sensory function. All 54 patients had radiographic evidence of posterior instability as well as anterior disruption of either a vertebral body or intervertebral disk. We found that "early" intervention (less than 24 hours after injury) was performed frequently in the neurologically compromised patients. Twelve of the 22 patients undergoing surgery less than 24 hours after admission regained significant neurological function, with 13 of 22 developing postoperative complications. In the "delayed" group (surgery more than 24 hours after injury, mean 14.3 days), 14 patients experienced postoperative complications, with 15 of 24 demonstrating neurological improvement. The eight patients who were intact did uniformly well. There was no mortality during the follow-up. All 54 patients showed a solid fusion (clinically and radiologically) within 6 months of surgery. In two cases the plates had to be removed, without risking the fusion. Our experience suggests that although anterior cervical fusion and Caspar plating remain appropriate for patients with documented anterior compromise of the canal, it should not substitute for more traditional posterior stabilization procedures. Because this route has the potential for more serious complications, it should be reserved for the cases in which anterior decompression is deemed necessary or posterior fusion was unsuccessful. With appropriate selection of patients, no adverse effect of early surgery was demonstrated. In fact, neurologically compromised patients had the benefits of increased ease of patient care and early transfer to rehabilitation. 
Open, double-blind and long-term study of vigabatrin in chronic epilepsy. We performed an open, double-blind, and long-term study of vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl-GABA, GVG) in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy who were receiving only one or at most two standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The novel design included a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase that minimized the number of patients receiving placebo and allowed determination of the optimum dose of GVG for each patient before initiation of the double-blind phase. The study was divided into four phases. The first phase was a 6-week period of baseline observation. In the second phase, GVG was added openly to previous AEDs for 8 weeks. During the first 2 weeks of this phase, the dose of GVG was increased weekly and then, in the absence of adverse effects, was held constant for the next 6 weeks. At the end of this open phase, seizure frequency during the 6 weeks of constant treatment was compared with the baseline seizure frequency for each patient. Patients who experienced reduction greater than 50% in the frequency of any seizure type during the open phase were defined as responders. These responders were then entered into the third and double-blind phase, in which they were randomly allocated wither to continue active GVG treatment or placebo for 8 weeks. Thirty-three patients entered the study; 31 of 33 patients completed the initial open phase. Twenty patients achieved a reduction greater than or equal to 50% in the frequency of one or more seizure types and were eligible for the double-blind phase; 10 were randomized to continue GVG and 10 were randomized to placebo. 
Spatial contrast sensitivity is reduced in bilateral Parkinson's disease. We studied the contrast sensitivity functions of 41 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) with a wide range of parkinsonian symptomatology (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 to 4) and 22 age-matched control subjects in a parametric design. Results demonstrated reduced contrast sensitivity in PD patients but only in those patients who had progressed beyond Hoehn and Yahr stage 1. Furthermore, there were deficits in contrast sensitivity related to the severity of PD. 
Proliferation of normal breast epithelial cells as shown by in vivo labeling with bromodeoxyuridine. The proliferative activity of normal acinar and ductal breast epithelial cells was studied by in vivo labeling with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) in 26 cases with concurrent breast carcinoma. The BrdUrd-labeled cells were recognized in histologic sections of paraffin-embedded tissue, using an anti-BrdUrd antibody and an immunoperoxidase reaction. The percentage of BrdUrd-labeled cells showed great variability for both acinar (0% to 2.66%; mean, 0.70%; standard deviation [SD], 0.80%) and ductal cells (0% to 1.99%; mean, 0.51%; SD, 0.57%). The fraction of proliferating epithelial cells declined with the age of the patients and was significantly higher in premenopausal women (1.16% +/- 0.85% for acinar and 0.94% +/- 0.60% for ductal cells) as compared with the postmenopausal women (0.27% +/- 0.46% for acinar and 0.17% +/- 0.22% for ductal cells), P less than 0.01 for acinar and P less than 0.001 for ductal cells, respectively. In some patients, great variability in distribution of proliferating acinar and ductal cells among different lobules and ducts was observed. No difference was found in the number of proliferating acinar and ductal cells situated near or far from their corresponding tumors. No correlation was seen between cell proliferation of normal acinar or ductal cells and cell proliferation of the respective tumors. 
The safety of intraaortic balloon pump catheter insertion through suprainguinal prosthetic vascular bypass grafts. To determine the safety of intraaortic balloon pump catheter insertion for critical coronary ischemia through suprainguinal prosthetic bypass grafts, we examined our experience of 19 intraaortic balloon pumps placed through grafts in 17 patients by means of surgical exposure (8) or the percutaneous (11) approach. Fourteen intraaortic balloon pumps were placed through matured grafts at a time remote (2 to 13 years; mean, 7 years) from their vascular bypass surgery. Five were inserted through nonmatured grafts during the same hospitalization as their vascular reconstructive surgery (1 to 12 days; mean, 4 days). One patient, a day after an aortoiliac bypass, died during an urgent, surgical intraaortic balloon pump insertion for cardiogenic shock. All other patients had prompt reversal of their cardiac ischemia. Decreased limb perfusion developed during use of the intraaortic balloon pump in three patients, all of whom had their intraaortic balloon pump placed percutaneously through mature grafts. Two of these required surgical thrombectomy. Ten intraaortic balloon pump insertions in eight patients survived the hospitalization and were followed for a mean of 24 months (range, 2 weeks to 64 months). No localized groin or graft infections were identified. No bleeding complications or pseudoaneurysms occurred. Thus in patients with unstable, severe, cardiac disease, intraaortic balloon pumps can be safely placed through indwelling suprainguinal bypass grafts. 
Vasculitis. A practical approach to management. Vasculitis encompasses a wide variety of diseases. Because diagnosis may be difficult, a careful evaluation is essential, including a detailed patient history, thorough physical examination, and appropriate laboratory studies. Diagnosis is based on clinicopathologic features that permit identification of the condition. Biopsies are often necessary to confirm a diagnosis. It is important to accurately categorize the vasculitic disorders, since prompt, aggressive therapy with potentially toxic drugs is necessary to avoid irreversible organ system dysfunction. 
Family and peer issues among adolescents with spina bifida and cerebral palsy. Increasingly, children with disabling conditions are surviving through childhood into adolescence and beyond. This places increased importance on understanding adolescent, family, and peer relationships, which are critical to healthy development among adolescents in general and to transitions to successful adulthood among youths with physical disabilities in particular. The purpose of this study was to identify the patterns of family and peer interactions. One hundred two youths with spina bifida and 60 adolescents with cerebral palsy between the ages of 12 and 22 completed written psychological measures as well as an in-depth structured interview. Approximately 90% of youths with spina bifida and cerebral palsy resided at home, of whom 80.4% and 72% lived with both parents. Almost without exception, parental relationships were defined as positive, with no difference of attitude noted toward the mother and father. Relationships with parents for teenagers with spina bifida were marked by high levels of dependence on parents for personal care such as bowel programs and, for both groups, low levels of responsibility at home and lack of discussion with parents about sexuality or menstruation. Although friends were viewed as very important by most respondents (approximately 83%), relationships were characterized by extremely limited out-of-school contacts, negligible participation with organized social activities, and a primary orientation toward sedentary activities. Finally, regarding heterosexual relationships, whereas 44.1% of respondents with spina bifida and 54.2% of respondents with cerebral palsy said their friends dated, only 14.7% and 28.3% of study participants indicated that they had ever been on a date and, even for those teenagers, heterosexual social contacts were infrequent. 
Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. Since 1985, 57 patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal (GE) junction have undergone surgical resection. In this group, 16 of the tumors arose in a Barrett's esophagus. There was a significant predilection toward white men above the age of 55 (15/16; 94%) in this subgroup. The mean proximal extent of abnormal columnar involvement was 5.4 cm above the gastroesophageal junction (range 2.5 to 11 cm). The mean location of the neoplasm centered in the distal esophagus 1.8 +/- 0.5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction. During the same time period, 30 patients with Barrett's esophagus were seen without associated adenocarcinoma. There were no statistical differences in the proximal extent of columnar involvement or the presence of reflux symptoms between the two groups. There were no significant differences in age, smoking history, and alcohol consumption between patients with benign or malignant Barrett's esophagus as compared to those with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction not associated with Barrett's mucosa. The marked male predominance seen in the group with malignant Barrett's esophagus was in contrast to the benign cases (16/30; 53%) but was similar to the adenocarcinoma group, without recognized Barrett's esophagus (38/41; 93%). The mean location of the tumor in the latter was 0.9 +/- 1.2 cm above the gastroesophageal junction and was comparable to the location in the group with Barrett's adenocarcinoma. The 4-year survival rate of patients in the non-Barrett's adenocarcinoma group is approximately 30%. Of those with Barrett's adenocarcinoma, the present 4-year survival rate is 60%. The demographic and morphometric similarities between the Barrett's and non-Barrett's adenocarcinoma groups may be of primary importance in determining the true clinical prevalence of Barrett's adenocarcinoma. Our findings suggest that the sensitivity of endoscopic surveillance may be improved if biopsy specimens are concentrated within the distal 3 cm of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction. Finally, the reason for the current difference in survival between the Barrett's and non-Barrett's adenocarcinoma groups is uncertain but may be related to endoscopic surveillance permitting earlier diagnosis and treatment. 
Selective peripheral denervation for torticollis: preliminary results Herein we report the preliminary results in nine patients who have undergone selective peripheral denervation for spasmodic torticollis and have been followed up for at least 13 months. All patients had improvement immediately after surgical intervention, and the results have been maintained in five patients. In one patient who had recurrent torticollis, a second procedure in conjunction with injection of botulinum toxin has produced substantial improvement; however, follow-up was brief (6 months). No surgical complications occurred. We believe that selective peripheral denervation is safe and that it can benefit patients with torticollis who have not responded to other types of therapy. These favorable results confirm other published reports on the efficacy of selective peripheral denervation. Long-term follow-up, however, is necessary for determining the role of this procedure in the management of torticollis. 
Hemodynamics in the prone jackknife position during surgery. We examined the hemodynamic changes occurring with prone jackknife positioning during colorectal surgery. The operative procedure was restorative proctocolectomy with ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis in five patients with adenomatosis coli and six patients with ulcerative colitis and anoabdominal resection of the rectum with colonic J-pouch anal anastomosis in eight patients with rectal cancer. Nineteen patients (10 men and 9 women aged 41 +/- 19 years) were monitored with arterial and Swan-Ganz catheters during positioning. Measurements were obtained in the supine and prone positions (1 minute, 3 minutes), and the jackknife position (1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes), as well as before and after adoption of the Lloyd-Davies position (1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes). Turning the patient from the supine position to the prone position resulted in a significant decrease in the cardiac index (CI). However, following head-down rotation, the CI increased and returned to the value seen in the supine position (p less than 0.05). Heart rate (HR) slowed and mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased in the prone jackknife position. We concluded that the extent of the changes in cardiac function presented no serious problems. 
The effect of endoscopic laser therapy on survival in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Further experience. Although endoscopic laser therapy is effective for symptom palliation in esophageal cancer, few studies have investigated its effect on survival. We previously reported a 300% improvement in survival in 10 patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus after endoscopic Nd:YAG laser energy. We now report a study to determine if the survival advantage persisted after treating an additional 26 patients. Thirty-six patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus treated with endoscopic laser therapy were compared to 20 controls identified by our hospital Tumor Registry. There was no difference between the groups with respect to age, sex, race, location of tumor, or clinical stage. More control patients (25%) had previously undergone surgery than laser patients (0%) (p less than 0.05). Survival analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (p less than 0.05), with an improvement in median survival from 5.7 to 9.7 months (p less than 0.05). One-year survival was 38% in laser patients, compared to 20% in control patients. Our experience continues to demonstrate that endoscopic laser therapy is effective in prolonging life as well as palliating the symptoms of patients with squamous-cell esophageal carcinoma. 
Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome: megalencephaly and heterotopic gray matter. A 3-month-old white male with linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS), facial deformities, brain malformations, and cortical blindness is presented. Facial deformities included left ear hypertrophy and a left-sided hamartomatous neck mass. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested that a central nervous system (CNS) abnormality, involving gray and white matter, should be linked with LNSS. Magnetic resonance imaging was more useful than computed tomography in demonstrating the full spectrum of CNS anomalies, including unilateral lissencephaly, a paucity of white matter, excessive and heterotopic gray matter, apparent left schizencephaly, and unilateral left colpocephaly (dilation of atrium and posterior horn of lateral ventricle). Postmortem examination revealed left hemisphere megalencephaly with a dilated posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The impressive gray matter heterotopias likely were the source of the patient's seizures and perhaps the ultimate cause of death. Megalencephaly and other deviations of neuronal migration should be considered as a dramatic component of LNSS. 
Evaluation and treatment of aneurysms of the vertebral artery: different strategies for different lesions. Aneurysms of the vertebral artery and its branches are relatively uncommon lesions. Their anatomy and presentation can be quite variable. A spectrum of aneurysms of the vertebral artery is presented to illustrate the neuroradiological evaluation, surgical treatment, and perioperative management of these complex lesions. 
Autoimmune Addison's disease and thyrotoxic thyroiditis presenting as encephalopathy in twins. An 11 year old boy who presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms including delirium and pronounced agitation was found to have simultaneous onset of autoimmune adrenocortical insufficiency and hyperthyroidism. His identical twin also had hyperthyroidism and six months later developed symptoms of adrenocortical insufficiency. In children presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms, adrenal (or pituitary) and other endocrine disorders should be considered. 
Evidence for WT1 as a Wilms tumor (WT) gene: intragenic germinal deletion in bilateral WT. The inactivation of two alleles at a locus on the short arm of chromosome 11 (band 11p13) has been suggested to be critical steps in the development of Wilms tumor (WT), a childhood kidney tumor. Two similar candidate WT cDNA clones (WT33 and LK15) have recently been identified on the basis of both their expression in fetal kidney and their location within the smallest region of overlap of somatic 11p13 deletions in some tumors. These homozygous deletions, however, are large and potentially affect more than one gene. Using a cDNA probe to the candidate gene, we have analyzed DNA from both normal and tumor tissue from WT patients, in an effort to detect rearrangements at this locus. We report here a patient with bilateral WT who is heterozygous for a small (less than 11 kb) germinal deletion within this candidate gene. DNA from both tumors is homozygous for this intragenic deletion allele, which, by RNA-PRC sequence analysis, is predicted to encode a protein truncated by 180 amino acids. These data support the identification of this locus as an 11p13 WT gene (WT1) and provide direct molecular data supporting the two-hit mutational model for WT. 
Membranous nephropathy related to hepatitis B virus in adults. BACKGROUND. The natural course of adult hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related membranous nephropathy in areas where HBV infection is endemic (characterized by vertical and horizontal transmission of HBV in early childhood) has not been fully defined. METHODS. We evaluated the clinical features, pathological findings, serologic profiles, therapeutic responses, and prognoses of 21 patients with adult-onset HBV-related membranous nephropathy. The patients were followed for a mean of 60 months (range, 12 to 108). Only patients with evidence of glomerular capillary deposition of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in a renal-biopsy specimen were included. RESULTS. The clinical features and serologic studies suggested that the patients had acquired chronic HBV infection in early childhood; moreover, other causes of membranous nephropathy had been excluded. All were seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen and had high titers of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen at first clinical presentation. HBeAg was detected in the serum of 17 patients (81 percent), yet only 3 had even slightly increased plasma alanine aminotransferase levels. The clinical response to therapy with interferon alfa was disappointing; only one of the five patients treated had a complete remission with seroconversion to antibody to HBeAg. Contrary to reports of studies in children, spontaneous remission of the nephrotic syndrome or proteinuria was uncommon in the adults with HBV-related membranous nephropathy whom we studied. Proteinuria and HBV antigenemia persisted in untreated patients. During the follow-up period, 29 percent of the patients had progressive renal failure and 10 percent required maintenance dialysis therapy. CONCLUSIONS. The course of HBV-related membranous nephropathy in adults in areas where HBV is endemic is not benign. Regardless of treatment, the disease has a slowly but relentlessly progressive clinical course in approximately one third of patients. 
Bilateral nephrectomy before transplantation: indications, surgical approach, morbidity and mortality. Forty patients with end-stage renal failure, who had undergone simultaneous bilateral native nephrectomy before a subsequent renal transplant operation, were reviewed with particular reference to the indications and surgical approach for bilateral nephrectomy and to the complications of the procedure. The main indications for bilateral nephrectomy are hypertension resistant to medical therapy, persistent symptomatic renal infection, severe renal protein loss and occasionally polycystic kidneys or bilateral renal tumours. In this consecutive series of 40 patients both kidneys were removed because of chronic pyelonephritis with reflux (n = 28), glomerulonephritis with reflux (n = 9) and uncontrolled hypertension (n = 3). Surgical morbidity was less in patients who had bilateral nephrectomy performed through bilateral vertical lumbotomy incisions. There was no surgical mortality. 
Effect of i.v. midazolam on the ventilatory response to sustained hypoxia in man. The ventilatory response to isocapnic, sustained hypoxia is characterized by initial hyperventilation followed by ventilatory decline. The ventilatory response to isocapnic sustained hypoxia during i.v. administration of midazolam was assessed in five healthy subjects. Compared with control experiments, the hyperventilatory effect of hypoxia was not decreased following administration of midazolam. The hypoxic ventilatory change was significantly greater with midazolam because of a decrease in tidal volume. 
Hypertension as a risk factor for renal disease. Review of clinical and epidemiological evidence Renal failure is a well-recognized complication of accelerated and malignant hypertension that can be prevented by appropriate antihypertensive therapy. The risk of renal disease in patients with milder forms of hypertension is less certain. Death certificate, insurance industry, and community-based observational studies provide little information with respect to the risk of kidney damage in the hypertensive patient. Randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive drug therapy provide equivocal results. The strongest evidence in support of the hypothesis that mild hypertension increases the risk of subsequent renal disease comes from analyses of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program and the Medicare End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Program. The risk of blood pressure-related ESRD appears to be especially high in blacks, independent of age, sex, and prevalence of hypertension. Although these results need to be confirmed, the data raise the possibility that the effects of high blood pressure on the kidney are different in blacks than in whites. Based on current trends, it is projected that the number of beneficiaries in the Medicare ESRD Program will continue to increase during the next 30-40 years and that the diagnosis of hypertensive ESRD will become increasingly common. Additional studies to characterize the relation between mild hypertension and subsequent risk of renal disease and to confirm the corresponding benefits of antihypertensive therapy are urgently needed. 
Sudden cardiac death: management of high-risk patients Sudden cardiac death remains a leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 350,000 deaths each year, and the survival rate of victims remains low. Most survivors face a significant risk for recurrence. The typical substrate is chronic--abnormal myocardium with fibrosis (often from previous myocardial infarction) and left ventricular dysfunction. Acute triggers for sudden cardiac death are primarily electrical, ischemic, metabolic, neurohormonal, and pharmacologic. In most electrocardiographically documented cases of sudden cardiac death, the trigger-substrate interaction appears to result in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. After initial resuscitation, survivors need a thorough cardiovascular evaluation, including definition of coronary anatomy, left ventricular function, and wall-motion abnormalities, as well as an electrophysiologic evaluation. An attempt must be made to determine what each survivor's correctable triggers are. Management should address all reversible triggers, such as acute ischemia and electrolyte abnormalities, and should include modifying or correcting the arrhythmogenic substrate. Empiric antiarrhythmic therapy offers no advantage in such modification. Pharmacologic therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs should be guided by an objective therapeutic endpoint, which is best accomplished through the use of programmed ventricular stimulation and serial electrophysiologic studies. Other therapeutic options include surgical suppression of ventricular tachycardia and implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator. 
Myocardial protection with Hamburg oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution for multiple coronary bypass and multivalvular replacement. We evaluated myocardial protection with Hamburg oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution in a double study. Part I was a prospective metabolic study, measuring myocardial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate (CP) contents before and after ischemia in 30 coronary bypass (CABG) patients. During ischemia, CP levels decreased significantly, whereas ATP did not. After 10 minute of reperfusion, mean ATP contents were 90% of preischemic values and CP levels increased to 85% of preischemic values. Spontaneous myocardial defibrillation was seen in 93.3% of patients. Part II included evaluation of early postischemic myocardial function in 228 patients, 48 with multiple valve replacement (MUVR) and 180 with CABG. Spontaneous myocardial defibrillation was seen in 90.3%. Cardiac index, measured before and 1 and 12 hours after surgery, increased significantly in the postischemic period (from 1.95 +/- 0.9 to 2.5 +/- 0.7 l/min m2 in MUVR, p 0.04; from 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 2.7 +/- 0.7 l/min/m2 in CABG, p 0.01). Myocardial infarction frequency was 3% among CABG patients, and unrelated to the number of distal anastomosis or to aortic cross-clamp time. Early postoperative mortality was 6.2% for MUVR and 0.5% for CABG. Thus, oxygenated cardioplegia with Hamburg solution preserves high-energy phosphate compounds and prevents ischemic injury, with excellent short-term clinical results. 
Argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions and alpha-fetoprotein in adenomatous hyperplasia in human cirrhotic livers. Recently, adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) of the liver has been suspected as a precancerous lesion in human hepatocarcinogenesis. The authors examined 75 cases of AH from 42 cirrhotic livers, using staining of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs). These reflect proliferative cell activity. Findings in AH were compared with those seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other chronic liver diseases. Expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was also examined immunohistochemically. The authors classified AH into three types: ordinary (OAH), atypical (AAH), and AH with focal malignancy (FM). OAH implies a lack of atypia; AAH represents AH with structural and cellular atypia but without the features of overt carcinoma; and FM denotes AH with foci of overt HCC. Forty of the 75 cases of AH were categorized as OAH, 19 as AAH, and 16 as FM. The noncancerous areas of FM had features of AAH. The mean number of AgNORs in AH was intermediate between that seen in cirrhosis (2.93) and HCC (6.18) and showed a step-wise increase in the following order: OAH (2.95), AAH (3.89), noncancerous areas in FM (4.58), and malignant foci in FM (5.71). There was no significant difference in AgNOR counts between OAH and cirrhosis. AgNOR counts in AAH and FM were significantly higher than those of OAH, and lower than those of HCC. AFP was positive in 12 of 25 HCCs and in malignant foci of 3 FM lesions, but it was absent in OAH and AAH. These data suggest that OAH has a limited capacity for proliferation but that AAH and FM are much more replicative. The latter two conditions are probably preneoplastic lesions or early forms of HCC. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma in Italian patients with cirrhosis BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Patients with cirrhosis of the liver are recognized as being at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. The magnitude of the risk, the natural history of this disease, and the possibilities for detecting potentially curable tumors in patients in the Western world are unknown. To address these questions, we examined 447 Italian patients with well-compensated cirrhosis (which was of viral origin in 62 percent of them) from 1985 through 1990, performing serum alpha-fetoprotein assays and real-time ultrasonography every 3 to 12 months. RESULTS. Hepatocellular carcinoma was found in 30 patients (7 percent) at base line and in another 29 patients (7 percent of 417 patients free of tumor at base line) during follow-up periods averaging 33 months (range, 1 to 48). The cumulative hazard of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma during follow-up was higher among patients with persistently elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein levels (12 with tumors among 42 with such levels) than among those with fluctuating levels (11 among 82) or those with consistently normal levels (6 among 255). Only 17 patients had potentially operable tumors. The proportion of potentially operable tumors among those detected during follow-up was significantly lower than the proportion at enrollment (4 of 29 vs. 13 of 30, P = 0.027). The survival at one year of the 12 patients who underwent surgery was 67 percent, and the tumor-recurrence rate was 60 percent. Outcome was not appreciably different for the five patients who refused surgery. CONCLUSIONS. In the West, as in Asia, patients with cirrhosis of the liver are at substantial risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, with a yearly incidence rate of 3 percent. Our screening program did not appreciably increase the rate of detection of potentially curable tumors. 
Dual modulation of 5-fluorouracil using leucovorin and hydroxyurea. A phase I trial. Oral hydroxyurea (HU) was added to a regimen of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus leucovorin (LCV) administered as a continuous 24-hour infusion for 14 days. A previous report of the 5-FU plus LCV infusion established optimal dosages of 200 mg/m2/d and 5 mg/m2/d, respectively, for each agent. Oral HU was added to the regimen in total dosages of 0.5 g/d, 1.0 g/d, 1.5 g/d, or 2.0 g/d. Twenty-two patients received a total of 45 courses of treatment. Stomatitis was the dose-limiting side effect; it occurred in 3 of 14 courses with HU at 0.5 g/d (21%) and 9 of 17 courses with HU at 1.0 g/d (53%). Dosage escalation to 1.5 g/d or 2.0 g/d was possible in only 3 of 22 patients (17%). The median time to stomatitis was 10 days (range, 7 to 12 days). One response was observed in this heavily pretreated population. Phase II trials of HU plus LCV dual modulation of infusional 5-FU should use initial HU dosages of 0.5 g/d for the 14-day regimen described, with dose escalation as tolerated. Variable oral absorption presumably accounts for the small group of patients who can tolerate the higher doses of HU. 
Preservation of urine voiding and sexual function after rectal cancer surgery In order to decrease the urinary and sexual morbidity which follows radical pelvic lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer, we began selective preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerves. Between 1985 and 1987, 134 patients with rectal cancer underwent a curative resection (52 abdominoperineal resections, 82 sphincter-saving resections) with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy and selective pelvic autonomic nerve preservation (PANP). PANP was classified into five degrees depending on the extent of pelvic dissection. First-degree PANP indicates complete preservation of the nerves; second-degree PANP indicates destruction of the hypogastric plexus: third-degree PANP indicates partial preservation of the pelvic autonomic plexus; fourth-degree PANP indicates bilateral or unilateral preservation of only the fourth pelvic parasympathetic nerve; and fifth-degree PANP indicates complete destruction of the pelvic autonomic nerves. Most patients with first-degree PANP were able to spontaneously void 7-10 days following the operation. However, 78 percent (28/36) of patients with fifth-degree PANP had not regained bladder sensation by the third postoperative week and were discharged with an indwelling catheter; 58 percent (21/36) had not regained bladder sensation by the 60th postoperative day. The cystometric data indicate a progressive decline in bladder sensation and function with increasingly extensive pelvic dissection. However, preservation of only the fourth parasympathetic nerve (fourth-degree PANP) resulted in partial sparing of bladder sensation and voiding function. Evaluation of sexual function in males under 60 years of age revealed that only 31 percent (12/39) recovered erectile function and only 19 percent (6/39) recovered normal ejaculatory function in the first postoperative year. Most of these patients had complete preservation of their pelvic autonomic plexus (i.e., first-degree PANP). Four patients with partial PANP have recovered erectile function. Complete PANP is the best way to prevent urinary and sexual morbidity after rectal resection. The opposing goals of maximizing the chance for cure and minimizing morbidity must be individualized and balanced in each patient. Our data demonstrate that it is now possible to perform radical pelvic lymphadenectomy in the majority of patients with advanced rectal cancer with a minimum of voiding dysfunction. Preservation of sexual function in males is more difficult and depends on complete PANP and, as such, should be restricted to the group of patients with Dukes' A and B carcinomas. 
Comparison of the combined effects of atropine and neostigmine with atropine and edrophonium on the lower oesophageal sphincter. In two groups (n = 11) of healthy patients, we have measured gastric, lower oesophageal and barrier pressures before and after antagonism of neuromuscular block during anaesthesia with nitrous oxide and isoflurane. In one group, atropine 1.2 mg and neostigmine 2.5 mg were given and in the second group atropine 0.6 mg with edrophonium 1 mg/kg. One minute after administration of the reversal agents, there was a significantly greater reduction in barrier pressures in the neostigmine and atropine group than in the edrophonium and atropine group, but subsequently, there was no significant difference between the two groups. We conclude that there is no clinical difference between the two reversal mixtures in terms of the risk of regurgitation in the immediate period after reversal. 
Hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia: specific findings at dynamic contrast-enhanced US with carbon dioxide microbubbles. Dynamic contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) with intraarterial infusion of carbon dioxide microbubbles was performed for four cases of histologically proved focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in four patients and for 167 cases of various hepatic nodules in 144 patients. No complications due to dynamic US were observed in any of the 148 patients. All FNH nodules were less than 3 cm in diameter. Consistent specific findings of FNH were not obtained with US, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, radiocolloid scanning, or angiography in the four cases of FNH. In contrast, the characteristic vascular pattern (ie, early central hypervascular supply with centrifugal filling to the periphery at the arterial phase and a uniform or lobulated dense stain at the capillary phase) was observed in all four cases of FNH with dynamic US. This vascular pattern demonstrated in FNH with dynamic US was not seen in any of the 167 hepatic nodules, including 44 small hepatocellular carcinomas less than 3 cm in diameter. Therefore, the newly developed, dynamic contrast-enhanced US technique seems to be extremely sensitive and specific for diagnosing FNH and is useful in the differentiation of FNH from other hepatic tumors, especially hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of neural cell adhesion molecules. Differential expression in small round cell tumors of childhood and adolescence. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was discovered in a search for cell surface antigens of chicken neurons that contribute to cell adhesion and pattern formation during development. Homologous adhesion molecules have been identified in several species, including humans. In this immunohistochemical study, the authors examine the role of human NCAM in tumor diagnosis. The authors used a monoclonal antibody (MAb), 5.1H11, to examine NCAM immunoreactivity in frozen sections of more than 450 tumors, including more than 80 small round cell tumors (SRCT) of childhood and adolescence (neuroblastomas, Ewing's sarcomas [ES], peripheral neuroepitheliomas [PN], primitive neuroectodermal tumors [PNET], esthesioneuroblastomas, malignant ectomesenchymoma, medulloblastomas, small cell osteosarcomas, mesenchymal chondrosarcomas, embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, and lymphomas). The authors show that 1) neuroblastomas and primary brain tumors are NCAM+; 2) ES, most PN/PNETs, and melanomas are NCAM-; 3) embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas and various other sarcomas are NCAM+; 4) neuroendocrine tumors are NCAM+; 5) subsets of carcinomas of kidney, ovary, lung and other organs are NCAM+; and 6) lymphoid tumors are NCAM-. Tests with normal fetal and adult tissues indicate that these findings reflect only in part the NCAM phenotypes of corresponding normal tissues. Notably the NCAM- phenotype of ES and PN/PNET is not explained by current histogenetic models for these tumors, which suggest a primitive neuroectodermal origin. Finally the authors show that NCAM expression among SRCT has an inverse relationship with the expression of p30/32MIC2, a cell surface antigen of ES and PN/PNET detected with MAb HBA71. These results suggest that immunohistochemical assays for NCAM and p30/32MIC2 expression may aid in the further characterization of SRCT of childhood and adolescence. 
Effects of distention and short-term grafting on vasoreactivity in rabbit external jugular veins. The relative effects of distention, intraluminal pressure, and wall tension on venous smooth muscle and endothelial cell function were examined in 40 external jugular veins from New Zealand white rabbits. Vein grafts (n = 5) were interposed in the common carotid artery and explanted after 10 minutes. Distended veins were inflated in vitro with modified Krebs' solution at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes at pressures of either 20 mm Hg (D-20; n = 5) or 80 mm Hg (D-80; n = 5). Externally supported veins (ES-80; n = 5) were inflated at 80 mm Hg pressure, but distention was prevented by covering with a 3 mm internal diameter polytetrafluoroethylene sleeve. Bradykinin-induced in vitro maximal tension was attenuated significantly in vein grafts (0.13 +/- 0.04 g) and D-80 rings (0.27 +/- 0.07 g) compared with D-20 rings (1.20 +/- 0.14 g), ES-80 rings (0.99 +/- 0.13 g), or nondistended control rings (n = 40; 1.19 +/- 0.10 g; p less than 0.001). The attenuation in contraction in the vein graft and D-80 groups was nonspecific (i.e., similar results were obtained with respect to other smooth muscle agonists). Contractile function was inversely associated with wall tension, the product of pressure and radius (r2 = 0.7438; p = 0.06). In contrast, there were no differences in endothelium-dependent or endothelium-independent relaxation among the five groups. It is concluded that, in this experimental system, (1) venous smooth muscle function is significantly attenuated after short-term in vitro distention or grafting although endothelial function is largely preserved, and (2) the decrement in contraction is due to elevated wall tension. 
Differential effects of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-II on the expression of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) in a rat neuroblastoma cell line: isolation and characterization of two forms of IGFBP-4. The isolation and hormonal regulation of two low molecular weight insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) present in the conditioned medium (CM) of the rat neuroblastoma cell line B104 cells has been performed. IGFBPs were purified by ZnSO4 precipitation, insulin-like growth factor-I 1IGF-I) affinity chromatography, and reverse phase HPLC. Final isolation and N-terminal analysis was accomplished by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and sequencing of the bound proteins. Two IGFBPs, with apparent Mr of 28K and 24K were coisolated and sequenced. Both proteins had identical N-terminal sequences and appear to be two forms of IGFBP-4. Treatment of the IGFBPs with endoglycosidase-F caused a shift in the apparent Mr of the 28K IGFBP to 24K. However, there was no change in the apparent Mr of the 24K IGFBP. The data from this study suggest that the IGFBP-4 exists as both a glycosylated and nonglycosylated protein. Treatment of B104 cells with IGF-I increased the expression of both the 24K and 28K IGFBPs and also resulted in the appearance of IGFBP-3 and an unknown IGFBP at 29K. When added to subconfluent cells, IGF-I was also mitogenic in B104 cells. Similar to IGF-I, IGF-II treatment increased cell number and resulted in the appearance of IGFBP-3 and the 29K IGFBP. However, IGF-II treatment resulted in a significant decrease (approximately 50%) in the 24K IGFBP and also decreased the 28K IGFBP. This decrease in the expression of the 24K and 28K IGFBPs was dose-dependent and was blocked by addition of IGF-I to the cells. When an IGF-II receptor antibody was added to the cells it mimicked the effects of IGF-II on B104 cells, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of IGF-II are mediated through the type II IGF receptor. Although both IGF-I and IGF-II affected the amount of the 24K IGFBP in the CM, neither peptide affected the expression of the messenger RNA for the 24K IGFBP. In conclusion, we have isolated two IGFBPs from the CM of B104 cells. Both the 24K and 28K IGFBPs appear to be isoforms of the same protein, and sequence data suggest these proteins are two forms of IGFBP-4. IGF-I increases the expression of both of these IGFBPs, whereas IGF-II decreases their expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Ki-67 immunostaining in node-negative stage I/II breast carcinoma. Significant correlation with prognosis. Prognostic predictors for node-negative breast carcinoma have not been clearly established. Immunostaining with Ki-67 antibody was performed on frozen sections of histologically proved node-negative breast carcinomas from 42 patients to examine its prognostic value and its association with other clinicopathologic and biochemical parameters, i.e., patient age and tumor size, histologic type, nuclear grade, mitotic rate, presence of vascular or lymphatic invasion, DNA ploidy, percentage of cells in S-phase, estrogen content, and c-erbB-2 amplification. Thirty-seven of the 42 tumors showed immunoreactivity with Ki-67 antibody in 1% to 55% of the tumor cells. A strongly significant correlation was observed between Ki-67 staining percentage and, respectively, nuclear grade, age, and mitotic rate. Nuclear grade 1 (the most anaplastic) tumors showed a significantly higher median percentage of cells stained (median, 14; range, 3 to 40) compared with nuclear grade 3 tumors (median, 0.5; range, 0 to 8). Thirteen patients developed recurrence; six of them died of disease. On univariate analysis, both 5-year disease-free and overall survivals were strongly associated with percentage of cells stained with Ki-67 antibody. Our results suggest that Ki-67 immunostaining correlates well with nuclear grade and clinical outcome in node-negative breast carcinoma. Because of small sample size analyzed in this study we were unable to do multivariate analysis. Therefore, further studies with larger number of cases are needed to determine whether tumor proliferative activity determined by Ki-67 immunostaining is an independent prognostic parameter or it merely reflects histopathologic features such as nuclear grade or mitotic activity. 
Radiologic findings of clonorchiasis. Clonorchiasis is a trematodiasis caused by chronic infestation of liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis. The adult flukes reside in the medium-sized and small intrahepatic bile ducts and, occasionally, in the extrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder, and pancreatic duct. The result is mechanical obstruction, inflammatory reaction, adenomatous hyperplasia, and periductal fibrosis. Signs and symptoms are usually mild and nonspecific, but heavy infestation results in obstructive jaundice. The disease has a close relationship with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma. In this article, the radiologic findings, including cholangiography, sonography, and CT of clonorchiasis are reviewed in light of the pathophysiology of the disease. The relationship to recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and to cholangiocarcinoma is discussed. 
Exercise supplementation of dipyridamole for myocardial perfusion imaging [editorial; comment] The substitution of intravenous dipyridamole for symptom-limited treadmill exercise has provided a non-invasive means to diagnose coronary artery disease with 201Tl scintigraphy in patients unable to adequately exercise. Limitations of dipyridamole/thallium imaging are primarily due to suboptimal image quality secondary to hepatic tracer concentration and decreased test sensitivity in patients who are dipyridamole "non-responders." Low-level treadmill exercise supplementation improves image quality, whereas handgrip has little, if any, benefit. The effect of low-level exercise in augmenting coronary blood flow is unknown and reports regarding the effect of handgrip are conflicting. The diagnostic benefit of these maneuvers in improving test sensitivity and decreasing the number of "non-responders" has not been documented. The combination of maximal, symptom-limited treadmill exercise and intravenous dipyridamole is a theoretically attractive option to improve overall test sensitivity, but the physiologic consequences and potential side effects should be more thoroughly investigated. 
Serum bupivacaine concentrations following wound infiltration in children undergoing inguinal herniotomy. Serum bupivacaine concentrations were measured in 12 children who underwent elective herniotomy and who received analgesia in the form of wound infiltration. Mean (SD) peak concentration was 0.36 (0.14) micrograms/ml and time to peak concentration was 14.6 (7.2) minutes after infiltration of 1.25 mg/kg of bupivacaine. These concentrations are lower than those associated with other local anaesthetic blocks and well below potentially toxic levels. Wound infiltration provides a simple, effective and safe method of providing postoperative analgesia for hernia repair in children. 
Effect of very low birth weight and subnormal head size on cognitive abilities at school age BACKGROUND. We tested the hypothesis that very-low-birth-weight (less than 1.5 kg) infants with perinatal growth failure whose head size is not normal by eight months of age (corrected for prematurity) have significantly poorer growth and neurocognitive abilities at school age than very-low-birth-weight children with a normal head size at eight months. We also hypothesized that these differences would persist even after control for major neurologic impairment and perinatal and sociodemographic risk factors. METHODS. We have followed a cohort of very-low-birth-weight children since their birth during the period 1977 to 1979. At eight to nine years of age 249 children were evaluated with a neurologic examination and tests of intelligence; receptive and expressive language skills; speech, reading, mathematics, and spelling aptitude; visual and fine motor abilities; and behavior. Ages were corrected for premature birth. RESULTS. Among these 249 very-low-birth-weight children, head size was subnormal (less than the mean -2 SD for age) at birth in 30 (12 percent), at term in 57 (23 percent), and at eight months in 33 (13 percent). As compared with the 216 children with normal head sizes, the 33 children with subnormal head sizes at the age of eight months had significantly lower mean birth weights (1.1 vs. 1.2 kg) and higher neonatal risk scores (71 vs. 53) and at the age of eight years had a higher incidence of neurologic impairment (21 percent vs. 8 percent) and lower IQ scores (mean verbal, 84 vs. 98). Even among the children without neurologic abnormalities, a subnormal head size at eight months of age was predictive of poorer verbal and performance IQ scores at eight years of age; lower scores for receptive language, speech, reading, mathematics, and spelling; and a higher incidence of hyperactivity. In multiple regression analyses to control for socioeconomic and neonatal risk factors, intrauterine growth failure, birth weight, and neurologic impairment, a subnormal head size at eight months of age had an independently adverse effect on IQ and on scores for receptive language, speech, reading, and spelling. CONCLUSIONS. In very-low-birth-weight infants, perinatal growth failure, as evidenced by a subnormal head circumference at eight months of age, is associated with poor cognitive function, academic achievement, and behavior at eight years of age. 
Central nervous system monitoring. What helps, what does not. The ICU monitoring of CNS function can make a difference in the clinical outcome. No single technique addresses the multiple issues that arise in the ICU setting, especially for the polytrauma patient. Multimodality approaches combining assessment of cerebral blood flow, electrophysiologic parameters, and intracranial pressure, when appropriate, with cardiac and respiratory monitors are being developed at a number of traumatology centers world wide. Experience needs to be gained to establish the best combination of these modalities. Pending this, selected use of intracranial pressure monitoring combined with EEG and transcranial Doppler ultrasound provides reliable immediate assessment and ongoing monitoring of CNS structures. 
Prognostic significance of computed tomography of the brain in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We studied the prognostic value of computed tomography (CT) of the brain for neurologic morbidity in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. On review of Mayo Clinic records for 1975 through 1985, we found 32 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 20 of whom had undergone CT of the brain during their hospitalization. Despite major neurologic symptoms and signs, normal CT findings were associated with complete neurologic recovery. Seventy percent of patients with normal results of CT of the brain recovered and had no neurologic deficits, whereas 80% of patients with CT abnormalities died or had permanent neurologic sequelae. A review of the literature supports these conclusions. Thus, we suggest that CT of the brain be done in any patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and neurologic deficits. Regardless of the severity of neurologic involvement, normal CT findings should encourage continued vigorous treatment of the patient because a normal scan supports the possibility of full clinical recovery. 
Alterations of ATP levels and of energy parameters in the blood of alcoholic and nonalcoholic patients with liver damage. Blood adenine nucleotides were determined in patients with alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases. They included patients with alcoholic hepatitis (AH), alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC), non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis (NALC), and amoebic liver abscess (ALA) (28 patients). A decrease of 28% to 39% in blood ATP levels was observed among the patients with AH and the cirrhotic groups, respectively (p less than 0.05), whereas no significant changes in blood ATP levels were detected in the ALA group. Although total blood adenine nucleotides were significantly diminished in AH, ALC, and NALC groups, the AH patients retained their energy relationships within normal range. On the other hand, the cirrhotic groups, independently of their etiology, failed to maintain an adequate ATP/ADP ratio, energy charge, and phosphorylation potential in the blood, suggesting a decreased energy availability in their blood cells. Nevertheless, the mechanism involved in these effects remains to be elucidated, a failure of the damaged liver to supply purines to extra-hepatic tissues might be a major event altering the blood energy parameters. 
Cutaneous herpes simplex virus infections. Affecting millions of Americans each year, herpes simplex virus infections are among the most common human viral infections. Many clinical forms exist, depending on the site of infection and the patient's age and immune status. Clinical evaluation and laboratory studies help establish the diagnosis. Acyclovir is the drug most often used to treat herpes simplex virus infections, although newer agents, such as phosphonoformate trisodium, may be required for acyclovir-resistant infections. 
Facial nerve monitoring in acoustic tumor surgery. Anatomic and functional preservation of the facial nerve during acoustic tumor surgery remains a primary goal. Intraoperative electromyographic facial nerve monitoring with auditory feedback has enabled the surgeon to more readily achieve this goal. We compared a group of monitored translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removals (N = 89) to a similar unmonitored group (N = 155) in regard to facial nerve function. Function was assessed immediately postoperatively, at time of discharge, and at 1 year postoperatively using the House six-point scale. Results were grouped as satisfactory, intermediate, or poor and were analyzed by tumor size. Facial nerve results were better at all time intervals in the monitored groups, although the difference was not statistically significant at the 1-year interval. There was no difference between monitored and unmonitored patients in the subgroups with tumors smaller than 2.5 cm in diameter. This study supports the usefulness of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring in improving facial nerve results, particularly in larger tumors. 
Effects of media conditions, insulin, and dexamethasone on insulin-receptor mRNA and promoter activity in HepG2 cells. Numerous physiological agents and conditions modulate cellular insulin sensitivity by downregulating or upregulating total cellular insulin receptors. In this study, we examined the effects of replacing complete medium in the absence or presence of insulin on the regulation of insulin-receptor gene expression in cultured human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Failure to replace complete medium resulted in growth arrest of HepG2 cells and a six- to sevenfold increase in insulin-receptor mRNA due to the prolongation of insulin-receptor mRNA half-life. Northern analysis revealed multiple insulin-receptor mRNA species; the largest species (11 kilobases) was disproportionately increased in growth-arrested cells. High concentrations of insulin (500 ng/ml) induced a 33.8% decrease in the abundance of insulin-receptor mRNA (n = 14). At lower concentrations, a trend of inhibition was observed but was not statistically significant. Insulin (500 ng/ml) did not affect insulin-receptor mRNA stability. The effect of conditioned media, insulin, and dexamethasone on insulin-receptor promoter activity was also examined. Various constructs of the 5'-flanking region of the insulin-receptor gene were attached immediately upstream to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and transiently transfected into HepG2 cells via a pBR322-derived plasmid (pCAT). In cells replaced with complete medium, 12 and 118% of the promoter activity was contained within 578 and 877 base pairs, respectively, from the major translational initiation site. Conditioned media from growth-arrested cells in culture for 7 days increased promoter activity approximately twofold in 48 h. However, this increase failed to localize to any specific region on the insulin-receptor promoter. 
A prospective comparison of neuropsychologic performance of children surviving leukemia who received 18-Gy, 24-Gy, or no cranial irradiation. To compare the late neuropsychologic toxicities of CNS prophylaxis for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), longitudinal assessments were performed on three groups of patients: those who received repeated courses of moderate-dose (1 g/m2) intravenous (IV) and intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) without cranial irradiation (MTX group, n = 26), those who received IT MTX and 18 Gy cranial irradiation (18-Gy group, n = 23), and those who received IT MTX and 24 Gy cranial irradiation (24-Gy group, n = 28). All patients were free of CNS leukemia at diagnosis and had remained in continuous, complete remission 5 to 11 years (median, 7.4 years) following CNS prophylaxis. An analysis of serial intelligence quotient (IQ), achievement, and neuropsychologic studies revealed no significant influence of either age at CNS prophylaxis or CNS prophylaxis group on any neuropsychologic outcome measure. After adjusting for changes in IQ test versions that were necessitated by advancing patient age, no statistically significant declines in Verbal, Performance, or Full Scale IQs were noted for the three CNS treatment groups. However, comparisons of group means masked declines in individual children; 22% to 30% of children exhibited a clinically significant deterioration (greater than or equal to 15 points) in uncorrected IQ values over the study period. Female sex was associated with an increased risk of deterioration in Verbal IQ, but we were unable to identify risk factors associated with other declines in intellect and achievement. The inability to reliably predict individual patients at risk for clinically significant neuropsychologic toxicities on the basis of age at diagnosis or specific method of CNS prophylaxis suggests that other etiologic factors must be explored as the basis for these changes, such as ecologic factors and chemotherapy during the continuation phase of treatment. 
Resection of malignant bone tumors about the shoulder. A preliminary report of reconstruction with a new modular spacer. Reconstruction after resection of malignant bone tumors about the shoulder is difficult. Twelve patients had reconstruction using a new titanium modular spacer. This modular system allows the surgeon to reconstruct variable lengths of the proximal humerus. Although the patient has no active shoulder motion, excellent hand and elbow function is preserved. The spacer serves as a temporary device in the young active patient. A more definitive reconstructive procedure can be performed after the completion of chemotherapy and a sufficient disease-free interval. 
Clinical application of a patient-controlled apparatus for ventricular administration of morphine in intractable pain: report of 28 cases. The authors developed a patient-controlled apparatus (L-224) for ventricular administration of pain-relieving medication and utilized it in the treatment of 28 patients with intractable pain. The initial dose of morphine hydrochloride was 1 mg, which afforded pain relief for an average of 170 hours. At an average dose of 1.8 mg, the average time of pain relief obtained was 137 hours. Therefore, they conclude that L-224 is a satisfactory apparatus for the ventricular administration of pain medication; it is patient controlled, safe, and reliable in clinical application. 
Malignant transformation of an osteoblastoma of the skull: an exceptional occurrence. Case report. What is apparently the first reported case of spontaneous malignant transformation of a benign osteoblastoma of the skull is described. The initial lesion was completely removed surgically and showed the histological features typical of a benign osteoblastoma. No radiotherapy was performed. Eleven years later the patient developed an osteosarcoma of the skull. Review of the literature showed that malignant transformation of benign osteoblastomas is extremely rare and could take place spontaneously. However, the risk of this occurring seems higher after inadequate initial treatment (curettage or partial excision). Follow-up monitoring of patients with osteoblastoma of the cranial vault is suggested. 
Pulmonary function of preeclamptic women receiving intravenous magnesium sulfate seizure prophylaxis. Pulmonary function was studied in ten preeclamptic women in labor (mean gestational age 38.1 +/- 0.9 weeks measured from the last menstrual period) receiving continuous intravenous (IV) infusions of magnesium sulfate. Baseline maximal inspiratory pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, functional vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume at 1 second were measured immediately before a 6-g IV loading dose of magnesium sulfate and 2 hours after the initiation of a continuous 2-g/hour infusion of magnesium sulfate. Serum magnesium levels were measured at the same time pulmonary function tests were performed. All values are reported as the mean +/- standard deviation. The maximal inspiratory pressure, an indicator of generalized respiratory muscle weakness, decreased from a baseline value of 26.2 +/- 7.7 to 19.4 +/- 6.3 cm H2O (P less than .05). The maximal expiratory pressure, an indicator of expiratory muscle strength, decreased from a baseline value of 30.6 +/- 9.2 to 25.2 +/- 7.1 cm H2O (P less than .005). The functional vital capacity decreased from a baseline value of 3.37 +/- 0.49 to 3.19 +/- 0.73 L, and the forced expiratory volume at 1 second decreased from a baseline value of 2.61 +/- 0.58 to 2.36 +/- 0.68 L at 2 hours (P less than .05). The mean serum magnesium level was 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/dL before the administration of the IV loading dose and 4.51 +/- 0.67 mg/dL 2 hours after initiation of the continuous infusion. Our results demonstrate a significant decrease in pulmonary function tests in term preeclamptic patients receiving magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis. 
Androgens and oligomenorrhea in hirsute women. A recent study demonstrated that hirsute women with irregular menses had higher levels of serum androgens that hirsute women with regular menses. To investigate this finding, we measured total testosterone, biologically active testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in 51 hirsute women with regular menses and compared the levels found to those found in 28 hirsute women with oligomenorrhea. There was no significant difference in the degree of facial hirsutism between the two groups. Oligomenorrheic women had significantly higher levels of free testosterone (p less than 0.02) and biologically active testosterone (p less than 0.05). The other androgens did not differ significantly between the two groups. The free fractions of testosterone are the metabolically active forms of the hormone and their levels are a function of the rates of production and clearance of testosterone that are elevated in states of hyperandrogenism. This study confirms that hirsute women with oligomenorrhea have higher levels of free and biologically active testosterone than those with regular menses. 
Concomitant medical disease and headache. The treatment of headache disorders in patients with concomitant medical illness constitutes one of the more challenging areas of headache therapy. As new agents are added to our pharmacologic armamentarium, it will become easier to tailor therapy to our patients. The physician who treats the headache patient with concomitant medical illness must be particularly aware of drug side effects and pharmacology in order to prevent a worsening of underlying medical conditions or an exacerbation of headaches. 
How prevalent is cancer family syndrome? Based on an established but pragmatic definition of cancer family syndrome as the presence of three or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer in a first degree kinship, the contribution of this syndrome to the total cancer burden in Northern Ireland has been studied by investigating all non-polyposis probands under 55 years old at histological diagnosis between 1976 and 1978. Family interviews were possible for 95% (n = 205) of all non-polyposis probands and verification of vital status or medical history was obtained for 98% of 1811 first degree relatives. The prevalence of cancer family syndrome was between 1 and 2%, a figure some fivefold less than that estimated elsewhere. A proximal tumour excess was not characteristic of the ascertained families. These results may have implications for the identification of susceptible people if screening for high risk groups is considered a worthwhile option for reducing colorectal cancer mortality in the United Kingdom. 
Small bowel obstruction after colon resection for benign and malignant diseases. To determine the etiology and outcome of patients with small bowel obstruction after a colon resection for benign and malignant diseases, the medical records of 118 patients who underwent 120 laparotomies for small bowel obstruction were reviewed. Contrary to previous reports, benign adhesions were responsible for the obstruction in all patients with a history of benign colon disease, 82.6 percent of patients with a history of adenocarcinoma of the colon without known recurrence, and 30.1 percent of patients with known recurrent malignancy. The morbidity and mortality was more related to the etiology of the obstruction rather than the preoperative delay or operative procedure performed. Considering the high likelihood of adhesive obstruction in patients with a history of, or known, metastatic colorectal carcinoma, it is suggested that these not deter surgeons from aggressive early surgical intervention in these patients who develop small bowel obstruction. 
Clinical experience with oral sumatriptan: a placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study. Oral Sumatriptan Dose-defining Study Group. A double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 100, 200 and 300 mg sumatriptan, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1-like receptor agonist, given in an oral dispersible form in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. A total of 1130 patients were recruited from 51 centres in eight countries and the efficacy results are presented from an interim analysis of 538 cases. Tolerability was evaluated in 227 patients. At 2 h, an improvement in headache severity from moderate or severe to mild or none was reported by 67% of patients who received 100 mg sumatriptan, 75% receiving 200 mg and 69% of patients receiving 300 mg sumatriptan, compared with 22% of patients who received placebo (P less than 0.001 all doses sumatriptan vs placebo). Adverse events were generally mild and transient, and appeared to be dose-related; the adverse event profile of 100 mg sumatriptan was similar to that of placebo. Overall, nausea/vomiting and "bitter taste" were the most common complaints. The proportion of patients withdrawn due to adverse events was similar in the placebo and 100 mg sumatriptan treatment groups (2% and 3%, respectively). It is concluded that 100 mg sumatriptan given orally is well tolerated with an anti-migraine efficacy comparable to that provided by the two higher doses. 
Effect of sequential early burn wound excision and closure on postburn oxygen consumption. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of early excision and closure of burns on postburn hypermetabolism, measured as oxygen consumption (VO2). METHODS: Twelve patients with deep burns of 30% to 50% of total body surface underwent sequential excisions and wound coverage, beginning 1 to 3 days after burn. The majority of the deep burn was removed by day 7, but with the addition of a donor site area of 20% to 25% of total body surface. RESULTS: No decrease in VO2 was noted in relation to the percent removal of burn tissue. In addition, a transient further increase in VO2 was noted early after excision, especially with surgical procedures performed after 5 days. This response could not be attributed to wound manipulation-induced bacteremias. CONCLUSION: We conclude that early surgical excision and closure of burns in excess of 30% to 50% of total body surface do not decrease postburn hypermetabolism in proportion to the area closed. It is possible that remaining open wounds in the form of donor sites and nonexcised burn are sufficient to perpetuate the hypermetabolic process, once established. 
Transanal electrostimulation for fecal incontinence: clinical, psychologic, and manometric prospective study. A prospective study was carried out to analyze the clinical, psychologic, and manometric short-term results of transanal electrostimulation (TES) in the treatment of fecal incontinence. Fifteen patients underwent TES. An initial clinical and manometric assessment was carried out before and 1 month after the procedure. A psychologic evaluation was also performed by means of interviews and appropriate tests. Early improvement of symptoms was noted in 10 patients. The nonresponders were women with gross daily incontinence to solid stool. At anal manometry, resting tone and rectal sensation remained unchanged, whereas a significant increase of voluntary contraction was observed following TES (from 48 +/- 26 to 59 +/- 39 mm Hg, P = 0.03). Psychologically, TES led to a significant decrease of both latent and paranoid anxiety related to symptoms (P = 0.02). At a clinical reassessment 6 months later, one of the nonresponders became continent after a further course of TES. In conclusion, TES is well accepted by the patients, is followed by positive emotional response, and, by improving striated sphincter function, seems to be effective in the treatment of partial fecal incontinence. 
Combination thrombolytic therapy: a comparison of simultaneous and sequential regimens of tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase. Coronary angioplasty following unsuccessful tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) therapy for acute myocardial infarction has been associated with a high incidence of subsequent reocclusion of the infarct-related artery, and a relatively high in-hospital mortality. In contrast, the combination of t-PA and urokinase, when given intravenously prior to coronary angiography, appears to be associated with a low incidence of post-rescue angioplasty reocclusion. In order to determine whether intraprocedural urokinase, given at the time of rescue coronary angioplasty for failed t-PA therapy, improves long-term patency of the infarct vessel to the same extent as preangiographic, combination t-PA/urokinase therapy, three thrombolytic treatment strategies were retrospectively compared. The first group included 86 patients undergoing rescue angioplasty after t-PA monotherapy (t-PA alone). The clinical and angiographic outcomes of these patients were compared with those of 24 patients who received intravenous or intracoronary urokinase during rescue angioplasty following unsuccessful t-PA therapy (sequential t-PA/urokinase therapy), and with those of 34 patients undergoing rescue coronary angioplasty following unsuccessful therapy with the combination of intravenous t-PA and urokinase (simultaneous therapy). There was no difference in postangioplasty patency rate of the infarct-related artery between the three groups. However, the sequential t-PA/urokinase regimen was associated with a subsequent reocclusion rate that was lower than the rate that occurred in the t-PA monotherapy group but higher than the rate in the simultaneous t-PA/urokinase group (13 versus 29 versus 2%, respectively; p = 0.003). 
Intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, and subdural hematoma after acute myocardial infarction and thrombolytic therapy in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study. Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II, pilot and clinical trial. In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II pilot and clinical trial, 908 patients [326 (35.9%) in the pilot study and 582 (64.0%) in the randomized study] were treated with 150 mg recombinant tissue-type plasminogen (rt-PA) activator in combination with heparin and aspirin, and 3,016 patients [64 (2.1%) in the pilot study and 2,952 (97.9%) in the randomized study] were treated with 100 mg rt-PA in combination with heparin and aspirin. Adverse neurological events occurred in 23 patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (2.5%) [nine cerebral infarctions (1.0%), 12 intracerebral hemorrhages (1.3%), and two subdural hematomas (0.2%)] and in 33 patients treated with 100 mg rt-PA (1.1%) [20 cerebral infarctions (0.7%), 11 intracerebral hemorrhages (0.4%), and two subdural hematomas (0.1%)]. The difference in adverse neurological events observed comparing the two rt-PA regimens was primarily due to a higher frequency of intracerebral bleeding among patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (1.3% versus 0.4%, p less than 0.01). Patients with recent (within 6 months) histories of stroke were not eligible for the study, and patients with any history of cerebrovascular disease were declared ineligible early in the study. The small number of patients (89, or 2.3%) with any history of neurological disease, intermittent cerebral ischemic attacks, or stroke who were enrolled before the stricter eligibility criteria were imposed or on the basis of incomplete baseline information experienced an increased frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage compared with patients without such histories (3.4% versus 0.5%). Mortality at 6 weeks after presentation among 23 patients who had intracerebral hemorrhage was 47.8%. Intracerebral hemorrhage is a severe but infrequent complication of rt-PA therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The combined frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and cerebral infarction after treatment with 100 mg rt-PA is comparable to that observed in other trials with thrombolytic agents in acute myocardial infarction. 
9p monosomy in a patient with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS) is a genetic disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit disorder. Family studies support the presence of an autosomal dominant gene; however, to date, an assignment for the GTS locus has not been made. We present the case of a boy with GTS and a deletion of the terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 9, del(9)(qter----p2304:). 
A femoral vein-femoral artery loop technique for aortic dilatation in children. Balloon aortic dilatation is now a recognized therapy for aortic stenosis in children. Using retrograde approaches with either single or double balloons, successful dilatation can be readily achieved, but with little control of balloon position across the valve. We describe a femoral vein-femoral artery loop technique via a transseptal approach which facilitates antegrade crossing of the stenotic aortic valve and allows optimal balloon control and simultaneous pressure gradient recording during the procedure. 
Acceleration of chronic myeloid leukemia correlates with calcitonin gene hypermethylation. Calcitonin gene methylation at CCGG sites were determined in 39 chronic myeloid leukemia patients by isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease analysis. A total of 27 patients were analyzed while still in the chronic phase: 20 patients had a normal gene, and seven had a hypermethylated gene. There were 12 patients initially studied in accelerated or blastic phases. All but one patient showed gene hypermethylation, suggesting a good correlation between gene methylation and disease stage. All five patients who, while still in the chronic phase, had a major 3.1-kb hypermethylated calcitonin gene fragment, accelerated within 2 to 27 months. In consecutively analyzed patients, the initially normal calcitonin gene changed to a hypermethylated state as the disease escalated. The hypermethylation predicted disease acceleration with a median lead time of 6 months before any morphologic or clinical signs of disease progression were seen. The disease progressed in 8 of 27 patients initially studied in the chronic phase: in only two patients this occurred without predictive methylation changes. The results suggest that the assessment of calcitonin gene methylation status may be a promising tool for monitoring chronic myeloid leukemia disease escalation. 
Fibrinolysis in cerebrospinal fluid after intraventricular haemorrhage. Concentrations of cross linked fibrin degradation products were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid from five 'normal' preterm infants (median 102 ng/ml), four preterm infants with intraventricular haemorrhage (median 315 ng/ml), and five infants with progressive post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (median 1000 ng/ml). Serial samples of cerebrospinal fluid from one infant showed a peak concentration two weeks after the haemorrhage. 
Hydatidiform mole and fetus with normal karyotype: support of a separate entity. Repetitive hydatidiform mole was observed in four pregnancies. The pregnancies presented with heavy bleeding and vomiting, but the post-evacuation courses were uncomplicated, with rapid regression of serum hCG levels. Cytogenetic investigations, analyses of restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and flow cytometry in three pregnancies were consistent with diploid, biparental conception as the origin of fetal tissue and molar and nonmolar villi. In one pregnancy, the analyses of cytogenetic markers suggested the coexistence of two different cell lines of dizygotic, biparental origin, whereas DNA analysis was consistent with a single conception. With incomplete genetic information, a hydatidiform mole with coexistent normal fetus is generally considered to result from dizygous twinning comprising an androgenetic complete mole and a normal conception. In the present gestations, the results based on several techniques applied on numerous samples from different tissues render this possibility unlikely. Some of the contradictions between histologic and cytogenetic classifications of hydatidiform mole may be explained by diploid, biparental partial mole, which seems to constitute a separate subgroup within hydatidiform mole. Following chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, continued pregnancy may be considered, depending on prenatal diagnosis including genetic marker analysis. 
A prospective study of outcome from protein-energy malnutrition in nursing home residents. To study recovery from protein-energy malnutrition in patients newly admitted to a chronic care facility, biochemical and anthropomorphic malnutrition indicators were measured prospectively over a 2-month period. Subjects were observed for a mean of 76 +/- 18 days after admission. Factors which might affect nutritional status including method of feeding, energy prescribed, use of supplemental feedings, assistance in eating, and amount of diet consumed were recorded. Confounding variables including illness, mental status, functional status, or prescription drugs were evaluated for their impact. On the basis of an empiric nutrition score, 54% of newly admitted residents were malnourished. Improvement in nutritional score occurred in 63% of malnourished patients remaining in the facility whereas 37% remained malnourished. Two related factors, percentage of diet consumed and degree of assistance required in eating, were important differences in the outcome of patients remaining malnourished. Interventional studies to determine whether outcome can be improved by more aggressive feeding methods or by feeding teams need to be undertaken. 
Human beta-galactosidase gene mutations in GM1-gangliosidosis: a common mutation among Japanese adult/chronic cases. Molecular analysis of the human beta-galactosidase gene revealed six different mutations in 10 of 11 Japanese GM1-gangliosidosis patients. They were the only abnormalities in each allele examined in this study. A 165-nucleotide duplication (positions 1103-1267) was found in two infantile patients, producing an abnormally large mRNA; one patient was probably a homozygote, and the other was a heterozygote of this mutation. The other two infantile patients had different mutations; a 123 Gly(GGG)----Arg(AGG) mutation in one patient and a 316 Tyr(TAT)----Cys(TGT) mutation in the other. A 201 Arg(CGC)----Cys(TGC) mutation, eliminating a BspMI site, was detected in a late-infantile/juvenile patient; the restriction-site analysis of amplified genomic DNA confirmed his heterozygosity for this mutation. A 51 Ile(ATC)----Thr(ACC) mutation was found in all five adult/chronic patients examined in this study. It created a SauI site, and restriction-site analysis confirmed that four patients were homozygous mutants. The other was a compound heterozygote for this mutation and another 457 Arg(CGA)----Gln(CAA) mutation. These mutant genes expressed markedly decreased or completely deficient enzyme activities in beta-galactosidase-deficient human fibroblasts transformed by adenovirus-SV40 recombinants. We conclude that gene mutations are heterogeneous in GM1-gangliosidosis but that the 51 Ile(ATC)----Thr(ACC) mutation is common among the Japanese adult/chronic cases. Genotype-phenotype correlations in GM1-gangliosidosis are briefly discussed. 
Lack of evidence for small vessel disease in a patient with "slow dye progression" in the coronary arteries. A patient with chest pain of recent onset, suggestive for angina pectoris, was referred for diagnostic coronary angiography, which showed the typical phenomenon of "slow dye progression" in the absence of any significant coronary artery stenosis. While intracoronary Doppler measurements confirmed the extremely slow blood flow velocity, the coronary flow reserve and the calculated coronary blood flow proved to be within normal range. The present findings suggest that, in contrast with a previous hypothesis, the phenomenon of slow dye progression may not always be due to a microvascular cause. Epicardial artery disease, as suggested by the marked coronary artery ectasia, may be linked to the slow dye progression and predispose to coronary artery thrombosis. 
Rotationplasty as a reconstructive operation after tumor resection. Reconstruction in the skeletally immature patient following resection of osteosarcoma about the knee is a challenging problem. Salvaging of the limb with allogeneic or prosthetic replacement results in a shortened limb with functional limitations. Arthrodesis yields a stiff and shortened limb. The so-called growing prosthesis has a high complication rate and is still unproven. However, rotationplasty has been successfully used as a reconstructive technique following resection of these types of tumors in the skeletally immature patient. A limb with normal sensation and proprioceptions, adequate range of motion, and without leg-length discrepancies, functional limitations, or painful neuroma is to be expected. Although a prosthesis must be worn, these patients are active and participate in unrestricted physical activity. Cosmetic acceptance has not been a problem and complications are minimal. Thus, rotationplasty requires only a single operation and results in a highly functional limb. 
Factors affecting the patency of stents in malignant biliary obstructive disease: univariate and multivariate analysis. To investigate the factors affecting the patency of biliary stents, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses in 370 straight stents with diameters of 10- to 12-French gauge which had been inserted singly as palliative treatment in 228 patients with malignant biliary obstructive disease. In the analysis of 226 first stents, advanced age of patients and higher serum bilirubin levels before insertion were found to be significant unfavorable factors limiting the duration of stent function. Overall, older age, male sex, no stent cleaning, and insertion on three or more occasions were significant unfavorable prognostic factors for patency. The risk of occlusion for stents inserted on three or more occasions was 2.32 times that of the first stent insertion. The median duration of patency of first, second, and subsequent stents was 177, 98, and 97 days, respectively. Diagnosis and the area of stenosis were unrelated to patency. No predictive significance of length or size of stent between 10- and 12-French gauge was found in our study. 
Unusual clinical presentation of malignant histiocytosis in a 70-year-old woman. A 70-year-old woman was admitted for evaluation of hepatosplenomegaly, fever and elevated serum LDH levels. A biopsy specimen of the liver revealed histiocytic proliferation at the portal triad, and a mild degree of hepatitis. A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed proliferation of histiocytes with minimal immaturity and atypism, and haemophagocytosis by the proliferated histiocytes. Fever, hepatosplenomegaly and elevation of LDH levels all disappeared spontaneously, and presumptive diagnosis of benign reticulosis with haemophagocytosis was made. One year later, fever, hepatosplenomegaly and elevation of LDH levels redeveloped, and the liver and bone marrow biopsy specimen showed proliferation of unequivocally malignant histiocytes. The patient died as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation with shock 20 d later. We concluded that, in this case, malignant histiocytosis first presented as benign haemophagocytic reticulosis and, 1 year later, there was a typical malignant presentation. 
Management of bleeding liver tumours in Hong Kong. A retrospective study was undertaken of 41 patients diagnosed as having suffered spontaneous liver rupture over a 4-year period to identify the clinical features, treatment and outcome of this complication in an area in which hepatocellular carcinoma is endemic. Two patients were excluded with a revised diagnosis of haemorrhagic malignant ascites. Of the remaining 39 patients, 37 bled from ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma, one from peliosis hepatis and multiple liver cell adenomas, and one from a malignant hepatic epithelioid haemangioendothelioma. Analysis showed that 59 per cent of patients were in shock on admission and that all but two of the 37 patients with ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma were men with cirrhosis. The association with cirrhosis was significantly higher than in a series of 45 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing elective resection during the same period (P less than 0.05). Treatment consisted of supportive care only in two patients, angiographic embolization in four, emergency liver resection in 11 of whom six died, hepatic artery ligation in 12 of whom eight died, and suture and/or packing in eight of whom six died. One patient died at laparotomy and in another patient bleeding was successfully arrested by intratumoural injection of absolute alcohol. Because of the high operative mortality of emergency surgery in these poor risk patients, prospective evaluation of emergency angiographic embolization is required. 
Impaired efficacy of selective LDL-apheresis in primary biliary cirrhosis. Low-density lipoprotein apheresis (LDL-apheresis) was done with either cascade filtration (DF) or dextran sulfate cellulose adsorption (DSC) in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis who developed severe dyslipidemia associated with cholestasis and accumulation of lipoprotein-X (LP-X). The extracorporeal treatment was initially performed weekly, and resulted in a sharp drop in total cholesterol from 1038 to 430 mg/dl. During the next four months the patient was treated every 10-15 days, and pre-apheresis cholesterol levels were maintained between 438 and 505 mg/dl, until an orthotopic liver transplantation was successfully performed. With semi-selective DF a mean 47.1% of total cholesterol was removed per procedure compared to 30.0% with DSC, although the volume of treated plasma was 38.0 vs 49.9 ml/kg body weight. The changes in plasma cholesterol levels during DSC and DF showed that the kinetics of cholesterol removal were similar with both techniques, but the efficacy differed; DF removed both LDL and LP-X from plasma, whereas DSC selectively lowered the LDL content. Cascade filtration may therefore be considered as a first-choice treatment for patients with LP-X accumulation due to cholestasis. 
Chronic hematocele complicating renal failure and hemodialysis. A patient with a recent history of genitourinary tuberculosis, chronic renal failure and hemodialysis presented with a slow growing scrotal swelling that had enlarged during the last 3 years. Physical examination and sonography were suspicious for testicular tumor, and surgical exploration and inguinal orchiectomy were performed. Ultimately the mass proved to be a chronic hematocele, a rare complication of uremic coagulopathy and hemodialysis. Because hematocele may clinically and sonographically resemble a testicular tumor, the proper management of a complex multiseptated scrotal mass without obvious history suggestive of hematocele is surgical exploration and orchiectomy. Awareness of this common presentation may obviate orchiectomy. 
Pulmonary intravascular lipid in neonatal necropsy specimens. The lungs of 482 liveborn infants were examined at necropsy for the presence of intravascular lipid. Forty one patients had received parenteral feeding (including lipid emulsion in 30), and 441 had died before starting feeds or had received enteral feeds alone. Tissue was processed into wax and then stained with Sudan black; intravascular lipid was found in 15 of 30 infants who had received intravenous fat (Intralipid), but in no others. Those patients with positive lipid staining had received significantly more fat during parenteral nutrition than those in whom intravascular lipid was not found but the two groups were otherwise clinically indistinguishable. Using this staining technique intravascular lipid can be shown relatively often, although only in patients who have received intravenous lipid emulsion. The location of fat, predominantly in small pulmonary capillaries, and the absence of lipid emboli in other organs, suggests that lipid coalescence takes place before death and is not a postmortem artefact. The clinical relevance remains uncertain. 
Current surgical technique to repair Fallot's tetralogy with absent pulmonary valve syndrome. The experience with surgical repair of Fallot's tetralogy and absent pulmonary valve syndrome is reviewed. Twenty-two patients aged 1 day to 8 years were treated between 1982 and 1989 using one surgical technique. This consisted of resection of the main pulmonary artery and large parts of the anterior wall of the right and left pulmonary artery. The ventricular septal defect was closed with a patch, and an aortic or pulmonary homograft (size, 8 to 24 mm) was interposed between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. Two of the 8 infants operated on died; there was one late death. All 14 older children survived the operation. All survivors are well up to 7 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 3.6 years). We recommend early treatment of infants; older children can be treated electively. The technique used in our series gives excellent results. 
Pheochromocytoma in a long-term hemodialysis patient. A right adrenal tumor was found incidentally by renal echography in a 25-year-old man, who had been on hemodialysis for 4 years. Inquiry and clinical examination suggested pheochromocytoma, which was confirmed by plasma catecholamine measurements. Subsequent adrenalectomy was uneventful. Although hypertension, headache, and diaphoresis are common symptoms in a dialyzed patient, pheochromocytoma has to be eliminated in the presence of this clinical triad. 
Results of total cavopulmonary connection in the treatment of patients with a functional single ventricle. Total cavopulmonary connection was proposed as a modification of the Fontan procedure that might have greater benefits than previous methods. To assess this procedure we reviewed case histories of 38 patients (aged 17 months to 30 years) who underwent Fontan procedures with cavopulmonary anastomoses between January 1987 and December 1989. The group included 32 patients with univentricular heart, 2 with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, 3 with tricuspid atresia, and 1 with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. One or more previous palliative procedures were performed in 34 patients, including 19 systemic-pulmonary shunts, 16 pulmonary artery bandings, 7 atrial septectomies/septostomies, 7 Glenn shunts, and 1 patent ductus arteriosus ligation. Preoperative hemodynamics showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 12 mm Hg (range 6 to 22 mm Hg), pulmonary-systemic flow ratio of 1.6 (range 0.37 to 3.0), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 9 mm Hg (range 3 to 15 mm Hg), and systemic arterial oxygen saturation of 82% (range 67% to 94%). Concomitant with cavopulmonary connection, 13 patients underwent additional procedures, including 9 atrioventricular valve annuloplasties, 4 Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedures, and 2 resections of subaortic membranes. Modifying the Fontan procedure in this fashion was particularly useful in the management of 2 patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum who had right ventricular-dependent coronary blood flow. Cavopulmonary anastomosis and atrial septectomy were performed in both patients, with resultant inflow of oxygenated blood to the right ventricle and coronary arteries. Excellent postoperative results were noted in each. Postextubation hemodynamics for the entire group included a mean right atrial pressure of 13 mm Hg (range 11 to 17 mm Hg), a mean left atrial pressure of 6 mm Hg (range 3 to 12 mm Hg), and a room air oxygen saturation of 96% (range 92% to 98%). Seven patients had pleural effusions, 3 required postoperative pacemaker placement, and 2 required reoperation for tamponade. A venous assist device was required in one patient on the second postoperative day, but the patient was weaned successfully within 24 hours. One early death (2.6%) occurred in a patient who had intractable ventricular fibrillation 2 days after operation. There was one late cardiac death (2.7%) caused by ventricular failure and one late noncardiac death. These results demonstrate that total cavopulmonary connection provides excellent early definitive treatment, with low morbidity and mortality, for a variety of complex congenital heart lesions. 
Evaluating South Carolina's community cardiovascular disease prevention project. A community cardiovascular disease prevention program was undertaken as a cooperative effort of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control and the Centers for Disease Control of the Public Health Service. As part of the evaluation of the project, a large scale community health survey was conducted by the State and Federal agencies. The successful design and implementation of the survey, which included telephone and in-home interviews as well as clinical assessments of participants, is described. Interview response rates were adequate, although physical assessments were completed on only 61 percent of those interviewed. Households without telephones were difficult and costly to identify, and young adults were difficult to locate for survey participation. The survey produced baseline data for program planning and for measuring the success of ongoing intervention efforts. Survey data also have been used to estimate the prevalence of selected cardiovascular disease risk factors. 
Six-year experience with a comprehensive approach to the treatment of recurrent childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-REZ BFM 85). A relapse study of the BFM group. Between April 1985 and March 1987 130 children and adolescents up to 18 years of age with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were registered on the stratified and randomized multicentric trial ALL-REZ BFM 85 designed for patients pretreated with intensive front-line therapies. Stratification criteria were time and site of relapse: bone marrow (BM) relapse on or up to 6 months after stopping front-line therapy (group A), BM relapse beyond 6 months after therapy (group B), and isolated extramedullary relapse at any time (group C). Treatment consisted of alternating courses of polychemotherapy including randomly administered high- or intermediate-dose methotrexate (HDMTX:12 g/m2 as 4-hour infusion; IDMTX: 1 g/m2 as 36-hour infusion). During maintenance therapy the patients received daily oral thioguanine and biweekly intravenous (IV) MTX. The overall second complete remission (CR) rate was 92% (groups A, B, and C: 88%, 92%, and 100%), and the probability of event-free survival (EFS) at 6 years is 0.31 +/- 0.04 (groups A, B, and C: 0.18 +/- 0.05, 0.30 +/- 0.07, and 0.72 +/- 0.11). HDMTX did not prove to be superior to IDMTX, which led to premature stopping of randomization. Risk factor analyses showed early relapse, particularly BM relapse within 18 months, and T-cell phenotype to be independent predictors of poor outcome. The incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapses following BM relapse was 19%, indicating that reprophylaxis to the CNS with IV/intrathecal (IT) MTX was insufficient. For 17 children who received bone marrow transplantation in second CR from HLA-compatible siblings the EFS was 0.53 +/- 0.12 at 5 years. Their outcome was not influenced by the above-mentioned risk factors. With the proposed treatment regimen long-lasting second remissions can be achieved in about one third of patients even after intensive front-line treatment. 
Expiratory muscle fatigue in normal subjects. We examined expiratory muscle fatigue during expiratory resistive loading in 11 normal subjects. Subjects breathed against expiratory resistances at their own breathing frequency and tidal volume until exhaustion or for 60 min. Respiratory muscle strength was assessed from both the maximum static expiratory and inspiratory mouth pressures (PEmax and PImax). At the lowest resistance, PEmax and PImax measured after completion of the expiratory loaded breathing were not different from control values. With higher resistance, both PEmax and PImax were decreased (P less than 0.05), and the decrease lasted for greater than or equal to 60 min. The electromyogram high-to-low frequency power ratio for the rectus abdominis muscle decreased progressively during loading (P less than 0.01), but the integrated EMG activity did not change during recovery. Transdiaphragmatic pressure during loading was increased 3.6-fold compared with control (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that expiratory resistive loaded breathing induces muscle fatigue in both expiratory and inspiratory muscles. Fatigue of the expiratory muscles can be attributed directly to the high work load and that of the inspiratory muscles may be related to increased work due to shortened inspiratory time. 
Gliomatosis peritonei with malignant transformation: a case report and review of the literature. Gliomatosis peritonei is the implantation of glial tissue within the peritoneal cavity associated with ovarian teratomas. Previous reports have emphasized improved outcomes when these implants are found to be mature, even if the ovarian component is immature. A 16-year-old female with grade 3 immature teratoma was found on two subsequent laparotomies to have extensive peritoneal implantation of mature glial tissue. More than 5 years after the original surgery she was found to have a malignant abdominal glial neoplasm. This case illustrates a rare finding of malignant transformation of previously mature gliomatosis peritonei. 
Interferon-alpha overrides the deficient adhesion of chronic myeloid leukemia primitive progenitor cells to bone marrow stromal cells. Primitive blast colony-forming cells (BI-CFC) from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients are defective in their attachment to bone marrow-derived stromal cells compared with normal BI-CFC. We investigated the effect of recombinant interferon-alpha 2a (IFN-alpha) on this interaction between hematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow-derived stromal cells by culturing normal stromal cells with IFN-alpha (50 to 5,000 U/mL). At 50 U/mL we found that: (1) the capacity of stromal cells to bind two types of CML primitive progenitor cells (BI-CFC and long-term culture-initiating cells) was increased; and (2) the amount of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the stromal layer was increased. However, sulfated GAGs were not directly involved in binding CML BI-CFC, unlike binding by normal BI-CFC, which is sulfated GAG-dependent. Neuraminidase-treated control stromal cells bound an increased number of CML BI-CFC, reproducing the effect of IFN-alpha, whereas the binding to IFN-alpha-treated stromal cells was unaffected by neuraminidase treatment. Thus, the enhanced attachment by primitive CML progenitor cells to INF-alpha-treated stromal cells might be due to changes in the neuraminic acid composition in the stromal cell layer. Our in vitro evidence may provide insights into the mechanism of action of IFN-alpha in vivo. Prolonged administration may alter the marrow microenvironment in some patients such that it can restrain the aberrant proliferation of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive stem cells while permitting Ph-negative stem cells to function normally. 
Plasma renin activity in renal transplant patients with hypertension. Chronic renal allograft rejection (CR) is the major cause of graft loss after 1 year following transplantation. Hypertension (HTN) and proteinuria (Up) are the hallmarks of this immunologic allograft response. Over 1 year, 23 patients posttransplantation and with HTN (diastolic greater than 95 mm Hg) were examined. Serial serum creatinine (Scr), Up, urine creatinine (Ucr), and resting and enalapril challenged (EC) plasma renin activity (PRA) were all determined. Renal artery stenosis was excluded by noninvasive imaging. Of the 23 patients, eight eventually lost their renal allografts, while 15 maintained satisfactory renal function (Scr less than 2.5). Results of this study show that: 1) worsening renal function (RF) increases EC reactivity; 2) the presence of proteinuria is not itself related to increase in EC activity; 3) renin before and after EC was higher (P = .06) in the allograft loss group. In this study, patients with high PRA represent the highest EC responses. Therefore, they display not macrovascular lesions, but microvascular intrarenal disease; this defect is most likely secondary to chronic immunologic insult. 
Diffuse uterine leiomyomatosis with hemorrhage. A 28-year-old woman with primary infertility and severe menorrhagia underwent a hysterectomy after failed hormonal therapy for multiple leiomyomas. The postoperative pathologic findings established the diagnosis of diffuse uterine leiomyomatosis, which demonstrated histologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural similarity to leiomyomas of the uterus. The rapid growth of the tumor coincided with the administration of clomiphene citrate, an estrogenic agonist. As with the common leiomyoma, intralesional hemorrhage in this case of diffuse leiomyomatosis was associated with norethindrone acetate treatment given after the cessation of clomiphene therapy. 
Myocardial infarction with minimal coronary atherosclerosis in the era of thrombolytic reperfusion. The Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) Study Group. The incidence of minimal residual atherosclerotic coronary obstruction after successful intravenous thrombolytic therapy was evaluated in 799 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Minimal residual coronary obstruction (less than or equal to 50%) was observed on selective coronary angiography performed 90 min after initiation of thrombolytic therapy in 43 patients (5.5%). In 42 other patients (5.4%), a greater than 50% but less than 100% residual stenosis noted at 90 min demonstrated further resolution of obstruction to less than 50% at an angiographic follow-up study 7 to 10 days later. Patients with minimal residual coronary obstruction were significantly younger (52 +/- 10.7 versus 56.7 +/- 10 years; p = 0.002) and had less multivessel coronary disease (p less than 0.001), better initial left ventricular ejection fraction (54 +/- 12% versus 50.2 +/- 11.4%; p = 0.006) and a lower in-hospital mortality rate (1% versus 7%; p = 0.04) than did patients who had a significant (greater than 50%) residual coronary obstruction after intravenous thrombolysis. Long-term follow-up study of patients with a minimal coronary lesion (average 1.5 +/- 0.6 years) and those with significant residual stenosis (average 1.6 +/- 0.7 years) demonstrated that the incidence of death (2.4% in patients with minimal stenosis versus 3.5% in those with significant stenosis) and recurrent myocardial infarction (5% each) were similar in both groups. New strategies are needed to prevent coronary rethrombosis in patients with minimal atherosclerosis after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. 
Effectiveness of glibenclamide on myocardial ischemic ventricular arrhythmias in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Glibenclamide, a hypoglycemic sulfonylurea, is a blocker of the adenosine triphosphatase-modulated potassium ion channels. The opening of these channels in the myocardial cells, induced by acute myocardial hypoxia, can be responsible for ischemic ventricular arrhythmias. To evaluate the antiarrhythmic effects of this drug 19 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients were selected. They had coronary artery disease and evidence on Holter monitoring of ventricular premature complexes or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or both, induced by transient myocardial ischemia. In all patients, 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring was performed to evaluate the number and duration of myocardial ischemic events, the frequency of ventricular premature complexes and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia per minute of ischemia and the percentage of ventricular premature complexes versus total ischemic beats. Selected patients were classified in 2 groups: group A (9 patients) received metformin (placebo) and group B (10 patients) was treated with glibenclamide. On the fourteenth day patients underwent 24-hour control monitoring. Then a crossover between the 2 groups was made and a new Holter monitoring sequence was performed at the end of the second phase. Results indicate that glibenclamide significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced both the frequency of ventricular premature complexes and the episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during transient myocardial ischemia, but did not change the number and duration of acute myocardial ischemic attacks and did not reduce the spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, glibenclamide appears to have an antiarrhythmic effect in preventing ventricular arrhythmias induced by transient myocardial ischemia. 
AAEM minimonograph #11: Needle examination in clinical electromyography. The physiologic and histologic principles underlying clinical electromyographic studies are briefly reviewed as an introduction to the normal and abnormal findings in human subjects. Technical aspects of recordings as well as the specific types of discharges and their significance are discussed. 
Importance of chloride in the development of salt-induced angiotensin II hypertension in rats. This study attempted to evaluate the effect of anion associated with sodium loading on the development of angiotensin II (AII)-induced hypertension in rats. Hypertension was induced by intraperitoneal infusion of AII(125 ng/min) for 12 days via miniosmotic pump (systolic blood pressure on day 12, 143 +/- 3 mm Hg). High dietary intake of sodium chloride significantly augmented the AII-induced hypertension (systolic blood pressure on day 12, 166 +/- 4 mm Hg), but equimolar sodium loading provided as sodium citrate failed to enhance AII hypertension (systolic blood pressure on day 12, 136 +/- 8 mm Hg). Thus, the data suggest that the full expression of salt (NaCl) sensitivity in AII hypertension depends on high dietary intake of both sodium and chloride. 
Concomitant medical disease and headache. The treatment of headache disorders in patients with concomitant medical illness constitutes one of the more challenging areas of headache therapy. As new agents are added to our pharmacologic armamentarium, it will become easier to tailor therapy to our patients. The physician who treats the headache patient with concomitant medical illness must be particularly aware of drug side effects and pharmacology in order to prevent a worsening of underlying medical conditions or an exacerbation of headaches. 
Augmentation of reverse arthus reaction by mast cells in mice. Immune complex-induced injury is an important pathogenic factor in antibody-mediated nephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases. In this study we investigated the role mast cells in immune complex-mediated injury in mouse skin. Reverse Arthus reaction was induced in mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice and their congenic controls (WBB6F1(-)+/+). Serial skin sections were evaluated for neutrophil infiltration, edema, and hemorrhage. In WBB6F1-W/Wv mice the neutrophil influx was only 40% and edema 60% of that in congenic controls. Hemorrhage was also significantly reduced in the mast cell-deficient mice. After mast cell reconstitution, the magnitude of the reaction in WBB6F1-W/Wv was equivalent to that in WBB6F1(-)+/+ mice. Mast cell release in reverse Arthus reaction was evaluated by measuring fluorescence intensity after avidin-FITC staining of mast cell granules. There was a 70% decrease in fluorescence intensity. The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor A-63162 significantly decreased neutrophil accumulation (40%), edema (60%), and hemorrhage in WBB6F1(-)+/+, but not in mast cell-deficient mice. Mast cell reconstitution of WBB6F1-W/Wv mice restored the effect of A-63162. The results indicate that mast cells and their mediators, including leukotrienes, make an important contribution to reverse Arthus reaction. 
The significance of myoclonic status epilepticus in postanoxic coma. We report 11 adults who exhibited myoclonic status epilepticus (MSE) after cardiac arrest. Based on pathologic, electroencephalographic, and clinical evidence, we conclude that our patients died from the initial anoxic-ischemic insult rather than as a result of MSE. We suggest that the seizures in these nonsurvivors were self-limited events arising from lethal damage to neurons. Thus, in patients with bilaterally synchronous facial myoclonus, bilateral loss of pupillary or oculovestibular reflexes, and suppression and burst-suppression on EEG, it is not warranted to use anesthetic barbiturates to treat MSE. 
Cyst of the ligamentum flavum: report of six cases. Six cases of cyst of the ligamentum flavum with compression of a lumbar nerve root are reported. All patients exhibited recurrent back pain and sciatica. Investigation included computed tomography, myelography, or both. The correct diagnosis was reached before operation in only half the patients. High-resolution computed tomography performed in the four last patients outlined the cystic lesion with its low-density center. Surgical excision was performed in all patients. Microscopic examination showed a dense fibrous cyst arising from the ligamentum flavum. The lumen contained myxoid or necrotic material, but no epithelial lining. Cysts of the ligamentum flavum must be considered in the differential diagnosis of causes of sciatica. A firm radiological diagnosis may, at present, still require myelography combined with high-resolution computed tomography. Differentiation from synovial or ganglion cysts of the spine is discussed. 
Acute lower limb ischemia: failure of anticoagulant treatment to improve one-month results of arterial thromboembolectomy. A prospective randomized multi-center study. The value of short-term anticoagulant treatment in improving the early outcome in patients operated on for acute lower-limb ischemia has been debated and so far unproven. In this prospective randomized multi-center study, 188 such patients were randomized on admission, either to preoperative and postoperative anticoagulant medication (AC group, n = 94) or no anticoagulant treatment during the first month after surgery (O group, n = 94). Background factors were evenly distributed in the two groups, and 89% of the cases were considered as embolic. Analysis on an intention-to-treat basis showed no differences in outcome after 30 days. Good results, survivors who had amputation, and patients who died in the two groups are given respectively: AC group, 61%, 9%, 30%; O group, 65%, 11%, 24%. The results were similar in the two treatment groups also if only patients with a cardiac source of embolism were analyzed. Local bleeding complications were more common in the AC group (17% vs 2%, p less than 0.01). It is concluded that preoperative and early postoperative anticoagulant medication should not be routinely administered since such treatment is unlikely to improve the short-term results of lower-limb arterial thromboembolectomy while bleeding complications increase. The possible value of late (beyond 1 month) long-term anticoagulant treatment remains to be studied. 
Distribution of carbon flux within fatty acid utilization during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Twenty-nine intact, working pig hearts were extracorporeally perfused and divided into two study groups (16 Aerobic and 13 Ischemic/Reflow hearts). Step function, equilibrium labeling with [14C]palmitate was used to develop uptake and washout curves of radioactive fatty acid products contained in coronary effluent during either aerobic perfusion or reperfusion after ischemia (60% reduction in left anterior descending coronary flow for 30 minutes). Left anterior descending control flows were slightly overperfused in Aerobic hearts (18% higher than in Ischemic/Reflow hearts); otherwise, circumflex and right coronary flows, left ventricular pressure, and serum fatty acids and blood sugar levels were comparable between groups. As expected in Ischemic/Reflow hearts, recovery of regional systolic shortening and myocardial oxygen consumption in reperfusion was only modestly impaired (-20% and -19%, respectively, not significant and p less than 0.011 compared with preischemic values, not significant from Aerobic hearts). The only significant metabolized product to be released from labeled fatty acid utilization in either group was 14CO2. A smaller fatty acid pool also was measured and accounted for by that contained in the coronary intravascular volume. We could determine no significant back diffusion of fatty acids from myocardium in either perfusion condition. Uptake time constants of the early phase of 14CO2 production also were virtually identical in both groups (19.9 +/- 3.2 versus 16.7 +/- 3.2 minutes in Aerobic and Ischemic/Reflow hearts, respectively) and strongly correlated with hemodynamics as described by heart rate. In washout studies, tissue radioactivity in the aqueous soluble and fatty acid pools declined in both study groups, and counts in complex lipids and cholesterol/cholesteryl esters remained steady, whereas those in triacylglycerols varied. Washout of 14CO2 in both groups never reached background radioactivity over a 40-minute sampling after cessation of isotope infusion into the perfusate, suggesting slow release of trapped substrate from intracellular pools, which then proceeded to fatty acid oxidation. In conclusion, these experiments have demonstrated very similar findings with respect to fatty acid uptake, storage, and release characteristics between aerobic and reperfused myocardium. We found no differences in preferred substrate utilization and oxidation as a result of reversible ischemia followed by reflow. 
Improved results with the addition of interferon alfa-2b to dacarbazine in the treatment of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. Sixty-four patients with histologically confirmed metastatic malignant melanoma were entered on a prospectively controlled randomized trial. Patients received dacarbazine (DTIC) alone or DTIC plus interferon (IFN) alfa-2b. Patients were reasonably balanced with respect to age, sex, performance status (PS), site of metastases, and number of metastatic sites. Objective response (complete plus partial remission [CR + PR]) was documented in six patients on DTIC and in 16 patients on DTIC plus IFN alfa-2b. Median time to treatment failure (TTF) and median survival are significantly better on the combination arm, with some long-term CRs observed. More toxicity was encountered in the combination arm, which was acceptable except in three patients where treatment was discontinued because of IFN toxicity. 
The cognitive and psychological sequelae of uncomplicated aneurysm surgery. Many patients are left with psychological symptoms after surgery for a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. Often the reason for these symptoms is not clear. A prospective study was carried out of 27 patients who were in a good (Grade 1 or 2) condition before operation to identify the origin of such symptoms and discover whether the basic techniques of aneurysm surgery could lead to serious psychological sequelae even in the absence of any specific complication. Each patient was given a modified psychometric assessment just before surgery and at the time of discharge from hospital. One year later a full psychometric and social assessment was carried out. Even a temporary worsening of psychometric performance did not occur unless there had been some specific surgical or post-operative problem. Five patients showed worsening of psychometric performance in the immediate post-operative period but by one year, only two of the 27 patients showed any abnormalities on formal psychometric evaluation; in both, clear reasons were evident. Although the majority of patients reported minor psychological symptoms, these had not hindered full functional recovery, and we doubt whether they had any organic basis. It is concluded that aneurysm surgery does not, itself, threaten higher intellectual function unless some specific complication occurs. 
Unexplained syncope evaluated by electrophysiologic studies and head-up tilt testing. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical characteristics of subgroups of patients with unexplained syncope having electrophysiologic studies and head-up tilt testing and to assess the efficacy of various therapies. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Inpatient services of a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Eighty-six consecutively referred patients with unexplained syncope. MEASUREMENTS: All patients had electrophysiologic examinations. Patients with negative results subsequently had head-up tilt testing. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine (34%) patients (group 1) had abnormal electrophysiologic results, with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced in 72%. Thirty-four (40%) patients (group 2) had syncope provoked by head-up tilt testing. The cause of syncope remained unexplained in 23 (26%) patients (group 3). Structural heart disease was present in 76%, 6%, and 30% of groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In group 1, pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapy was recommended based on electrophysiologic evaluation. All group 2 patients had negative results on head-up tilt testing while receiving oral beta blockers (27 patients) or disopyramide (7 patients). Group 3 patients did not receive any specific therapy. During a median follow-up period of 18.5 months, syncope recurred in 9 (10%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of electrophysiologic evaluation and head-up tilt testing can identify the underlying cause of syncope in as many as 74% of patients presenting with unexplained syncope. Therapeutic strategies formulated according to the results of these diagnostic tests appear to prevent syncope effectively in most patients. 
Transantral sphenoethmoidectomy: a procedure for the 1990s? Currently, among otolaryngologists, much attention is focused on the surgical management of paranasal sinus disease. However, transantral sphenoethmoidectomy is rarely mentioned in the literature of the past several decades. We reviewed a consecutive series of 98 patients over a 12-year period who underwent transantral sphenoethmoidectomy in the treatment of severe chronic hyperplastic pansinusitis. The major and minor complications encountered are tabulated, as are the clinical outcomes. A description of the operative technique is followed by a discussion of the indications for this approach. We believe transantral sphenoethmoidectomy has a useful place in modern paranasal sinus surgery. 
Deliberate hypotension with nicardipine or nitroprusside during total hip arthroplasty. To induce deliberate hypotension during anesthesia, nicardipine was administered to patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and was randomly compared with nitroprusside. Hemodynamic measurements were performed before and 10, 20, 30, and 60 min after starting to administer either nicardipine (n = 12) or nitroprusside (n = 12) (B, T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively); at the end of drug infusion (T5); and 10, 20, and 60 min later (T6, T7, and T8, respectively). Plasma renin activity and catecholamine levels were measured at B, T1, T5, T6, and T7. In addition, plasma nicardipine concentration was measured in five patients at T1, T2, T5, T7, and T8. As with nitroprusside, nicardipine administration (1-3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, after a titration dose of 4.7 +/- 1.5 mg) resulted in hypotension (up to -34% +/- 3%), a decrease in systemic vascular resistances (up to -49% +/- 4%), and increases in heart rate (up to +17% +/- 6%), cardiac index (up to +37% +/- 8%), plasma norepinephrine (up to +63% +/- 17%) and epinephrine (up to +232% +/- 68%) levels, and plasma renin activity (up to +336% +/- 207%). Ten and 20 minutes after discontinuation of the hypotensive drug, nicardipine led to persistent vasodilation and hypotension, which differed significantly from the hypertensive rebound observed after nitroprusside discontinuation, despite a similar increase in plasma renin activity and catecholamine levels. Our results indicate that after the infusion was terminated, the nicardipine-induced vasodilation was opposed to the vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin II and catecholamines, thus avoiding hypertensive rebound.

During a median follow-up period of 18.5 months, syncope recurred in 9 (10%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of electrophysiologic evaluation and head-up tilt testing can identify the underlying cause of syncope in as many as 74% of patients presenting with unexplained syncope. Therapeutic strategies formulated according to the results of these diagnostic tests appear to prevent syncope effectively in most patients. 
Arrhythmias in heart failure--therapeutic challenges. Electrophysiologic disorders are common at all stages of heart failure due to myocardial mechanical factors, neuroendocrine disturbances, electrolyte abnormalities, or ischemia, and also because of cardiovascular drugs. The prevalence of various forms of heart block, bradycardias, and arrhythmias in heart failure is largely unknown, as is their relationship to the etiology of the syndrome. Complex and multiform ventricular premature beats and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia are common, and their frequency is broadly related to the severity of heart failure. Supraventricular arrhythmias are also common features of the syndrome. The heart failure syndrome has an ominous prognosis. Approximately half the patients die suddenly, but the causal relationship between preexisting arrhythmias and sudden death is not known. Equally vital is knowledge of the influence of drug therapy on the arrhythmias of heart failure, but at present this is scarce and needs further study. 
Headache spectrum in Arnold-Chiari malformation. Exertional headaches in patients with Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM) are well described. We report four patients with Type I ACM and recurrent headaches. These patients presented, respectively, with low spinal fluid pressure headache, migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and migraine with prolonged aura. This report suggests the need for observing patients with recurrent headaches for any physical stigmata of craniovertebral junction anomalies, and the need to exclude ACM in such patients. Possible implications of the association between ACM and different types of headaches are discussed. 
Vocal cord paralysis in the Shy-Drager syndrome. A cause of postoperative respiratory obstruction. A case is presented in which unexpected and persistent postoperative respiratory problems led to the finding of bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis and confirmed the diagnosis of the Shy-Drager syndrome. Anaesthetists should be aware that vocal cord paralysis may be a feature of this uncommon condition, and should consider the possibility of glottic obstruction as a cause of ventilatory difficulties. 
PTA and laser assisted PTA combined with simultaneous surgical revascularization. In this study we investigated the efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and laser percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (LPTA) as an adjunct to surgery in patients with peripheral vascular disease. We report 84 cases of the simultaneous association of direct arterial surgery and angioradiological procedures to treat 82 patients with arterial occlusive disease of the lower limbs. Sixty-five patients (79.2%) were affected by severe claudication and 14 (19.6%) presented with rest pain or gangrene. One patient (1.2%) had signs of acute ischemia. PTA or LPTA were utilized as an inflow procedure in 41 cases (48.8%), as an outflow procedure in 24 (28.6%) and in 19 cases (22.6%) to recanalize an arterial occlusion in the contralateral limb opposite to surgical interventions. Immediate postoperative patency was achieved in 79 cases (94.0%), while in 5 cases (6.0%) it was impossible to perform a satisfactory balloon dilatation. The complication rate was 16.6%: 10 perioperative thromboses, 1 plaque dissection, 1 peripheral embolus, 1 haemorrhage and 1 femoral nerve lesion. No perioperative mortality occurred in this group of patients. Long term patency, analyzed with the life-table method (mean follow-up: 28 months) was respectively 78.0%, 76.3% and 78.9% at 5 years. These data indicate that the combined revascularization technique should always be recommended in properly selected patients because it is less invasive, the surgical risk and operative time are reduced and associated with early and long term cumulative patency rates comparable to those of extensive surgery. 
Study of P wave morphology in lead V1 during supraventricular tachycardia for localizing the reentrant circuit. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a benign form of tachycardia that generally does not require costly evaluation. The purpose of this study was to describe a new sign permitting delineation of the mechanism of SVT by analysis of the P wave in lead V1 and the left atrial electrogram, which may be registered by the esophageal electrode. Among 146 patients with SVT, 72 had a ventriculoatrial interval greater than 70 msec. The P wave in lead V1 during SVT was discernible in 69 of them. The precession of the left atrial electrogram on the P wave in lead V1 was always associated with reentry through a left lateral (n = 37) or posteroseptal (n = 4) accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection. When the P wave in lead V1 preceded or occurred simultaneously with the left atrial electrogram, reentry was through either the AV node or a right-sided accessory AV connection. On the other hand, although the P wave in lead V1 was more frequently negative in reentry through a right-sided connection and positive in reentry through a left-sided connection, the polarity was not specific enough to identify the reentry. The precession of the left atrial electrogram recorded by the esophageal electrode on the P wave in lead V1 during SVT was a specific criterion of reentry through a left accessory AV connection, and this technique could be useful for preliminary localization of the accessory connection before electrophysiologic study. 
Hyperdynamic circulation in a chronic murine schistosomiasis model of portal hypertension. Chronic murine schistosomiasis is a natural disease model of portal hypertension closely mimicking the clinical and histological features of human hepatic schistosomiasis. We studied the splanchnic and systemic hemodynamics in the murine model of schistosomiasis by radioactive microsphere technique. Mice infected with 60 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni (n = 8) were studied hemodynamically 11 wk after the infection and were compared with age-matched healthy controls (n = 11). Mean portal venous inflow in the infected mice (3.82 +/- 0.32 ml/min) was 61% higher than in the healthy animals (2.37 +/- 0.25 ml/min; p less than 0.01). A twofold increase in hepatic arterial flow was also seen in mice with schistosomiasis (0.47 +/- 0.14 ml/min) as compared with controls (0.16 +/- 0.03 ml/min; p less than 0.05), whereas splanchnic arteriolar resistance (60.91 +/- 7.64 vs. 101.21 +/- 11.06 mm Hg.min.ml-1.gm; p less than 0.05) and peripheral vascular resistance (112.05 +/- 14.05 vs 254.53 +/- 29.86 mm Hg.min.ml-1.gm; p less than 0.01) were reduced. There was a significant increase in cardiac index (752 +/- 99 vs. 453 +/- 55 ml.min-1.kg body weight-1; p less than 0.05) and reduction in mean arterial pressure (81.37 +/- 3.09 vs. 101.45 +/- 5.85 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) in the infected animals compared with controls. These observations clearly demonstrate the existence of a hyperdynamic circulatory state in this model of portal hypertension. 
Role of adjuvant therapy in colorectal cancer. After nearly three decades of consistently disappointing adjuvant therapy trials in resectable colorectal cancer, recently emerging results offer some basis for cautious optimism. Adjuvant fluorouracil-containing regimens appear to confer a modest treatment benefit in completely resected colonic adenocarcinomas. The two most promising chemotherapy approaches at present appear to be the fluorouracil-levamisole and fluorouracil-leucovorin regimens. The optimal schedule and dose of these agents remains to be determined. Portal vein chemotherapy infusion studies have yielded promising but inconclusive results to date. As data from completed or ongoing large group studies become available, the role of this modality will be better clarified. In rectal cancer, adjuvant radiotherapy alone has a modest but consistent ability to reduce local recurrence without demonstrating any survival advantage. The optimal dose and sequencing of radiotherapy remains poorly defined. Two completed cooperative group studies strongly suggest that the optimal use of radiotherapy is in combination with chemotherapy. The independent role of chemotherapy in rectal cancer remains unclear. There is suggestive evidence that adjuvant chemotherapy is more effective with rectal cancer than with primaries arising proximal to the peritoneal reflection. Despite the large number of unresolved questions that remain, the following interim treatment recommendations can be made: 1. Patients with Dukes' B and C rectal and colonic adenocarcinomas should be entered into an appropriate adjuvant clinical trial when feasible. 2. Outside the setting of a protocol, there is a sound rationale to treat Dukes' B and C rectal cancer with combination chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy. The chemotherapy could consist of fluorouracil either alone or combined with leucovorin. 3. In more proximal colonic tumors (above the pelvic peritoneal reflection), recently described improvements in survival for patients with Dukes' B disease suggests that adjuvant therapy should be withheld in this group when not participating in a clinical study. Patients with Dukes' C tumors should receive fluorouracil-levamisole. 
Obstructive sleep apnea in children with Down syndrome. Children with Down syndrome have many predisposing factors for the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), yet the type and severity of OSAS in this population has not been characterized. Fifty-three subjects with Down syndrome (mean age 7.4 +/- 1.2 [SE] years; range 2 weeks to 51 years) were studied. Chest wall movement, heart rate, electroculogram, end-tidal PO2 and PCO2, transcutaneous PO2 and PCO2, and arterial oxygen saturation were measured during a daytime nap polysomnogram. Sixteen of these children also underwent overnight polysomnography. Nap polysomnograms were abnormal in 77% of children; 45% had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), 4% had central apnea, and 6% had mixed apneas; 66% had hypoventilation (end-tidal PCO2 greater than 45 mm Hg) and 32% desaturation (arterial oxygen saturation less than 90%). Overnight studies were abnormal in 100% of children, with OSA in 63%, hypoventilation in 81%, and desaturation in 56%. Nap studies significantly underestimated the presence of abnormalities when compared to overnight polysomnograms. Seventeen (32%) of the children were referred for testing because OSAS was clinically suspected, but there was no clinical suspicion of OSAS in 36 (68%) children. Neither age, obesity, nor the presence of congenital heart disease affected the incidence of OSA, desaturation, or hypoventilation. Polysomnograms improved in all 8 children who underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, but they normalized in only 3. It is concluded that children with Down syndrome frequently in have OSAS, with OSA, hypoxemia, and hypoventilation. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is seen frequently in those children in whom it is not clinically suspected. It is speculated that OSAS may contribute to the unexplained pulmonary hypertension seen in children with Down syndrome. 
Blood transfusion and recurrent Crohn's disease. The effect of blood transfusion on the postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease has been investigated. Clinical and pathological data from 197 patients treated by right hemicolectomy between 1947 and 1988 have been analysed. Symptomatic recurrences confirmed radiologically or histologically have been recorded and cumulative recurrence rates calculated for transfused and non-transfused patients. Perioperative blood transfusion does not influence the development of recurrent disease (log rank test, chi 2 = 0.112). 
Tuberous sclerosis with primary meningioma of the maxillary antrum. Primary extracranial meningiomas are uncommon; they have been documented in the ear, skin, orbit, parapharyngeal space, parotid gland, mediastinum, and rarely the paranasal sinuses. Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by multiple connective tissue tumours. We report the first case of a tuberous sclerosis patient with a maxillary antral meningioma. 
Pregnancy-induced hypertension and low birth weight: the role of calcium. Considerable interest has developed regarding the role of calcium in the regulation of blood pressure. Epidemiologic investigations, laboratory evaluations, and clinical trials all confirm that the relationship between calcium and blood pressure extends to include the pregnant state. On the basis of current information it is clear that calcium supplementation during pregnancy lowers blood pressure. Additionally, the effect of calcium on blood pressure may influence the incidence and/or gestational age of development of preeclampsia. Additionally, the effect on smooth-muscle relaxation detected in calcium-supplemented patients may affect the incidence of prematurity. Although the mechanism for these effects has not been entirely elucidated, calcium supplementation appears to affect circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone and renin, which may modulate intracellular ionized calcium, resulting in the observed effect on smooth-muscle relaxation. This effect may also be responsible for reduced uterine activity and for a lowering of the incidence of prematurity. 
Active idiopathic ulcerative colitis in a patient with ongoing HIV-related immunodepression. It is suspected that immune mechanisms are important in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. The following is a case report of a patient with human immunodeficiency virus-related immunodeficiency whose ulcerative colitis ran a course independent of the depression of his peripheral CD4 cells. Thus, peripheral CD4 cells may have little role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. 
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Lack of association between clinical improvement and effects on sleep. Thirteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis (mean +/- SD age 55.8 +/- 10.5 years) received 20 mg of tenoxicam daily for 90 days following a 3-7 day "washout" period and 4 days of placebo treatment. Clinical evaluations were conducted at the end of the washout period and at monthly intervals thereafter. All-night polysomnography was performed in a sleep laboratory during the last 2 days of placebo treatment and on days 13, 14, 89, and 90 of tenoxicam treatment. Although there was improvement in the patients' clinical condition, there were no treatment-related changes in any of the sleep parameters. Eight of the 13 patients, however, were found to have primary sleep disorders. Four had periodic leg movements during sleep, 3 had sleep apneas, and 1 had a combination of both disorders. The implications of these findings in the treatment of sleep disorders in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are discussed. 
Induced hypertension during restoration of flow after temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat: effect on neuronal injury and edema. The effect of hypertension instituted during restoration of flow after focal ischemia was studied. After the middle cerebral artery (MCA) of 12 rats was occluded for 2 hours, the ligatures were released and flow was restored for a period of 2 hours. In the control group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the hypertensive group, the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg immediately after reestablishment of MCA patency. The area of neuronal injury, determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining, was significantly smaller in the hypertensive group. Specific gravity, determined by microgravimetry, did not differ between groups. The data demonstrate that modest hypertension, when induced during reperfusion after 2 hours of MCA occlusion, reduces neuronal injury and does not exacerbate edema formation. 
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of gall stones: an in vitro comparison between an electrohydraulic and a piezoceramic device. A comparative study of the effectiveness of two types of lithotripter in fragmenting gall bladder stones is reported. The machines used were a Piezolith 2300, which generates shock waves by the piezoceramic principle, and a Dornier MPL 9000, which produces the shock waves by underwater spark discharge. With each machine, corresponding stones of 45 pairs of weight and volume matched calculi (median volume 0.5 cm3, median diameter 10.5 mm) obtained at cholecystectomy were treated. All stones were successfully disintegrated (fragments smaller than 2 mm) with up to 5400 (median 628) shocks with the Piezolith and 3450 (median 428) shocks with the MPL 9000 lithotripters. With the Piezolith, operating at the highest power setting, a 1.65 fold median higher number of shocks was required for stone fragmentation than with the MPL 9000 at a medium power setting. Stone volume seemed to be the only determinant which affected ease of fragmentation; composition and density of the stones as assessed by computed tomography did not seem to be governing factors. 
Combined split anterior tibial-tendon transfer and intramuscular lengthening of the posterior tibial tendon. Results in patients who have a varus deformity of the foot due to spastic cerebral palsy. Twenty patients who had a varus deformity of the foot secondary to spastic cerebral palsy had twenty-two operations involving combined split anterior tibial-tendon transfer and intramuscular lengthening of the posterior tibial tendon, with and without concomitant lengthening of the Achilles tendon. Preoperatively, all patients had had a dynamic varus deformity of the hindfoot and adduction of the forefoot in both the stance phase and the swing phase of gait. At an average follow-up of 6.2 years (range, 2.3 to 8.8 years), there were fourteen excellent, four good, and four poor clinical results. Two patients who had a fixed varus deformity of the hindfoot and one patient who had a very weak anterior tibial muscle had a poor result. We concluded that the combined procedure is effective for correction of a flexible varus deformity of the foot in patients who have spastic cerebral palsy. 
Positive regulation of human thyrotropin receptor mRNA by thyrotropin. We have assessed the influence of natural and recombinant thyrotropin (TSH) on mRNA specific for the human TSH receptor (TSHR) in normal and abnormal adult human thyroid monolayer cells. Using physiological concentrations of TSH (less than 100 mU/L), a marked increase in the level of TSHR mRNA was observed within 12 hours and reached a greater than 1000% increase after 24 hours exposure. At high TSH concentrations (greater than 1000 mU/L), this increase in TSHR-specific mRNA was markedly reduced. However, at no time were basal TSHR mRNA levels suppressed even with 100 U/L of TSH for 48 hours. These observations demonstrate ligand-induced up-regulation of the human TSHR mRNA by physiologically relevant concentrations of TSH. 
Spinal and supraspinal correlates of nociception in man. The objective of this work was to simultaneously measure pain-related spinal and supraspinal physiological responses in humans. The sural nerve compound action potential (CAP), the spinal withdrawal reflex (RIII), the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and subjective magnitude ratings were elicited by electrical stimulation of the sural nerve in 10 healthy subjects. The sural nerve CAP was used to normalize the evoking stimulus current and to help identify the peripheral nerve afferent types contributing to the physiological and psychophysical responses. Normalizing stimulus current to a proportion of that which elicited a just maximal sural nerve CAP significantly reduced individual variability in magnitude ratings, the RIII and the SEP. Pain and RIII responses only occurred at stimulus levels that were greater than or equal to 1.5 x that which produced a just maximal sural nerve CAP and both responses were positively related to stimulus intensity above that level. Activity in the large diameter A beta fibers will be saturated at stimulus levels near that which produced a just maximal CAP, which implies that both the pain and RIII responses can be attributed to recruitment of the smaller diameter A delta fibers. Although the amplitudes of the P200 and P300 peaks of the SEP were significantly related to stimulation at noxious levels, both were also affected by stimulation at innocuous levels. This result implies that these peaks receive contributions from both noxious and innocuous somatosensory processes. Clearly, the non-pain-related components of these SEP peaks must be identified and isolated before their potential in measuring supraspinal nociceptive processes can be fully realized. 
Microscopic hematuria: advances in identification of glomerular dysmorphic erythrocytes. The high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of microscopically visible, typically glomerular dysmorphic erythrocytes for identification of the cause of glomerular bleeding have been recognized worldwide. Although glomerular dysmorphic erythrocytes are simple to detect on phase contrast microscopy, immediate microscopic diagnosis still is indispensable, since a change in the morphology of the erythrocytes with restriction of the diagnostic relevance is anticipated because of the high autolytic potency of the urine. It may be postulated that this need for immediate diagnosis has led to the method being neglected owing to the high work load at hospitals and physician offices. Moreover, a physician who does not perform microscopic investigations or who lacks experience with the method will not be able to use this diagnostic technique, since it appeared to be impossible to transport urine samples by mail. In the context of a study comprising 30 patients, of whom 10 had histologically confirmed glomerulonephritis, we have shown that glomerular dysmorphic erythrocytes have a manifest form stability for at least 3 days. The preservative used was thimerosal. Also, the urine can be investigated independent of time even after alcoholic Papanicolaou staining without an alteration of erythrocyte morphology. The practicality of the form stability of glomerular erythrocytes can be exploited in everyday medical routine. There are well founded prospects that the rate of early diagnosis of glomerulonephritis will increase. 
Fasting gastric pH and its relationship to true hypochlorhydria in humans. Abnormally low rates of gastric acid secretion (hypochlorhydria) are associated with bacterial overgrowth, enteric infection, and with hypergastrinemia and an increased risk of gastric neoplasms. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of fasting gastric juice pH measurements to detect true hypochlorhydria. True hypochlorhydria was defined as a peak acid output in response to a maximally effective stimulant of acid secretion that was below the lower limit of normal for 365 consecutive healthy subjects. In these healthy subjects, average basal pH was 2.16 +/- 0.09 in men and 2.79 +/- 0.18 in women. In 109 consecutive experiments in 28 subjects with true hypochlorhydria, fasting gastric pH averaged 7.44 +/- 0.11 in men and 7.65 +/- 0.33 in women. Fasting pH exceeded the upper 95% confidence limit of normal (5.09 in men and 6.81 in women) in 102 of the 109 experiments (94%). Thus, fasting pH measurement was a sensitive method for diagnosing bona fide hypochlorhydria. 
Congenital anomalies in children of patients who received chemotherapy for cancer in childhood and adolescence. BACKGROUND. Many patients who have been treated successfully for childhood cancer with regimens that contain one or more mutagenic chemotherapeutic agents are concerned that their own treatment during childhood or adolescence may adversely affect their children. METHODS. To determine the effect of chemotherapy for cancer during childhood and adolescence on the outcome of subsequent pregnancies, we reviewed the records of 306 men and women who had been treated for pediatric cancer and who responded to our questionnaire. One hundred of the 306 patients reported 202 pregnancies. Among the patients who had received chemotherapy as part of their treatment for cancer, 60 patients or wives of patients had had one or more pregnancies of 20 or more weeks' gestation. The 60 former patients had a total of 100 live-born and 2 stillborn children. RESULTS. The frequency of congenital anomalies was 8.1 percent (5 of 62) among the live-born children of the women and 7.9 percent (3 of 38) among the live-born children of the men. Structural congenital cardiac defects were identified in 10.0 percent (2 of 20) of the children of women who had been treated with dactinomycin, as compared with 0.6 percent (144 of 24,153) among the children in a multicenter survey of fetal anomalies (P = 0.0126). We found no relation between the number of mutagens received or the cumulative dose of any agent received and the frequency of congenital anomalies in the children. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that treatment of children and adolescents with mutagenic chemotherapeutic agents, in the dose ranges we examined, does not increase the frequency of congenital anomalies in the children subsequently born to the former patients. However, the possible adverse effect of dactinomycin on the children of such patients requires further study. 
Repetitive sinoatrial exit block as the major mechanism of drug-provoked long sinus or atrial pause. Prolonged sinus or atrial pause occurred in six patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia after drug administration. All six patients had normal sinus node function during control electrophysiologic study; the sinus cycle length ranged from 510 to 900 ms (mean 743 +/- 141) and the longest sinus node recovery time ranged from 800 to 1,230 ms (mean 1,018 +/- 168). A long sinus or atrial pause occurring at the termination of tachycardia or cessation of atrial pacing, ranging from 3,100 to 8,200 ms (mean 6,270 +/- 1,674), was provoked by the administration of various drugs. These included an intravenous bolus injection of adenosine triphosphate (5 mg; one patient), intravenous bolus injection of verapamil (5 mg; one patient), a combination of a single oral dose of diltiazem (120 mg) and propranolol (20 to 40 mg; three patients), oral diltiazem (240 mg/day; one patient) and a combination of oral diltiazem (240 mg/day) and propranolol (160 mg/day; one patient). In five patients, low frequency deflections suggestive of sinus node activity with a cycle length between 620 and 3,500 ms were recorded during pauses. These findings suggest that repetitive sinoatrial exit block was responsible for the pause. Sinus slowing with a long arrest suggesting suppression of sinus automaticity was also noted in three of these five patients; the longest sinus arrest in these three patients was 4,160, 4,800 and greater than 4,910 ms, respectively. The remaining patient with a pause of 6,840 ms had no recordable sinus activity, either reflecting suppression of sinus automaticity or technical failure. 
Ultrasonographic findings in thalamus and basal ganglia in term asphyxiated infants. Three severely asphyxiated term neonates demonstrated bilateral hyperechogenicity in the thalamus and basal ganglia. During evolution, areas of attenuated echogenicity appeared in these structures at the same time as periventricular cysts were evident in 2 patients with coexistent periventricular leukomalacia. All 3 patients developed ventricular dilatation; in the 2 patients with periventricular leukomalacia, the ventricular border was irregular in the outer (dorsal) margin, and interhemispheric fissures were widened as a manifestation of cerebral atrophy. Furthermore, the thalamic inner (ventral) margins of the lateral ventricles were irregular in all 3 patients. This previously unrecognized finding points to a particular form of cerebral atrophy localized in the gangliothalamic region that contributes to the development of ventriculomegaly. The reported sonographic sequence implies profound damage in the thalamus and basal ganglia in asphyxiated infants which undoubtedly has contributed to the poor outcomes of our patients. 
Laboratory correlates and prognostic significance of granular acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children. A Pediatric Oncology Group study. As part of a comprehensive prospective clinicopathologic study by the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG), 2,092 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were evaluated by uniform morphologic, cytochemical, and immunologic methods to assess the frequency and implications of granular lymphoblasts. All cases were Sudan black or myeloperoxidase negative and met French-American-British (FAB) morphologic criteria for ALL. Granular ALL, characterized by the presence of more than 5% marrow blasts with at least three clearly defined azurophilic cytoplasmic granules, was identified in 56 of the 1,252 fully studied cases (4.5%). The frequency of granular features did not differ among early pre-B (4.3%), pre-B (3.6%), and T (5.8%) ALL; no cases were identified among the 12 patients with B ALL. Within the early pre-B/pre-B group, granular ALL was equally distributed between good- and poor-risk clinical groups but was more frequent among FAB L2 than FAB L1 cases (12% vs. 2%; P less than or equal to 0.001). Patients were treated with standard POG protocols for early pre-B/pre-B and T ALL. Complete remission (CR) rates were significantly lower for those with granular lymphoblasts, regardless of risk group, immunophenotype, or FAB type. Analysis of event-free survival (EFS) showed a significantly poorer outcome for granular early pre-B/pre-B cases with FAB L2 morphologic characteristics (P less than 0.001) and for those classified as poor risk (P = 0.015). These findings suggest a relationship between granules and L2 morphologic characteristics in childhood ALL and indicate that the presence of granular lymphoblasts conveys a worse prognosis for certain subgroups of children with ALL. 
Lymphomas of true histiocytic origin. Expression of different phenotypes in so-called true histiocytic lymphoma and malignant histiocytosis. The authors determined the phenotypes of neoplastic cells in true histiocytic lymphoma and malignant histiocytosis by using a large panel of monoclonal antibodies and enzyme histochemistry procedures. Although the phenotypes overlapped slightly, the authors noted a distinct pattern in these tumors. The tumor cells of malignant histiocytosis generally expressed the monocyte markers CD11b, CD11c, CD14, and CD45, especially after induction with phorbol ester. In contrast, the tumor cells of true histiocytic lymphoma exhibited a marker expression very similar to that of Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's disease. These cells expressed markers CD30, 2H9, and 1A2, but rarely expressed CD11b, CD11c, CD14, or CD45. Regardless of their cytologic features, the tumor cells from both types of histiocytic lymphoma exhibited diffuse nonspecific esterase and acid phosphatase activities, and they expressed histiocyte markers CD15, CD68, LN5, 1E9, and M387 to varying degrees. The tumor cells from both lymphomas did not exhibit T- or B-cell markers, T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, or gene translation products, even when they were induced with phorbol ester. The phenotypic expression in these two histiocytic malignancies suggests that they are derived from different types of histiocytes, or from histiocytes in different stages of maturation or differentiation, or from histiocytes that have distinct mechanisms of tumorigenic transformation. The expression of circulating monocyte markers in malignant histiocytosis suggests that this tumor originates in monocytes or free histiocytes, whereas the phenotype of true histiocytic lymphoma is compatible with an origin in fixed histiocytes, which generally are devoid of the monocyte markers CD11b and CD14. 
Hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis: report of two cases and review of the literature. The cases of two patients with idiopathic pachymeningitis hypertrophica that caused progressive paraparesis are presented. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was used to demonstrate this pathological entity in one patient, and myelography was used in the other. Decompressive surgery led to significant neurological improvement. The etiology, diagnosis, and management of this disease is discussed, and the literature is reviewed. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the features of this rare pathological entity on magnetic resonance imaging. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of vertebrobasilar ectasia in tic convulsif. Case report. A patient with trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm was evaluated using multiplanar magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with gadolinium enhancement. Preoperative images demonstrated massively ectatic vertebral and basilar arteries and their distortion of the brain stem and the trigeminal and facial nerves. Surgical manipulation included selective trigeminal rhizotomy, cushioning of the residual nerve at the point of maximal distortion by the underlying basilar artery, and microvascular decompression of the seventh nerve from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery which was being pushed dorsomedially by the vertebral artery. Postoperatively, the patient had neither trigeminal neuralgia nor facial spasm. Gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging not only excludes other etiologies such as tumor or arteriovenous malformation, but also demonstrates cranial nerve compression by ectatic vertebral and basilar arteries. The choice of preoperative imaging modality is discussed and the literature concerning the etiology of tic convulsif is reviewed. 
Prevention of restenosis by lovastatin after successful coronary angioplasty. Prevention of restenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) remains a major challenge. To determine whether lovastatin could prevent restenosis, between December 1987 and July 1988, a total of 157 patients undergoing successful PTCA were randomly and prospectively assigned to the lovastatin group or a control group. Seventy-nine patients received lovastatin (20 mg daily if the serum cholesterol level was less than 300 mg/dl and 40 mg daily if the serum cholesterol level was greater than or equal to 300 mg/dl) in addition to conventional therapy (lovastatin group). Seventy-eight patients received conventional therapy alone (control group). Fifty patients in the lovastatin group and 29 in the control group were evaluated with coronary angiography at an interval of 2 to 10 months (mean 4 months). The restenosis rate was evaluated according to the number of patients showing restenosis, the number of vessels restenosed, and the number of PTCA sites restenosed. Restenosis was defined as the presence of greater than 50% stenosis of the PTCA site. In the lovastatin group 6 of 50 patients (12%) had restenosis compared with 13 of 29 patients (44.4%) in the control group (p less than 0.001). When the number of vessels restenosed was considered, only 9 of 72 vessels (12.5%) restenosed in the lovastatin group compared with 13 of 34 vessels (38.2%) in the control group (p less than 0.002). Similarly, 10 of 80 (12.5%) PTCA sites restenosed in the lovastatin group compared with 15 of 36 (41.7%) in the control group (p less than 0.001). 
Headaches due to spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection magnetic resonance imaging evaluation and follow up. Spontaneous internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection is not an infrequent cause of headache and acute neurologic deficits in the younger population. Angiography has been the imaging modality of choice for both diagnosis and follow-up. The use of magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), in conjunction with angiography, is described in three patients shown to have ICA dissection. Our clinical findings suggest that MRI may provide a less expensive, non-invasive, diagnostic and particularly a follow up modality in patients with headache and signs suggestive of ICA dissection. 
Prognostic factors in colorectal carcinoma treated by preoperative radiotherapy and immediate surgery. The clinicopathologic staging of colorectal cancer is the subject of recent debate. We studied morphologic variables in a series of tumors resected from 284 patients. Half had been prospectively, randomly allocated to receive a 4-day schedule of preoperative pelvic radiotherapy followed by immediate surgery. There was a significant (P less than 0.01) difference in the distribution of tumors of various histopathologic grades between irradiated (XS) and unirradiated (S) patients and borderline differences in the predictive values of venous spread, tumor grading, and local spread. However, these differences were less marked in 180 tumors examined by one review pathologist. They were thought to be due to misinterpretation of changes induced by radiotherapy. No differences were detected in the distribution of tumors of various sizes and Dukes' stage in the XS and S groups. The review pathologist recorded a borderline (P = 0.049) difference in the distribution of tumors of various CEA staining patterns between the XS and S groups. In a Cox regression model. Dukes' staging remained the most important predictive variable for survival and pelvic recurrence in the XS and S groups. Dukes' staging was apparently unchanged by this schedule of preoperative radiotherapy, but Broders' grading may be unreliable. Any new clinicopathologic staging system for colorectal cancer should record when preoperative radiotherapy is delivered. More studies of radiotherapy effects are required. 
Chlamydia trachomatis in the etiology of acute otitis media. In an effort to show that Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) may be involved in the causation of acute otitis media (AOM), we performed three experiments. In the first, we inoculated the tympanic bullae of 6 chinchillas with CT. Five of the 6 inoculated animals developed CT AOM. In the second experiment, we sprayed the nasopharynx of 10 chinchillas with CT. Of these, 8 developed both pharyngitis and AOM, and in 6, live CT was cultured from the middle ear and pharynx. In the third experiment, 5 chinchillas had their conjunctiva inoculated with CT. Three developed CT conjunctivitis. Of these, 2 developed CT pharyngitis and 1 developed CT AOM. We concluded that CT will cause AOM in the chinchilla by direct inoculation into the middle ear as well as indirectly by infection of the nasopharynx and conjunctiva. 
Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator followed by heparin compared with heparin alone for refractory unstable angina pectoris. Patients with unstable angina pectoris who remain symptomatic despite medical treatment are at high risk of death and myocardial infarction. The incidence of refractory unstable angina was examined in a consecutive series of 103 patients who received conventional medical treatment with nitrates, beta blockers, calcium antagonists and aspirin. During 48 hours of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, 24 patients had greater than or equal to 1 anginal attack, 5 of whom had both painful and painless ischemic episodes. In these 24 patients with unstable angina refractory to conventional medical treatment, the short-term efficacy of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) followed by heparin was assessed and compared with heparin alone in a randomized double-blind trial. Recurrences of ischemic attacks during a 72-hour follow-up period were documented in 9 of the 12 patients given heparin alone. All patients experienced at least 1 symptomatic ischemic episode and 1 patient had both painful and painless ischemia. No patient given rt-PA plus heparin had either symptomatic or asymptomatic ischemic attacks during follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves analysis demonstrated a significantly higher probability of being ischemia free in the group of patients treated with rt-PA followed by heparin than in the group treated with heparin alone (p less than 0.01). Quantitative coronary arteriography failed to reveal any significant changes of ischemia-related lesions before and after each treatment. This study demonstrates that the combination of rt-PA and heparin has a greater protective effect than heparin alone in treating recurrent ischemic episodes in patients with refractory unstable angina. 
Is melanoma changing? Nine hundred ninety-five cases of melanoma of the head and neck were divided into two groups so that certain comparisons could be made concerning the behavior of melanoma over a 55-year period. One hundred twelve melanomas of the ocular system were excluded from this review. The first group consisted of 660 melanomas seen during a period from 1932 to 1972. The second group consisted of 223 melanomas seen during a period from 1973 to 1987. Thirteen parameters, including sex, age, distribution, pre-existing mole, amelanotic melanoma, delay in diagnosis, classification, levels, local recurrence, regional metastasis, systemic metastasis, morbidity, and survival, were studied to assess the behavior and the variations. There is no question that the most important aspect of the favorable changes that have occurred are because of earlier diagnosis and better management by a larger group of well-trained specialists. There are some subtler changes that could possibly indicate biologic alterations, but this requires more time and study to substantiate. 
A controlled study of disruptive vocalizations among geriatric residents in nursing homes. This paper reports the results of a controlled study comparing geriatric residents in nursing homes who displayed disruptive vocalizations with residents in a comparison group. Two 350-bed nursing homes were surveyed, and it was found that 11% of the residents engaged in disruptive vocalizations, at least once per week, of sufficient severity to require consideration in the resident's care plan. Results show that disruptive vocalizers were more functionally impaired and were more likely to receive a diagnosis of dementia. They were also more likely to display a higher activity level and to experience sleep disturbance and to be prescribed neuroleptic medications. Descriptive data are presented on typology of disruptive vocalizations, likely situations for their occurrence, and the utilization and perceived efficacy of common interventions. Suggestions are made regarding behavioral treatments for this vexing problem. 
Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and physical and cognitive performance at 17 years of age. To estimate the effect of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia on long-term cognitive ability in full-term newborns with a negative Coombs test, we performed a 17-year historical prospective study of 1948 subjects. Intelligence tests and medical examinations performed at the military draft board were stratified according to serum bilirubin concentration. A logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for the confounding effects of gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score, ethnic origin, socioeconomic class, paternal education, birth order, and the administration of phototherapy and exchange transfusion. No direct linear association was shown between neonatal bilirubin levels and intelligence test scores or school achievement at 17 years of age. However, the risk for low intelligence test scores (IQ score less than 85) was found to be significantly higher (P = .014) among full-term male subjects with serum bilirubin levels above 342 mumol/L (20 mg/dL) (odds ratio, 2.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-6.79). This association was not observed among female subjects. We conclude that severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, among full-term male newborns with a negative Coombs test, could be associated with lower IQ scores at 17 years of age. 
Evolution of the treatment of the injured colon in the 1980s. During the past 10 years, 1006 patients with colon injuries were treated in an urban trauma center. Primary repair, including suture repair and resection with anastomosis, was performed in 614 patients (61%), colostomy in 284 patients (28%), and exteriorized repairs in 83 patients (8.3%). In the remaining 25 patients (2.5%) who were exsanguinating, the colon injuries were ligated. Independent risk factors for adverse outcomes (defined as a fecal fistula, abdominal abscess, stomal complication, or death from multisystem failure) were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. These factors were used to match patients at similar risk within different treatment groups, and odds ratios for each treatment were calculated. The odds ratios for primary repair, colostomy, and exteriorized repair were 1.0, 1.9, and 2.0, respectively. Therefore, the chance of an adverse outcome was twice as great for both exteriorized repair or colostomy as for primary repair. It is concluded that further increases in the use of primary repair are warranted.
