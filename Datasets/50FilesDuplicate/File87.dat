Prospective randomized evaluation of ciprofloxacin versus piperacillin plus amikacin for empiric antibiotic therapy of febrile granulocytopenic cancer patients with lymphomas and solid tumors. The European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer International Antimicrobial Therapy Cooperative Group. Empiric therapy for febrile granulocytopenic patients is mandatory, but whether monotherapy is a safe alternative and whether fluoroquinolones are useful agents for this indication are still controversial issues. The use of monotherapy with intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 to 300 mg every 12 h) was evaluated against combined therapy with piperacillin plus amikacin in febrile granulocytopenic patients with solid tumor or lymphoma. The study was discontinued prematurely because patients treated with ciprofloxacin had a significantly lower overall success rate than patients treated with piperacillin plus amikacin (31 of 48 patients [65%] versus 48 of 53 patients [91%], P = 0.002). Patients with gram-positive coccal bacteremia had a particularly poor outcome: therapy failed for six of eight patients (75%) treated with ciprofloxacin, while therapy failed for none of four patients treated with piperacillin plus amikacin. Death from primary infection during initially randomized protocol therapy occurred in 7 of 48 patients (14.5%) treated with ciprofloxacin and in 3 of 53 (6%) treated with piperacillin plus amikacin. This study does not support the use of this dose of intravenous ciprofloxacin as empiric monotherapy for fever in granulocytopenic patients. 
Late results of two hundred seventeen femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments. A 10-year-experience of 217 femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments in 207 patients is reported. Thirty-three femoropopliteal bypasses (15%) were performed with reversed saphenous vein and 184 (85%) with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Operative indications were gangrene in 121 (56%), nonhealing ulceration in 40 (18%), ischemic rest pain in 51 (24%), and claudication in 5 (2%) cases. The 5-year primary graft patency rate of these bypasses was 59% (reversed saphenous vein, 74%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 55%; p less than 0.05), the secondary 5-year graft patency rate was 61% (reversed saphenous vein, 79%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 56%; p less than 0.05), and the 5-year limb salvage rate was 78% (reversed saphenous vein, 78%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 78%). The 30-day operative mortality rate was 10%, and the 5-year patient survival rate was 38%. Eleven patients (5%) required lower extremity amputation because of progressive gangrene or extensive infection despite a patent bypass to an isolated popliteal artery segment. We conclude that femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments (1) have acceptable 5-year graft patency and limb salvage rates; (2) should be performed with reversed saphenous vein grafts when possible; (3) may be performed with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts if necessary, with a resulting limb salvage rate equal to that of reversed saphenous vein grafts; and (4) require sequential extension to an infrapopliteal artery in up to 20% of patients. In addition, the presence of an isolated popliteal artery segment is associated with a high operative mortality rate and limited life expectancy because of coronary artery disease. 
Pathogenetic mechanism of stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation: follow-up of stroke patients with and without atrial fibrillation. Stroke patients with brain infarction and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF, n = 88) or sinus rhythm (SR, n = 188), treated at a population-based stroke unit, were studied for 5 years. Within 1 month, 13% of NVAF and 2% of SR patients (P less than 0.01) had either a stroke recurrence or systemic embolism. After 5 years, the corresponding figures were 26 and 25%, respectively. The 1-month and 5-year mortality values were 35 and 78% in the NVAF group vs. 7 and 52% in the SR group (P less than 0.01). Age, ischaemic heart disease and function group on arrival at the hospital were independent risk factors for death. The main cause of death was ischaemic heart disease in the NVAF group, and complications to the initial stroke or a stroke recurrence in the SR group. Thus a higher risk of death, stroke recurrence and peripheral embolism was evident only during the first month after stroke. 
Applications and transfer of technology to the nations of the South. Biotechnology and the control of childhood enteric infections. The optimal use of biotechnology to address the health care needs of developing countries entails the formation of interdisciplinary working groups linking basic biomedical scientists with public health workers, epidemiologists, physicians, and social scientists. Their mission should be congruent with and guided by the public health goals and primary care program of the country or region. Moreover, their research and development activities should lead to products that address a specific need and which are evaluable, cost-effective, and readily transferred to the public health sector. With respect to the enteric infections of childhood, the essential components of an integrated control effort are a field site where infections of this kind are common and readily studied; a local public health laboratory where the performance of new products can be tested and where technology transfer can occur; a basic science laboratory where molecular pathogenicity studies lead to new diagnostic tests, vaccines, and drugs; and a production laboratory where these products can be refined and prepared in sufficient amounts for field testing. This strategy is now being evaluated for the control of infantile diarrhea through the combined use of epidemiologic investigations, DNA probe and amplification techniques, and molecular fingerprinting. Together, these methods are yielding new information about microbial reservoirs and transmission systems; in turn, this information should lead to highly focused public health interventions. 
Monitoring, reentry, and relapse prevention for chemically dependent health care professionals. Monitoring and reentry programs for chemically dependent health care professionals are increasingly being recognized as important components of recovery efforts targeted at this population. Such monitoring and preventive programs should incorporate certain eligibility requirements, patient-monitoring program contracts, recovery maintenance activities and adjuncts, work-site assessments and reentry recommendations, random body fluid analysis, relapse management, and clear explanations of financial responsibility. Monitoring and reentry programs need to be fully integrated within the spectrum of resources available to health care professionals. 
Limb salvage for osteosarcoma in the 1980s. The incidence of local recurrences following limb salvage performed by experienced surgeons with wide surgical margins and with the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is sufficiently low (5%-10%) so as not to have a biologically statistically significant impact on the long-term survival rate. Following limb salvage, the incidence of morbidity increases with a few patients occasionally requiring prolonged or repeated hospitalizations and further surgical procedures, even amputation. The durability of the reconstructions is variable, and many of the mobile knee reconstructions may need to be revised if the patients become long-term survivors. The function of salvaged limbs is better than that after the alternative amputation, but none of the reconstructions will give normal function. Finally, no matter which type of surgery on the lower extremity is selected, patients will have a good early psychosocial adjustment if no premorbid psychosocial disorder is present. 
The effect of sterile water blocks on low back labor pain. To evaluate the analgesic effect of intradermal sterile water blocks, 272 women in labor complaining of severe low back pain were randomly assigned to treatment with either sterile water or saline solution blocks. Pain intensity was assessed on a visual analog scale, before the blocks were given and again 1 and 2 hours later. The groups were equal with regard to age, parity, fetal size, progression of labor, and initial pain scoring. Pain scoring 1 and 2 hours after the blocks were given showed a significantly higher degree of analgesia in the sterile water group. No adverse effects were noted, and patient acceptability was high. 
Hereditary sacral agenesis with presacral mass and anorectal stenosis: the Currarino triad. A family with autosomal dominant inheritance of sacral agenesis is described. Ten members were affected; four had associated presacral teratomas and anterior sacral meningoceles, giving rise to serious complications in three, including bacterial meningitis, local recurrence of teratoma and perianal sepsis. Three of those with presacral masses presented initially with anorectal anomalies. Other associated abnormalities included tethering of the cord, hydrocephalus, duplex ureter, hydronephrosis, vesicoureteric reflux, neurogenic bladder, bicornuate uterus, rectovaginal fistula and hereditary spherocytosis. Early diagnosis and surgical excision of a presacral mass is advised to prevent future morbidity and mortality. 
Adenocarcinoma of the prostate involving 2 cell types (prostate specific antigen producing and carcinoembryonic antigen producing) with selective metastatic spread. Of 3 patients with clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate 2 were treated by radical prostatectomy and 1 was treated with radiation therapy. Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) values were elevated before therapy. After treatment the PSA levels were decreased to zero. All 3 patients later had evidence of metastatic tumor spread to the liver with elevation of serum carcinoembryonic antigen but not PSA. Immunohistochemical staining of the 2 primary tumors from the prostatectomy specimens identified 2 cell clones, one immunoreactive to PSA and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and nonimmunoreactive to carcinoembryonic antigen, and the other immunoreactive to carcinoembryonic antigen but not PSA or PAP. Biopsy of a hepatic metastasis in 2 patients confirmed anaplastic carcinoma of the carcinoembryonic antigen-producing cell type. Immunohistochemical staining of a lymph node metastasis identified the PSA-producing cell type only. Such results suggest selective metastatic spread of each cell type to its own organ tropic site. Occasional carcinoembryonic antigen-producing prostate cancers may metastasize to the liver. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen measurements occasionally may be useful in the management of certain prostate adenocarcinoma patients. 
Reduced postoperative hospitalization after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. An initial experience of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 50 consecutive patients was reviewed and the results compared with those of a group of 25 patients who underwent laparotomy cholecystectomy during the 3 months before the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully performed in 44 of 50 consecutive patients in whom it was attempted. When compared with laparotomy, laparoscopy cholecystectomy was associated with longer mean (s.d.) anaesthesia, 155 (61) min versus 102 (31) min (P less than 0.001), shorter mean postoperative hospital stay, 3.5 (1.5) versus 8.8 (3.2) days (P less than 0.001), and reduced mean cost, pounds 895 (376) versus pounds 2210 (822) (P less than 0.001). Perioperative morbidity was also reduced following laparoscopy cholecystectomy (9 per cent versus 16 per cent) but not significantly so. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe, effective procedure which completely removes the gallbladder. It significantly reduces hospital stay, is cosmetically satisfactory and has financial benefits. We suggest that this technique be considered for all patients having cholecystectomy. 
Fulminant hepatic failure due to acute hepatitis B and delta co-infection: probable bloodborne transmission associated with a spring-loaded fingerstick device. Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) due to acute hepatitis B and delta co-infection occurred in a 74-yr-old female, who eventually died. There was no clear-cut epidemiology other than probable bloodborne transmission from a contaminated spring-loaded fingerstick device used for glucose determination, in an outpatient facility. This unusual mode of transmission reiterates the importance of using sterile cleansing and disposal procedures anytime there is a possibility of contamination with blood. 
Collinear nutrients and the risk of colon cancer. The relationship between colon cancer risk and the relative contributions of fat and caloric intake are assessed. A lack of consensus exists regarding the role of each of these dietary factors in the development of colon cancer. This lack of agreement originates from the high correlations between the nutrients, as well as the manner in which researchers treat these dietary variables in their analyses. Four proposed methods are evaluated which attempt to address the collinearity problem in nutritional epidemiology: (1) exclude one or more collinear variables, (2) use the proportion of calories consumed attributable to each dietary component, (3) use a regression-adjustment approach to purge the collinearity correlated nutrients, and (4) ridge regression. Diagnostic tests are reported which assess the degree of collinearity on data collected for a case-control study of colon cancer conducted in Utah between 1979 and 1983. Using logistic regression analyses, we apply each of these methods to case-control data. We find that the risks associated with fat and caloric consumption are extremely sensitive to a priori analytic decisions made by epidemiologist about the underlying collinearity problem. 
Cerebral blood flow and carbon dioxide reactivity in children with bacterial meningitis. We examined total and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) by stable xenon computed tomography in 20 seriously ill children with acute bacterial meningitis to determine whether CBF was reduced and to examine the changes in CBF during hyperventilation. In 13 children, total CBF was normal (62 +/- 20 ml/min/100 gm) but marked local variability of flow was seen. In five other children, total CBF was significantly reduced (26 +/- 10 ml/min/100 gm; p less than 0.05), with flow reduced more in white matter (8 +/- 5 ml/min/100 gm) than in gray matter (30 +/- 15 ml/min/100 gm). Autoregulation of CBF appeared to be present in these 18 children within a range of mean arterial blood pressure from 56 to 102 mm Hg. In the remaining two infants, brain dead within the first 24 hours, total flow was uniformly absent, averaging 3 +/- 3 ml/min/100 gm. In seven children, CBF was determined at two carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) levels: 40 (+/- 3) mm Hg and 29 (+/- 3) mm Hg. In six children, total CBF decreased 33%, from 52 (+/- 25) to 35 (+/- 15) ml/min/100 gm; the mean percentage of change in CBF per millimeter of mercury of PCO2 was 3.0%. Regional variability of perfusion to changes in PCO2 was marked in all six children. The percentage of change in CBF per millimeter of mercury of PCO2 was similar in frontal gray matter (3.1%) but higher in white matter (4.5%). In the seventh patient a paradoxical response was observed; total and regional CBF increased 25% after hyperventilation. Our findings demonstrate that (1) CBF in children with bacterial meningitis may be substantially decreased globally, with even more variability noted regionally, (2) autoregulation of CBF is preserved, (3) CBF/CO2 responsitivity varies among patients and in different regions of the brain in the same patient, and (4) hyperventilation can reduce CBF below ischemic thresholds. 
A direct effect of hyperinsulinemia on serum sex hormone-binding globulin levels in obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. To determine whether hyperinsulinemia can directly reduce serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, six obese women with this disorder were studied. Before study, ovarian steroid production was suppressed in each woman by the administration of 7.5 mg of a long-acting GnRH agonist, leuprolide depot, im, on days -56, -28, and 0. This resulted in substantial reductions in serum concentrations of testosterone (from 1.72 +/- 0.29 nmol/L on day -56 to 0.32 +/- 0.09 nmol/L on day 0), non-SHBG-bound testosterone (from 104 +/- 16 pmol/L on day -56 to 19 +/- 5 pmol/L on day 0), androstenedione (from 7.25 +/- 1.65 nmol/L on day -56 to 2.78 +/- 0.94 nmol/L on day 0), estrone (from 371 +/- 71 pmol/L on day -56 to 156 +/- 29 pmol/L on day 0), estradiol (from 235 +/- 26 pmol/L on day -56 to 90 +/- 24 pmol/L on day 0), and progesterone (from 0.28 +/- 0.12 nmol/L on day -56 to 0.08 +/- 0.02 nmol/L on day 0). Serum SHBG levels, however, did not change (18.8 +/- 2.8 nmol/L on day -56 vs. 17.8 +/- 2.6 nmol/L on day 0). While continuing leuprolide treatment, the women were administered oral diazoxide (300 mg/day) for 10 days to suppress serum insulin levels. Diazoxide treatment resulted in suppressed insulin release during a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (insulin area under the curve, 262 +/- 55 nmol/min.L on day 0 vs. 102 +/- 33 nmol/min.L on day 10; P less than 0.05) and deterioration of glucose tolerance. Serum testosterone, androstenedione, estrone, estradiol, and progesterone levels did not change during combined diazoxide and leuprolide treatment. In contrast, serum SHBG levels rose by 32% from 17.8 +/- 2.6 nmol/L on day 0 to 23.5 +/- 2.0 nmol/L on day 10 (P less than 0.003). Due primarily to the rise in serum SHBG levels, serum non-SHBG-bound testosterone levels fell by 43% from 19 +/- 5 pmol/L on day 0 to 11 +/- 4 pmol/L on day 10 (P = 0.05). These observations suggest that hyperinsulinemia directly reduces serum SHBG levels in obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome independently of any effect on serum sex steroids. 
The origin of pain in optic neuritis. Determinants of pain in 101 eyes with optic neuritis. In 101 eyes with either anterior or retrobulbar optic neuropathy of ischemic or inflammatory origin, ocular pain occurred significantly more often with retrobulbar optic neuropathy. The association of pain with posterior optic nerve lesions supports Whitnall's hypothesis that the pain of optic nerve inflammation is caused by traction of the origins of the superior and medial recti on the optic nerve sheath at the orbital apex. Eye pain reflected neither severity nor origin of optic neuropathy. 
Transcutaneous oxygen tensions in assessing the treatment of healed venous ulcers Transcutaneous oxygen tension (Ptc,O2) was assessed as an indicator of risk of reulceration in 68 limbs with healed venous ulcers. Ptc,O2 was also used to assess two methods of ulcer prophylaxis. Measurements were made over the gaiter skin, the healed ulcer and the upper arm. The results were expressed as a ratio of the lower limb readings over those taken from the arm. Patients were randomized, after the ulcer had healed, to elastic stockings and stanozolol, or elastic stockings and surgical ligation of incompetent superficial veins. Patients who declined to participate in the study were prescribed elastic stockings only. Those limbs remaining healed at 12 months had Ptc,O2 ratios remeasured. The Ptc,O2 ratios from limbs that reulcerated were not significantly lower than those from limbs remaining healed. The Ptc,O2 ratio was significantly increased in limbs treated by stanozolol and elastic stockings (P less than 0.05) and by surgery and elastic stockings (P less than 0.05). There was no significant increase in Ptc,O2 in limbs treated by elastic stockings alone. In those treated by surgery and elastic stockings, there was a significant improvement in limbs with normal deep veins (P less than 0.01), but not in limbs with post-thrombotic changes on ascending phlebography. Although these two methods of ulcer prophylaxis improve the Ptc,O2 ratio, a high ratio has not been shown to be beneficial in preventing ulcer recurrence. 
Validation of hourly pain intensity profiles with chronic pain patients. This study examines how empirically derived pain intensity profiles relate to psychological adjustment in chronic pain patients. Hourly pain intensity ratings over the course of a day of 189 chronic pain patients were categorized into 6 groups using a hierarchical regression analysis technique. The profiles reflected linear, curvilinear, multilinear or "no profile" effects. Judges' ratings of pain intensity profiles were found to be less reliable than ratings based on empirical analysis. The majority of patients showed linear profiles while 26% of the patients showed no consistent relationship between hourly pain intensity and time of day. Patients who showed no consistent trend in their pain ratings reported having significantly higher ratings of emotional distress. They tended to have conflicts at home and showed more pain behavior than patients who had a distinct pain profile. Support is given for the potential clinical utility of pain rating profiles. 
Extraspinal causes of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Twelve of 12,125 patients who had been referred during a seven-year period to a specialist in spinal disorders were found to have an extraspinal cause of radiculopathy or neuropathy of the lower extremity. The records of these twelve patients were reviewed retrospectively. The average age of the twelve patients was sixty-five years (range, forty-two to seventy-seven years). The cause of the symptoms was an occult malignant tumor in nine patients and a hematoma, an aneurysm of the obturator artery, or a neurilemoma of the sciatic nerve in the others. The average time from the onset of symptoms to the final diagnosis was eight months (range, one month to two years). The most useful test for determination of the correct diagnosis was computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and bone-scanning of the whole body were of little help in localizing the disease. In four of the twelve patients, an operation was performed on the basis of an incorrect diagnosis. In dealing with elderly patients who have radiculopathy, one should be suspicious that the cause is outside the spine. 
Neurofibromatosis type I--a rare case resulting in conductive hearing loss. Notwithstanding the many similarities, there are important differences between NF1 and NF2. NF1-related neurofibromas, which can number in the hundreds, can occur all over the body. Unique clinical situations, such as the case described here, can occur that test the ingenuity of the physician. Once the presenting problem has been ameliorated, genetic counseling is imperative in this common and at times devastating genetic disease. 
Placental site trophoblastic tumor in a postmenopausal woman. Placental site trophoblastic tumor is a rare neoplasm that arises in the trophoblastic tissue of the placental bed. This case report is unusual because of the patient's advanced age at the time of diagnosis and the favorable response of the disease to chemotherapy. Although the clinical course is benign for most patients with placental site trophoblastic tumor, the malignant variant of the disease is characterized by recurrence, relative insensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy, and death. To the authors' knowledge, the 53-year-old woman reported is the oldest patient with histologically confirmed placental site trophoblastic tumor. Initially, surgery, radiation, and multiagent chemotherapy failed to control vaginal and pulmonary metastatic disease. After administration of four treatment cycles of a "second-line" chemotherapeutic regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and cisplatin, complete clinical and radiologic remission was achieved. The patient's serum level of human chorionic gonadotropin has remained undetectable, and she has been without measurable evidence of disease for 16 months. 
Eyelid gold weights in the management of facial palsy. We reviewed our experiences with 20 patients with established facial palsy who had a total of 24 gold weights inserted. All patients had corneal symptoms: ulceration, exposure keratitis or discomfort abolished. Functional improvement i.e. reduction of lagophthalamos and restoration of the blink reflex was good in our opinion and that of the patients in all cases. Dissatisfaction with the cosmetic result was expressed by two patients due to the prominence of the weight under the thin eyelid skin. Three patients had to have the weight replaced because it was too light. Two patients had their weights removed because of recurrent eyelid infections. In two patients the weights were removed as they had migrated over the tarsal rim. In one of these patients the weight was replaced immediately in the appropriate position, in the other it was not replaced as dissatisfaction had been expressed due to the bulky appearance of the weight under the eyelid skin. 
Gastrointestinal endoscopy and general surgical practice. Surgical endoscopy versus surgeon endoscopists. Endoscopic studies and treatment are a necessary and vital component of General Surgery practice. Since most of the concepts related to therapeutic endoscopy were conceived and developed in the context of surgical science, it is both appropriate and necessary that surgeons continue their involvement with this modality. Furthermore, within the evolution of surgical science, endoscopic tools will continue to be utilized. 
Esophageal involvement in mixed connective tissue disease. A study of esophageal symptoms and function was performed in 21 patients with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). Esophageal involvement was found in 18 cases (85%), in 14 (66%) with typical symptoms, in 15 (71%) with manometric abnormalities and in 11 (57%) with both. The manometric pattern was characterized by reduction of amplitude and coordination of peristaltic waves throughout the esophageal body and reduction of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) competency. In comparison, 38 patients with systemic sclerosis showed a similar but more severe pattern, particularly at the level of the distal esophagus and LES. Thus, although similar, the esophageal involvement in MCTD was not exactly the same as that of systemic sclerosis. Furthermore, in MCTD a correlation between manometric abnormalities and cutaneous involvement was lacking, and this suggests that esophageal disorders are not always linked with clinically evident scleroderma-like features of this disease. Since the diagnosis of MCTD is made in the presence of the clinical picture of more than one connective tissue disease, the detection of esophageal involvement by a sensitive technique such as esophageal manometry in a patient with suspected MCTD may be a useful diagnostic aid. 
Usefulness of ST-segment changes in greater than or equal to 2 leads on the emergency room electrocardiogram in either unstable angina pectoris or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in predicting outcome. To determine the reliability of the admission electrocardiogram in predicting outcome in patients hospitalized for chest pain at rest, 90 patients were randomized into a trial of aspirin versus heparin in unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, and prospectively followed for 3 months. The emergency room admission electrocardiogram was analyzed for ST-segment deviation greater than or equal to 1 mm/lead and T-wave changes. Unfavorable outcomes were recurrent ischemic pain, myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization with angioplasty or surgery. In patients who underwent coronary arteriography, a myocardium in jeopardy score ranging from 0 to 10 was assigned, based on the number of vessels with a diameter stenosis greater than or equal to 70% and the location of the stenoses. Considering all 90 patients, an admission electrocardiogram with ST-segment deviation in greater than or equal to 2 leads had a positive predictive value for adverse clinical events of 79% and a negative predictive value of 64%. In the subset of patients without left ventricular hypertrophy and whose admission electrocardiograms were recorded during chest pain (62 of 90), the positive predictive value of ST deviation in greater than or equal to 2 leads improved to 89% and the negative value to 72%. Of the 62 patients, 53 underwent coronary arteriography. There was a positive linear correlation between the total number of leads with ST-segment deviation and the myocardium in jeopardy score (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001). 
Quantitative relation between increased intrapericardial pressure and Doppler flow velocities during experimental cardiac tamponade. To establish whether a quantitative relation exists between pericardial pressure and respiratory variation in intracardiac blood flow velocities, a spontaneously breathing closed chest canine model of pericardial tamponade was created. In seven dogs, pericardial pressure was sequentially increased in stages from a mean of -4 +/- 1 to 10 +/- 2 mm Hg while aortic and pulmonary Doppler flow velocities, pleural pressure changes (respiratory effort), blood pressure and cardiac output were measured. The variation in the Doppler-detected peak transaortic velocity (AV) during inspiration (IV) increased linearly from -5 +/- 3% at baseline (pericardial pressure -4 mm Hg) to -32 +/- 9% at a pericardial pressure of 10 mm Hg [IVAV = -2 (pericardial pressure)--13.1; r = 0.78, p less than 10(-6)]. The inspiratory variation in the peak transpulmonary velocity increased from 13 +/- 3% at baseline to 71 +/- 19% at a pericardial pressure of 10 mm Hg. The inspiratory variation in the pulmonary Doppler peak velocity (IVPV) was dependent on both pericardial pressure and degree of respiratory effort [IVPV = 3.8 (pericardial pressure) + 2.6 (respiratory effort) + 10.9; r = 0.88, p less than 10(-8)]. Thus, quantitative relations exist between increases in intrapericardial pressure and increases in inspiratory variation of peak aortic and pulmonary flow velocities. Additionally, pulmonary artery flow velocity is influenced more than aortic velocity by intrathoracic pressure. 
Lack of HLA class I antigen expression by cultured melanoma cells FO-1 due to a defect in B2m gene expression. The melanoma cell line FO-1 does not express HLA class I antigens and does not acquire them on the cell surface after incubation with IFN-gamma. Immunochemical studies showed that FO-1 cells synthesize HLA class I heavy chain, but do not synthesize beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-mu). The latter abnormality is associated with lack of beta 2-mu mRNA which remains undetectable in FO-1 cells incubated with IFN-gamma. The defect was identified as a genetic lesion in the B2m gene, since DNA hybridization analysis detected a deletion of the first exon of the 5'-flanking region, and of a segment of the first intron of the B2m gene. HLA class I antigen expression was reconstituted on melanoma cells FO-1 after transfection with the wild-type mouse B2m gene, thereby confirming the abnormality of the endogenous B2m gene. The defect identified in FO-1 cells is distinct from that underlying the lack of HLA class I antigen expression by lymphoblastoid cells Daudi, but is remarkably similar to that causing lack of H-2 class I antigen expression by mouse lymphoblastoid cells R1 (TL-). These results suggest that genetic recombination in the 5' region of the B2m gene is a recurrent mechanism in B2m gene defects. In addition to contributing to our understanding of molecular abnormalities in HLA class I antigen expression by melanoma cells, FO-1 cells represent a useful model for analyzing the role of HLA class I antigens in the biology of melanoma cells and in their interaction with cells of the immune system. 
Effects of calcium antagonists on glomerular hemodynamics and structure in experimental hypertension. The RK, DS, and UNX SHR rats are related models of progressive renal disease characterized by the presence of severe systemic hypertension and reduction in renal mass. In these models, glomerular injury is related to increased glomerular pressure and to kidney and glomerular hypertrophy. As summarized in Table 1, administration of a calcium antagonist reduces the prevalence of glomerular sclerosis in all three models. Calcium antagonists have many effects that might tend to reduce renal injury. Similar to the ACE inhibitors, they may reduce PGC, although a protective effect has been observed in some models despite persistence of marked glomerular capillary hypertension. Calcium antagonists also appear to inhibit compensatory renal growth. The observation that these drugs lessen injury in experimental hypertension has important implications for the treatment of patients with hypertension and renal disease. However, widespread use of calcium antagonists specifically to prevent kidney damage should await the results of controlled clinical trials. 
Histopathologic validation of angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound. BACKGROUND. To establish a histopathologic basis for angioscopic and ultrasound image interpretation we studied 70 postmortem human arterial segments in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used 7- to 9-French fiber-optic angioscopes and 20- to 30-MHz intravascular ultrasound imaging catheters. Three observers assigned an angioscopic and ultrasound image classification to each vessel segment. The image and histological classification categories were then compared. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both methods separately or in combination for normal vessels were each greater than or equal to 95%. The predictive value was better for angioscopy than for ultrasound due to incorrect ultrasound interpretations of normal anatomy in the presence of thrombus. For stable atheroma the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the individual methods were each greater than 90%. However, both angioscopy and ultrasound had classification errors in that disrupted atheroma was identified and classified as stable atheroma. Consequently, the predictive value was 74% for angioscopy and 78% for ultrasound. For disrupted atheroma the sensitivities for angioscopy and ultrasound were only moderate (73% and 81%, respectively), whereas the specificity, accuracy, and predictive value were each high (greater than 90%). For thrombus detection, the specificity, accuracy, and predictive value were high (greater than 93%) for each method. The sensitivity of angioscopy was 100%. However, sensitivity was lower for ultrasound (57%) due to false-negative interpretation of laminar clots in normal vessels and an inability to distinguish disrupted or stable atheroma from intraluminal thrombus. CONCLUSIONS. Contingency analyses showed that each imaging method alone or combined had significant agreement with the results obtained from histology (p less than 0.001). When assessing all cases in which angioscopy and ultrasound were concordant, there was a 92% agreement with the histological classification. 
Systemic effects of collagen-impregnated aortoiliac Dacron vascular prostheses on platelet activation and fibrin formation. To minimize intraoperative blood loss a watertight knitted Dacron aortoiliac prosthesis has been developed by impregnation with bovine collagen. A potential disadvantage is that collagen may be associated with an increase in thrombus formation. We conducted a prospective randomized trial to study the systemic effects of collagen-impregnated prostheses and of aortoiliac operation as such on the coagulation mechanism during the first 10 days after operation. Forty-one patients randomly received either a collagen-impregnated (n = 20) or a nonimpregnated prosthesis (n = 21). Twelve patients who underwent cholecystectomies served as controls. Three markers of the coagulation mechanism were monitored: beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinopeptide A, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products. We found no significant differences in median beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinopeptide A, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product levels between patients in the collagen-impregnated prosthesis group and patients in the nonimpregnated prosthesis group. This indicates that collagen does not stimulate the coagulation cascade any more than conventional Dacron protheses do. In a comparison of patients who underwent aortoiliac reconstruction and patients who underwent cholecystectomies, the results indicated a significant increased platelet activation and fibrin metabolism in aortoiliac reconstruction group compared with the control group. Finally, we observed a significantly higher preoperative fibrin metabolism in patients with vascular disease than in control subjects. This difference is attributable to the high preoperative fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product values in patients with aortic aneurysms. 
Exercise testing and training in patients with peripheral vascular disease and lower extremity amputation. Patients with peripheral vascular disease have a high risk of coronary artery disease. The risk is even greater when the peripheral vascular disease leads to lower extremity amputation. Exercise testing using lower extremity exercise has been the "gold standard" for screening for coronary artery disease, but many patients with peripheral vascular disease and those with amputations have difficulty doing this type of exercise. Arm exercise ergometry has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative for the detection of coronary artery disease in patients who cannot do leg exercise. This test has also been used to determine safe exercise levels and may be able to predict the ultimate level of prosthetic use in amputees. Exercise training with arm ergometry also improves cardiovascular efficiency and upper body strength in poorly conditioned patients. Studies are needed to appreciate fully the role of exercise testing and training in the recovery of these patients after amputation. 
Short-term variation in abnormal antenatal fetal heart rate records. In a retrospective study the relation of reduced fetal heart rate variation to fetal acidemia was analyzed with a computerized system for numeric analysis. Between 1983 and 1987, 78 pregnancies were identified in which at least one record of the fetal heart rate had very low long-term variation. The outcome was analyzed to determine the numeric criteria of fetal heart rate variation that most efficiently detect a fetus that will die (preterminal) or is dying (terminal). Because fetal compromise was found on occasion to be associated with a slow sinusoidal fetal heart rate rhythm that increased measures of long-term variation. It was necessary to define a new index of short-term fetal heart rate variation (the 1/16 minute epoch-epoch variation). This was closely related to long-term variation (r = 0.9) but provided better detection of preterminal records as judged by metabolic acidemia at delivery or intrauterine death. 
Presence of the terminal complement complex (C5b-9) precedes myelin degradation in immune-mediated demyelination of the rat peripheral nervous system. In this study, the terminal complement complex C5b-9 (TCC) was localized by immunocytochemistry at different clinical stages of experimental autoimmune neuritis. Deposits of TCC were found on the surface of Schwann cells and their myelin sheaths, and to some extent in the extracellular space at predilective sites of impending demyelination before onset of clinical signs and for a short period thereafter. Additionally, TCC was deposited on the surface of W3/13 positive leukocytes. No TCC immunoreactivity was seen in the distal stump of transected sciatic nerves 1 to 15 days after axotomy. The early and transient deposition of TCC on Schwann cells and myelin sheaths in experimental autoimmune neuritis before overt demyelination suggests that complement activation plays a pathogenic role in the initiation of immune-mediated myelin damage. The lack of TCC immunoreactivity after nerve transection excludes a nonspecific activation process. The signals involved in local TCC formation in demyelinating peripheral nervous system disorders have yet to be explored. 
The "two week syndrome" associated with injection treatment for chronic pain--fact or fiction? Many patients attending the pain clinic for regular injections of local anaesthetic state that the pain returned "two weeks" ago. This study demonstrates that 85% of these patients have a "return of pain" interval which coincides with the proximity of their next clinic appointment. 
Atrial antitachycardia pacing in children and young adults. Atrial antitachycardia pacing was tested in 23 children and young adults. The majority of these patients had had operative repair of congenital cardiac defects and had both bradycardia and tachycardia. Pacemakers were usually implanted by the transvenous technique using bipolar leads. In each patient it was possible to find a tachycardia termination algorithm that successfully converted the tachycardia. In some patients very complex algorithms were necessary. In each patient it was also possible to find an algorithm that successfully differentiated the abnormal tachycardia from sinus tachycardia. Twelve patients required no antiarrhythmic drugs after pacemaker implantation, while 10 patients required one drug and one patient required two drugs. Eight of 23 patients had symptomatic tachycardias that required reprogramming the pacemaker to a different tachycardia termination sequence. Seven patients required reoperations, five for adapter problems and two for infection or erosion. Cardiac function improved in 15 of the 23 patients. Antitachycardia pacing is a viable option for management of tachycardias in children and young adults. 
Median frequency--a new parameter for predicting defibrillation success rate. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Current American Heart Association guidelines recommend immediate defibrillation of ventricular fibrillation. When this is unsuccessful, there are no guidelines to help determine the optimum time at which to defibrillate after the administration of an alpha-adrenergic agonist. Previous studies have shown that the median frequency of the ventricular fibrillation ECG signal correlates with myocardial perfusion during CPR. We hypothesized that median frequency could predict the success of defibrillation and thus accurately determine the most appropriate time at which to defibrillate during ventricular fibrillation. STUDY POPULATION: Twenty-two mixed-breed swine weighing more than 15 kg were studied. METHODS: Ventricular fibrillation was induced electrically, and the ventricular fibrillation ECG signal was analyzed using fast Fourier analysis. After ten minutes of ventricular fibrillation, mechanical CPR was begun. After three minutes of CPR, the animals received one of three alpha-adrenergic agonists and CPR was continued. Defibrillation was attempted three and one-half minutes after drug administration. The average median frequency 20 seconds before defibrillation was calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of median frequency with respect to defibrillation success were determined. RESULTS: A median frequency of 9.14 Hz had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92.31% in predicting the results of defibrillation in this model. CONCLUSION: The median frequency may serve as a valuable parameter to guide defibrillation therapy during ventricular fibrillation. 
Cysts of the neuraxis of endodermal origin. Five colloid cysts of the third ventricle were compared with two spinal enterogenous cysts to examine the hypothesis that these entities have the same origin from primitive endodermal tissue. All the lesions showed cuboidal and columnar epithelium with mucus containing goblet cells and cilia. Immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin, EMA and CEA was positive in all the colloid cyst and enterogenous cyst epithelium. S-100 was focally positive in three of the colloid and one of the enterogenous cysts while vimentin and GFAP were negative in both. The anatomical distribution of both colloid and enterogenous cysts is reviewed. An illustrative case of an identical cyst within the fourth ventricle is presented. This suggests that the similarities between colloid and enterogenous cysts and the presence of identical lesions along the neuroaxis indicate that these structures are derived from primitive foregut endoderm. 
Septicaemia and adrenal haemorrhage in congenital asplenia. Five patients developed overwhelming infection as a result of congenital asplenia, which was previously unsuspected in all cases. Each illness followed a fulminant course resulting in death within 24 hours. They illustrate the respective roles of Haemophilus influenzae infection (n = 4) and adrenal haemorrhage (n = 4) in this condition. We suggest a management protocol for screening infants with abnormalities of the atria or viscera with splenic ultrasound and examination of a blood film for Howell-Jolly bodies. Vaccination and prophylactic antibiotics should be considered for those at risk. Vigorous use of parenteral antibiotics and steroids in suspected infection is recommended. 
Retrospective long-term follow-up analysis in 21 patients with chordomas of various sites treated at a single institution. Twenty-one patients with chordoma were treated at the Radiation Oncology Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, between 1949 and 1986. Thirteen patients had sacrococcygeal tumors, five had clival tumors, two had nasopharyngeal tumors, and one had a lumbar spine tumor. Nine patients were treated with surgery alone, eight patients with subtotal resection and postoperative irradiation, and four patients with radiotherapy alone after biopsy. The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 74% and 46%, respectively. The 10-year actuarial survival rate was significantly better in patients treated with surgery alone or surgery and irradiation than in those treated with radiotherapy alone (52%, 32%, and 0%, respectively, p = 0.02). Although all patients ultimately suffered a recurrence, those with lumbosacral tumors treated with surgery and irradiation had a longer mean disease-free survival period (6.6 years) than those treated with surgery alone (4.1 years) (p = 0.08). Disease-free survival times of patients with base of the skull tumors was not significantly different between the treatment groups. Irradiation after resection of chordomas appears to increase the time to first relapse in lumbosacral tumors and should be considered after subtotal resection. 
Middle meatus anstrostomy: patency rates and risk factors. Two hundred patients with chronic sinusitis were operated on using functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) techniques. These patients were followed closely over 3 years. Patency of the endoscopic middle meatotomy was recorded using actuarial life-table methods. The overall patency rate of the endoscopic middle meatotomy was 93.55%, and the actuarial patency rate at 36 months was 87.47%. The presence of seasonal allergy with nasal polyps was the most important variable in predicting closure. Middle turbinectomy was the most important variable in predicting patency. Symptoms were evaluated by questionnaire at 1 year. Questionnaire data indicate that 96% of these patients are improved or asymptomatic. 
Striatal function in normal aging: implications for Parkinson's disease. Central to several current theories of the etiology of Parkinson's disease is the premise that the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system degenerates with normal aging. Much of the evidence for this assertion has come from postmortem neurochemical studies. We have used L-6-[18F] fluoro-Dopa and positron emission tomography in 26 healthy volunteers (age range, 27-76 years) to examine striatal and frontal cortical tracer uptake. Data have been analyzed by using a graphical approach to calculate an influx constant (Ki) for L-6-[18F]fluoro-Dopa uptake into the caudate, putamen, and medial frontal cortex of each subject. In the population studied, there was no decline in Ki with age for any of these structures. A series of physiological measurements made on the older subjects also showed few significant changes with age. The positron emission tomographic findings demonstrate preservation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in normal aging. The pathological process causing Parkinson's disease may operate closer to the time of presentation than has been suggested. 
Total peripheral artery occlusions: conventional versus laser thermal recanalization with a hybrid probe in percutaneous angioplasty--results of a randomized trial Increasing the primary success rate in recanalization of peripheral vascular occlusions is one aim of using laser techniques in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. Although reports of lasers enabling recanalization after failure of guide wires have been numerous, direct comparisons of the success of the two techniques in a randomized trial have been few. The results of a randomized trial showed no statistical difference in recanalization of femoropopliteal occlusions between the conventional guide wire and hybrid laser probe. The number of patients with iliac occlusions was small and comparisons are difficult to make, but the findings suggest that the hybrid laser probe has little to offer. Immediate crossover to the alternative method allowed investigation of the relationship between the two methods in practice. Combining the two methods improved the primary success rate from 82% to 91% for femoropopliteal occlusions randomized to laser thermal recanalization and from 74% to 91% for those randomized to conventional recanalization. 
Normal splenic size in infants and children: sonographic measurements. The purpose of this study was to establish guidelines for normal splenic size at different ages by using a simple and reproducible sonographic method. Two hundred thirty patients, from neonate to 20-year-old, had sonography because of abdominal and/or pelvic problems unrelated to the spleen. Findings on sonograms of the liver and kidneys were normal in all cases. Splenic size was measured by obtaining a coronal view that included the hilum, while the patient was breathing quietly. The greatest longitudinal distance between the dome of the spleen and the tip (splenic length) was measured and correlated with age, height, and weight. The following guidelines are proposed for the upper limit of normal splenic length based on this simple, easy to use, one-measurement technique: splenic length no greater than 6.0 cm at 3 months, 6.5 cm at 6 months, and 7.0 cm at 12 months, 8.0 cm at 2 years, 9.0 at 4 years, 9.5 cm at 6 years, 10.0 cm at 8 years, 11.0 cm at 10 years, 11.5 cm at 12 years, 12.0 cm at 15 years or older for girls, and 13.0 cm at 15 years or older for boys. Twenty-two patients with known abnormalities of the spleen were randomly selected and their splenic lengths compared with the proposed guidelines; in each case, the length of the spleen exceeded the upper limit of normal for that age. Normal values of a single measurement of the greatest longitudinal diameter of the spleen, from the dome to the tip measured at the hilum in the coronal plane, were obtained in patients from newborn to 20 years old. 
Coronal alignment after total knee replacement. Maquet's line passes from the centre of the femoral head to the centre of the body of the talus. The distance of this line from the centre of the knee on a long-leg radiograph provides the most accurate measure of coronal alignment. Malalignment causes abnormal forces which may lead to loosening after knee replacement. We report a series of 115 Denham knee replacements performed between 1976 and 1981 using the earliest design of components, inserted with intramedullary guide rods. Patients were assessed clinically and long-leg standing radiographs were taken before operation, soon after surgery and up to 12 years later. In two-thirds of the knees (68%) Maquet's line passed through the middle third of the prosthesis on postoperative films and the incidence of subsequent loosening was 3%. When Maquet's line was medial or lateral to this, an error of approximately +/- 3 degrees, the incidence of loosening at a median period of eight years was 24%. This difference is highly significant (p = 0.001). Accurate coronal alignment appears to be an important factor in prevention of loosening. Means of improving the accuracy of alignment and of measuring it on long-leg radiographs are discussed. 
Insulin resistance. A multifaceted syndrome responsible for NIDDM, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Diabetes mellitus is commonly associated with systolic/diastolic hypertension, and a wealth of epidemiological data suggest that this association is independent of age and obesity. Much evidence indicates that the link between diabetes and essential hypertension is hyperinsulinemia. Thus, when hypertensive patients, whether obese or of normal body weight, are compared with age- and weight-matched normotensive control subjects, a heightened plasma insulin response to a glucose challenge is consistently found. A state of cellular resistance to insulin action subtends the observed hyperinsulinism. With the insulin/glucose-clamp technique, in combination with tracer glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry, it has been demonstrated that the insulin resistance of essential hypertension is located in peripheral tissues (muscle), is limited to nonoxidative pathways of glucose disposal (glycogen synthesis), and correlates directly with the severity of hypertension. The reasons for the association of insulin resistance and essential hypertension can be sought in at least four general types of mechanisms: Na+ retention, sympathetic nervous system overactivity, disturbed membrane ion transport, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Physiological maneuvers, such as calorie restriction (in the overweight patient) and regular physical exercise, can improve tissue sensitivity to insulin; evidence indicates that these maneuvers can also lower blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are also associated with an atherogenic plasma lipid profile. Elevated plasma insulin concentrations enhance very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis, leading to hypertriglyceridemia. Progressive elimination of lipid and apolipoproteins from the VLDL particle leads to an increased formation of intermediate-density and low-density lipoproteins, both of which are atherogenic. Last, insulin, independent of its effects on blood pressure and plasma lipids, is known to be atherogenic. The hormone enhances cholesterol transport into arteriolar smooth muscle cells and increases endogenous lipid synthesis by these cells. Insulin also stimulates the proliferation of arteriolar smooth muscle cells, augments collagen synthesis in the vascular wall, increases the formation of and decreases the regression of lipid plaques, and stimulates the production of various growth factors. In summary, insulin resistance appears to be a syndrome that is associated with a clustering of metabolic disorders, including non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, lipid abnormalities, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
Intrahepatic recurrence after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma complicating cirrhosis. To determine whether a careful evaluation of tumor extension by preoperative computed tomography scan after intra-arterial injection of ultrafluid lipiodol and by intraoperative ultrasound examination reduced the recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma after resection, a series of 47 cirrhotic patients with a single tumor operated on from 1984 was studied. Alphafetoprotein level was less than 100 ng/mL in 26 patients (55%), size of the tumor was less than 5 cm in 28 patients (59%), and capsule was present in 30 patients (63%). The resection was performed with free margin measuring 1 cm or more. The overall cumulative survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 35% and 17%, respectively. Intrahepatic recurrence was observed in 28 patients (60%), located less than 2 cm from the resection margin in only four patients. The cumulative intrahepatic recurrence rate at 3 years was 81% and was significantly higher in patients with tumor greater than or equal to 5 cm and in patients with preoperative alphafetoprotein level of greater than or equal to 100 ng/mL. In this series the cumulative intrahepatic recurrence rate at 5 years was 100%. This high recurrence rate after resection, even with careful evaluation of tumor extension, indicates that liver transplantation might be envisaged for the treatment of cirrhotic patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Body composition in ballet dancers measured by total body electrical conductivity. The purpose of this study was to describe the body composition of adolescent and young adult ballet dancers using total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC). We studied 112 female and 33 male dancers. The mean ages were 15.0 +/- 2.0 and 18.7 +/- 3.1 yr for females and males, respectively. The mean percent body fat (PBF) values were 20.1 +/- 3.6% for the females and 14.5 +/- 4.2% for the males. Age and pubertal development were not significantly related to PBF in the females. Age and pubertal status were significantly inversely related to PBF in the males. There was no difference in dance history, percent body fat, and abdominal/hip or waist/hip ratios in eumenorrheic vs amenorrheic dancers. Estimated calorie intake indicated that dancers with menstrual abnormalities had lower calorie intake than those with normal menses. This is the largest group of ballet dancers whose body composition has been studied. Our PBF measurements are higher than in previous reports using hydrodensitometry, which may have underestimated body fat by not accounting for the increased bone density in the lower extremities of dancers. Our data suggest that previous measurements of PBF in dancers are underestimates; these new data challenge our concept of PBF values in dancers. 
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding following open heart surgery. Predominant finding of aggressive duodenal ulcer disease. We reviewed our experience with endoscopically evaluated severe upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage following open heart surgery. Of 4892 patients undergoing open heart surgery, 18 (0.4%) sustained upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring endoscopic evaluation. Endoscopy identified the source of bleeding in all cases. No significant complications of endoscopy were observed. Duodenal ulcers (DUs) were found in 16 (89%) of cases and were felt to be the source of bleeding in 15 (83%). Aggressive features, such as multiplicity, large size, or distal location were associated with 13 (81%) of the DU cases. Complications necessitated endoscopic or surgical therapy in eight (44%) patients with DUs. We conclude that aggressive DU disease accounts for the majority of severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding following open heart surgery. 
Efficacy of transrectal ultrasound for identification of clinically undetected prostate cancer. A total of 51 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound of the prostate before radical cystoprostatectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Each had a normal prostate by digital rectal examination, no history of prostatic adenocarcinoma and no invasion of the prostate by transitional cell carcinoma. Real-time and step-sectioned ultrasound images were interpreted at the time of sonography and results were compared to pathological examination of the step-sectioned prostate specimen. When adenocarcinoma was identified in the specimen, cancer volume was determined. Positive ultrasound scans consisted of those exhibiting hypoechoic lesions. Hypoechogenicity due to transurethral resection defects, benign hyperplasia, vascular structures or shadowing from calcifications was not considered positive. Of 51 patients 27 (52.9%) exhibited no abnormality on ultrasound and were free of cancer in the prostate specimen, while 8 (15.7%) demonstrated a hypoechoic lesion that was proved to be prostate cancer. Seven patients (13.7%) with normal transrectal ultrasound scans had adenocarcinoma of the prostate, while 9 (17.6%) had lesions on ultrasound but no cancer. Based on these results, transrectal ultrasound has a sensitivity of 53.3% and a specificity of 75%. Further analysis reveals that transrectal ultrasound is more accurate in the detection of cancers of greater than 0.20 cc in volume than those of 0.20 cc or less. Transrectal ultrasound also is more accurate in the detection of peripheral zone than transition zone cancers. 
Circadian infusion of floxuridine in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A total of 42 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma received floxuridine infusion for 14 days at monthly intervals. The drug was delivered via an external programmable pump on a time-modified or circadian schedule; the highest dose of 68% was given between 3 and 9 p.m. Of the 42 patients 25 (60%) had undergone prior nephrectomy. Of the 40 evaluable patients 4 (10%, 95% confidential interval 3 to 24%) achieved a partial response: 3 of the 4 had undergone prior nephrectomy, while 1 had undergone renal angioinfarction. Another 4 patients (10%) had responses at metastatic sites but no response in the primary kidney tumor. The median duration of response for these 2 groups of patients was 65 and 27 weeks, respectively, and the most responsive site was the lungs. The treatment was generally well tolerated and could be administered on an outpatient basis. Our study confirms the limited but definite activity of floxuridine infused on a circadian schedule in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. We observed responses in metastasis equally in patients with or without prior nephrectomy. 
Human IgE, IgG4 and resistance to reinfection with Schistosoma haematobium. A well recognized feature of the immune response to parasitic helminth infections, including schistosomiasis, is the production of large amounts of specific and nonspecific IgE1,2. Immunological pathways involving IgE can lead to damage to the developing schistosomulum and it has been suggested that responses involving IgE could have evolved as protection against helminth infections. There has been no epidemiological evidence to support this idea and the only significant IgE responses known in man are those involved in the pathogenesis of allergic disease. Here we measure serological response during reinfection with S. haematobium and demonstrate that IgE antibodies in man can be beneficial. Our results support the hypothesis that the slow build-up of IgE to high levels and the early production of IgG4 antibodies, which may block IgE pathways are responsible for delaying the development of protective immunity to S. haematobium. 
The role of reperfusion-induced injury in the pathogenesis of the crush syndrome. The crush syndrome consists of the general manifestations that follow prolonged continuous pressure on the limbs. These manifestations are caused by the disintegration of muscle tissue and leakage of the contents of myocytes into the plasma. The morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome are high. The pathophysiologic process of the derangements associated with the crush syndrome is not fully understood, but the injury induced by reperfusion is likely to be important in its development. The injury due to reperfusion involves many factors, but it is currently ascribed largely to the release of oxygen free radicals, massive accumulation of calcium in ischemic muscles, and the infiltration of neutrophils into reperfused vessels. Since ischemic muscles cannot survive without reperfusion, a strategy to salvage as much of the muscle and kidney tissue as possible in the crush syndrome must include ways of decreasing injury during ischemia and reperfusion. Various pharmacologic agents may attenuate or prevent reperfusion-induced injury to ischemic skeletal muscles and consequently to other organs, particularly the kidneys. 
Results and prognostic factors of surgery in the management of non-small cell lung cancer with solitary brain metastasis. Between 1975 and 1988, 37 patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and synchronous (within 1 month, n = 10) or metachronous (n = 27) solitary brain metastasis (SBM) underwent combined excision of their lesions. Overall 5-year and median survival were 30% and 27 months (range, 3 to 125+ months), respectively. Twenty-seven patients had a relapse, and their median disease-free interval (DFI) was 17.5 months (range, 1 to 108 months). The most frequent (78%, n = 20) site of first recurrence locally was either the ipsilateral thorax (n = 14) or brain (n = 6). In univariate analysis, age, primary tumor and lymph node status; tumor histology, size, and side; type of pulmonary resection; side and location of SBM; and onset of presentation did not affect survival and DFI. By contrast, the interval (less than or equal to versus greater than 12 months) between the two operations significantly affected survival (P = 0.0096) and DFI (P = 0.046). The DFI was also affected by the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) for the primary tumor (P = 0.02). Using the Cox model, AC was the most independent predictor of DFI. These data support the inclusion of surgery in the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with NSCLC and SBM. 
Cerebrovascular events after myocardial infarction: analysis of the GISSI trial. Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto Miocardico (GISSI). OBJECTIVES--To describe the epidemiology of cerebrovascular events in patients given or not given fibrinolytic treatment and to assess the prognostic implications and risk factors. DESIGN--Case series derived from the GISSI randomised trial. SETTING--176 coronary care units in Italy giving various levels of care. PATIENTS--5860 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with 1.5 million units of intravenous streptokinase and 5852 patients not given fibrinolytic treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cerebrovascular event, sex, age, blood pressure, history of previous infarct, site of infarction, and Killip class. RESULTS--99 of 11,712 patients (0.84%) had a cerebrovascular event. Older age, worse Killip class, and anterior location of infarction seemed to be risk factors for cerebrovascular events (40/3201 aged 65-75 v 42/7295 aged less than 65, odds ratio 2.18; 9/437 class 3 v 55/8277 class 1, 1.81; and 57/4878 anterior v 24/4013 posterior, 1.96). No significant difference was found in the rate of cerebrovascular events between patients treated with streptokinase and controls (45/5852 (0.92%) streptokinase v 54/5860 (0.77) control). More patients in the streptokinase group than in the control group had cerebrovascular events (especially haemorrhagic strokes) on day 0-1 after randomisation (27 streptokinase v 7, control), although this was balanced by late events in control patients (54 streptokinase v 45 control at one year). The mortality of patients who had a cerebrovascular event was higher than that of those who did not (47% (47/99) v 11.6% (1350/11,613]. CONCLUSIONS--Although the incidence of cerebrovascular events complicating myocardial infarction was low, they increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment with streptokinase did not significantly alter the incidence, but age and poor haemodynamic state were associated with an increased risk. 
Complications associated with brachytherapy alone or with laser in lung cancer. Relatively little has been reported about destruction through brachytherapy of mucosa-perforating and extraluminary tumors with probable large vessel involvement causing major hemorrhagic or fistular complications. We report 12 patients subjected to laser and brachytherapy for centrally occluding lung cancer, whom we have periodically followed up from June 1986 until they died. Although all laser procedures were free from complications, necrotic cavitation in five cases, two of which were accompanied by large bronchoesophageal fistulas, and massive fatal hemoptysis occurred in six. Minor complications included radiation mucositis (two), noncritical mucosal scarring (two), and cough (four). Characteristics that will identify patients at risk of developing fatal hemoptysis and fistulas should be better defined by imaging and endoscopic techniques. In such cases, modifying the protocol or using alternative procedures should be considered. Minor complications, such as cough, can be avoided by using topical steroid therapy (eg, beclomethasone dipropionate). 
Effect of exercise intensity and duration on regional function during and after exercise-induced ischemia. BACKGROUND. Transient reversible myocardial dysfunction has been documented after episodes of exercise-induced ischemia. This study was undertaken to determine whether the duration or intensity of exercise affects the severity of postischemic dysfunction in this setting. METHODS AND RESULTS. Ten dogs were instrumented with ultrasonic microcrystals for measurement of wall thickening, with circumflex coronary artery flow probes, and with hydraulic occluders. Dogs performed low-intensity exercise, which was sufficient to increase coronary perfusion 50% above control, and high-intensity exercise, which was sufficient to double coronary blood flow. To investigate the effects of exercise intensity on postischemic dysfunction, we had dogs perform high-intensity exercise for 5 minutes in the presence of a stenosis. On the alternate day, dogs performed low-intensity exercise for 10 minutes in the presence of a stenosis. These two protocols provide equivalent coronary flow debts. Mean transmural blood flow during high-intensity exercise without stenosis (2.61 +/- 0.54 ml/min/g) was significantly higher than that during low-intensity exercise (1.74 +/- 0.61 ml/min/g, p less than 0.002). During high-intensity exercise with coronary artery stenosis, subendocardial blood flow was significantly lower than that during low-intensity exercise with stenosis (0.64 +/- 0.40 versus 1.08 +/- 0.28 ml/min/g, p less than 0.02). This difference in subendocardial perfusion was associated with greater degrees of regional dysfunction during exercise (circumflex wall thickening was 44 +/- 23% of control for high-intensity exercise versus 60 +/- 18% of control for low-intensity exercise, p less than 0.01). In addition, from 10 to 30 minutes after exercise, wall thickening in myocardium perfused by the circumflex coronary artery remained significantly lower after high-intensity exercise than that after low-intensity exercise. To assess the effects of exercise duration on the severity of postischemic dysfunction, we had dogs perform low-intensity exercise in the presence of a coronary stenosis for 10 minutes and low-intensity exercise for only 5 minutes on alternate days. Systolic wall thickening was significantly lower after low-intensity exercise for 10 minutes than after low-intensity exercise for 5 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. High-intensity exercise results in greater degrees of subendocardial hypoperfusion and greater degrees of regional dysfunction both during and after exercise-induced ischemia than does low-intensity exercise. Second, exercise duration also exerts an effect on the severity of postischemic dysfunction, although the magnitude of this effect is less important than the effect of exercise intensity. 
Association of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in carcinoma of the breast with infiltrating lobular carcinoma. An autopsy study. We analyzed the autopsy records of 261 patients with breast carcinoma, who died at The Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, for the presence of metastases to the central nervous system, particularly for the presence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Metastases to the central nervous system were found in 41 (18.1%) of 226 patients who had metastatic cancer. In 24 cases (10.6%), metastases were seen in brain parenchyma; in 11 cases (4.9%), only dura mater was involved, and in six cases (2.6%), leptomeningeal carcinomatosis was found. All patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis showed some symptoms of central nervous system involvement while alive. The patients died between 2 weeks and 2 months after the onset of central nervous system symptoms. Four of six patients with such a complication presented with locally advanced or disseminated carcinoma on the first admission. With regard to histologic findings, three patients had infiltrating lobular carcinoma, two had infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and one had mixed infiltrating lobular and ductal carcinoma, with a metastasizing lobular component. Metastases to the brain parenchyma were found exclusively in infiltrating ductal carcinoma. We stress that infiltrating lobular carcinoma represents a distinctive type of breast cancer with an unusual propensity to disseminate into leptomeninges, as this occurred in almost 14% of all cases of infiltrating lobular carcinoma in our series in contrast to a 1% incidence in cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma. 
Leiomyosarcoma arising in atypical fibromuscular hyperplasia (phyllodes tumor) of the prostate with distant metastasis. An extremely rare neoplasm of the prostate, commonly known as phyllodes type of atypical prostatic hyperplasia, is described in a 57-year-old man. Over a 2-year period, the atypical smooth muscle component has transformed into leiomyosarcoma, and eventually metastasized to the bones and the lungs. Such an evolution has never been documented for this tumor. 
Predictors and prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea and snoring in 1001 middle aged men. One thousand and one men, aged 35-65 years, were identified from the age-sex register of one group general practice. Over four years 900 men were visited at home and asked questions about symptoms potentially related to sleep apnoea and snoring. Height, weight, neck circumference, resting arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and spirometric values were also determined. All night oximetry was then performed at home and the tracing analysed for the number of dips in SaO2 of more than 4%. Subjects with more than five dips of 4% SaO2 or more per hour were invited for sleep laboratory polysomnography. Seventeen per cent of the men admitted to snoring "often." Multiple linear regression techniques identified and ranked neck circumference (r2 = 7.2%), cigarette consumption (r2 = 3.4%), and nasal stuffiness (r2 = 2%) as the only significant independent predictors of snoring. Together these account for at least a sixfold variation in the likelihood of being an "often" snorer. Forty six subjects (5%) had greater than 4% SaO2 dip rates of over five an hour and 31 of these had full sleep studies. Three subjects had clinically obvious and severe symptomatic obstructive sleep apnoea, giving a prevalence of three per 1001 men (0.3%; 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.9%). Eighteen men had obstructive sleep apnoea only when supine and in 10 the cause of the SaO2 dipping on the original home tracing was not elucidated. The greater than 4% SaO2 dip rates correlated with the history of snoring. Multiple linear regression techniques identified and ranked neck circumference (r2 = 7.9%), alcohol consumption (r2 = 3.7%), age (r2 = 1%) and obesity (r2 = 1%) as the only significant independent predictors of the rate of overnight hypoxic dipping. This study shows that snoring in this randomly selected population correlates best with neck size, smoking, and nasal stuffiness. Obstructive sleep apnoea, defined by nocturnal hypoxaemia, correlates best with neck size and alcohol, and less so with age and general obesity. 
Intramedullary nailing for impending pathological subtrochanteric fractures. We reviewed ten patients with metastatic carcinoma and impending pathological fractures of the subtrochanteric region of the femur who had prophylactic insertion of the Russell-Taylor reconstruction nail. There were no operative complications or long-term mechanical failures. This reconstruction nail has some technical and biomechanical advantages over other implants and is ideal for the management of such cases. 
Effects of radiation on testicular function in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the Children Cancer Study Group. Testicular function was evaluated in 60 long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). All the patients were treated on two consecutive Children Cancer Study Group protocols and received identical chemotherapy and either 18 or 24 Gy radiation therapy (RT) to one of the following fields: craniospinal plus 12 Gy abdominal RT including the gonads (group 1); craniospinal (group 2); or cranial (group 3). The median age at the time of their last evaluation was 14.5 years (range, 10.5 to 25.7), which took place a median of 5.0 years (range, 1 to 10.3) after discontinuing therapy. The incidence of primary germ cell dysfunction as judged by raised levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or reduced testicular volume was significantly associated with field of RT; 55% of group 1, 17% of group 2, and 0% of group 3 were abnormal (P = .002). Leydig cell function, as assessed by plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone, and pubertal development, was unaffected in the majority of subjects regardless of RT field. These data indicate that in boys undergoing therapy for ALL, germ cell dysfunction is common following testicular irradiation and can occur following exposure to scattered irradiation from craniospinal RT. In contrast, Leydig cell function appears resistant to direct irradiation with doses as high as 12 Gy. 
Effect of hypercapnia on total pulmonary resistance during wakefulness and during NREM sleep. We investigated the effect of different levels of hypercapnia on total pulmonary resistance (RL) in 13 subjects ranging from nonsnorers with low RL to snorers with high RL and dynamic narrowing of the upper airway during inspiration. Added CO2 was adjusted to achieve a steady-state increase in PETCO2 of +2, +4, or +6 mm Hg. RL was measured at peak inspiratory flow (RLpf), at maximal resistance within breath (RLmax), and at 10 equally spaced points within inspiration in several trials. During wakefulness, hypercapnia was associated with decreased RLmax. During steady state +6 mm Hg hypercapnia, RLmax decreased by 30% (p less than 0.01). During NREM sleep, low levels of hypercapnia did not affect RL. However, +6 mm Hg hypercapnia was associated with decreased RLmax in six of eight subjects (p = 0.07), especially in subjects with high RLmax during room air breathing. The effects of hypercapnia on RLpf paralleled its effect on RLmax. We concluded that (1) the decrease in RL during awake hypercapnia suggests an increase in upper airway dimensions and stiffness, (2) the absence of increased RL during low level NREM hypercapnia (despite the increase in inspiratory flows and collapsing pressures) also suggests an increase in upper airway dimensions and stiffness, and (3) upper airway dilating muscles appear to be recruited in a coordinated fashion with inspiratory muscles in normal humans during NREM sleep. The implications of these findings in patients with obstructive sleep apnea are not clear at this point. 
Argon laser-assisted anastomoses in medium-size vessels: one-year follow-up. Laser-assisted anastomosis of medium-size vessels can be performed with satisfactory short-term patency. This study was undertaken to evaluate patency and structural integrity up to 1 year. An argon laser was used to make bilateral femoral arteriovenous anastomoses in 12 dogs compared to conventional suture method in another 8 dogs. These anastomoses were evaluated for patency and aneurysm formation at 1 hour; 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks; and 12 months after surgery. All anastomotic sites were patent and without aneurysmal change or luminal narrowing at all harvesting intervals. Histologic examination revealed that within 1 month laser anastomotic sites were almost completely healed and without intimal hyperplasia. In suture anastomoses, foreign-body reaction remained evident up to 1 year. Use of the argon laser for medium size vessel anastomoses resulted in excellent patency without aneurysm formation or intimal hyperplasia even in the long term. These data suggest promising clinical applications. 
Inhibitory effect of sandostatin on secretion of luteinising hormone and ovarian steroids in polycystic ovary syndrome. Hyperinsulinism accompanies the raised luteinising hormone (LH) concentrations in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Somatostatin inhibits insulin and LH secretion in healthy adults, so the effect of treatment with a long-acting somatostatin analogue ('Sandostatin') on gonadotropin and androgen secretion in PCOS was investigated. LH pulsatility, androgen concentrations, and hormonal responses to an oral glucose load and to administration of a GnRH agonist (buserelin) were measured before and after 7 days' treatment with sandostatin 100 micrograms subcutaneously twice a day in 10 amenorrhoeic women with classic features of PCOS. Sandostatin significantly reduced integrated LH concentrations and LH pulse amplitudes, oestradiol, testosterone, and androstenedione concentrations, and LH responses to buserelin; it also suppressed insulin and C-peptide responses to an oral glucose load. Thus sandostatin inhibits pituitary and ovarian hormonal responses in part by a direct influence on pituitary activity, and the possibility of an indirect effect mediated by changes in insulin concentrations requires investigation. These findings have implications for the treatment of infertility in women with PCOS. 
Stop codon in the procollagen II gene (COL2A1) in a family with the Stickler syndrome (arthro-ophthalmopathy). Linkage analysis with restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the gene for type II procollagen (COL2A1) was carried out in a family with the Stickler syndrome, or arthro-ophthalmopathy, an autosomal dominant disorder that affects the eyes, ears, joints, and skeleton. The analysis demonstrated linkage of the disease and COL2A1 with a logarithm-of-odds score of 1.51 at zero recombination. A newly developed procedure for preparing cosmid clones was employed to isolate the allele for type II procollagen that was linked to the disease. Analysis of over 7000 nucleotides of the gene revealed a single base mutation that altered a CG dinucleotide and converted the codon CGA for arginine at amino acid position alpha 1-732 to TGA, a stop codon. From previous work on procollagen biosynthesis, it is apparent that the truncated polypeptide synthesized from an allele with a stop codon at alpha 1-732 cannot participate in the assembly of type II procollagen, and therefore that the mutation would decrease synthesis of type II procollagen. It was not apparent, however, why the mutation produced marked changes in the eye, which contains only small amounts of type II collagen, but relatively mild effects on the many cartilaginous structures of the body that are rich in the same protein. 
The trk proto-oncogene product: a signal transducing receptor for nerve growth factor The trk proto-oncogene encodes a 140-kilodalton, membrane-spanning protein tyrosine kinase (p140prototrk) that is expressed only in neural tissues. Nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulates phosphorylation of p140prototrk in neural cell lines and in embryonic dorsal root ganglia. Affinity cross-linking and equilibrium binding experiments with 125I-labeled NGF indicate that p140prototrk binds NGF specifically in cultured cells with a dissociation constant of 10(-9) molar. The identification of p140prototrk as an NGF receptor indicates that this protein participates in the primary signal transduction mechanism of NGF. 
Duodenal somatostatinoma with congenital pseudoarthrosis. We describe a previously unreported association between somatostatinoma and congenital pseudoarthrosis. Because pseudoarthrosis is part of von Recklinghausen's disease, in turn with an association with somatostatinoma, we speculate on a link between pseudoarthrosis and somatostatinoma. 
Repeat infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in patients with acute myocardial infarction and early recurrent myocardial ischemia. When conventional treatment of patients with early clinical reinfarction after thrombolytic therapy fails, mechanical revascularization may be attempted. An alternative strategy, repeat thrombolytic infusions, is reported. Fifty-two patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with one or two additional thrombolytic infusions of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) because of nonsustained ischemia after initial treatment with rt-PA or streptokinase. Thirty-five patients received the second infusion within 1 h of the first; 13 patients received the second infusion 1 to 72 h after the first and 4 patients received it later during their hospitalization. Bleeding complications occurred in 10 patients (19%); however, most of these were minor (no intracranial bleeding) and only 2 patients required blood transfusion. In 14 patients in whom the decrease in fibrinogen and plasminogen levels was measured after the first and second infusions, this decrease was only 25% and 63%, respectively--only slightly higher than the 22% and 53% decreases measured in 63 patients who had only one rt-PA infusion. In 44 patients (85%), the acute ischemia resolved completely within 1 h after initiation of the second infusion. In 23 patients (44%), pain and ST segment elevation did not recur and invasive coronary intervention was avoided. Thus, repeat rt-PA infusions can stabilize a substantial number of patients with acute reinfarction and, even when relief is temporary, repeat rt-PA infusions can minimize myocardial damage while patients await mechanical revascularization. 
Assessment of quality of life. Assessment of quality of life has emerged in recent years as an important part of the overall evaluation of drug therapy and health care in general. Measurement techniques for this difficult assessment range from simple unqualified questions on patient well-being to complex statistical analyses of a wide range of lifestyle and activity variables. The factors that influence quality of life during chronic drug therapy differ in the treatment of symptomatic (e.g., heart failure) vs asymptomatic (e.g., hypertension) disease, and include drug side effects, relief of symptoms, improved prognosis, return to work, physical activity and the need for further hospital treatments. The manifestation of quality of life varies for different people leading to lack of agreement on the precise definition. The absence of standardization of methods of measurement also contributes to this and leads to lack of comparability of studies and unreasonable claims by some drug manufacturers. Further complicating issues in multicenter trials across countries include language problems and interethnic differences in "sickness" behavior. The recently introduced quality-adjusted life year (QALY) index, designed to take account of both the quality and duration of life in assessing the outcome of treatments, may avoid some of these problems. By classifying illness states (the Rosser index) on the basis of disability and distress, and comparing outcomes in terms of improved prognosis, QALYs have already been used for cost/benefit analyses of a number of new and expensive therapies. Like other methods, QALYs have problems related to variability in individual appreciation of life values. To date, a perfect method of quality of life assessment remains elusive. 
Evidence for a defect in growth hormone-releasing factor signal transduction in the dwarf (dw/dw) rat pituitary. Dwarf (dw/dw) rats exhibit a 40% reduction in body growth, isolated GH deficiency (less than 5% of normal pituitary content), and a decreased number of pituitary somatotrophs (15-20% of normal). Since GH-releasing factor (GRF) stimulates GH synthesis and secretion and somatotroph proliferation, and its effects are probably mediated by cAMP, we have assessed GH secretion and cAMP production in dw rat pituitaries in response to various GH secretagogues. Dispersed pituitary cells from dw rats were less sensitive (2.5-fold) to stimulation of GH secretion by GRF and showed a 25% reduction in the maximal GH response even after normalization of their reduced GH content. Intracellular cAMP was elevated 63-fold over basal levels in normal cells after 4 h in response to maximal GRF stimulation, but only 1.9-fold in dw cells, and even larger differences between the groups were found at earlier time points. The GH responses of dw cells to exogenous cAMP, however, were indistinguishable from normal. Forskolin, a direct stimulator of adenylate cyclase, elicited comparable maximal GH and cAMP responses, but an increased ED50, in dw cells. Activation of GS alpha by cholera toxin showed an increased ED50 and reduced GH and cAMP responses in dw cells, and marked decreases in these responses were observed in response to prostaglandin E1. Phorbol ester stimulation resulted in a reduced maximal GH response in dw cells without a change in sensitivity. These results provide evidence for a defect in the GRF signal transduction pathway associated with a decreased ability of GS alpha to stimulate adenylate cyclase in dw rat somatotrophs that may be causally linked to their GH deficiency. 
Reaction time and movement velocity abnormalities in Parkinson's disease under different task conditions. We examined reaction times, movement velocities, and the associated agonist and antagonist muscle behaviors in nine Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and eight normal subjects before and after medications, using a wrist extension task to changing locations of a visual target. Targets changing 500 msec before an auditory "go" signal act as a preparatory cue, while targets changing at the time of the go signal provide a combined auditory and visual stimulus. Late target changes allowed examination of (1) reaction times during an ongoing movement, and (2) movement in the presence and absence of visual targets. PD prolonged the time from the onset agonist electromyographic activity and reduction of antagonist activity to movement onset. Both were shortened by preparatory cues and combined visual and auditory go signals. PD slowed movement only in a subset of trials in which there was movement to a displayed target. 
The proximal element of the beta globin locus control region is not functionally required in vivo. In addition to local sequence elements the regulation of the high-level, development- and tissue-specific expression of the human beta globin gene cluster appears to require distant regulatory sequences which have been termed locus control region. In the chromatin of erythroid cells the locus control region is characterized by four DNaseI hypersensitive sites that are located 6-18 kb 5' of the epsilon globin gene. The definition of the sequences minimally required for locus control region activity is likely to further the understanding of its physiology and will be of interest for the development of somatic gene therapy strategies of the hemoglobinopathies. We present here the analysis of a family with a 3,030-bp deletion of sequences upstream of the epsilon globin gene including the most 3' locus control region element and cosegregating beta degree thalassemia. The deletion is linked in cis to a structurally and functionally normal beta globin gene. The proximal element of the locus control region does not therefore appear to be necessary for beta globin gene activity in vivo. 
Alterations in the levels of iron, ferritin and other trace metals in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases affecting the basal ganglia. Levels of iron, copper, zinc and manganese were measured by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy in frozen postmortem brain tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy with strionigral degeneration (MSA), and Huntington's disease (HD) compared with control subjects. Total iron levels were found to be elevated in the areas of basal ganglia showing pathological change in these disorders. In particular, total iron content was increased in substantia nigra in PD, PSP and MSA, but not in HD. Total iron levels in the striatum (putamen and/or caudate nucleus) were increased in PSP, MSA and HD but not in PD. Total iron levels were decreased in the globus pallidus in PD. There were no consistent alterations of manganese levels in basal ganglia structures in any of the diseases studied. Copper levels were decreased in the substantia nigra in PD, and in the cerebellum in PSP, and were elevated in the putamen and possibly substantia nigra in HD. Zinc levels were only increased in PD, in substantia nigra and in caudate nucleus and lateral putamen. Levels of the iron binding protein ferritin were measured in the same patient groups using a radio-immunoassay technique. Increased iron levels in basal ganglia were generally associated with normal or elevated levels of ferritin immunoreactivity, for example, the substantia nigra in PSP and possibly MSA, and in putamen in MSA. The exception was PD where there was a generalized reduction in brain ferritin immunoreactivity, even in the substantia nigra. An increase in total iron content appears to be a response to neurodegeneration in affected basal ganglia regions in a number of movement disorders. However, only in PD was there an increased total iron level, decreased ferritin content, decreased copper content, and an increased zinc concentration in substantia nigra. These findings suggest an alteration of iron handling in the substantia nigra in PD. Depending on the form in which the excess iron load exists in nigra in PD, it may contribute to the neurodegenerative process. 
Revision of failed knee replacements using fixed-axis hinges. Forty failed hinged arthroplasties of the knee were revised by the insertion of another hinged implant. In 14 cases the prosthesis used at the revision operation was similar to the primary implant; in 26, a hinge with an elongated femoral stem was used, usually replacing part of the femoral shaft. In seven of these knees an elongated tibial stem was also required, though the tibial shaft was replaced in only two of them. There were many complications. Fracture of the femur at the tip of the femoral stem was the most frequent. Sixteen first revisions failed and were revised a second time; 12 required replacement of the distal femoral shaft and three required replacement of the proximal tibia. The incidence of complications in knees requiring a second revision was even higher. Four required a third revision after an average interval of three years. Failure of a hinged prosthesis results in bone loss mainly in the femur. Revision of a failed hinged prosthesis with another of the same design is unlikely to be successful and may cause fracture of the femur. 
The epidemiology of exposure to electromagnetic fields: an overview of the recent literature. Epidemiologic studies of exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) have been reviewed. Possible links to incidences of cancer and abnormal fetal development have been suggested by some investigators. In general, the results have been inconsistent. There are many deficiencies in the studies, and many questions have been raised about the validity of some of the conclusions proposed. There is currently no definitive evidence of an association between exposure to EMF and the alleged risks. Due to problems and limitations inherent in future studies (misconceptions about exposure levels, uncertainty about field variability, criticisms of surrogate measures), this question is unlikely to ever be answered with certainty. Unfortunately, many highly-publicized accounts of speculative and unsubstantiated claims have caused undue concern among the general public. 
Increased amino acid transport into brain tumors measured by PET of L-(2-18F)fluorotyrosine The uptake of L-(2-18F)fluorotyrosine (F-Tyr), a newly synthetized amino acid tracer, was studied in 15 patients with various brain tumors by dynamic PET. The higher F-Tyr accumulation in tumors (mean 27% above contralateral tissue) was associated with two-fold transport rates into tumors, while the rate constants describing irreversible incorporation were decreased. The increased F-Tyr transport was not correlated to 68Ga-EDTA accumulation and cannot be explained by disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Kinetic analysis of 2-(18F)-fluoro-deoxy-glucose accumulation in the same patients demonstrated that increased metabolic rates in tumors are mainly caused by altered phosphorylation rates while transport of glucose is less affected. Since F-Tyr transport rates clearly separated tumors from normal tissue and since F-Tyr accumulation was related to tumor grade, PET studies of F-Tyr uptake are of clinical value for diagnosis and classification of brain tumors. 
Similar prevalence of renovascular hypertension in selected blacks and whites. Renovascular hypertension is a potentially curable form of high blood pressure that is thought to be extremely rare among blacks. We demonstrate, however, that in a clinically selected population, the prevalence of renovascular hypertension is similar in blacks and whites. We prospectively evaluated 167 hypertensive subjects who had one or more clinical features known to be associated with renovascular hypertension. All subjects had captopril-stimulated peripheral renin measurements and conventional renal arteriography. All significant renal artery stenoses (greater than 50% luminal narrowing) were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or surgery. Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed if there was a blood pressure response to interventional therapy, according to the criteria established by the Cooperative Study of Renovascular Hypertension. Of the total group evaluated, 24% (39 of 167) had renal artery stenosis and 14% (23 of 167) had renovascular hypertension. Renal artery stenosis or occlusion was found in 27% (26 of 97) of whites and 19% (13 of 67) of blacks (p = 0.27). Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed in 18% (17 of 97) of whites and 9% (6 of 67) of blacks evaluated (p = 0.25). Renovascular hypertension was associated with severe or refractory hypertension and with smoking, but there were no racial differences in these associations. Blacks with renovascular hypertension tended to have low captopril-stimulated peripheral renin activity. We conclude that blacks with clinical features suggestive of renovascular hypertension should be evaluated with angiography. Captopril-stimulated plasma renin may not be useful in detecting blacks with renovascular hypertension, but this and other potential screening tests require further evaluation. 
Reversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm by intravenous flecainide. Spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm is a frequent occurrence in recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF). In a randomized, double-blind, controlled study, intravenous flecainide (2 mg/kg, maximum dose 150 mg) was compared with placebo in the treatment of recent-onset AF (present for greater than or equal to 30 minutes and less than or equal to 72 hours' duration and a ventricular response greater than or equal to 120 beats/min). Intravenous digoxin (500 micrograms) was administered concurrently to all patients in both groups who had not previously taken digoxin. The trial medication was administered over 30 minutes. Exclusion criteria included hemodynamic instability, severe heart failure, recent antiarrhythmic therapy, hypokalemia and pacemaker dependence. One hundred two consecutive patients with recent-onset AF were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in the intensive care or coronary care unit. Twenty-nine (57%) patients given flecainide and digoxin, but only 7 (14%) given placebo and digoxin, reverted to sinus rhythm in less than or equal to 1 hour after starting the trial medication infusion and remained in stable sinus rhythm (chi-square 18.9, p = 0.000013; odds ratio 8.3, 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 24.8). At the end of the 6-hour monitoring period, 34 patients (67%) in the flecainide-digoxin group were in stable sinus rhythm, whereas only 18 patients (35%) in the placebo-digoxin group had reverted (chi-square 8.83, p = 0.003; odds ratio 3.67, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 9.1). 
Quadrantic visual field defects. A hallmark of lesions in extrastriate (V2/V3) cortex. We report 2 patients with homonymous quadrantic visual field defects. The first patient experienced scintillations in the left lower quadrant, leading to the discovery of an astrocytoma in the cuneus of the right occipital lobe. Postoperatively she had a left lower quadrantanopia that precisely respected the horizontal meridian. The second patient presented with a left lower quadrantanopia, sparing the central 10 degrees of vision that also respected the horizontal meridian. An astrocytoma was resected from the right upper peristriate cortex. We must explain how a lesion in extrastriate cortex produced a homonymous field defect with a sharp horizontal edge in these 2 patients. Areas V2 and V3 are each divided along the horizontal meridian into separate halves flanking striate cortex. Consequently, the upper and lower quadrants in extrastriate cortex are physically isolated on opposite sides of striate cortex. We propose that a lesion involving V2/V3 may be sufficient to create a visual field defect. Although the lesion may have irregular margins, if it crosses the representation of the horizontal meridian in extrastriate cortex, it will produce a quadrantic visual field defect with a sharp horizontal border because of the split layout of the upper and lower quadrants in V2/V3. 
Effectiveness of recombinant desulphatohirudin in reducing restenosis after balloon angioplasty of atherosclerotic femoral arteries in rabbits BACKGROUND. The effectiveness of balloon angioplasty is limited by a restenosis rate of approximately 30%. Recombinant desulphatohirudin (r-hirudin [CGP 39393]) has been found to be highly effective in preventing acute platelet-rich thrombosis after deep arterial injury as compared with heparin. METHODS AND RESULTS. This study evaluated the effect of intravenous r-hirudin, a selective inhibitor of thrombin, on restenosis after balloon angioplasty in 29 rabbits. Focal femoral atherosclerosis was induced by air desiccation endothelial injury followed by a 2% cholesterol diet for 1 month. At angioplasty (2.5-mm balloon with three 60-second, 10-atm inflations 60 seconds apart), the rabbits received heparin (150 units/kg bolus, n = 16) or r-hirudin (1 mg/kg bolus followed by infusions of 1 mg/kg for the first hour and 0.5 mg/kg for the second hour, n = 13). Angiograms performed before and after angioplasty and before death were analyzed quantitatively by a blinded observer. Rabbits were killed 2 hours (n = 14) or 28 days (n = 15) after angioplasty. Femoral arteries were fixed in situ by perfusion of 10% formaldehyde at 100 mm Hg. The mean luminal diameter of the arteries with successful angioplasty (greater than or equal to 20% increase in luminal diameter) in rabbits treated with heparin (n = 8 arteries) increased from 1.18 +/- 0.29 mm before angioplasty to 1.86 +/- 0.24 mm immediately after angioplasty (p less than 0.001) and decreased to 0.94 +/- 0.69 mm (p = 0.0004) at 28 days after angioplasty. In rabbits treated with r-hirudin (n = 11 arteries), the mean luminal diameter increased from 1.14 +/- 0.17 mm before angioplasty to 1.68 +/- 0.20 mm immediately after angioplasty (p less than 0.001) and decreased to 1.37 +/- 0.47 mm (p = 0.01) at 28 days after angioplasty. The mean reduction in luminal diameter by angiography was less in the r-hirudin-treated group than in the heparin-treated group (0.30 +/- 0.33 versus 0.92 +/- 0.61 mm, p = 0.01). Blinded planimetric analysis of stained histological sections of the femoral arteries also showed less cross-sectional area narrowing by plaque in rabbits treated with r-hirudin compared with those treated with heparin (22 +/- 16% verus 48 +/- 29%, p = 0.01). Both groups had similar numbers of arteries with histological evidence of balloon-induced plaque tear (12 of 13 versus 13 of 15). CONCLUSIONS. Rabbits receiving r-hirudin at the time of experimental balloon angioplasty had significantly less restenosis by angiography and by quantitative histopathology than rabbits receiving heparin. 
High-attenuation mediastinal masses on unenhanced CT. On unenhanced CT scans, a variety of mediastinal masses contain areas with attenuation values higher than the attenuation value of the chest wall musculature. The increased attenuation may be diffuse or focal and may be a result of calcium deposition, high iodine content, or areas of acute hemorrhage. This report illustrates the gamut of high-attenuation mediastinal masses seen on unenhanced CT. Masses that are of high attenuation only on IV contrast-enhanced images (e.g., aberrant vessels) are not included. 
Growth of human breast cancer cell lines is inhibited by the somatostatin analog BIM23014. Somatostatin has been shown to lower plasma levels of various hormones and growth factors involved in regulation of the growth of human breast cells. In the present study we examined the ability of the somatostatin octapeptide analog BIM23014 to modulate the in vitro growth of five human breast cell lines: HBL100, Hs578T, MDAMB231, T47D, and MCF7. BIM23014 inhibited the growth of the two steroid-dependent cell lines, MCF7 and T47D, in a dose-related manner. This inhibitory effect was only observed when MCF7 and T47D cells were cultivated in medium containing steroid-depleted serum. The growth of a MCF7 variant capable of growth in serum-free medium was also inhibited by BIM23014, indicating that serum factors are not required for this inhibition. In the serum-free medium, the addition of estradiol before or during treatment with BIM23014 abolished its inhibitory effects on cell growth. The studies including time course, competitive inhibition, and cross-linking of iodinated BIM23014 to its receptor revealed a specific binding on MCF7 cells and showed a single 57,000 mol wt protein band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results support the hypothesis that BIM23014 inhibits the growth of steroid-receptor positive cells of human breast cancers through its own receptor in estradiol-free conditions. 
Coronary vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage as a cause of stunned myocardium. Case report. A patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage was found to have electrocardiographic abnormalities resembling an acute myocardial infarction as well as left ventriculographic findings of cardiac dysfunction. These cardiac abnormalities resolved following surgical clipping of the aneurysm and the patient recovered well from the operation. She died 2 months later from cancer and a postmortem examination at that time revealed no evidence of myocardial necrosis. In this report, the authors discuss coronary vasospasm and reversible postischemic "stunned myocardium," a condition that has not been considered previously in relation to subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Hypertrophy and increased gene expression of neurons containing neurokinin-B and substance-P messenger ribonucleic acids in the hypothalami of postmenopausal women. We have previously described hypertrophy of neurons containing estrogen receptor mRNA in the infundibular nucleus of postmenopausal women. In the present investigation we identified peptide mRNAs in the hypertrophied neurons and determined whether postmenopausal neuronal hypertrophy was accompanied by changes in gene expression. In the first study in situ hybridization was performed on sections from hypothalami of postmenopausal women (n = 3) using synthetic 35S-labeled cDNA probes complementary to mRNAs encoding estrogen receptor, substance-P (SP), neurokinin-B (NKB), POMC, cholecystokinin, dynorphin, CRF, enkephalin, galanin, neuropeptide-Y, GH-releasing hormone, and tyrosine hydroxylase. Neuronal cross-sectional areas and cell densities were measured with the aid of a computer microscope system. Neurons labeled with the NKB and SP probes were comparable in size, morphology, and distribution to the hypertrophied neurons containing estrogen receptor mRNA. In contrast, neurons labeled with other cDNA probes were sparsely distributed (CRF and dynorphin), smaller in size (neuropeptide-Y, galanin, GH-releasing hormone, enkephalin, cholecystokinin, and POMC), or located anterior to the hypertrophied population (tyrosine hydroxylase). In the second study sections from hypothalami of premenopausal (n = 3) and postmenopausal (n = 3) women were incubated with cDNA probes complementary to SP or NKB mRNAs. The mean cross-sectional areas of postmenopausal infundibular neurons containing NKB and SP mRNAs increased to 194% and 176% of premenopausal values, respectively. The autoradiographic grain densities of infundibular neurons labeled with either probe were also significantly increased in the postmenopausal group. Finally, the numbers of labeled neurons/tissue increased 6-fold (SP) and 15-fold (NKB) in the postmenopausal infundibular nucleus. These data demonstrate that human menopause is associated with marked increases in hypothalamic NKB and SP gene expression. We propose that neurons containing estrogen receptor, SP, and NKB mRNAs participate in the hypothalamic circuitry regulating estrogen negative feedback in the human. 
Relation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin: a case-control study. We conducted a case-control study in five general hospitals in the region of Antwerp, studying 161 patients (102 men, 59 women) and hospital control subjects matched for age and sex to explore the relation between drug use and upper gastrointestinal bleeding from 'erosive lesions' (peptic oesophagitis, gastric erosions, gastric ulcer(s), or duodenal ulcer(s]. There was a highly significant difference between cases and control subjects in the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, excluding aspirin) (odds ratio 7.4, p less than 0.001; 95% confidence interval odds ratio 3.7 to 14.7). There also was a significant difference in the use of aspirin (odds ratio 2.2, p = 0.025; 95% CI odds ratio 1.3 to 4.0) and a highly significant difference regarding the presence of antecedents of peptic ulcer disease (odds ratio 5.5, p less than 0.001; 95% CI odds ratio 3.2 to 9.6). There was no significant difference in the use of other drugs, paracetamol and corticosteroids in particular, nor in the use of alcohol or tobacco. The patient group using NSAIDs was older, had more women, and had a higher mortality than the group not using NSAIDs. Among patients with bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcer(s), NSAID users were not more or less likely to have had symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, and had no higher frequency of multiple gastric or duodenal ulcers. The attributable risk for NSAID use was 0.30 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.37) and for aspirin use 0.14 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.20). 
Coronary arteriography in patients with dextrocardia. Coronary arteriography is described in a patient with dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis. Six cases of coronary arteriography in dextrocardia were reviewed from the literature, and 3 other cases were reported from the authors' institutions. In 9 of the 10 patients, coronary arteriography was performed without difficulty using standard Judkins or Sones catheters. Angiographers encountering patients with dextrocardia may use standard coronary arteriographic techniques with a few subtle modifications. 
Renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena caval involvement. Renal cell carcinoma extends into the lumen of the inferior vena cava in approximately 4% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Surgical removal of the intracaval tumor thrombus with radical nephrectomy is the preferred treatment for this malignancy. From January 1977 to June 1990, 31 such patients were examined for combined problems of renal carcinoma and intracaval tumor extension. Twenty-six of these patients underwent radical nephrectomy and vena caval thrombectomy. Ten patients had tumor thrombus confined to the infrahepatic vena cava, 11 had retrohepatic caval involvement, and 5 had extension to the level of the diaphragm or into the right atrium. Surgical approach was dictated by the level of caval involvement. Control of the suprahepatic vena cava plus temporary occlusion of hepatic arterial and portal venous inflow were necessary in some cases; cardiopulmonary bypass was required for transatrial removal of more extensive tumors. Five of the 26 patients had evidence before operation of distant metastatic disease; none of these survived beyond 12 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of the 21 patients without known preoperative metastatic disease was 57%. Complete surgical excision of all gross tumor appears to be critical for long-term survival in these patients. 
Gastric cancer after gastric bypass for obesity. Case report. We describe a patient in whom gastric cancer developed after gastric bypass for morbid obesity. In addition, we review the literature to emphasize the technical problems involved in diagnosing disease in the excluded portion of the stomach. 
Depressed adenoma of the stomach. Conceptual review and study of five cases. Depressed gastric adenoma is a recently featured lesion, distinguished by a depression in the gastric mucosa, with histologic changes of conventional adenomatous polyp. We observed five cases of depressed gastric adenoma, one of them associated with a peptic ulcer, another with a gastric stump, and yet another with an early gastric carcinoma. None of the cases was detected clinically by radiology or endoscopic study. Endoscopically, this lesion stimulates a peptic ulcer at a re-epithelialization stage or an early carcinoma of the depressed type. Histologically, all the cases showed dysplastic changes of varying degrees, with a relevant risk of malignancy. A similarity is shown to other lesions described in the gastric mucosa. 
Maxillofacial considerations in orthotopic liver transplantation. Orthotopic liver transplantation is now a widely used treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease. Lifelong pharmacologic immunosuppression renders these patients susceptible to many infections. The purpose of this article is to provide guidelines for treating the patient with end-stage liver disease, both before and after transplantation. In addition, we shall discuss some of the medical implications associated with end-stage liver disease and their clinical presentations and appropriate presurgical management. Adverse side effects of long-term immunosuppression and their effect on the oral and maxillofacial region shall also be discussed. Last, a brief discussion of FK506, the latest immunosuppressant, will be presented together with the implications of its use on our surgical treatment of these patients. 
Prevalence of asthma among 12 year old children in New Zealand and South Wales: a comparative survey. A survey of 12 year old schoolchildren was carried out in New Zealand and South Wales, the same questionnaire and exercise provocation test being used. The prevalence of a history of asthma at any time was higher in New Zealand (147/873, 17%) than in South Wales (116/965, 12%). The New Zealand children were also more likely than the Welsh children to have a history of "wheeze ever" (27% versus 22%), and wheeze brought on by running (15% versus 10.5%). The sex ratio of asthmatic and wheezy children was very similar in the two countries. A history of hospital admission for chest trouble was twice as common in New Zealand as in South Wales. An exercise test produced a fall in peak expiratory flow rate of 15% or more in more New Zealand children (12.2%) than Welsh children (7.7%). These results suggest that the prevalence of childhood asthma is higher in New Zealand than in South Wales. 
Proliferation and cytolytic function of anti-CD3 + interleukin-2 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells following bone marrow transplantation. We evaluated the proliferation, cytolytic function, and phenotypic characteristics of anti-CD3 plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 44 patients with leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with multiagent chemotherapy or following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). BMT patients had decreased cell growth with only a 1.35 +/- 0.25 (autologous BMT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), 1.24 +/- 0.25 (autologous BMT for NHL), and 0.8 +/- 0.1 (allogeneic BMT for leukemia) mean fold increase by day 5 of culture compared with controls (4.0 +/- 0.4), P less than .001. Anti-CD3 + IL-2 activated cells from patients with ALL and NHL who had received autologous BMT and cells from patients with leukemia who underwent allogeneic BMT were more effective in lysing the natural killer (NK) sensitive target, K562, and the NK-resistant target, Daudi, compared with controls. In contrast, cytolysis of K562 and Daudi by cultured PBMCs from patients with ALL and NHL receiving multi-agent chemotherapy was similar to that of controls. Cultures from BMT recipients had a significant increase in CD16+ (autologous ALL 5.7 +/- 1.5%, P less than .01; autologous NHL 12.4 +/- 3.5%, P less than .001; allogeneic 14.3 +/- 2.9%, P less than .001) and CD56+ cells (autologous ALL 27.6 +/- 12.0%, P less than .01; autologous NHL 39.3 +/- 9.5%, P less than .001; allogeneic 42.7 +/- 7.4%, P less than .001) compared with controls (CD16+ 2.5 +/- 0.4%; CD56+ 6.9 +/- 0.9%). Stimulation of PBMCs with anti-CD3 + IL-2 is effective in generating cells with high cytolytic function post-BMT. 
The management of transitional cell carcinoma in solitary renal units. Ten patients with urothelial malignancies involving a solitary functioning renal unit were treated at our center for an average of 24 months or until death. These patients were all managed by parenchyma-sparing methods, including percutaneous as well as ureteroscopic tumor resection. Of our patients 9 have received adjunctive chemotherapy in the form of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations. At the time of this report 5 of our patients were alive without evidence of disease, 4 were alive with evidence of either residual or recurrent neoplasia and 1 was dead of disease 5 years after original presentation. Patients with higher grade tumors or carcinoma in situ did less well than patients with low grade disease. We present an analysis of our experience with this complex patient population and discuss the implications of these data within the context of a growing literature on the topic of upper tract urothelial malignancy. 
Perioperative stroke. Part I: General surgery, carotid artery disease, and carotid endarterectomy. Although stroke, defined as a focal neurological deficit lasting more than 24 hr, is uncommon in the perioperative period, its associated mortality and long-term disability are high. No large-scale data are available to identify the importance of recognized risk factors for stroke in the perioperative period. A review of the literature shows that the incidence and mechanism of its occurrence are influenced by the presence of cardiovascular disease and the type of surgery. The most common cause of perioperative stroke is embolism. In non-cardiac surgery, the incidence of perioperative stroke is higher among the elderly. Properly administered, controlled hypotension is associated with minimal risk of stroke. Cerebral vasospasm may be the cause of focal cerebral ischaemia in eclamptic patients, and the aggressive treatment of hypertension may exacerbate the neurological damage. The risk of stroke associated with carotid endarterectomy is closely related to the preoperative neurological presentation, and the experience of the surgical/anaesthetic team. Symptomatic cerebrovascular disease, acute stroke, asymptomatic carotid lesions, preoperative assessment of risk, local and general anaesthesia, cerebral protection and monitoring during carotid endarterectomy are discussed with reference to reducing the risk of perioperative stroke. Adequate monitoring and protection have minimized the risk of ischaemia from carotid clamping, and the major mechanism of stroke is embolization. 
Restenosis after coronary angioplasty: an overview. Despite substantial basic and clinical efforts to address the problem of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention, effective preventive therapies have not yet been developed. Nevertheless, the accumulated information has provided much insight into the process of restenosis in addition to allowing standards to be developed for adequate clinical trials. The pathophysiology of restenosis increasingly appears to be distinct from that of primary atherosclerosis. Restenosis involves elastic recoil, incorporation of thrombus into the lesion and fibrocellular proliferation in varying degrees in different patients. Lack of an animal model that satisfactorily mimics restenosis is a major impediment to further understanding of the process. Clinical studies are hampered by difficulties in finding a single unifying definition of restenosis and by variable methods of reporting follow-up. Reporting of clinical outcomes of all patients in angiographic substudies would allow a more satisfactory interpretation of the results of clinical trials. Current noninvasive test results are not accurate enough to substitute for angiographic and clinical outcome data in intervention trials. In the majority of observational studies, only diabetes and unstable angina have emerged as consistently associated with restenosis; whereas most of the standard risk factors for atherosclerosis have a less consistent relation. Disappointingly, the new atherectomy and laser technologies have not affected restenosis rates. The one possible exception is coronary stenting, as a result of the larger luminal diameter achieved by the placement of the stent. In conclusion, although substantial continued effort is necessary to explore the basic aspects of cellular proliferation and mechanical alteration of atherosclerotic vessels, attention to the principles of clinical trials and observation are required to detect the impact of risk factors and interventions on the multifactorial problem of restenosis. Adequate sample sizes, collection of clinical and angiographic outcomes and factorial study designs hold promise for unraveling this important limitation of percutaneous intervention. 
Crescentic glomerulonephritis in Wegener's granulomatosis: morphology, therapy, outcome. Fourteen patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and severe renal and extrarenal involvement were studied (serum creatinine on admission 5.8 +/- 3.4 mg/dl). Renal histology showed a necrotizing, crescentic glomerulonephritis in all patients. Despite advanced renal disease on admission cyclophosphamide, steroids (in 13 patients) and plasma exchange (in 9 patients) caused a rapid and sustained improvement of renal function. Four patients required intermittent hemodialysis over a period of one week. After 2 weeks of treatment serum creatinine values below 2 mg/dl (n = 4) indicated a nearly complete recovery of renal function in the long-term follow up (mean serum creatinine achieved after 12 months therapy: 1.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dl (n = 4). Therefore serum creatinine values observed after 2 weeks of therapy, appear to be of prognostic value with regard to renal outcome. No relapse of active WG or progressive renal deterioration was observed during follow-up (22 +/- 13 months) except in one patient with persisting renal impairment. Three patients died (staphylococcus sepsis, intracerebral hemorrhage during hypertensive crisis, pulmonary embolism) during the first two months of therapy. The decline of serum creatinine seemed to be a better indicator of successful therapy than the decrease of anticytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and hematuria. On admission ANCA titer neither correlated with serum creatinine, the degree of renal involvement, nor was it of prognostic value. ANCA, serum creatinine and hematuria normalized within 2 to 8 months, whereas ESR and proteinuria remained elevated. Our data indicate a good prognosis of WG even with advanced renal involvement and generalized vasculitis provided aggressive treatment is performed early. 
The Istituto Rizzoli-Beretta experience with osteosarcoma of the jaw. Twenty-eight osteosarcomas (OS) of the jaw were reported. There were 15 male and 13 female patients (age range, 9 to 68 years; mean, 36.9 years); 57.1% of the patients were older than 30 years of age. Swelling was the most frequent symptom; it was reported on an average of 6 months before diagnosis. Most of the tumors of the maxilla (eight patients) occurred in the alveolar ridge (six of eight). In the mandible (20 patients), the body was the preferred site (11 of 20). Radiographically most of the lesions were either lytic and sclerotic or only lytic. Histologically, 12 cases (42.9%) were osteoblastic osteosarcoma, ten (35.8%) were chondroblastic, four (14.3%) were fibroblastic, and two (7%) were round cell OS. Of the 28 cases, three (10.7%) were low grade, and 25 (89.3%) were high grade. Thirteen patients had intralesional surgery, and 13 had marginal surgery as their initial treatment. Recurrence was the rule in the first group, and it was 69% in the second group. Twenty patients (71%) died, and eight are alive. Of these, two are alive with disease. In the six patients who are alive and disease-free, all but one had marginal to wide surgical margins at the time of the first procedure or wide margins at the time of the recurrences along with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In the patient in which the surgical margins were marginal, the lesion was small 2.5 X 2 cm. This patient was alive without evidence of disease after 9 years of follow-up. 
Accuracy of a mixed venous saturation catheter during acutely induced changes in hematocrit in humans. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of in vivo mixed venous hemoglobin saturation (Svo2) measurements with a fiber optic thermodilution catheter during acute changes in hematocrit. DESIGN: Comparison of fiberoptic in vivo Svo2 values with in vitro Svo2 values obtained with a multiwavelength spectrophotometer. SETTING: Operating room in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Six consecutive patients who are Jehovah's Witnesses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Before and after each step of hypervolemic hemodilution and after every 500 mL of blood loss, blood gases were analyzed and hemodynamic, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and in vitro and in vivo Svo2 measurements were made. Hematocrit values were measured in the range of 40% to 18%. Plotting all in vivo Svo2 values (n = 74) against the in vitro Svo2 measurements obtained during the entire study period gives r2 = .86. The accuracy of in vivo Svo2 measurements was not affected by changes in hematocrit or cardiac output. The Svo2 catheter value at the beginning of the study differed from the in vitro Svo2 value by -0.86 +/- 2.56% and at the end of the study period of 8 to 10 hrs by 0.71 +/- 3.04%. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of the studied fiberoptic continuous measuring Svo2 system was not affected by changes in hematocrit or cardiac output. No significant drift in the in vitro Svo2 measurements was observed. 
Valproate in the treatment of persistent chronic daily headache. An open label study. Thirty patients with persistent chronic daily headache, unresponsive to various combinations of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment were selected for an open label study using divalproex sodium. All patients had normal liver function tests. After a baseline observation period of 1 month, patients were given divalproex sodium 1000 to 2000 mg per day, for a period of 3 months. Blood valproic acid levels were kept between 75 and 100 mcg/ml. Liver function studies and blood ammonia levels were obtained periodically. Based on weekly headache index, headache-free days, dysfunctional days and patients' general well-being rating and physicians' global assessment, two thirds of the patients improved significantly. The common side effects included weight gain, tremor, hair loss and nausea. Liver functions were unaffected by treatment. The possible mechanism of action of valproate in headache is discussed. Valproate appears to be a worthwhile addition to the prophylactic treatment of chronic recurrent headache. 
Normal P300 following extensive damage to the left medial temporal lobe. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during auditory and visual "oddball" tasks from a patient with a severe verbal memory deficit due to a low grade infiltrating glioma which involved the full extent of the left medial temporal lobe. In both sensory modalities, the patient's oddball-evoked P300s were symmetrical and of normal amplitude. These findings are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that the hippocampus, or any other medial temporal structure, makes a substantial contribution to the scalp P300. 
Acid secretory changes and early relapse following duodenal ulcer healing with ranitidine or sucralfate. Controversial aspects relating to acid secretory changes following duodenal ulcer healing, and the effect of histamine-2 (H2)-receptor blockers on such changes are discussed. Recent studies comparing the effects of ranitidine or sucralfate on changes in the acid secretory responses in the healing of duodenal ulcers are described, and the relevance of these changes to early relapse considered. The duration of therapy and timing of acid-secretory studies and endoscopies are standardized in all studies, but the acid-secretory parameters vary. These comprised acid secretory responses to graded doses of an intravenous infusion of pentagastrin or histamine, sham-feeding responses, and basal and nocturnal acid secretion. In all studies, healing with sucralfate was associated with a significant decrease in the various parameters of acid secretion. In the ranitidine-healed groups, no appreciable decrease was noted and there was, indeed, a significant increase in nocturnal acid secretion. Routine endoscopies performed 4-6 weeks after documented ulcer healing showed a recurrence of 3 of the 32 (9%) sucralfate-healed and in 14 of the 35 (40%) ranitidine-healed ulcers. Increased acid secretory responsiveness following duodenal ulcer healing was strongly correlated with subsequent early relapse. 
Multicentric osteolysis: an infrequently recognized renal-rheumatologic syndrome. We describe the case of a young girl with Type III multicentric osteolysis, a rare syndrome characterized by osteolysis and renal insufficiency. Our report is intended to make physicians aware of this uncommon cause of renal and rheumatologic abnormalities. 
Management of low-grade cervical dysplasia during pregnancy. Fifty-five pregnant patients referred to my colposcopy service from 1985 to 1990 for biopsy-proven mild dysplasia were entered into a program of serial evaluations, including Pap test, colposcopy, and directed biopsy if indicated. The evaluations were done every 12 weeks during pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum to rule out new or occult invasive cervical cancer. By the time the postpartum biopsy was done, no such cancer had been detected. All 55 patients had mild dysplasia or less. I conclude that pregnant patients with biopsy-proven mild cervical dysplasia who have had adequate expert colposcopy and results of Pap test consistent with biopsy require only one antepartum colposcopy prior to postpartum reevaluation and treatment. Multiple interval cytologic and colposcopic studies with or without biopsy are unnecessary. The likelihood of invasive cervical cancer developing in these patients during pregnancy is negligible. 
Transcortical aphasia. Importance of the nonspeech dominant hemisphere in language repetition. While a relative preservation of repetition in acute transcortical aphasia (TA) has usually been associated with the functional integrity of the speech dominant (left) perisylvian area, recent amytal data (Bando et al., 1986) have suggested a fundamental role of the nondominant (right) hemisphere in language repetition. The neuroradiological correlates of repetition were studied in a consecutive series of 21 patients with acute TA. A similar frequency of either perisylvian or extraperisylvian pathology was found. In 2 patients with perisylvian pathology, the injection of amytal in the hemisphere contralateral to the lesion abolished repetition. Positron emission tomography (PET) in another patient revealed marked hypometabolism over the entire left cortical mantle ipsilateral to a basal ganglia lesion, suggesting that preserved repetition was carried out by right hemisphere structures. This was confirmed in a second patient with left extraperisylvian pathology, in whom a second lesion in the right hemisphere resulted in impaired repetition. These findings suggest that the spared contralateral hemisphere may subserve residual repetition in some transcortical aphasic patients with a lesion within or outside the speech-dominant perisylvian area. 
Retinal detachment adherent to posterior chamber IOL after Molteno implant surgery. A patient with refractory glaucoma 1 year after cataract extraction and trabeculectomy had Molteno implant surgery. Three days after surgery a kissing choroidal effusion and retinal detachment adherent to the posterior chamber IOL were detected. Repeated choroidal taps were unsuccessful. Removal of the Molteno implant, vitrectomy, and silicone oil injection were required to reattach the retina. 
Desmoplastic small cell tumors of the peritoneum coexpressing mesenchymal and epithelial markers. Desmoplastic small cell tumors arising diffusely within the abdomen and lacking an apparent organ of origin are rare. Most previously reported cases occurred in children, but young adult patients also have been described. Light microscopic examination shows the tumors to be composed of nests of small cells surrounded by an abundant desmoplastic stroma. Immunohistochemical findings reveal multidirectional differentiation with coexpression of cytokeratin, milk fat globule, neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7, desmin, and vimentin. Electron microscopic examination demonstrates paranuclear condensations of intermediate filaments. The authors describe two patients who died of their disease, despite aggressive chemotherapy and surgical intervention. 
Detection of hepatitis B virus DNA sequences in liver in HBsAg seronegative patients with liver disease with and without anti-HBc antibodies. Excluding studies from Brechot and co-workers, little support has been found for a role of the hepatitis B virus in the pathogenesis of HBsAg seronegative patients with predominantly chronic liver diseases, including primary liver cancer. In this study liver DNA from 59 predominantly British patients (four cases with paired biopsies, 6-12 months apart) with different, mostly chronic, liver diseases was analysed by molecular hybridization. All were seronegative for HBsAg and serum hepatitis B virus DNA (dot blot hybridization) and their liver diseases were believed to be unrelated to hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in liver of 11 (18.6 per cent) patients; nine had episomal (3.2 Kb) DNA and eight had higher molecular weight bands suggesting integrated forms. Six patients were also seronegative for anti-HBc. Patients of UK and non-UK origin were equally represented. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in serum of six of nine patients tested using the polymerase chain reaction. The detection of hepatitis B virus DNA in liver and in serum by this assay in a significant proportion of patients with chronic liver disease, hitherto unsuspected of being hepatitis B virus-related, suggests a possible role for this virus in low- as well as high-prevalence countries. 
Impairment of natural killer functions by interleukin 6 increases lymphoblastoid cell tumorigenicity in athymic mice. Expression of the human IL-6 gene in EBV-immortalized normal human B lymphocytes following retroviral-mediated transduction rendered these cells highly tumorigenic in athymic mice. The tumors were lymphomas composed of the originally inoculated human lymphoblastoid cells. Co-injection of IL-6 expressing EBV-immortalized cells with IL-6 nonexpressing control cells resulted in increased tumorigenicity of the IL-6 nonexpressing cells. The lymphoblastoid cells expressing IL-6 were indistinguishable from parental cell lines in morphology and in a variety of cell surface characteristics, and did not exhibit growth advantage over parental cell lines in vitro, such that increased tumorigenicity is unlikely to depend upon a direct oncogenic effect of IL-6 on the B cells. Rather, at high concentrations, IL-6 markedly inhibits human lymphoblastoid cell killing by IL-2-activated murine splenocytes in vitro, suggesting that IL-6-related tumorigenicity might depend upon IL-6 inhibiting cytotoxicity at the tumor site. Thus, production of IL-6 by tumor cells that results in natural killer cell dysfunctions illustrates a novel mechanism of tumor cell escape from immune surveillance. 
Racial differences in HLA antigen frequency and hypertensive renal failure. Black patients with hypertension are six times more likely to develop end-stage renal disease than are their white counterparts. To determine if genetic differences associated with the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system account for racial variation in hypertensive renal failure, we examined antigenic frequencies from a large renal transplant registry. Human Leukocyte Antigen phenotypes from cadaveric renal transplant recipients and donors in the South Eastern Organ Procurement Foundation database from 1982 to 1986 were analyzed. One thousand six hundred four renal transplant recipients with hypertensive renal failure as the cause of end stage renal disease (cases) were compared with 4506 race-matched cadaveric kidney donors (controls). Log-linear models were used to assess the relationship between hypertensive renal failure and prevalence of each HLA phenotype. Bonferroni adjustments of P values were used to correct for multiple comparisons. Comparison of HLA frequencies between blacks and whites with hypertensive renal failure demonstrated that blacks had an increased frequency of HLA-DR3 beyond that normally known to exist between black and white populations. Black cases compared to black controls had an 8.6% increase in HLA-DR3 frequency contrasted with a 1.6% decrease in the frequency of this antigen between white cases and white controls. This absolute 10.2% difference between the races was significant (P = .02) because the control black and white populations had nearly identical frequencies for this antigen. White cases compared to white controls had lower HLA-A1 and B8 frequencies (21.2% v 30.6%, P = .0005 and 13.7% v 22.3%, P = .001, respectively) and a greater HLA-B35 frequency (20.7% v 14.2%, P = .02). 
Later recurrence and longer survival among obese patients with renal cell carcinoma. To investigate the effect of obesity at diagnosis on prognosis of renal cell carcinoma, 360 renal cell carcinoma patients newly diagnosed at 29 hospitals in Oklahoma between January 1, 1981 and December 31, 1984 were followed through December 31, 1987. The Cox proportional-hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio, adjusting for other potentially prognostic factors. Both the disease-free interval and the overall survival were longer in patients who were obese (greater than or equal to 120% standard body mass index) at diagnosis. The adjusted-hazard ratio for disease recurrence between obese and nonobese patients was 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 to 0.98). The obese patients had an adjusted death hazard rate 0.68 times that of the nonobese patients (95% CI, 0.38 to 1.22). Although obesity was reported to increase the risk for renal cell carcinoma, prognosis was no worse and may be better among obese patients with the disease. 
Node negative breast cancer: the prognostic value of DNA ploidy for long-term survival. The DNA content of breast tumours from 170 patients who presented between 1978 and 1980 was measured by flow cytometry. The relationship between tumour ploidy and disease outcome was assessed and its association with other prognostic factors evaluated. Compared with those with diploid tumours, patients with aneuploid tumours had significantly earlier relapse and shorter survival (P less than 0.0001). Tumour ploidy was strongly related to grade (P less than 0.001), but there was no significant association between DNA ploidy and c-erb-B-2 expression, lymph node status or tumour size. In lymph node negative and c-erb-B-2 negative patients, aneuploid tumours were associated with a poorer prognosis (P less than 0.001) than diploid tumours. Multivariate analysis showed that tumour ploidy gave independent information on disease free and overall survival. Tumour ploidy may be used as an independent prognostic variable in patients with breast cancer and it may be helpful in defining patients within the node negative or c-erb-B-2 negative groups likely to have a poor outcome who might benefit from adjuvant treatment. 
Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. To determine whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may reduce the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), we retrospectively identified 322 consecutive patients who underwent a successful procedure from June 1988 to December 1989. No patients developed chest pain, ST segment elevation, positive cardiac enzymes, or other evidence of abrupt vessel closure following the PTCA. All patients received intravenous heparin after PTCA and aspirin was begun on the day prior to PTCA. Patients were separated into two groups: those at hospital discharge incidentally treated for hypertension or heart failure with ACE inhibitors (n = 36), and those treated with a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors (n = 286). The two groups were similar with respect to age (61 +/- 13.5 vs. 60 +/- 12.5, p = NS) and other demographic characteristics. Restenosis, defined as the presentation to a physician with symptoms of angina within 6 months of the PTCA and the finding on repeat catheterization of a significant restenosis at the site of the PTCA, occurred in 30% of the patients who were discharged on a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors vs. 3% (p less than .05) in those treated with an ACE inhibitor. Thus, it appears that the use of ACE inhibitors may significantly reduce the incidence of restenosis after successful PTCA. 
Haemodynamic significance of incompetent calf perforating veins. A total of 149 consecutive unselected patients (221 limbs) who presented with signs and symptoms of chronic venous problems (varicose veins with or without ankle oedema, skin changes and leg ulcers) have been studied by clinical examination, ascending deep to superficial venography, Doppler ultrasound and ambulatory venous pressure measurements. Of the limbs, 180 (82 per cent) had varicose veins without obstruction in the deep veins or reflux in the popliteal or femoral veins while 41 (18 per cent) had deep venous disease. Of the 180 limbs with 'primary' varicose veins 110 (60 per cent) did not have incompetent calf perforating veins (group A) while 70 (40 per cent) did (group B). On the basis of the ambulatory venous pressure after calf muscle exercise and the refilling time, the incompetent calf perforating veins of limbs in group B belonged to three subgroups of different haemodynamic significance. In 20 limbs (30 per cent) they were found to be of no haemodynamic significance, in 25 (35 per cent) of moderate haemodynamic significance and in 25 (35 per cent) of major haemodynamic significance. The last were, on clinical examination, indistinguishable from limbs with deep venous disease although they had patent deep veins with competent popliteal valves. 
Neonatal short bowel syndrome. In this retrospective study the management of infants who had undergone resection of more than 50% of the small bowel as newborn infants between 1970 and 1988 was analyzed to define prognostic factors. Small bowel resections were performed for atresia (36 cases), volvulus (22 cases), gastroschisis (10 cases), necrotizing enterocolitis (11 cases), and other disorders (8 cases). Patients were classified into two groups depending on the length of residual small bowel: group 1 (n = 35) had less than 40 cm of small bowel and group 2 (n = 51) had 40 to 80 cm of residual small bowel. Patients in group 2 had significantly better survival rates than those in group 1 (92.0% vs 66.6%; p less than 0.001). The patients in group 1 who were born after 1980, when home parenteral nutrition was introduced, had better survival rates than those who were treated before 1980 (95.0% vs 65.0%; p less than 0.01). The time required for acquisition of intestinal adaptation depended on the intestinal length (average, 27.3 months for group 1 and 14 months for group 2; p less than 0.01) and on the presence or absence of the ileocecal valve. Parenteral or supportive enteral nutrition, or both, ensured normal growth in both groups. We conclude that more than 90% of infants now survive after extensive small bowel resection with parenteral nutrition and that the remaining small intestine will adapt with time. Home-based parenteral nutrition allowed children to be treated in the best psychosocial environment. 
Nonpharmacological therapy of hypertension. Commentary on diet and blood pressure. The use of dietary measures as sole therapy for hypertension has generated much enthusiasm and is supported by epidemiological and anecdotal data but is not substantiated by long-term controlled trials. Dietary measures should be effective in preventing the rise in blood pressure with age in civilized populations, but there are no firm data to substantiate this hypothesis. However, some data do suggest that weight loss and sodium restriction may benefit the drug-treated hypertensive patient. There are strong reasons to consider the use of nonpharmacological measures for the treatment of mild hypertension. Mild hypertension is ubiquitous. Some population subsets have a prevalence of mild hypertension approaching 40%, based on one blood pressure determination, for individuals older than 50 years. Even if the true prevalence is closer to 15%, this is a high proportion of the population in need of drug therapy. If a change in lifestyle could reduce the need for drug therapy by a respectable percentage, then an enormous number of individuals could be spared the necessity of taking antihypertensive medication. 
Inhibition of endogenous superoxide dismutase with diethyldithiocarbamate in acute island skin flaps. Oxygen free radicals have been implicated in postischemic tissue damage in a variety of experimental models including the island skin flap. Previous studies have demonstrated that supplementing animals with exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD), a free radical scavenger, improves tissue survival in island flaps. No studies to our knowledge have attempted to inhibit endogenous SOD in a skin flap model. In this experiment 20 control rats demonstrated a 12.00% flap necrosis 7 days after a modified ventral island skin flap was raised. A second group of 20 rats were supplemented with exogenous SOD (50,000 U/kg 30 minutes preoperatively and 12 hours postoperatively) and demonstrated a statistically significant decreased flap necrosis of 5.28%. A third group of 20 rats received diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC, 0.5 gm/kg 12 hours preoperatively), an agent previously shown to inhibit SOD, and demonstrated a statistically significant increased flap necrosis of 19.77%. In a final group of 20 rats the effect of DDC was overcome by supplementation with exogenous SOD, obtaining a flap necrosis of 8.35%. Our results add further support to the importance of SOD and oxygen free radicals in postischemic tissue damage by demonstrating increased tissue necrosis with inhibition of endogenous SOD. This suggests that there is a baseline degree of SOD activity in ischemic areas working to preserve tissue. It appears that the copper-containing species of SOD found primarily in the cytoplasm plays a pivotal role in preservation of postischemic tissue. 
Acute and chronic symptoms of mononucleosis. BACKGROUND. The clinical symptoms and durations of illness of patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM) are variable and are poorly documented in the scientific literature. METHODS. Patients who presented for care at the Student Health Service of a Canadian university between September 1985 and May 1988 and had been diagnosed as having IM were surveyed. Health experience during the acute and convalescent phases of IM was compared with that of a group of patients matched for age, sex, date of diagnosis, and year of study, who had suffered acute upper respiratory tract infections (URI), other than Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced, during the same period. RESULTS. Students were sicker for longer after IM than after non-EBV-induced URI. During the acute phase of illness, the symptoms of fatigue (P = less than .000001), night sweats (P = .000001), and painful neck swelling (P = .00003) were seen significantly more often in the IM group. The severity and duration of these symptoms were also significantly worse in IM patients. Getting tired easily (P = .002), diurnal somnolence (P = .002), and depression (P = .002) were significantly more common postacute symptoms. Eleven percent of IM patients reported persistence of symptoms longer than 100 days, and in 6% of patients the symptoms had persisted after 1 year. Convalescent cases showed a trend toward reduced alcohol intake and, perhaps, reduced alcohol tolerance. CONCLUSIONS. IM involves excessive morbidity in a student community compared with URI that was other than EBV-induced, during both the acute and the postacute phases of infection. 
Analysis of septic morbidity following gunshot wounds to the colon: the missile is an adjuvant for abscess. Over a 7-year period, 151 patients with gunshot wounds to the colon surviving beyond 24 hours were managed. The bullet was retained in the body in 66% and exited in 34%. Thirty-four (23%) developed major septic complications (diffuse peritonitis, 21%; intraperitoneal abscesses 24%; and extraperitoneal abdominal abscesses, 56%). The septic complication rate was 26% in the bullet-present group compared with 16% in the remainder (p less than 0.15). The increased septic rate in those with bullets present was the result of abscesses developing around the retained missile. That group with missile abscesses had a lesser degree of injury as measured by the abdominal trauma index compared with the other patients with septic complications (p less than 0.001). Fifteen (79%) of the 19 patients with missile and missile track abscesses had them develop in the psoas muscle. These abscesses occur by fecal contamination of the muscle following inoculation by the bullet, which passes through the large bowel. Computed tomography-guided and operative drainage tend to fail if the foreign body is not removed. Computed tomography-guided or operative drainage should be successful in draining missile track abscesses when the bullet has exited the patient. 
Molecular characterization of a supratypic cross-reactive idiotype associated with IgM autoantibodies. Neoplastic B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLL) frequently express surface Ig reactive with the mouse mAb, Lc1. Raised against a human monoclonal IgM with rheumatoid factor activity, Lc1 detects a major cross-reactive Id (CRI) present on the H chain of many monoclonal IgM autoantibodies. In contrast to other major autoantibody-CRI investigated to date, we note that the Lc1-CRI is expressed by subpopulation of cells in the germinal centers, as well as in the mantle zones, of secondary human B cell follicles. To examine the molecular basis for Lc1 expression, we used the polymerase chain reaction to isolate the functionally rearranged Ig VH genes of monoclonal Lc1-reactive B cell populations from six unrelated patients with CLL or SLL. Although the neoplastic B cells from most patients with CLL or SLL express the CD5 surface differentiation Ag, the lymphoma cells from one patient with SLL were CD5-negative. We find that the Lc1-reactive cells from each cell population have Ig rearrangements involving a VH gene of the VH4 subgroup. However, the VH4 genes rearranged in different Lc1-reactive tumor populations may originate from at least two disparate germ-line VH4 genes. Also, in contrast to the CD5-positive tumor populations, we find evidence for intraclonal diversity in the functionally rearranged VH4 genes of the CD5-negative SLL. Collectively, this study discerns a degeneracy in the VH4 genes that can encode the Lc1 CRI, indicating the term "supratypic cross-reactive idiotype" may best describe the specificity of the Lc1 mAb. Also, this study suggests that expression of CD5 may delineate categories of B cell SLL that differ in their relative rates of constitutive Ig V gene somatic mutation. 
Invasive aspergillus rhinosinusitis in patients with acute leukemia. Invasive aspergillus rhinosinusitis is a potentially lethal complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with acute leukemia. The majority of cases are caused by Aspergillus flavus. The infection is difficult to diagnose early but should be suspected when a neutropenic patient develops persistent fever without a known source, symptoms of rhinitis or sinusitis, cutaneous findings over the nose or sinuses, symptoms and signs of orbital or cavernous sinus disease, or an ulcerating lesion of the hard palate or gingiva. Careful anterior rhinoscopy followed by computed tomography of the sinus helps establish the diagnosis, which should be confirmed by histologic study and culture of biopsied material. Early treatment with aggressive surgery, high-dose amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, and possibly white blood cell transfusions may produce a cure if the patient's bone marrow recovers. Newer antifungal agents offer promise for prophylaxis and treatment of this infection. 
Hemodynamic monitoring: a technology assessment. Technology Subcommittee of the Working Group on Critical Care, Ontario Ministry of Health. OBJECTIVE: To review catheterization of the right side of the heart according to technical capability, diagnostic accuracy, range of possible uses, therapeutic impact, benefit to patient outcome and impact on health care workers. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE was searched for English-language articles published since 1962. Additional references were selected from the bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Nonrandomized trials and retrospective reviews were included because of a paucity of randomized controlled trials. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: After a review of the data on hemodynamic monitoring by the subcommittee members, guidelines were developed through the use of the nominal group and Delphi consensus-gathering techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The use of catheterization of the right side of the heart for hemodynamic monitoring should be reserved for tertiary and secondary care hospitals, which are adequately staffed by physicians and nurses well versed in the use of such monitoring. Future research should be directed at determining whether the use of hemodynamic monitoring will improve outcomes among patients, especially those with myocardial infarction, septic shock or pulmonary edema. 
Cervical dystonia: clinical findings and associated movement disorders. We studied 300 patients, 61% women, with mean age 49.7 years and mean duration of dystonia 7.8 years, to determine the demographic and clinical characteristics of cervical dystonia (CD) and its relationships to other movement disorders. Torticollis was present in 82%, laterocollis in 42%, retrocollis in 29%, and anterocollis in 25%; however, the majority (66%) had a combination of these abnormal postures. Scoliosis was present in 39%, local pain reported by 68%, and 32% had evidence of secondary cervical radiculopathy. In addition to CD, 16% of patients had oral dystonia, 12% mandibular dystonia, 10% hand/arm dystonia, and 10% had blepharospasm. Tremor was noted in 71% of patients; head-neck tremor was present in 60%, and tremor in other body regions was present in 32%. A family history of a movement disorder was present in 44% of the CD patients. Tardive dystonia was the cause in 6%; 11% had posttraumatic dystonia. Anticholinergic drugs provided moderate improvement in 33% of patients, but local intramuscular botulinum toxin injections relieved CD, local pain, or both in over 90% of all treated patients. 
Na(+)-H+ exchanger and its role in essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The Na(+)-H+ exchanger is a ubiquitous transport system that is involved in the regulation of intracellular pH, cell growth and proliferation, cell volume regulation, and transepithelial absorption of Na+, Cl-, and HCO3-. Altered activity of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger has been implicated as a mechanism contributing to the development of high blood pressure in subgroups of patients with essential hypertension and in various animal models of hypertension. Many of these studies measured Na(+)-Li+ exchange rather than Na(+)-H+ exchange, hypothesizing that Na(+)-Li+ exchange represents a functional mode of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger. However, this is a controversial assumption. Several studies have also shown an association between erythrocyte Na(+)-Li(+)-exchange rate and predisposition to nephropathy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The recent cDNA cloning of at least one isoform of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger will help clarify the cellular mechanisms of regulation of the exchanger and its possible role in pathophysiological states such as hypertension. 
Global T wave inversion. Because global T wave inversion has not been specifically characterized, 100 electrocardiograms (ECGs) with this pattern (frontal plane T vector -100 degrees to -170 degrees with precordial T inversion) were prospectively collected from approximately 30,000 consecutively interpreted ECGs and analyzed blindly. There was a striking female predominance (82 women vs. 18 men; p less than 0.0005) despite an essentially equal number of female and male hospital admissions. There was a single statistically significant ECG correlate: a more vertical QRS axis in women (+14.1 degrees +/- 45.3 degrees vs. -5.6 degrees +/- 31.3 degrees; p = 0.034). The T waves were basically symmetric (68%), the influence of this factor usually altering the characteristically asymmetric T wave inversions of right bundle branch block (4 of 5) and left ventricular hypertrophy (21 of 36). Asymmetry was mainly associated with digoxin therapy (21 of 32 patients taking digoxin; p less than or equal to 0.0005) and a corrected QT (QTc) interval (0.433 +/- 0.095) shorter than with symmetric T wave inversions (0.507 +/- 0.074; p less than or equal to 0.0005) though not reaching the degree of shortening expected for digitalization. Twenty-eight patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and 23 for a central nervous system disorder accounted for the majority of patients with symmetric T wave inversion. Fifteen of 18 patients who had coronary angiography had some degree of coronary artery disease: 3 had angiographically normal coronary arteries. 
Enteropathogens associated with acute diarrheal disease in urban infants in Sao Paulo, Brazil. To determine the prevalence and epidemiology of enteropathogens in acute infantile diarrhea, 500 infants less than or equal to 12 months of age with diarrhea and 500 age-matched control subjects coming to a Sao Paulo emergency room were studied. Enteropathogens were identified in 55% of case infants and 10% of controls; enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) of classic EPEC serotypes producing EPEC adherence factor (EAF) (26% of case infants), rotavirus (14%), Salmonella species (8%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (7%), and Shigella species (5%) were associated with diarrhea. Isolation of EAF+ classic EPEC decreased with increasing age of cases and peaked in spring, whereas rotavirus was least common in early infancy and peaked in fall and winter. Bloody stool had a 36% positive predictive value for Shigella infection, EAF+ classic EPEC were highly resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Among poor Sao Paulo infants, EAF+ classic EPEC equaled or exceeded rotavirus throughout the year as a cause of diarrhea bringing children to medical attention. 
Gastritis due to spiral shaped bacteria other than Helicobacter pylori: clinical, histological, and ultrastructural findings. An intensive histological search for Helicobacter pylori in gastric biopsy specimens has led to the detection of other spiral shaped bacteria in the human gastric mucosa. The clinical and morphological findings of 39 cases (0.25% of all gastric biopsies performed in the observation period) are reported for 34 patients (87.2%) complaining of upper abdominal discomfort. Five patients (12.8%) had chronic gastritis and 34 (87.2%) chronic active gastritis. The organisms were seen by light microscopy deep in the gastric foveolae and intracellularly. The scanning and transmission electron microscopic findings show bacteria which invade and damage gastric mucosal cells. These organisms are similar to the spiral shaped bacteria found in the stomachs of cats and dogs and non-human primates. In eight patients organisms were not detected after four weeks of treatment with bismuth salts. The disappearance of the organisms coincided with resolution of the chronic active gastritis and the symptoms. 
J. Maxwell Chamberlain Memorial Paper. Role of staging in prognosis and management of thymoma. Eighty-five patients operated on for thymoma from 1972 to 1989 were evaluated, 32 with myasthenia gravis and 53 without. Masaoka staging revealed stage I disease in 45 (53%), stage II in 23 (27%), stage III in 14 (16%), and stage IVa in 3 (4%). There was no operative mortality. Actuarial survival at 10 years was 63.7% for all patients: 78.3% for those in stage I, 74.7% for those in stage II, and 20.8% for those in stage III. There was no recurrence in patients in stage I. Mediastinal recurrence developed in 4 patients in stage II considered to have noninvasive disease by the surgeon. It is recommended that all patients be followed up for a minimum of 10 years and that all patients in stages II and III receive postoperative radiotherapy. The presence of myasthenia gravis is no longer considered as an adverse factor in survival. 
Particle shedding and migration from silicone genitourinary prosthetic devices. Of 26 patients undergoing revision of genitourinary prostheses the surrounding reactive fibrous capsule was biopsied in 25 and the draining lymph nodes also were biopsied in 4. The prostheses included 16 inflatable and 14 flexible penile devices, and 10 artificial urinary sphincters. Tissue was examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. X-ray microanalysis was done on intracellular and extracellular foreign material from each specimen. Silicone was found in 18 of the 25 periprosthetic specimens and in all 4 lymph nodes. Foreign body granulomas were identified in 14 of these 29 specimens. Examination of new and explanted versions of each prosthesis by scanning electron microscopy revealed free particles of silicone or silicates on the surface of most devices. Pitting and microfissuring were seen on a few of the new devices and on nearly all of the used ones. Thus, genitourinary prostheses shed silicone particles that can be found in the fibrous capsule and draining lymph nodes. 
Hyperglycemia and neurological outcome in patients with head injury. To examine the relationship between serum glucose and the outcome of patients suffering from head injury, the authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 169 patients admitted for treatment to Harborview Medical Center (a regional trauma center). All patients underwent craniotomy for evacuation of intracranial hematoma and/or placement of a subarachnoid bolt for intracranial pressure monitoring under general anesthesia. Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less had significantly higher serum glucose levels than patients with GCS scores of 12 to 15 (mean +/- standard error of the mean 192 +/- 7 mg/dl vs. 130 +/- 8 mg/dl or 10.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter vs. 7.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter) (p less than 0.0001). Patients who subsequently remained in a vegetative state or died had significantly higher glucose levels both on admission and postoperatively than patients who had good outcome or moderate disability (217 +/- 12 mg/dl vs. 167 +/- 6 mg/dl or 12.1 +/- 0.7 mmol/liter vs. 9.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter on admission, and 240 +/- 16 mg/dl vs. 156 +/- 5 mg/dl or 13.3 +/- 0.9 mmol/liter vs. 8.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter postoperatively) (p less than 0.0001). Among the more severely injured patients (GCS score less than or equal to 8), a serum glucose level greater than 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/liter) postoperatively is associated with a significantly worse outcome (p less than 0.01). The authors conclude that severely head-injured patients frequently develop hyperglycemia and the elevated serum glucose level may aggravate ischemic insults and worsen the neurological outcome in such patients. 
Lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast: clinical, pathologic, and mammographic features. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) was diagnosed in 165 surgical specimens (119 patients) at our institution between 1974 and 1987. LCIS was seen more often in younger women (mean age, 49 years) than other breast carcinomas were (mean age, 58 years). Sampling of a single breast revealed multifocal disease in 70% (96/138). When both breasts were sampled, bilateral foci were found in 50% (41/82). Of 165 breasts with foci of LCIS, 37% (61/165) had simultaneously occurring invasive cancers in the same breast. Direct mammographic-pathologic correlation of foci of LCIS was possible in 73 breasts (67 patients). Microcalcifications were an indication for biopsy in 49% (20/41) of breasts with a mammographic abnormality, but were a nonspecific finding often found in tissues adjacent to foci of LCIS. The mammogram was normal in 44% (32/73) of breasts with foci of LCIS. The mammograms of patients with LCIS and those from a group of age-matched control subjects were compared by using a modified form of Wolfe's criteria and the percentage of fibroglandular elements. LCIS was seldom found in an N1 breast (1% vs 29%) or in a breast with less than 25% of its parenchymal area occupied by fibroglandular density (3% vs 33%). Compared with the control group, breasts with LCIS had more than 50% fibroglandular density (85% vs 45%) and a much higher frequency of the DY pattern (56% vs 36%). More fibroglandular density was seen in the LCIS group at all ages. Postmenopausally, the frequencies of the DY pattern and fibroglandular density greater than 50% in LCIS patients were nearly double those in the control group. LCIS patients have disease of the entire breast parenchyma, characterized by multifocality and bilaterality of various forms of lobular disease. Their mammograms reveal a higher rate of the DY pattern and higher percentages of fibroglandular or parenchymal density than those of age-matched controls. In LCIS patients, persistence of the DY pattern, or large amounts of fibroglandular density postmenopausally supports the concept that mammographically dense breasts are a marker for increased cancer risk in women 50 years old and older. 
Selective 2-[18F]fluorodopa uptake for melanogenesis in murine metastatic melanomas. The relationship between 3,4-dihydroxy-2-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine (2-[18F]FDOPA) uptake and melanogenesis was studied using mice bearing two B16 melanomas: B16-F1 has a higher melanin synthesis ability and a slower growing rate than the higher metastatic B16-F10. A significantly higher 2-[18F]FDOPA uptake by B16-F1 than by B16-F10 and a reverse relationship for the uptake of [14C] 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose and [3H]thymidine were observed 1 hr postinjection. F1-to-F10 ratios of both the 2-[18F]FDOPA uptake and the acid-insoluble radioactivity increased to about 5 at 6 hr, which paralleled the melanin content. FM3A mammary carcinoma showed a 2-[18F]FDOPA uptake similar to the B16-F10 but without the acid-insoluble radioactivity. With D,L-DOPA loading, a 55% decreased uptake by FM3A 1 hr postinjection was significantly greater than the 20% reduction in both melanomas. O-Methylated 2-[18F]FDOPA was a predominant acid-soluble metabolite in all tumors. Whole-body autoradiography discriminated the two melanomas clearly. 2-[18F]FDOPA may be a promising tracer for the selective imaging of melanogenesis. 
Use of percutaneous nephrostomy in malignant ureteric obstruction. Seventeen patients with malignant disease underwent percutaneous nephrostomy to relieve renal failure secondary to ureteric obstruction. Renal function improved in 88%. The median survival time was 18 weeks and 58% left the primary hospital to return home or to a terminal care hospice. Minor complications occurred in 58%. The use of bilateral nephrostomy tubes conferred no greater benefit than a unilateral tube. Intervention in malignant ureteric obstruction may confer some benefit and should not necessarily be viewed with pessimism. 
Inhibition of burn pain by intravenous lignocaine infusion. Patients with burns often suffer severe pain, especially during dressing of wounds, but there are no established alternatives to potent opiate analgesics, with their various side-effects. Intravenous lignocaine infusion strikingly reduced self-assessed pain scores in 7 patients during the first 3 days after second-degree burns, without need for supplementary opiate analgesia. 
Acetylcholine receptor-reactive T and B cells in myasthenia gravis and controls. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is strongly associated with antibodies to acetylcholine receptor (AChR), whereas the extent of T cell involvement is not settled. The number of cells secreting interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to AChR during 48 h culture of blood mononuclear cells (PBL) may reflect AChR-reactive T cells. Using an immunospot assay, we detected such cells in 23 of 30 patients with MG at a mean number of 1 per 33.333 PBL. AChR-reactive T cells were also found in patients with other neurological diseases (OND) and in healthy subjects but at lower frequencies and numbers. The T cell response to purified protein derivative and to PHA, and also to two major myelin proteins (basic protein and proteolipid protein) did not differ between MG and the two control groups, underlining the specificity of an augmented T cell reactivity to AChR in MG. Evaluation of the B cell response by enumerating anti-AChR IgG antibody secreting cells revealed such cells in 27 of 28 patients with MG at a mean value of 1 per 14,085 PBL. Cells secreting anti-AChR antibodies of the IgA and IgM isotypes were also detected in MG, but less frequently, at lower numbers, and only in conjunction with IgG antibody secreting cells. Anti-AChR antibody secreting cells were also found among patient with OND and in healthy controls, but at lower frequencies and numbers. These data confirm that AChR is a major target for autoimmune response in MG. 
Effects of high-dose aprotinin on blood loss, platelet function, fibrinolysis, complement, and renal function after cardiopulmonary bypass. The use of aprotinin to reduce blood loss after cardiopulmonary bypass is under debate. Concern has been raised about the renal effects of aprotinin. We administered a mean aprotinin dose of 4.2 x 10(6) kallikrein-inhibiting units to 13 patients with coronary disease undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for 74 +/- 5 minutes (mean +/- standard error of the mean); 13 comparable patients having cardiopulmonary bypass served as control subjects, and all were studied postoperatively for 24 hours. Aprotinin reduced postoperative blood loss by 50% (p = 0.0082). Two of the 13 patients who received aprotinin needed one red cell unit each versus a total of 18 units in eight of 13 control patients (p = 0.0096). Blood pressure, hemoglobin value and serum protein concentration were higher after operation in the aprotinin group (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.01). Platelet counts did not differ, but plasma thromboxane was lower in aprotinin recipients (p less than 0.001). In control patients fibrinogen degradation products (D dimer) doubled, and alpha 2-antiplasmin activity was halved during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 0.01 to p less than 0.001), whereas aprotinin patients showed no changes. The complement breakdown products C4a, C3a, and C3dg as well as C9 neoantigen increased from prebypass baseline in both groups (p less than 0.001); the increment of C3a and C3dg was greater in the aprotinin than in the control patients (p less than 0.001). Serum electrolytes, osmolality, and creatinine remained normal in both groups of patients. Creatinine clearance was normal or above normal and virtually identical in both groups. Osmolar clearance and fractional sodium excretion were higher in the aprotinin group than in the control group shortly after cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.01); renal function was unremarkable the next morning. No adverse clinical effects attributable to aprotinin were seen. In summary, aprotinin offers advantages for cardiopulmonary bypass. 
Resection of a granular cell tumor at the hepatic confluence. A precarious location for a benign tumor. Granular cell tumors are lesions that account for less than 10 per cent of benign biliary tumors and only 1 per cent occur in the biliary tract. Since the first description, 45 other cases have been described to which we add a case. In reviewing the literature, a striking predominance in black females is evident. The most frequent location of these tumors in the biliary tree appears to be the common bile duct (50%), followed by the cystic duct (37%), the hepatic ducts (15%), and the gallbladder (4%). Most patients have been treated with resection followed by restoration of biliary continuity using biliary enteric diversion. In the case presented, the tumor was located at the hepatic confluence with extension into the hepatic substance requiring segmental duct cholangiojejunostomy after resection. This resulted in fulminant sepsis and death despite adequate preoperative biliary decompression and the lack of signs or symptoms of infected bile. Alternative forms of management in the treatment of this benign condition at this location are discussed. 
Naevocytic naevi with vascular-like spaces. Fourteen cases of naevocytic naevi with anastomising lacunae suggestive of vascular spaces are reported. The cells lining these lacunae were consistent with naevus cells, being positive for vimentin and S100 protein and negative for factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europaeus I. The cells were not surrounded by laminin or type IV collagen. We suggest the formation of these vascular-like spaces may be due to defective production or increased degradation of components of the basement membrane with a consequent lack of cohesion. 
Somatosensory evoked potentials in intracranial hypertension: analysis of the effects of hypoxia. The loss of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP's) was investigated in a feline model of intracranial hypertension. Threshold values of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) required for maintenance of SSEP's are defined using a mathematical model. The model describes loss of amplitude of SSEP's using the form of a dose-response curve. Amplitude of the SSEP's declined to 50% of control values at a CBF of 15 ml/100 gm/min and a CPP of 20 mm Hg in the normoxic animal; in the presence of mild hypoxia (8 to 9 kPa), a significant increase in these values to 18 ml/100 gm/min and 32 mm Hg, respectively, occurred. No reliable changes in latency or central conduction time were demonstrated. It is concluded that given adequate oxygenation, evoked electrical activity is lost at too low a level of CPP for this parameter to be useful in clinical monitoring. However, even mild hypoxia, when combined with intracranial hypertension, produces a major risk to neuronal integrity. 
The effect of ethanol on the uptake, binding, and desialylation of transferrin by rat liver endothelium: implications in the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated hepatic siderosis. Chronic alcoholism has been reported to be associated with a reduced carbohydrate content of transferrin (TF), particularly, its reduced sialylation state. Low sialylation state of TF now serves as an objective marker of chronic alcohol abuse. To investigate the pathophysiological significance of this finding in relation to hepatic siderosis, also commonly associated with chronic alcoholism, the authors have investigated the effect of ethanol on the uptake, binding, and desialylation of transferrin by isolated rat liver endothelium in vitro. In pulse-chase experiments, transferrin labeled with either 125I (protein-labeled) or 3H (sialic acid-labeled) was incubated with isolated, fractionated liver endothelium with and without ethanol, and the supernates were subjected to column chromatography using RCA120- agarose. Incubation of the endothelium with increasing concentrations of ethanol resulted in a progressive increase in the desialylation rate of transferrin which was maximal when 160 mM concentration of ethanol was used. These data indicate that ethanol significantly promotes the desialylation of transferrin by rat liver endothelium. The implications of these findings in the pathogenesis of hepatic siderosis of the alcoholic are discussed. 
Causes of blindness and visual handicap in the Central African Republic. The causes of bilateral blindness (best visual acuity less than 3/60) in 1371 people in the Central African Republic seen between 1985 and 1989 who attended eye clinics in 10 out of the 16 prefectures across the country are given. The main causes of bilateral blindness were cataract (51%), glaucoma (12.7%), and onchocerciasis (8.1%). In 710 patients with unilateral blindness the main causes were cataract (38%), glaucoma (10%), iritis (7.5%), and trauma (6.3%). Bilateral blindness in children was rarely seen. The causes of visual impairment (vision between 6/18 and 3/60) in 424 patients were cataract, including aphakia (38%), maculopathy (14%), and onchocerciasis (7%). 
Endothelial cell damage by Walker carcinosarcoma cells is dependent on vitronectin receptor-mediated tumor cell adhesion. The transport of cancer cells from blood vessels to extravascular tissue is a critical step in metastasis, where endothelial cells and the vascular basement membrane act as barriers to cell traffic. Because endothelial injury can facilitate the metastasis of intravascular cancer cells in vivo, the authors have studied in vitro the free-radical-mediated endothelial damage caused by the rat Walker 256 carcinosarcoma (W256) cell after stimulation with 10(-6) mol/l (molar) phorbol ester. Here the authors have examined the hypothesis that W256 cell-mediated endothelial injury is dependent on adhesion between the effector and target cells. Attachment of phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated W256 cells to endothelial monolayers was increased 1.8 +/- 0.1-fold and damage (3H-2-deoxyglucose release from labeled endothelium) 1.4 +/- 0.1-fold after 4-hour pretreatment of the endothelium with 10 ng/ml recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha (rIL-1 alpha). Under various assay conditions, the release of 3H-2-deoxyglucose correlated directly with tumor cell adhesion (r = 0.98, P less than 0.005). In the presence of a polyclonal anti-vitronectin receptor antiserum, adhesion of stimulated W256 cells to rIL-1 alpha-treated monolayers was inhibited by 39% +/- 2%, and 3H-2-deoxyglucose release was inhibited by 53% +/- 13%. Immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence flow cytometry demonstrated that the endothelial cells but not the W256 cells expressed vitronectin receptor (VnR) on their cell surface. The surface expression of VnR by endothelial cells was increased 1.9 +/- 0.1-fold after 4 hours' incubation with rIL-1 alpha. The authors conclude that W256 cell-mediated endothelial damage is dependent on cell adhesion, which, in turn, is partly regulated by the expression of VnR on the endothelial cell surface. 
Prospective neuropathological validation of Hachinski's Ischaemic Score in dementias. The sensitivity and specificity of Hachinski's Ischaemic Score (IS) in the diagnosis of the vascular aetiology of dementia was studied in a series of 32 demented patients, dementia of the Alzheimer type (16), multi-infarct dementia (7), mixed dementia (6), Pick's disease (3), with neuropathological diagnosis as the point of reference. The IS distinguished between primary degenerative dementia and multi-infarct or mixed dementia. As single features of the IS "a positive history of stroke" and "a fluctuating course" showed differing prevalences in the latter two diagnostic categories. The IS labelled 21% of patients with primary degenerative dementia as having a vascular aetiology. The uncritical application of the IS to large samples in epidemiological studies may cause incorrect labelling of a significant proportion of patients with primary degenerative dementia as vascular dementia. These results are based on observations of long-term inpatients and depend on neuropathological criteria. While the definite diagnosis of DAT by threshold criteria concerning plaque and tangle counts is well established, neither clinical nor pathological evidence of stroke necessarily means that cerebrovascular disease has anything to do with a patient's dementia. 
Shunt failure caused by valve collapse. Shunt failure due to collapse of the Mini-Holter valve was observed 13 times in 11 out of 179 children with an implanted Mini-Holter ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) or ventriculo-atrial (VA) shunt during a 10 year period. Intussusception of the proximal or distal end of the valve thus caused a shunt failure rate of 6% of the children in this series. Two children experienced this complication twice. All collapsed valves were part of a VP shunt system. Because of this experience use of the mini valve was abandoned and an adult Holter valve was implanted in children over the age of one month. Breakdown of this particular valve has not occurred in 102 children and two hundred adults with the adult Holter shunt system. 
Adrenergic receptor responsiveness and congestive heart failure. Our knowledge and understanding of the structure, mechanism of action and regulation of receptor-adenylate cyclase systems have increased dramatically in the last few years. A family of receptors (including the beta-adrenergic receptors) and guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G proteins) have been purified and cloned. Structure-function studies are beginning to provide insight into how the various components of the transmembrane signaling apparatus interact to promote alterations in the activity of the effector systems. Much effort has been devoted to understanding how various pathophysiologic conditions, such as ischemia or congestive heart failure, and the therapeutic methods used to treat such conditions perturb or regulate receptor systems. It has become abundantly clear that such regulation does occur but is not restricted to simple alterations in receptor number, and may well involve covalent modification (phosphorylation) of receptors or alteration in the ability of receptors to interact with G proteins. In addition, regulation of the quantity or functionality of the various G proteins and the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase itself appear to occur. For example, recent evidence suggests that congestive heart failure in humans is associated with a decreased number of beta-adrenergic receptors as well as an increased quantity of the inhibitory G protein (Gi). These alterations may provide important insight into how to develop new therapeutic methods. Mechanisms generally responsible for transmembrane signaling, how the components are regulated by pathophysiologic conditions, and drugs used to treat disease states are discussed in detail. 
Human recombinant DNA-derived antihemophilic factor (factor VIII) in the treatment of hemophilia A. recombinant Factor VIII Study Group BACKGROUND. Current treatment of hemophilia A, a hereditary disorder affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 males, relies on plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates. We tested the safety and efficacy of a recombinant factor VIII preparation for the treatment of this disorder. METHODS. We conducted the investigation in three stages: comparing the pharmacokinetics of plasma-derived and recombinant factor VIII, assessing the efficacy of recombinant factor VIII for home therapy, and assessing its efficacy for major surgical procedures and hemorrhage. A total of 107 subjects with hemophilia, 20 of whom had not been treated previously, enrolled in the investigation. RESULTS. The in vivo recovery and elimination half-lives of recombinant factor VIII equaled or exceeded those of plasma-derived factor VIII. Seventy-six subjects participated in a home-treatment program, using recombinant factor VIII for 69 to 807 days (median, 618); home diaries of 56 subjects treated for 5 months were analyzed. Of 540 bleeding episodes, 399 (73.9 percent) required only one treatment with recombinant factor VIII. The projected annual consumption of recombinant factor VIII was similar to that of plasma-derived factor VIII concentrate. Twenty-six subjects received recombinant factor VIII for 22 surgical procedures and 10 serious hemorrhages; hemostasis was excellent in all cases. De novo formation of inhibitors occurred in only 1 of 85 previously treated subjects. Inhibitor antibodies also developed in 6 of 21 children, 20 of whom had not previously been treated; 5 had low levels (less than or equal to 7.5 Bethesda units) despite continued treatment with recombinant factor VIII. There was no evidence of new formation of antibody to foreign proteins, and recombinant factor VIII was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS. Recombinant factor VIII has biologic activity comparable to that of plasma factor VIII and is safe and efficacious for the treatment of hemophilia A. 
The time course and magnitude of spontaneous recovery of parkinsonism produced by intracarotid administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine to monkeys. We studied rhesus monkeys with hemiparkinsonism or bilateral parkinsonism produced by unilateral or bilateral intracarotid administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Using a standardized clinical rating scale, 4 hemiparkinsonian monkeys showed a 13 to 56% (mean, 36%) spontaneous improvement during an observation period of up to 25 weeks. Generally, recovery leveled off after 14 weeks. Four bilaterally parkinsonian monkeys showed a 5 to 42% (mean, 22%) improvement over a period of up to 30 weeks. Our findings emphasize that spontaneous recovery is a potentially confounding characteristic of this monkey model when used for assessing novel antiparkinsonian therapies. 
The value of MCA, CA 15-3, CEA and CA-125 for discrimination between metastatic breast cancer and adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. MCA, CA 15-3, CEA and CA 125 were determined in the serum of 49 patients with metastatic breast cancer and 38 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. By using the 99th percentile of the normal value distribution as the cut-off point, the positive predictive value (PV+) was found to be 85% (95% CI 76-94) for MCA, and 71% (95% CI 61-81) for CA 15-3. When receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, the PV+ for CA 15-3 was increased to 82% (95% CI 72-92), using 60 U ml-1 as the cut-off point. With the exception of two patients who had a slightly elevated MCA, MCA and CA 15-3 identified the same patients with breast cancer. By combining a positive MCA or CA 15-3 with a negative CEA and CA 125, further improvement of the PV+ could be achieved; 100% (95% CI 91-100). We conclude that MCA and CA 15-3 may play a useful role in discrimination between patients with metastatic breast cancer and those with adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. 
A comparison of the caffeine halothane muscle contracture test with the molecular genetic diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is currently diagnosed by the caffeine-halothane contracture (CHC) test. In a previous study, this test was used to establish linkage between the human gene for MH susceptibility and the ryanodine receptor (RYR) gene. The current study extends the genetic linkage analysis to a large French-Canadian kindred. In this family, genetic linkage between RYR and MH genes was not demonstrable using the currently recommended limits of normal for the CHC test in the identification of MH-susceptible individuals. With CHC test threshold limits below those currently recommended, however, complete linkage between the RYR and MH genes was seen. Comparisons of CHC test results with genetic linkage studies will increase the diagnostic accuracy of both tests as well as generate new insights into the biology of MH. 
Risk factors and the natural history of coronary heart disease in blacks. Contrary to early impressions of blacks' relative immunity to CHD, it is now clear that African Americans experience greater mortality from CHD than whites. The natural history of CHD differs between blacks and whites in three important respects: First, greater prevalence of established risk factors among blacks suggests that they may be at greater risk for heart disease than their white counterparts. Second, health care seeking differences are evident between blacks and whites, leading to lower rates of identification of early disease and slower seeking of services for acute events. However, risk factor differences and health care seeking behaviors do not appear to account for all of the differences in the natural history of heart disease between the ethnic groups, such as survival rate differences during treatment. Economic factors appear to account for only a portion of these differences in risk factors and health care seeking. Beyond differences in risk factors and health care seeking, other, as yet undetermined, factors seem to be involved. These unknown influences could include physiologic, behavioral, and/or psychologic differences. 
Total hip replacement for juvenile chronic arthritis. We review the results of 96 primary total hip replacements in 54 patients with juvenile chronic arthritis at five years or longer after surgery. The mean age at operation was 16.7 years (range 11.25 to 26.6); the follow-up period averaged 11.5 years. The clinical results in terms of pain, range of movement, mobility and function are presented. A revision procedure was required in 24 hips (25%) in 18 patients at an average of 9.5 years after the primary operation. A further 17 hips had radiographic signs of loosening. The factors thought to contribute to this relatively high failure rate in patients with juvenile chronic arthritis are discussed. 
Cough-variant asthma in children and adults: case reports and review. Two cases of cough-variant asthma are presented, one in an adult and one in a child. We discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and course of this common, yet often unrecognized entity. The keys to diagnosis are a typical history, clinical suspicion, and subsequent response to bronchodilator therapy. Treatment of cough-variant asthma is no different from that of classic asthma. 
Intentional and unintentional ureteral surgical treatment in gynecologic procedures. During a period of slightly over nine years, 4,195 extensive gynecologic procedures were performed and 40 patients required ureteral operations, with the ureteral injury unintentional in 16 patients. Extensive complications occurred in seven of 40 patients; in two of three patients in whom the injury was recognized postoperatively, nephrectomy was required. Roentgenographic imaging of the genitourinary tract prior to operation did not prevent injury nor did attempts at identification of the ureter. The majority of ureteral repairs were accomplished by ureteroneocystotomy. In selected patients, placement of percutaneous or indwelling ureteral stent prevented extensive surgical intervention. 
Localization and in vitro actions of atrial natriuretic peptide in the cat carotid body. Previous studies of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) have indicated that its release from the heart and from discrete areas of the central nervous system evokes coordinated physiological and behavioral adjustments that mitigate the adverse hypertensive effects of volume overload and/or acute increases in sodium intake. Because the reflex activity initiated by arterial chemoreceptors of the carotid body directly contributes to the integrated regulation of systemic blood pressure, we have investigated the possibility that ANP has a significant role in the chemosensory process as well. Our immunocytochemical studies show that ANP-like immunoreactivity is present in the preneural chemosensitive type I cells in the cat carotid body. Furthermore we found that the biologically active ANP fragment atriopeptin III is a potent inhibitor of carotid sinus nerve activity evoked by hypoxia. Our findings suggest that circulating and/or endogenous ANP may modulate carotid body function as part of a coordinated response to changes in systemic volume and solute balance. 
An apparent cluster of congenital hypopituitarism in central Massachusetts: magnetic resonance imaging and hormonal studies. Between 1980 and 1989, five infants (four males and one female) with congenital hypopituitarism were born within a relatively sparsely populated area of central Massachusetts, an incidence 25-fold greater than expected. In all infants the pituitary stalk was undetectable on magnetic resonance imaging, and a bright spot on T-1 weighted imaging, probably representing posterior pituitary tissue, was found ectopically located inferior to the median eminence. The height of the anterior pituitary remnant on magnetic resonance imaging varied from undetectable to 4 mm, and similarly, on hormonal testing a spectrum of deficiencies of GH, TSH, ACTH, and gonadotropin was observed. The magnitude of the hypopituitarism was less in the three patients whose anterior pituitary remnant was greater than 2 mm, and in them, TRH testing resulted in exaggerated TSH and PRL responses, suggestive of hypothalamic disease. In contrast, in the other two patients in whom the anterior pituitary remnant was less than 2 mm in height, hypopituitarism was more severe, and TRH administration resulted in little if any TSH or PRL response, characteristic of pituitary disease. The size of the anterior pituitary remnant correlated significantly with that of the ectopic posterior pituitary bright spot (P less than 0.005). We conclude that patients with congenital hypopituitarism may exhibit a spectrum of hormonal responses, varying from findings typical of hypothalamic to those characteristic of primary pituitary disease. The pattern of hormonal responsiveness is dependent on the quantity of residual anterior pituitary tissue and probably results from abnormal transport of the hypothalamic hypophyseal releasing hormones rather than to any putative hypothalamic abnormality. The significant correlation between the size and function of the anterior pituitary gland and the size of the ectopic posterior pituitary remnant suggests that the fetal pituitary gland may secrete a factor necessary for the growth and descent of the neuroepithelium to form the infundibulum and posterior pituitary gland. 
Dyslipidemic effects of cigarette smoking on beta-blocker-induced serum lipid changes in systemic hypertension. To assess the effects of beta blockers on lipids and apolipoproteins in cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, 330 patients with systemic hypertension received 1 month of placebo and 6 months of beta-blocker monotherapy. Serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A1 and B were measured. Total cholesterol increased with propranolol (smokers vs nonsmokers, 8 vs 2%); increased for smokers and decreased for nonsmokers with atenolol (8 vs -3%), metoprolol (6 vs -1%) and pindolol (7 vs -6%); and decreased for both groups with celiprolol (-3 vs -10%). HDL cholesterol decreased with propranolol (smokers vs nonsmokers, -8 vs -18%), atenolol (-7 vs -2%) and metoprolol (-12 vs -1%); increased for smokers and decreased for nonsmokers with pindolol (11 vs -2%); and increased for both groups with celiprolol (5 vs 6%). Similar trends were observed with LDL cholesterol and the total/HDL cholesterol ratio. It is concluded that early noncardioselective beta blockers such as propranolol have significant dyslipidemic effects in both smokers and nonsmokers. Cardioselective drugs such as atenolol and metoprolol, or drugs with partial agonist activity such as pindolol, have variable effects. Celiprolol, a new, highly cardioselective beta 1 blocker with partial beta 2 agonist activity and vasodilatory properties, has favorable effects on lipids and minimizes the dyslipidemic effects associated with smoking. 
A combined approach for purging multidrug-resistant leukemic cell lines in bone marrow using a monoclonal antibody and chemotherapy. Selective removal of malignant cells (purging) from bone marrow (BM) is a concern in autologous BM transplantation (ABMT). Use of vincristine, etoposide, or doxorubicin for purging could be rendered ineffective by the presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells. To circumvent this particular problem, we investigated whether 17F9, a monoclonal IgG2b antibody directed against the cell surface product of the MDR gene, P-glycoprotein, is effective in selective removal of MDR cells from BM when used with rabbit complement (C'). Using two different cell lines we have demonstrated that 17F9 + C' selectively lyses MDR-positive cells. Three rounds of antibody + C' resulted in 96.4% +/- 3.6% kill of K562/DOX and 100% +/- 0% of CEM/VLB cells. Mixtures of malignant cells and normal BM resulted in 99.85% removal of K562/DOX and 99.91% removal of CEM/VLB clonogenic cells. This treatment did not affect normal committed precursors compared with C' alone. The addition of the cytotoxic agent etoposide (VP-16) following antibody purging results in a 4.6 log reduction of malignant cells. Furthermore, this antibody was effective when used against patients' leukemic blasts. These results suggest the use of 17F9 + C' is effective and selective for removal of MDR cells from BM before ABMT and the addition of VP-16 enhances the purging efficacy. 
Mortality among petrochemical science and engineering employees. This is a study of a dynamic cohort of 13 250 commercial research and development personnel for whom information on occupational and educational background and smoking was available. Their age-, sex-, race-, and period-adjusted death rates were compared with New Jersey rates and with an internal comparison population. The overall results were favorable. The study groups had significantly fewer deaths from most major disease categories compared with other New Jersey residents. Among white male scientists and engineers, age-adjusted overall mortality and ischemic heart disease mortality were comparable to white male managers and support staff studied, whereas mortality from leukemia and lymphatic cancer was significantly elevated. Mechanics, however, had a significantly lower leukemia and lymphatic cancer mortality rate than did the comparison group. In a Poisson regression model in which white males and females from the study population were used, and for which the effects of age, smoking, college education category, period of hire, and years employed were controlled, scientists, engineers, and research technicians had elevated (nonsignificantly) mortality rates for leukemia and lymphatic cancer compared with managers and support staff. Smoking was an independent risk factor for leukemia and lymphatic cancer. Further work is needed to assess if specific environmental factors, such as benzene, other aromatics, radiation, medical treatment, and smoking habits, might have contributed to the above findings. 
Nontraumatic surgical emergencies in children. Clinical conditions that require operative intervention are frequent causes of emergency department visits. Common causes such as pyloric stenosis, intussusception, inguinal hernias, torsion of the testicle, and ingested foreign bodies are discussed, and aids in diagnosis and early intervention are addressed. Conditions that mimic surgical problems also are mentioned. 
Post-myocardial infarction mortality in patients with ventricular premature depolarizations. Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Arrhythmia Trial Pilot Study BACKGROUND. Among survivors of acute myocardial infarction, frequent and repetitive ventricular premature depolarizations (VPDs) detected on ambulatory monitoring contribute independently to the risk of all-cause mortality and sudden death. Apart from the beta-blockers, no antiarrhythmic drug has been reliably demonstrated to reduce mortality among patients with VPDs. A pilot study was undertaken to gather data to aid in the design of a multicenter trial of amiodarone for the reduction of mortality from cardiac arrhythmias in such patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. Seventy-seven patients with acute myocardial infarction within the previous 6-30 days and 10 or more VPDs/hr or one or more runs of ventricular tachycardia on 24-hour electrocardiographic recording were randomized in a double-blind fashion in a 2:1 amiodarone-to-placebo ratio. The loading dose was 10 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. The maintenance dose was 300-400 mg/day with reductions at 4-month intervals in response to VPD suppression, excessive plasma levels, or toxicity. VPD suppression at 1 week and 2 weeks was 63% and 85%, respectively, on amiodarone and 17% and 27%, respectively, on placebo. Apart from thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation and skin reactions, no side effects occurred more frequently with amiodarone. The study drug was stopped for side effects or noncompliance in 35% of amiodarone patients and 34% of placebo patients. Patients were followed for a maximum of 2 years (mean, 20 months). Arrhythmic death or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation occurred in two of 48 amiodarone patients (6%) and four of 29 placebo patients (14%), whereas the rates of all-cause mortality were five of 48 (10%) and six of 29 (21%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Amiodarone, in moderate loading and maintenance dosages with adjustments in response to plasma levels, VPD suppression, and side effects, results in effective VPD suppression and acceptable levels of toxicity. 
Prostate-type gland in the epididymis. We confirmed the presence of a prostate-type gland in the epididymis of a 30-year-old white man by immunohistochemical analysis using prostate specific antigen and prostate specific acid phosphatase. We suggest possible histogenetic mechanisms for such previously undescribed morphological heterogeneity within this wolffian duct derivative. 
Proliferation index in various stages of breast cancer determined by Ki-67 immunostaining. To investigate factors involved in progression of breast cancer, we estimated the growth fraction of malignant cell populations in various stages of mammary cancer growth. Frozen sections were immunostained with the Ki-67 monoclonal antibody and the proliferation index determined using static image analysis. Pure intraductal carcinoma, intraductal carcinoma coexisting with invasive disease, and metastatic sites coexisting with primary tumors were studied. The proliferation index of pure intraductal carcinomas (mean 4.5%, median 1.8%) was not significantly different from invasive mammary cancers (mean 5.1%, median 2.2%). The proliferation index determined for the in situ component of primary cancers (mean 3.8%, median 1.5%) was not significantly different from values obtained from the invasive component of growth (mean 4.2%, median 2.1%). Variability between in situ and invasive components for individual cases was minimal in tumors whose proliferation index was less than 3.0%; for tumors with higher proliferation indices, the differences were greater. However, there was no trend toward a decrease or increase in growth fraction for the two components of primary tumor growth. The mean proliferative index for primary tumors (mean 4.9%, median 4.0%) was not significantly different from the mean proliferative score from a matched group of metastatic sites in the same patients (mean 5.7%, median 5.5%). Comparison of individual cases uncovered differences in some tumors; again no consistent trends in either direction were noted. An increase (or decrease) in growth activity does not accompany the transition from intraductal (in situ) disease to invasive mammary cancer, nor does a change in growth fraction necessarily accompany progression of mammary cancer from the primary to regional metastatic site. 
Thymosin treatment of chronic hepatitis B: a placebo-controlled pilot trial Chronic hepatitis B is a severe and frequently progressive disease. We assessed the safety and efficacy of thymosin fraction 5 and thymosin-alpha 1 in a prospective, placebo-controlled trial in 12 patients with chronic hepatitis B. All patients had histological and biochemical evidence of active liver disease for at least 6 mo before treatment and were positive for serum hepatitis B virus DNA and HBsAg. Seven patients received thymosin fraction 5 or thymosin-alpha 1 and five patients received placebo twice weekly for 6 mo. By the conclusion of the study (1 yr), serum aminotransferase levels had improved significantly in thymosin-treated patients, but not in the placebo group. Six (86%) of the thymosin treated patients and one (20%) patient given placebo cleared hepatitis B virus DNA from serum (p less than 0.04, Fisher's exact test). After treatment, replicative forms of hepatitis B virus DNA were present in the liver specimens of four of five placebo-treated patients but in only one of seven thymosin-treated patients (p less than 0.04, Fisher's exact test). Response to thymosin therapy was associated with significant improvements in peripheral blood lymphocyte and CD3 and CD4 counts and in in vitro production of interferon-gamma over initial values. No significant side effects were observed in patients given thymosin or in placebo-treated patients. Clinical, biochemical and serological improvement in patients responding to thymosin were sustained during 26 +/- 3 mo of follow-up. The results of this pilot trial suggest that thymosin therapy promotes disease remission and cessation of hepatitis B virus replication in patients with chronic viral infection. 
Instability of the cervical spine after decompression in patients who have Arnold-Chiari malformation. Stability of the cervical spine was studied in two groups of children who had myelomeningocele. Group I consisted of twenty children who had an Arnold-Chiari Type-II malformation in whom a suboccipital craniectomy (partial occipital craniectomy through the suboccipital route) and cervical laminectomy was done to decompress the brain stem. The average duration of follow-up in this group (excluding one patient) was 4.7 years (range, 2.3 to 10.4 years) after the operation. Group II consisted of twenty children who had myelomeningocele but had not had an operation for decompression. Lateral radiographs of the cervical spine in flexion and extension showed no instability between the occiput and atlas or between the atlas and axis in either group. In contrast, translation between the second and third cervical vertebrae averaged four millimeters in Group I and one millimeter in Group II (p less than 0.01), and angulation between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae averaged 17 degrees in Group I and 6 degrees in Group II (p less than 0.01). Nineteen of the twenty patients in whom a suboccipital craniectomy and cervical laminectomy (Group I) had been done had instability of the cervical spine. 
Abnormal tubular handling of sodium and water induced by atrial natriuretic peptide in essential hypertension. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was given as an intravenous bolus injection (2.0 micrograms kg-1) to 12 essential hypertensive patients (EH) and 13 normotensive control subjects (C) in order to study the effect of ANP on renal glomerular and tubular function using the lithium clearance technique. Urinary sodium excretion (EH, + 370% vs. C, + 120%; P less than 0.001) and urine volume (EH, + 137% vs. C, + 62%; P less than 0.01) increased significantly more in EH than in controls after ANP injection. Glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, aldosterone and arginine vasopressin remained almost unchanged after ANP injection, whereas the filtration fraction increased to the same extent in both groups. Both proximal (EH, - 15% vs. C, - 5%; P less than 0.01) and distal fractional reabsorption (EH, - 12% vs. C, - 5%; P less than 0.01) of sodium decreased more markedly after ANP in EH than in controls. The increase in plasma cGMP and urinary excretion of cGMP was the same in the two groups. Mean blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased to the same extent in both groups. It is concluded that the increase in urinary sodium excretion and urine volume induced by ANP bolus injection is exaggerated in EH due to a more pronounced reduction in the reabsorption of sodium and water in both the proximal and the distal tubule. 
Clinical characteristics of acromegalic patients whose pituitary tumors contain mutant Gs protein. Activating mutations in the gene for the alpha-chain of Gs, the stimulatory regulator of adenylyl cyclase, have been identified in human GH-secreting pituitary tumors. Using the polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, we screened 25 GH-secreting tumors for the presence of the activating mutations. We also reviewed the clinical charts of the patients from whom the tumors were removed. Of 25 tumors, 10 (40%) contained activating mutations. Patients in the mutation-positive group came to surgery with smaller tumors and had lower GH levels. The activating mutations identify a subgroup of GH-secreting pituitary tumors that probably arise from a shared oncogenic mechanism. 
A comparison of the clinical characteristics of first and second primary head and neck cancers. A population-based study. The clinical characteristics of 183 patients with second primary neoplasms in the head and neck region were compared with those of 20,598 patients with one primary tumor in the same region registered during the period 1973 to 1984 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results Program. Second primary head and neck tumors were more likely to be diagnosed in a localized stage (47%) than if diagnosed as a single primary tumor (43%), but this difference was not significant. The tumor grade distribution was comparable in both groups. Using Cox proportional hazards modeling with age, sex, race, and stage as covariates, the median survival of patients with first and second head and neck cancer was identical (50 months). The survival of patients with localized second head and neck cancer was shorter than that of patients with single localized tumors (55 versus 102 months, P less than 0.026). Survival for regional tumors was similar (18 versus 21 months, not significant). The 84 second head and neck cancers in which the first head and neck cancer received radiation therapy (RT) had a median survival of 20 months; the 98 cases without prior RT had a median survival of 35 months. The high incidence of localized second cancers was probably due to the more intense surveillance. The worse survival in this group may be a result of prior RT or biologic characteristics of the tumor. 
Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia associated with T cell receptor delta gene rearrangement. Morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic analyses were carried out on peripheral blood, bone marrow, and pharyngeal biopsy material from a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Morphological analysis of bone marrow was diagnostic of CMML; immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow were negative for B and T cell antigens, and immunochemistry performed on the pharyngeal extramedullary infiltrate showed the presence of large monocytoid cells which stained positively for muramidase. Genotypic analysis, however, showed clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor (TCR) delta chain gene, a marker of T cell or, less commonly, B cell lymphoid neoplasms. Other TCR genes, beta and gamma, were germline in all tissues examined. TCR delta is rearranged in precursor B cell and most T lymphoid neoplasms. A small proportion of cases (10%) of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) also show rearrangement of the TCR delta gene. To date TCR delta rearrangement has not been described in CMML. The aberrant TCR delta rearrangement shown in this patient with CMML provides further evidence of the clonal nature of this disorder. 
Skeletal muscle metabolism and work capacity: a 31P-NMR study of Andean natives and lowlanders. Two metabolic features of altitude-adapted humans are the maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) paradox (higher work rates following acclimatization without increases in VO2max) and the lactate paradox (progressive reductions in muscle and blood lactate with exercise at increasing altitude). To assess underlying mechanisms, we studied six Andean Quechua Indians in La Raya, Peru (4,200 m) and at low altitude (less than 700 m) immediately upon arrival in Canada. The experimental strategy compared whole-body performance tests and single (calf) muscle work capacities in the Andeans with those in groups of sedentary, power-trained, and endurance-trained lowlanders. We used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor noninvasively changes in concentrations of phosphocreatine [( PCr]), [Pi], [ATP], [PCr]/[PCr] + creatine ([Cr]), [Pi]/[PCr] + [Cr], and pH in the gastrocnemius muscle of subjects exercising to fatigue. Our results indicate that the Andeans 1) are phenotypically unique with respect to measures of anaerobic and aerobic work capacity, 2) despite significantly lower anaerobic capacities, are capable of calf muscle work rates equal to those of highly trained power- and endurance-trained athletes, and 3) compared with endurance-trained athletes with significantly higher VO2max values and power-trained athletes with similar VO2max values, display, respectively, similar and reduced perturbation of all parameters related to the phosphorylation potential and to measurements of [Pi], [PCr], [ATP], and muscle pH derivable from nuclear magnetic resonance. Because the lactate paradox may be explained on the basis of tighter ATP demand-supplying coupling, we postulate that a similar mechanism may explain 1) the high calf muscle work capacities in the Andeans relative to measures of whole-body work capacity, 2) the VO2max paradox, and 3) anecdotal reports of exceptional work capacities in indigenous altitude natives. 
Mitogenic response of T-lymphocytes to exercise training and stress. The impact of exercise training and stress on the immune response was examined by measuring the mitogenic response of spleen lymphocytes to the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A (Con-A). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: sedentary controls (n = 11), handled controls (n = 12), treadmill runners (n = 10), and voluntary runners (n = 11) housed in running wheels. The treadmill group ran at 22 m/min (0.8 mph) for 45 min, 5 days/wk for 8 wk. After the training period, spleen lymphocytes isolated from each rat were incubated with Con-A for 54 h, pulsed with radiolabeled thymidine for 18 h, and counted for tritium activity. Counts per minute per group (means +/- SE) were as follows: sedentary, 6,839 +/- 1,461; handled, 8,959 +/- 1,576; voluntary runners, 13,126 +/- 2,069; and treadmill runners, 18,950 +/- 5,975. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's highly significant difference test found the counts per minute of the treadmill runners to be significantly different from the counts per minute of the sedentary animals. These results indicate that the responsiveness of spleen lymphocytes to Con-A increases as the level of stress and exercise increases. 
Autonomic nervous dysfunction in essential hypertension. Borderline hypertension, a condition in which the blood pressure oscillates between normal and high values, is a predictor of future more severe hypertension. Pathophysiologically, borderline hypertension is different from established hypertension. A large proportion of such patients have elevated cardiac output and a normal vascular resistance. In established hypertension, the output is normal and resistance is elevated. The elevation of cardiac output in borderline hypertension is neurogenic; it can be abolished by an autonomic blockade of the heart. In addition to an increased cardiac sympathetic drive, increased sympathetic tone to the kidney, arterioles, and veins has also been found. In parallel with the hypersympathetic state, patients with borderline hypertension also show decreased parasympathetic tone. The enhanced sympathetic tone leads to a decreased cardiac responsiveness, and eventually, the cardiac output returns to the normal range. High blood pressure causes vascular hypertrophy, and hypertrophic vessels are hyperresponsive to vasoconstriction. These secondary changes in the responsiveness of the heart and blood vessels are the basis of transition from a high cardiac output to high-resistance hypertension. These hemodynamic changes are associated with a downregulation of the sympathetic tone. A picture of an apparently nonneurogenic high-resistance hypertension emerges. Nevertheless, when assessed in regard to the enhanced pressor responsiveness, the sympathetic drive in such patients is still excessive. Despite the apparently normal tone, the sympathetic nervous system continues to play an important pathophysiological role in established hypertension. Borderline hypertension is associated with numerous metabolic abnormalities including obesity and insulin resistance. It is tempting to view all these abnormalities as a common expression of the increased sympathetic drive in hypertension. Explanation of the basis of the association of hypertension and metabolic abnormalities promises to bring new insights into the pathophysiology of two common diseases of civilization: hypertension and diabetes mellitus. 
Pitfalls in the diagnosis of drug smuggler's abdomen. Narcotics "body packing" can be detected in abdominal X-rays by the ring shadow caused by air trapped in the packs. In a series of 82 cases admitted for abdominal X-ray in Helsinki, Finland, in 1982 through 1988, we encountered 9 (11.0%) true positives, 3 (3.6%) false positives, and 1 (1.2%) false negative. The false positives were due to the constipation often associated with the narcotics abuse. The false negative X-ray diagnosis was attributable to an inexperienced radiologist. False negatives may also be associated with packets containing marijuana, packs with few wrappings, aluminum-foil coated packs, and machine-packed narcotics. Searching for trapped air in radiographs, repeated X-raying by an experienced radiologist, use of computed tomography, or combined urinary drug screening may be applied to diminish false findings and to avoid unnecessary arrest for the purpose of fecal screening over several days. 
A single amino acid substitution in the variable region of the light chain specifically blocks immunoglobulin secretion. Although immunoglobulin light chains are usually secreted in association with heavy chains, free light chains can be secreted by lymphocytes. To identify the structural features of light chains that are essential for their secretion, we mutated a conserved sequence in the variable domain of a lambda I light chain. The effects of the mutations on secretion were assayed by transient expression in COS-1 cells. One mutant (AV60), which replaced Ala-60 with Val, was secreted as efficiently as wild-type lambda I by transfected COS-1 cells. This result was not surprising because secreted lambda II chains contain valine in this position. However, a second lambda I mutant (AV60FS62), which replaced Phe-62 with Ser as well as Ala-60 with Val, was not secreted. This mutant was arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum, as judged by immunofluorescence and by its association with a lumenal endoplasmic reticulum protein, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP). The defect in secretion was not due to gross misfolding of the lambda I chain, since cells cotransfected with AV60FS62 and an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene produced functional antigen-binding antibodies. These assembled IgM molecules were still not secreted. Hence, the replacement of Phe-62 with Ser specifically affects a determinant on the lambda I light chain that is necessary for the intracellular transport of this molecule. 
End-systolic regional wall stress-length and stress-shortening relations in an experimental model of normal, ischemic and reperfused myocardium. Assessment of left ventricular function is influenced by a number of hemodynamic factors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the end-systolic regional wall stress-dimension relation in a series of 25 mongrel dogs. In Group A (n = 18) the regional wall stress-velocity of circumferential fiber shortening relation was measured before and after three interventions: volume infusion, metoprolol infusion and dobutamine infusion. The electrocardiogram, left ventricular pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), arterial pressure and echocardiograms were recorded at baseline and after phenylephrine administration (to increase afterload). For each dog values for regional wall stress were plotted against the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening. For all dogs the relations were inversely linear (r = -0.65 to -0.98). Volume infusion increased end-diastolic volume (p less than 0.05) without shifting the slope or intercept of the relation, indicating its independence from preload. Dobutamine caused a shift in the intercept to the right but no change in slope and metoprolol shifted the relation to the left without altering the slope. The effect of ischemia and reperfusion on the end-systolic regional wall stress-length relation was examined in Group B (n = 7), at baseline, after 5 min of mid-left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and after 10 min of reperfusion. Afterload was increased by hydraulic aortic occlusion. Regional wall stress was lowest at baseline, highest during ischemia and intermediate after reperfusion (100.2 +/- 32.1, 193.5 +/- 81.5, 141.9 +/- 67.6 kdyn/cm2, respectively, p less than 0.001). The end-systolic regional wall stress-length relation was linear during baseline, ischemia and reperfusion (r = 0.96, 0.95, 0.98, respectively, p less than 0.05). Ischemia caused an increase in the slope and a shift in the intercept to the right compared with baseline. Reperfusion represented an incomplete return toward baseline. This study demonstrates that the regional wall stress-velocity of circumferential fiber shortening relation is linear, independent of preload, incorporates afterload and is sensitive to changes in contractility. In addition, the regional wall stress-length relation can be measured in a nonhomogeneously contracting left ventricle and is predictably altered by ischemia and reperfusion. This relation may prove useful to determine whether alterations in regional systolic function result from changes in local load or contractility in the left ventricle with a regional wall motion abnormality. 
Identification of transforming genes of subgroup A and C strains of Herpesvirus saimiri. Herpesvirus saimiri is an oncogenic herpesvirus that induces rapidly progressing lymphomas in New World primates. Using retrovirus vectors for gene transfer, specific open reading frames of H. saimiri were tested for their ability to transform rodent cells in culture. One open reading frame, designated STP-C488 (for saimiri-transformation-associated protein of the subgroup C strain 488), phenotypically transformed Rat-1 cells, resulting in formation of foci, growth at reduced serum concentration, and growth to higher cell densities. Cells transformed by STP-C488 formed invasive tumors in nude mice. The STP-A11 reading frame of strain 11 (subgroup A) was much less potent in its transforming ability than STP-C488. These results demonstrate the oncogene nature of these two open reading frames and provide a means for studying their transforming functions independent of the rest of the H. saimiri genome. 
Arthrodesis with dual plates after failed total knee arthroplasty. Eleven patients were treated by arthrodesis with dual compression plates after failed total knee arthroplasty. All patients had a solid fusion, at an average of 5.6 months after the operation. The complications included one femoral stress fracture and one persistent infection, both of which were treated successfully. Fixation with dual compression plates is a useful technique for the salvage of a failed total knee arthroplasty, even when the patient has an infection. Staggering of the plates may help to prevent late stress fractures. 
Alterations in erythrocyte rheology in patients with severe peripheral vascular disease: 1. Cell volume dependence of erythrocyte rigidity. The erythrocyte rigidity of patients suffering from severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) was measured by a filtration method using 3 microns pore size filters. Filtration pressures for both PVD patients and normal subjects showed a cell volume dependency, and patient filtration pressures were normalized to cell volume to evaluate intrinsic, ie, nonvolume dependent, abnormalities in erythrocyte deformability. A significant (p less than 0.001) increase in cell rigidity was found in 44 of 54 PVD patients in comparison with volume-matched normal controls. No significant difference was found between patient mean corpusculer hemoglobin (MCH) and normal MCH at any given mean corpuscular volume (MCV), indicating that observed increases in erythrocyte rigidity are not attributable to changes in patient MCH. Therefore, the mechanism of increase in erythrocyte rigidity for PVD patients still needs further investigation into such parameters as levels of adenosine triphosphate,2,3-DPG, and membrane fluidity (calcium- and/or protein-binding membrane, cholesterol and phospholipid content of membrane, etc), as well as other aspects of erythrocyte physiology. 
Cerebrovascular malformation causing sudden death. Analysis of three cases and review of the literature. Three unusual cases of sudden death resulting from cerebrovascular malformation (CVM) are presented. CVMs are highly variable in location and morphology, and may be difficult to detect. Two of the patients discussed here had CVMs that involved the circle of Willis directly, and produced rapidly fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage at the base of the brain; both of these subjects were in their late 30s. One had a history of epilepsy; the other had been completely asymptomatic prior to the catastrophic event. The third was an asymptomatic 6 year old with a cerebellar CVM, who survived long enough for inconclusive neurosurgical intervention. In all three cases, the diagnosis was not made prior to autopsy; in one case, the circumstances of death were initially misleading. The relevant literature is reviewed and discussed, with emphasis on differential diagnosis, anatomic examination, and background investigation. 
Sulfonylureas, ATP-sensitive K+ channels, and cellular K+ loss during hypoxia, ischemia, and metabolic inhibition in mammalian ventricle. Sulfonylurea derivatives glibenclamide and tolbutamide are selective blockers of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. However, their ability to prevent cellular K+ loss and shortening of action potential duration during ischemia or hypoxia in the intact heart is modest compared with their efficacy at blocking KATP channels in excised membrane patches. In the isolated arterially perfused rabbit interventricular septum, the increase in unidirectional K+ efflux and shortening of action potential duration during substrate-free hypoxia were effectively blocked by glibenclamide, but only by very high concentrations (100 microM); during hypoxia with glucose present, glibenclamide was only partially effective at reducing K+ loss. During total global ischemia (10 minutes), up to 100 microM glibenclamide or 1 mM tolbutamide attenuated shortening of action potential duration but only reduced [K+]0 accumulation by a maximum of 32 +/- 6%. In isolated patch-clamped guinea pig ventricular myocytes in which the whole-cell ATP-sensitive K+ current was activated by exposure to the metabolic inhibitors, glibenclamide (up to 100 microM) and tolbutamide (10 mM) were only partially effective at blocking the whole-cell ATP-sensitive K+ current (maximum block, 51 +/- 10% and 50 +/- 9%, respectively), especially when ADP was included in the patch electrode solution. In inside-out membrane patches excised from these myocytes, glibenclamide blocked unitary currents through KATP channels with a Kd of 0.5 microM and a Hill coefficient of 0.5 in the absence of ADP at the cytosolic membrane surface, but block was incomplete when 100 microM ADP (+2 mM free Mg2+) was present. ADP had a similar effect on block of KATP channels by tolbutamide. These findings suggest that free cytosolic [ADP], which rises rapidly to the 100 microM range during early myocardial ischemia and hypoxia, may account for the limited efficacy of sulfonylureas at blocking ischemic and hypoxic cellular K+ loss under these conditions. 
US-guided venipuncture for venography in the edematous leg. A technique for sonographic-guided venipuncture was developed especially for venography made difficult by gross leg edema. Five patients were evaluated in whom venography had been attempted but was initially unsuccessful because of difficult venous access. All five underwent successful venipuncture after sonographic localization of a vein. Ultrasound-guided venipuncture is simple and useful when venous access by palpation is difficult. 
Stromal osseous metaplasia in carcinoma of the bladder. Osseous metaplasia of the stroma of carcinomas of the bladder is a rare finding that must be distinguished from osteosarcoma and carcinosarcoma. We report a case of multifocal osseous metaplasia in a high grade urothelial carcinoma with extensive glandular differentiation, arising in the base of the bladder of an 84-year-old man. Reports of 11 other cases of stromal osseous metaplasia in primary bladder carcinomas and of 5 cases of stromal osseous metaplasia in metastases of bladder carcinoma are reviewed. 
Effect of colloidal bismuth subcitrate on age related gastric lesions in the rat. The purpose of this study was to determine the changes in rat gastric functional morphology that take place with age and to study the action of colloidal bismuth subcitrate on the age related degeneration of the stomach. At 95 weeks of age erosions were apparent over 80% of the gastric mucosa and this was associated with a significant decline in the numbers and mucus content of the mucosal epithelial cells. The rate of stem cell proliferation in the neck region was also significantly lower than that found in 9 week old animals. The administration of 50 mg/kg colloidal bismuth subcitrate for 14 days to 9 week old animals resulted in slight hypertrophy of the mucosal epithelial cells. When 95 week animals were placed on the same regimen there was a decline in the number of deep erosions in the mucosa and an increase in the number and mucin content of the mucosal epithelial cells. A significant increase in the proliferation of the stem cell population was also observed after colloidal bismuth subcitrate administration. It is suggested that colloidal bismuth subcitrate may ameliorate the increased susceptibility to harmful agents that occurs with age. 
Hemopericardium: a late complication after repair of pectus excavatum. Hemopericardium and tamponade occurred in a 12 year old boy with Marfan's syndrome, two years after surgical repair of pectus excavatum. This life-threatening complication resulted from penetration of a fractured metal plate through the pericardium into the right atrium. The clinical details are reported and discussed. 
Sequential appearance of IL-1 and IL-6 activities in rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy. IL-1 and IL-6 activities were measured in the pleural exudate of rats during carrageenin-induced pleurisy to examine the relationship of the local production of cytokines to the inflammatory reaction. Time courses of appearance of the cytokines and inflammatory parameters in the exudate were compared. IL-1 activity and exudate volume started to increase at 1 h after the carrageenin injection, and then slightly later IL-6 activity and leukocyte number began to increase. IL-1 showed peak activity of approximately 700 U at 3 h and IL-6, of 6000 U at 5 h in the exudate, whereas exudate volume and number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes continued to increase thereafter. Furthermore, IL-6 level in the plasma of the carrageenin-injected rats showed a peak at 4 h (30 U/ml), and when rhIL-1 alpha (100,000 U) was intrapleurally injected, the more rapid increase in plasma IL-6 level was demonstrated at 1 h (30 U/ml). This latter rise was neutralized with simultaneous injection of anti-rhIL-1 alpha antibody. These facts indicate the possibility that IL-1 produced in the exudate or injected could rapidly propagate a signal to induce IL-6 production in the circulation. It took several hours to transmit an inflammatory signal that stimulated the liver to synthesize the acute-phase protein, T-kininogen. The time lag from the peak induction of IL-1 to the T-kininogen-increase in the pleurisy corresponded well to the interval for T-kininogen-increase by exogenous rhIL-1 alpha injection. These results strongly suggest that the initial inflammatory stimulus induces sequentially IL-1, IL-6, and T-kininogen production in this carrageenin inflammation. 
Cytoreductive surgery in disseminated non-seminomatous germ cell tumours of testis. Between 1977 and 1988, 67 patients underwent surgical removal of residual metastatic deposits following an aggressive chemotherapy regimen (cisplatin, vincristine, methotrexate and bleomycin alternating with etoposide, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide) for disseminated germ cell tumours of the testis (stage IIB or above). Ninety-one surgical procedures were performed. There were 63 (69 per cent) retroperitoneal lymph node dissections, 16 (18 per cent) thoracotomies, three (3 per cent) hepatic resections, three (3 per cent) craniotomies, five (5 per cent) delayed orchidectomies and one anterolateral decompression of the vertebral column. Nine (13 per cent) patients required a repeat retroperitoneal node dissection and one patient needed a repeat thoracotomy to remove recurrent metastatic deposits during the period of follow-up. Multivisceral resections and vascular reconstruction procedures were required in 20 (30 per cent) patients undergoing retroperitoneal node dissection. Fifty-five (82 per cent) patients remain in complete remission with a mean follow-up period of 49.6 months (range 2-121 months). Nine (13 per cent) patients died with metastatic disease between 2 months to 4 years after operation. There were three deaths in the perioperative period (4 per cent). The histology of the resected metastases revealed undifferentiated active tumour in 20 (30 per cent) patients, differentiated mature teratoma in 29 (43 per cent) patients and fibrosis/necrosis in 18 (27 per cent) patients. Twelve (60 per cent) patients with undifferentiated elements and 15 patients (60 per cent) with raised preoperative tumour markers (poor prognostic categories) are in complete remission. Cytoreductive surgery in patients with metastatic germ cell tumours offers the best chance of remission following chemotherapy even in poor prognostic group categories. 
Role of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in intraabdominal abscess formation in the rat. Our concept of the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis and advanced pelvic infection, such as tuboovarian abscess, is evolving. Although Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are thought to play a significant role in acute pelvic inflammatory disease, other microorganisms, such as aerobes and anaerobes, have repeatedly been reported to play a significant role, also, particularly in the patient with advanced disease. A study was designed to evaluate the pathogenesis, and particularly any synergistic role, of some aerobes and anaerobes with N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis abscess formation. Using the rat model developed by Weinstein and Onderdonk, the study demonstrated that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis alone do not produce abscesses. However, when combined with facultative or anaerobic bacteria, synergism with abscess formation is noted frequently. The data support the hypothesis that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis initiate infection and that aerobic and anaerobic bacteria act synergistically to produce abscesses. In addition, microorganisms not inoculated were found to be recruited into the infectious process. The organisms may gain access to the peritoneal cavity via the lower genital tract or from transmucosal migration from the intestinal flora. 
Hearing improvement after acoustic tumor removal. Hearing improvement after removal of an acoustic tumor is an uncommon occurrence. Hearing improvement was observed in 8.5% of acoustic tumor removals performed using the middle fossa approach in an attempt to preserve hearing. Improvement in speech discrimination occurred most frequently and was of greatest magnitude compared with changes in the speech reception threshold or pure-tone average. No preoperative factors were predictive of postoperative hearing improvement. Findings support the conclusion that candidates for hearing preservation surgery should be chosen on the merits of their existing preoperative hearing and not on the basis of anticipated improvement. 
Cocaine-related symptoms in patients presenting to an urban emergency department. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Cocaine abuse is a serious social problem that precipitates a significant number of emergency hospital encounters. To determine the nature of cocaine-related symptoms, we studied patients with cocaine use presenting to all adult services of an urban emergency department. DESIGN: Review of consecutive cases, with analysis of clinical features. SETTING: All adult EDs of an urban teaching hospital. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Patients acknowledging recent use of cocaine (within 72 hours) and/or with cocaine detected on a toxicologic screen. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Psychiatric complaints accounted for 44 (30.6%) presentations, followed by neurologic (17.4%), cardiopulmonary (16%), trauma (11.8%), and addiction-related (11.1%) symptoms. Cardiopulmonary symptoms were more frequently associated with intranasal than with IV or smoked cocaine (P = .003). Suicidal intent was the most common psychiatric reason for presentation, occurring in 24 patients (16.6%). Seventeen presented with trauma, including three involved in motor vehicle accidents. CONCLUSION: Cardiopulmonary symptoms such as chest pain and palpitations may be significantly more frequent in patients who use intranasal cocaine; suicidal intent is common among patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms related to cocaine; and the range of cocaine-related symptoms is varied, including not only psychiatric and cardiopulmonary symptoms but also trauma. 
Hurthle cell hyperplasia and sarcoidosis of the thyroid. We report of a case of Hurthle cell hyperplasia of the thyroid that was correctly identified preoperatively by fine-needle aspiration cytology but was unexpectedly associated with sarcoid granulomas. To our knowledge, the association has not been previously reported. The rarely described thyroid involvement by sarcoidosis is briefly reviewed. 
Clinical correlates of abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension. Sixty-five patients with esophageal complaints were studied to determine clinical associations with abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension (esophageal sensory dysfunction). Associations were examined in four categories: motility, esophageal symptoms, recent psychological symptoms, and general clinical features. A positive response to balloon distension (pain with less than or equal to 8 ml volume) was found in 29 (45%) of the subjects. This response was associated with specific findings in each category except recent psychological symptoms. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that an increased frequency of multipeaked waves on motility testing, presence of dysphagia, and shorter height of the subject each had an independent association with positive response to balloon distension (P less than or equal to 0.05 for each). Further comparison of subjects with sensory dysfunction, motor dysfunction, or both (sensorimotor dysfunction) indicated that subjects with the combined disorder appeared more symptomatic than those with either finding alone. These observations indicate that: (1) esophageal motor and sensory dysfunction are partially associated, but both contribute to the symptomatic state; (2) dysphagia may be representative of sensory dysfunction in some cases; and (3) subject height should be taken into consideration when interpreting balloon distension results. 
Management of the pregnant woman with spinal cord injuries. This paper forms part of an ongoing prospective study of pregnancy and labour in women with spinal cord injuries and combines a prospective and retrospective analysis of 17 pregnancies in 15 women with spinal injuries. The management and outcome in those 17 pregnancies is reviewed. 
Nutritional therapy for infants with diarrhea. The appropriate choice of treatment for infants with diarrhea has long provoked debate. Growth of infants with diarrhea is adversely affected by associated diseases including anorexia, malabsorption, catabolic response to infection, and iatrogenic starvation. To prevent the negative effects of diarrhea on the nutrition of infants, continued feeding during the active and early convalescent phases has been recommended. Although this concept is not new, until recently it has been little used in the treatment of diarrhea. In this article we examine the current knowledge about, and trends in, feeding infants with diarrhea. We will discuss treatments for the well-nourished infant with acute diarrhea, the infant with prolonged diarrhea, and the malnourished infant. Information regarding the use of local staples will also be provided. 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled cytogenetic study of oral acyclovir in patients with recurrent genital herpes. The antiherpes drug acyclovir breaks chromosomes in vitro at millimolar concentrations and at highly toxic doses in rodents but does not induce single-gene mutations. Recurrent genital herpes patients were examined to determine if such chromosomal damage occurs in peripheral lymphocytes during acute or chronic acyclovir therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive acyclovir suppressively and for recurrences, placebo suppressively and acyclovir for recurrences, or placebo suppressively and for recurrences (n greater than or equal to 20 for each group; all treatment double-blind). Normal volunteers and acyclovir-treated cultures served as additional controls. Cytogenetic analyses were done at enrollment (pretreatment), on day 5 of acute acyclovir or placebo treatment for the first postenrollment recurrence (postacute), and at the end of a year on study (postchronic). Cells in metaphase, 150 for each patient, were examined at each time point for structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities. No cytogenetic effects of chronic or acute oral acyclovir treatment were found relative to lifestyle controls, pretreatment controls, or placebo treatment. 
Lysis of autologous melanoma cells by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes: association with clinical response. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can be grown in vitro in medium containing interleukin-2 (IL-2). In clinical trials at the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute, patients with metastatic malignant melanomas were treated with IL-2 plus the adoptive transfer of autologous TILs. At the time of treatment, TILs were assayed for in vitro lysis of fresh autologous and allogeneic melanoma cells and Daudi cells. Patients were evaluated for clinical response 4-8 weeks later. Lysis of autologous tumor cells by TILs was significantly higher for responding than for nonresponding patients. Tumor cells from responding and nonresponding patients were equally sensitive to lysis by allogeneic lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. There was no difference between TILs from responding and nonresponding patients for lysis of LAK-sensitive Daudi cells, which was low in most cases and demonstrated that TIL lysis of autologous tumor cells was not due to LAK cells. The observed association of autologous tumor cell lysis by TILs with clinical response suggests that the development of culture methods to optimize lysis of autologous tumors may lead to increased response rates using this TIL treatment regimen. 
Gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging of the musculoskeletal system. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine has been used in the evaluation of musculoskeletal disorders only in recent years, and for the most part it is still under investigation. Review of the literature identified potential uses for this technique: (1) in the spine, for differentiation between scar tissue and recurrent disk herniation and for evaluation of epidural tumors; (2) in musculoskeletal tumors, for differentiation between tumor necrosis and peritumoral edema and for characterization and evaluation of tumors before and after treatment; (3) in the joints for delineation of cartilage and tendon tears, with intraarticular injection, and for differentiation between pannus and joint effusion, with IV injection; and (4) for delineation of infectious processes. Further studies are needed to confirm most of these potential indications. It is unlikely that gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging will become a routine part of musculoskeletal MR imaging, and its use will be reserved for specific circumstances. 
Granular cell tumor of the eyelid. We present a case of granular cell tumor of the eyelid. Although commonly reported elsewhere in the body, this entity rarely occurs in the ocular adnexa. 
Major role for arterial disease in morbidity and mortality after kidney transplantation in diabetic recipients. OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical characteristics of diabetic end-stage renal disease patients that place individual transplant candidates at high risk for arterial morbidity and mortality after transplantation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the course of 101 sequential renal allograft recipients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, transplanted between 10 November 1980 and 1 April 1986. Arterial disorders were tabulated from medical records and interviews with individual patients, their families, and their private physicians. Documentation of discrete arterial events included recorded physical examinations, radiographic studies, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, peripheral vascular flow studies, and operative reports. The prevalence of preoperative arterial disease was compared with the occurrence of new arterial events after kidney transplantation. RESULTS: Within a mean follow-up period of 47 mo, a 30% absolute mortality rate was observed. Of these deaths, 57% resulted from arterial disorders. Clinical manifestations of arterial disease were recognized in 41% of recipients before transplantation, and 78% of these patients suffered new vascular events after transplantation. Of the entire sample, 57% developed at least one new complication of arterial disease after transplantation, whereas only 34% had no vascular diagnosis before or after transplantation. Cerebral, coronary, and peripheral arterial complications after transplantation occurred in 14, 28, and 36% of the patients, respectively. The corresponding incidences of stroke, myocardial infarction, and amputation were 12, 14, and 25%. Pretransplant coronary artery disease predisposed to new coronary events after transplantation, but only peripheral arterial complications occurred more often after transplantation compared with the preoperative period. The probability of arterial complications or death correlated with patient age at first transplant and duration of diabetes but not with sex or smoking history. CONCLUSIONS: Intrinsic arterial disease in diabetic renal allograft recipients contributes heavily to the long-term morbidity and mortality after transplantation and poses the major threat to survival. Diabetic transplant candidates greater than 35 yr of age or with clinical evidence of arterial disease should undergo an extensive vascular assessment, including stress thallium myocardial imaging and/or coronary arteriography. Such recipients should receive careful preoperative counseling about their excess risk for subsequent arterial disorders. 
Epidural analgesia in Eaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome. Effects on respiratory function. The anaesthetic management of a patient with Eaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome undergoing thoracotomy is described. Epidural anaesthesia, in combination with a light level of general anaesthesia, provided good operating conditions and postoperative analgesia. Pulmonary function and ventilatory responses to carbon dioxide and hypoxia were measured before operation. These tests were repeated after the epidural administration of 8 ml 2% lignocaine before surgery and after 2 mg morphine sulphate in 10 ml saline postoperatively. Minor reductions in some of the ventilatory parameters were observed. The epidural technique appears to be a useful and safe method by which to manage patients with Eaton-Lambert syndrome undergoing thoracotomy. 
1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors and human colon adenocarcinoma. Epidemiological evidence suggests that dietary calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) might have a protective effect against colorectal cancers. Since the presence of receptors is required for steroid action, specific 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors (RD3) were investigated in biopsies taken at different levels of the colon. The study involved 90 biopsies from patients operated on for colorectal adenocarcinoma. They were paired biopsies from adenocarcinoma tissue and adjacent normal mucosa. In addition, 26 normal intestinal mucosa biopsies from patients without cancer were examined. RD3 receptors were assayed in tissue extract by the dextran-coated charcoal technique and also characterized by sucrose density gradient sedimentation. Scatchard analysis showed a single class of specific high affinity-low capacity sites binding for 1,25-(OH)2D3. The incidence of RD3 was 86 per cent in normal mucosa (n = 77) and lower in carcinoma (n = 34), for which the incidence decreased significantly (P less than 0.001) from right colon (58 per cent) to left colon (37 per cent) and rectum (19 per cent). These data suggest that the normal colon is a potential target organ for 1,25-(OH)2D3 which might modulate calcium transport in the colon. Loss of receptivity to 1,25-(OH)2D3 is associated with malignant transformation. 
Complications of the Heitz-Boyer urinary diversion: case report of late development of malignancy. We report on 3 patients with bladder exstrophy followed for more than 15 years after having undergone Heitz-Boyer urinary diversion. One patient had adenocarcinoma at the ureterocolonic anastomoses 16 years after diversion. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a malignancy developing after a Heitz-Boyer procedure. The other 2 patients had significant problems with urinary incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infections. Initial success with this form of urinary diversion can be followed by significant long-term complications. 
Abnormalities of the breast caused by biopsy: spectrum of mammographic findings. It is important for radiologists to be familiar with the spectrum of mammographic abnormalities caused by postbiopsy changes in the breast. Although many breast biopsies leave no residual abnormality, occasionally an atypical manifestation of a biopsy scar may produce a radiologic finding suspicious enough to mandate a biopsy. Problem-solving maneuvers recommended to increase confidence that a change is related to a recent biopsy include (1) skin markers; (2) comparison with preoperative films; (3) correlation with physical examination; (4) tailored mammographic views, including focal spot compression, magnification, and tangential views; and (5) postoperative and follow-up mammograms. 
Intracisternal recombinant tissue plasminogen activator after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fifteen patients undergoing surgery within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture were administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) directly into the basal subarachnoid cisterns after minimal surgical clot removal and aneurysm clipping. Preoperatively, 13 patients had diffuse or localized thick subarachnoid blood clots on computerized tomography (CT), and two had diffuse thin clots. The rt-PA was given as a single intraoperative injection of 7.5 mg (one patient), 10 mg (nine patients), or 15 mg (five patients). Postoperative cisternal drainage was employed in three patients. All patients except one demonstrated partial to complete cisternal clot clearance on CT scans within 24 hours after surgery. The patient who showed no clot reduction was the only patient in this series to develop symptomatic vasospasm and was the only fatality, dying 8 days after rupture. No vasospasm was seen on follow-up cerebral angiography in six of the 14 responding patients, and mild-to-moderate arterial narrowing was seen in at least one major cerebral artery in the remaining eight patients. Severe angiographic vasospasm was not seen, although the patient who died did not undergo repeat angiography. There was one major complication early in the series which seemed clearly related to treatment, and that was a large extradural hematoma occurring within several hours of craniotomy. Intrathecal fibrinolytic treatment appears effective in clearing subarachnoid clot and reducing vasospasm, and may be associated with acceptable risks if given to patients with large-volume subarachnoid hemorrhages at high risk for severe vasospasm. 
Nerve palsy associated with total hip replacement. Risk factors and prognosis. We reviewed the results of 3126 consecutive total hip replacements and identified postoperative neuropathy in the ipsilateral lower extremity after fifty-three (1.7 per cent) over-all and after 1.3 per cent of the primary arthroplasties. The prevalence was 5.2 per cent after the primary arthroplasties that had been done for congenital dislocation or dysplasia of the hip and 3.2 per cent after the revisions (all diagnoses). Thus, these two types of operations were risk factors (p less than 0.01). Limb-lengthening only partially accounted for the increased prevalence of neuropathy after these procedures. The sciatic nerve was involved in all but five extremities. The cause of the palsy was unclear or unknown in thirty (57 per cent) of the extremities. When the patients were last seen, at a minimum of one year and a maximum of sixteen and one-half years after the operation, seven extremities were normal neurologically, thirty-three had a mild neurological deficit, and thirteen had a major deficit. All patients who had complete recovery of neurological function had it by twenty-one months. Of thirty-six extremities that were evaluated at a minimum of twenty-four months after the operation, seven were neurologically normal, twenty-three had a mild persistent deficit, and six had a major persistent deficit. The ability to walk decreased for all patients who had a nerve palsy. The greatest disability was in the patients who had been forty-eight years old or less and had had a primary total hip replacement (p = 0.037). The prognosis for neurological recovery was related to the degree to which the nerve was damaged. 
Trisomy 21: association between reduced recombination and nondisjunction. To assess the association between recombination and nondisjunction of chromosome 21, we analyzed cytogenetic and DNA markers in 104 trisomy 21 individuals and their parents. Our DNA marker studies of parental origin were informative in 100 cases, with the overwhelming majority (94) being maternal in origin. This value is significantly higher than the 75%-80% maternal nondisjunction rate typically observed in cytogenetic studies of trisomy 21 and illustrates the increased accuracy of the molecular approach. Using the maternally derived cases and probing at 19 polymorphic sites on chromosome 21, we created a genetic map that spans most of the long arm of chromosome 21. The map was significantly shorter than the normal female linkage map, indicating that absence of pairing and/or recombination contributes to nondisjunction in a substantial proportion of cases of trisomy 21. 
Detection of inadvertent respiratory placement of small-bore feeding tubes: a report of 10 cases. Documented inadvertent respiratory placement of small-bore feeding tubes was identified in 10 patients over a 2-year period in five intensive care units and two general wards. Types and effectiveness of bedside methods used by clinicians to test tube position were described. The most frequently used methods were observation for respiratory distress and auscultation of the abdomen during air insufflations through the tubes. It was concluded that commonly used bedside methods to test feeding tube placement often gave false reassurance that the tubes were properly positioned. 
Differences in beta-adrenergic neuroeffector mechanisms in ischemic versus idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND. We measured the content and activities of components of the beta-adrenergic receptor-G protein-adenylate cyclase complex and adrenergic neurotransmitter levels in left and right ventricular myocardial preparations derived from 77 end-stage failing human hearts from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) or ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ISCDC). METHODS AND RESULTS. The results were compared with data obtained in 21 nonfailing hearts removed from organ donors. Compared with ISCDC ventricles, IDC left and right ventricles exhibited a greater degree of total beta- or beta 1-receptor downregulation. In contrast, compared with IDC right ventricles, isolated tissue preparations of ISCDC right ventricles exhibited a greater degree of subsensitivity to the inotropic effect of isoproterenol, indicating a relatively greater degree of functional uncoupling of right ventricular ISCDC beta-receptors from mechanical response. In addition, relative to IDC left ventricles, preparations of ISCDC left ventricle exhibited greater subsensitivity to beta-agonist-mediated adenylate cyclase stimulation, indicating functional uncoupling of left ventricular ISCDC beta-receptors from cyclic AMP generation. The uncoupling of beta-receptors in ISCDC left and right ventricles may have been a result of abnormalities in G protein activation of adenylate cyclase; compared with age- and cardiac function-matched respective left or right IDC ventricles, ISCDC left ventricles exhibited less stimulation of adenylate cyclase by NaF or forskolin but no change in Mn2+ stimulation, whereas ISCDC right ventricles exhibited less stimulation by the nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide Gpp (NH)p. Also, IDC right ventricles exhibited a "selective" (not present in IDC left ventricles or ISCDC ventricles) decrease in stimulation of adenylate cyclase by Mn2+. Tissue neurotransmitter levels and pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation were altered to similar extents in IDC and ISCDC. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that potentially important differences exist in the regulatory behavior of components of the beta-adrenergic receptor-G protein-adenylate cyclase complex in IDC versus ISCDC, differences that presumably relate to the distinct pathophysiologies of these two types of heart muscle disease. 
Home use of rectal diazepam for cluster and prolonged seizures: efficacy, adverse reactions, quality of life, and cost analysis. From 1982 through 1987, 128 families, who were instructed in the use of rectally administered diazepam (R-DZP) for the treatment of severe epileptic seizures, were surveyed. Sixty-seven families returned questionnaires and met inclusion/exclusion criteria; the results were used to analyze the medical, psychosocial, and economic impact of this program during the first year following instruction. Twenty-six families did not use R-DZP, primarily because of patient improvement. Among families using R-DZP, a total of 428 doses were administered to 41 children. R-DZP was effective in controlling seizures in 85% of patients. Adverse reactions usually were mild, consisting of drowsiness and/or behavioral changes. Compared to the year prior to instruction, emergency room visits decreased in both R-DZP-treated and -nontreated children; however, cost-savings were greater for the R-DZP group ($1,039.00 vs $420.00 per patient per year). Improvements in quality of life associated with the availability of R-DZP were observed by 58% of users and 27% of nonusers which included improved management of their children's seizures, increased flexibility in family activities, and greater peace of mind. R-DZP appears to be a practical method in the effective treatment of severe seizures at home. 
Central role of sodium in hypertension in diabetic subjects. The common association between diabetes mellitus and hypertension may be promoted by several mechanisms. Patients with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes and prone to develop nephropathy often have a familial predisposition for essential hypertension, whereas normotensive healthy offspring of nondiabetic essential hypertensive parents tend to have a reduced insulin sensitivity and increased plasma insulin levels. Na+ retention occurs as a characteristic alteration in type I or non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes; exchangeable body Na+ (Naex) is increased by 10% on average. This abnormality develops in the uncomplicated stage of diabetes and differentiates diabetic from nondiabetic essential hypertensive subjects. Possible Na(+)- retaining mechanisms include increased glomerular filtration of glucose leading to enhanced proximal tubular Na(+)-glucose cotransport, hyperinsulinemia (which activates several tubular Na+ transporters), an extravascular shift of fluid with Na+, and, once it occurs, renal failure. The pathogenetic role of Na+ retention in diabetes-associated hypertension is supported by positive correlations between systolic or mean blood pressure and Naex and by normalization of blood pressure after removal of excess Na+ by diuretic treatment in hypertensive diabetic subjects. The latter may also have an enhanced sensitivity of blood pressure to Na+. Plasma levels of active renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and catecholamines are usually normal or low in metabolically stable type I or type II diabetes. However, an exaggerated vascular reactivity to norepinephrine and angiotensin II commonly occurs already at uncomplicated stages of type I or type II diabetes. This may be a manifestation of functional (i.e., intracellular electrolytes) and/or morphological (proliferation, narrowing, and stiffening) vasculopathy. Diabetes-associated Na+ retention, vasculopathy, and a presumably inherited predisposition for both diabetes and essential hypertension may represent important complementary factors favoring the frequent occurrence of hypertension in the diabetic population. 
Detection of malignant bone tumors: MR imaging vs scintigraphy. One hundred six patients with a known or suspected diagnosis of bone cancer (11 patients with biopsy-proved primary tumors, 95 patients with metastatic disease) were evaluated with scintigraphy and MR imaging to determine the relative sensitivity of each technique in the detection of bone disease. MR imaging was performed at 0.5 T as part of the entry evaluation into Intramural Research Board protocols (30%), for evaluation of cord compression, or because of an equivocal scintigram. MR was performed with T1-weighted (e.g., 300-500/10-20 [TR/TE]), T2-weighted (e.g., 2000/80) spin-echo (SE), and a short-TI inversion recovery (STIR) pulse sequence. Scintigrams were performed with 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate. A retrospective analysis showed that in 30 (28%) of 106 patients, MR imaging performed over a limited region of interest revealed a focal abnormality consistent with tumor that was not observed on scintigraphy. Only one patient had an abnormality on scintigraphy, caused by a metastasis, that was not found on MR images. In 73 (69%) of the 106 patients, the results of MR imaging and scintigraphy were equivalent; in 41 cases results of both techniques were normal. A McNemar analysis of the discordant cases showed MR imaging to be more sensitive than scintigraphy was (p less than .001). Our results suggest that although MR imaging has a greater sensitivity in detecting focal disease, scintigraphy is still the most useful screening test for evaluating the entire skeleton. MR imaging should be reserved for clarification of scintigraphic findings when suspicion is high for tumor. 
Central hypothyroidism due to isolated TRH deficiency in a depressive man. A depressive man was evaluated for developing chronic fatigue and cold intolerance, in whom laboratory findings showed decreased thyroid hormone levels (T4, 2.7 micrograms dl-1; T3, 0.76 ng ml-1) with normal blood levels of TSH. A single bolus injection of TRH (500 micrograms) significantly stimulated prolactin secretion, but did not cause an increase in blood TSH levels (basal level, 1.2 microU ml-1 vs. 1.3 microU ml-1 30 min after injection). By contrast, TRH-induced TSH stimulation occurred after repeated injection of TRH for 4 consecutive days (basal level, 1.5 microU ml-1 vs. 5.6 microU ml-1 30 min after injection). Blood thyroid hormone concentrations were restored to normal levels after long-term administration of TRH. Other pituitary functions remained unchanged. A diagnosis of central hypothyroidism due to isolated TRH deficiency was made in this case, and the data presented here indicate that partial resistance of pituitary thyrotrophs to TRH may be associated with depression. 
Postoperative primary adrenal failure in a patient with anticardiolipin antibodies A 50-year-old woman with no history of thrombosis or recurrent abortions developed pulmonary thromboembolism and bilateral hemorrhagic adrenal infarction with adrenal failure after hysterectomy for uterine fibroids. Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were detected in high titer and have persisted. She remains well, without further thromboses, taking steroid replacement and warfarin anticoagulation. The initial presentation of aCL related disease can be as thrombotic postoperative complications in middle-age. 
Differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia with tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid). BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia have a characteristic (15;17) translocation, with a breakpoint on chromosome 17 in the region of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha). Since this receptor has been shown to be involved with growth and differentiation of myeloid cells in vitro, and since recent clinical studies have reported that tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) induces complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia we studied the effects of tretinoin on cellular maturation and molecular abnormalities in patients undergoing the induction of remission with this agent. RESULTS. Eleven patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were treated with tretinoin administered orally at a dose of 45 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day. Nine of the 11 patients entered complete remission. In two patients, complete remission was preceded by striking leukocytosis that then resolved despite continued drug treatment. Serial studies of cellular morphologic features, cell-surface immunophenotypic analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with a chromosome 17 probe revealed that clinical response was associated with maturation of the leukemic clone. All patients who responded to treatment who were tested by Northern blot analysis had expression of aberrant RAR-alpha. As patients entered complete remission, the expression of the abnormal RAR-alpha message decreased markedly; however, it was still detectable in several patients after complete morphologic and cytogenetic remission had been achieved. CONCLUSIONS. Tretinoin is a safe and highly effective agent for inducing complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Clinical response to this agent is associated with leukemic-cell differentiation and is linked to the expression of an aberrant RAR-alpha nuclear receptor. Molecular detection of the aberrant receptor may serve as a useful marker for residual leukemia in patients with this disease. 
Esophageal motility disorders and chest pain. Motility abnormalities have long been recognized as a possible esophageal cause of chest pain; however, their exact role and prevalence remain largely unknown. Baseline manometry and the various provocative tests may suggest an esophageal origin, but their yield is low. The recent advent of prolonged ambulatory monitoring of intraesophageal pressure and the assessment of psychological factors are contributing to a clearer understanding of this complex problem. 
Spinal cord schistosomiasis: a pediatric case mimicking intrinsic cord neoplasm. We present the clinical, myelographic, MRI, and histologic data on a 7-year-old girl with confirmed Schistosoma mansoni infection of the spinal cord. MRI of the granulomatous spinal lesion revealed extensive enlargement of the cord in the T11-12 area, with some intramedullary swelling extending to T-5 through T-7. The clinical manifestations of spinal schistosomiasis can be diverse, and there should be a high index of suspicion for all patients from endemic areas. 
Resection of malignant bone tumors about the shoulder. A preliminary report of reconstruction with a new modular spacer. Reconstruction after resection of malignant bone tumors about the shoulder is difficult. Twelve patients had reconstruction using a new titanium modular spacer. This modular system allows the surgeon to reconstruct variable lengths of the proximal humerus. Although the patient has no active shoulder motion, excellent hand and elbow function is preserved. The spacer serves as a temporary device in the young active patient. A more definitive reconstructive procedure can be performed after the completion of chemotherapy and a sufficient disease-free interval. 
Congenital optic tract syndrome. We describe two patients with complete homonymous hemianopia who were unaware of their visual field defects. The clinical impression of an optic tract syndrome was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, which showed absence of the corresponding tract in each case. The pathogenesis of congenital absence of the optic tract is unclear but it could represent either a primary failure of development or secondary atrophy due to focal injury during the perinatal period. 
CT evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules: value of 185-H reference phantom. The pulmonary nodule CT reference phantom is widely used in the evaluation of nodules 2 cm or less in diameter. It is used to detect benign patterns of calcification that are not visible on thin-section CT scans. Since 1986, the reference nodules have been manufactured with a nominal composition of 185 H. The multicenter study published in 1986 used nodules with a nominal composition of 264 H, 100 H more than the threshold value reported by Siegelman et al. in 1980. In the multicenter study, one of 37 nodules diagnosed as benign with the phantom proved to be malignant. The purpose of this study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate with the 185-H phantom and to ascertain whether the malignant tumors predicted to be benign actually contained calcification. We retrospectively reviewed 296 cases in which examinations had been performed with the 185-H nodules since 1986. Eighty-five nodules were diagnosed as benign by comparison to the reference phantom. These 85 contained no visible calcification on thin-section CT scans. Ten of the 85 cases were shown to be malignant tumors. Eight were diagnosed as having a high probability of benignity. Two were diagnosed as having a moderate probability of benignity. Calcium was present in the tissue of all six nodules available for review. Fifty-nine of the 85 nodules were still clinically indeterminate at the time of this review. Even if all of the clinically indeterminate nodules are benign, the misdiagnosis rate would be significantly higher than in most previous studies. Although analysis by using the reference phantom with 185-H nodules may indicate a high probability of benignity, close radiologic follow-up is necessary. 
Comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment of chronic pain: a follow-up study of treated and non-treated groups. There are relatively few outcome studies of multidisciplinary chronic pain programs which have utilized no-treatment comparison groups. The present study compared a group of chronic pain patients (N = 42) treated in a comprehensive multidisciplinary pain program with a group of patients (N = 15) who were evaluated but not treated. Comparisons were made at evaluation and at a follow-up period averaging 11 months later. From evaluation to discharge, the treated group showed significant increases in physical functioning. From evaluation to long-term follow-up, both the treated and non-treated groups showed significant decreases in self-report pain ratings and interference with activities ratings. However, only the treated group showed a significant decrease in addictive medication use and increase in work functioning. The return-to-work rate for the treated group was 48% with an additional 28% of the patients being returned to vocational rehabilitation. None of the non-treated group returned to work or vocational rehabilitation. Results are discussed in terms of their support for the conclusion that comprehensive multidisciplinary pain programs produce marked subjective and functional changes. 
Neural processing of craniovascular pain: a synthesis of the central structures involved in migraine. In order to determine the anatomical distribution of cells concerned with relaying craniovascular nociception, local cerebral glucose utilization was determined by the 2-deoxyglucose method in tissue autoradiographs of the alpha-chloralose anesthetized cat. The superior sagittal sinus was carefully lifted from the brain by sectioning the dura laterally and the falx inferiorly and suspending the sinus across two platinum hook electrodes for stimulation. The sinus was stimulated electrically and its effect on caudal brainstem, upper cervical spinal cord and diencephalic metabolic activity determined. Stimulation of the sinus caused increased metabolic activity in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, in the cervical dorsal horn and in a discrete area in the dorsolateral spinal cord at the second cervical segment. Metabolic activity was also increased in the ventrobasal thalamus, specifically in the ventroposteromedial (188%) nuclear group, in the medial nucleus of the posterior complex (70%) and the intralaminar complex (49%). There was no change in the surrounding thalamus, lateral geniculate nucleus or overlying cerebral cortex. These increases in 2-deoxyglucose utilisation were blocked by bilateral trigeminal ganglion ablation. The dorsolateral area activated in the spinal cord corresponds to a hitherto unrecognised group of cells in or near the lateral cervical nucleus that may form an important relay for craniovascular nociception. Further electrophysiological studies with glass coated tungsten microelectrodes have characterised the cells in these regions of the thalamus to be responsible for relaying nociceptive information. An understanding of the connections and properties of the neurons that subserve craniovascular pain is an essential prerequisite to understanding the complex pathophysiology of migraine. 
Dissecting aneurysm of the posterior cerebral artery: spontaneous resolution. Dissecting aneurysms of the intracranial arteries display vascular pathological features that appear sporadically, generally affecting young adults. The clinical features of this condition may involve both ischemic episodes and hemorrhages. Posterior circulation is affected less than the rest of the intracranial arteries, and it is extremely rare to find the posterior cerebral arteries only affected. Mortality is high in patients where the lesion is located in the posterior intracranial circulation, although dissecting aneurysms limited to the posterior cerebral arteries may, to a certain extent, be benign. We report the case of a young woman with ischemia in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery that occurred subsequent to a dissecting aneurysm that resolved spontaneously to a complete remission, both clinically and as demonstrated by angiography. A review of the literature is made, analyzing the pathogenic, clinical, angiographic, and therapeutic characteristics of such lesions. 
Ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus after aorto-iliac reconstruction. Between January 1, 1980, and June 30, 1989, 9 patients (6 males and 3 females) developed ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus following 3,320 operations on the abdominal aorta (0.3%). The incidence of this complication was 0.1% (2 of 1,901) after elective and 1.4% (3 of 210) after emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and 0.3% (4 of 1,209) after repair for occlusive disease. Three of the latter had prior clinical evidence of distal embolization. Eight grafts were bifurcated (aorto-iliac:four, aorto-femoral: three, aorto-ilio-femoral:one). One patient underwent extra-anatomic revascularization. Only two patients had supraceliac aortic cross-clamping and one patient underwent exclusion of both internal iliac arteries. Four patients had hypotension. Early mortality was 22% (two of nine). Severe perioperative complications, mostly due to associated visceral and somatic ischemia and sepsis, were present in seven of the nine patients. The extent and type of the neurologic injury correlated with long-term outcome. Patients with ischemic injury of the lumbosacral roots or plexus had better recovery. Attention to the pelvic circulation and the collateral blood supply is important. Use of gentle technique to prevent embolization, avoidance of hypotension and prolonged supraceliac cross-clamping, revascularization of at least one internal iliac artery, and the use of heparin may decrease but not eliminate paraplegia. Once this unexpected complication occurs, careful neurologic evaluation should be done to localize the lesion and aid prognosis. 
Lipid peroxidation: a possible factor in late graft failure of coronary artery bypass grafts. Atherosclerosis is the paramount cause of late vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass grafting. Lipid peroxidation, which may play a significant role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, was examined in segments of vein grafts (n = 6) harvested at reoperation for coronary disease. These were analyzed for cholesterol, phospholipid, triglyceride, and lipid peroxides. Nonatherosclerotic vascular tissues, including coronary arteries (n = 6), saphenous veins (n = 9), and donor aortic specimens (n = 11) were analyzed for comparison. Risk factors for atherosclerosis including elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides, smoking, and hypertension were more frequent in patients with coronary artery disease compared to organ donors. Lipid peroxides were elevated in explanted vein grafts when compared to either saphenous vein, coronary artery or donor aorta. Lipid peroxides were not significantly different in saphenous vein when compared to coronary artery, but levels in both of these tissues were greater than in donor aorta. Although increased levels of lipid peroxides in explanted veins may simply reflect morphologic changes in these grafts, the known effects of lipid peroxides on a number of biochemical events suggest that they may contribute directly to graft failure after coronary artery bypass grafting. 
Brain and brain tumor uptake of L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine: competition with natural L-amino acids SPECT studies with L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine (IMT) were carried out in 10 patients with different types of brain tumors--first under fasting conditions (basal) and a week later during intravenous infusion of a mixture of naturally-occurring L-amino acids (AA load). An uptake index (UI) was calculated by dividing tissue count rates by the integral of plasma count rates. The UI decreased by 45.6% +/- 15.4% (n = 10, p less than 0.001) for normal brain and by 53.2% +/- 14.1% for gliomas (n = 5, p less than 0.01) during AA load compared to basal conditions, while two meningiomas and a metastasis showed only a minor decrease (23.9 +/- 5.7%, n.s.). Two pituitary adenomas could not be delineated on the SPECT scans. These data indicate that IMT competes with naturally-occurring L-amino acids for transport into normal brain and gliomas. Transport characteristics of IMT into tumors of nonglial origin appear to be different from those of gliomas. For both types of tumors, it is advisable to perform IMT-SPECT under fasting conditions. 
The use of angioplasty, bypass surgery, and amputation in the management of peripheral vascular disease BACKGROUND. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has been adopted widely as a treatment for patients with peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities. However, the effect of this procedure on the overall management of peripheral vascular disease and on the outcomes of patients has not been clearly delineated. In particular, it is not known whether angioplasty has replaced other treatments for peripheral vascular disease. METHODS. To assess the extent to which angioplasty is used and the associated changes in the surgical management of peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities, we used data on hospital discharges in Maryland to identify all angioplasty procedures, peripheral bypass operations, and lower-extremity amputations performed for peripheral vascular disease in Maryland hospitals between 1979 and 1989. RESULTS. We estimated that from 1979 to 1989 the annual rate of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities, adjusted for age and sex, rose from 1 to 24 per 100,000 Maryland residents (P less than 0.0001 by linear regression). Despite this increase in the use of angioplasty, the adjusted annual rate of peripheral bypass surgery also rose substantially, from 32 to 65 per 100,000 (P less than 0.001), whereas the adjusted annual rate of lower-extremity amputation remained stable at about 30 per 100,000. Total charges for hospitalizations during which a peripheral revascularization procedure was performed increased from $14.7 million in 1979 (in 1989 dollars) to $30.5 million in 1989. CONCLUSIONS. In Maryland, the adoption of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities has been associated with an increase in the use of peripheral bypass surgery and with no decline in lower-extremity amputations. These results could be due to increased diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease, expanded indications for procedural interventions, or an increased number of repeat procedures performed in patients with peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities. 
Transethmoid decompression of the optic nerve in head injuries: an update. Sixty-three patients with loss of vision following head injury were subjected to decompression of the optic nerve by the transethmoid route. This paper discusses the criteria for selection of patients for surgery, the results of the operation and the prognostic factors determining the results. 
Local hormonal factors (intracrine, autocrine, and paracrine) in hypertension. Vasoactive hormones acting as endocrine, neuroendocrine, or local hormonal systems (intracrine, autocrine, and paracrine) are an important component of the many factors that regulate blood pressure. Hypertension may be the result of an alteration in the balance between vasodepressor and vasopressor hormonal systems. Changes in this balance could be due to genetic factors such as mutations in one of the genes of the vasoactive system or environmental factors that alter the synthesis and release of one or more vasoactive hormones. Endocrine and neuroendocrine vasopressor hormonal systems, such as the renin-angiotensin system and catecholamines, play a well-established and important role in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of some secondary forms of hypertension. The blockade of such systems has already resulted in effective antihypertensive treatment. The role of local hormonal systems is less well established; however, recent evidence suggests they also play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension. Some vasopressor hormonal systems, such as the renin-angiotensin system, can act as both endocrine or local hormonal systems. Work using transgenic rats harboring the mouse Ren-2 gene has conclusively demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system, acting as a local hormonal system, has the capability to cause severe hypertension. Whether this model of experimental hypertension mimics any type of human hypertension is not known. Vasodepressor hormones such as kinins, prostaglandins, and endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) act mainly as local hormonal systems, with the notable exception of atrial natriuretic factor, which may act as both an endocrine and a local hormone. The tissue kallikrein-kinin system, acting either directly or via paracrine eicosanoids or EDRF, participates in local regulation of the circulation, renal function, and the acute antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) that distinguishes the kallikrein gene family of a strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) from normotensive Brown Norway rats has been identified. In a set of 32 recombinant inbred strains derived from these SHR and Brown Norway strains, the RFLP marking the kallikrein gene family of SHR cosegregated with an increase in blood pressure. Also, in a study of Utah families it was found that a dominant-allele kallikrein gene expressed as high urinary kallikrein excretion was associated with a decreased risk of essential hypertension. In conclusion, vasopressor and vasodepressor hormones, acting not only as endocrine but also as local hormones, play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Contribution of endogenous endothelin to the extension of myocardial infarct size in rats. Pathophysiological roles of endogenous endothelin have been studied from the viewpoint of its contribution to the extension of myocardial infarct size. A monoclonal antibody against endothelin 1 (AwETN40) suppressed changes induced by endothelin 1 and endothelin 2 but did not modify those by endothelin 3 in vivo or in vitro. Effects of AwETN40 on myocardial infarct size were investigated. Coronary ligation (1 hour) and reperfusion (24 hours) in rats caused infarction in 35% of the left ventricle. Repetitive or single administration of AwETN40 reduced the infarct size; an intravenous injection of 22.5 mg/kg of the antibody 5 minutes after coronary occlusion or 5 minutes before reperfusion reduced the size by 38% or 31% of the control, respectively. Plasma and tissue endothelin 1 and plasma big endothelin 1 in rats were measured at various stages after occlusion. Plasma endothelin 1 showed a fourfold increase 10 minutes after reperfusion (from 1.02 to 3.96 pg/ml) and had returned to the control value after 8 hours. Plasma big endothelin 1 showed changes similar to those of plasma endothelin 1. No significant changes in plasma endothelin 2 and endothelin 3 were observed. Cardiac tissue contained seven times as much endothelin 1 as the control value 1 hour after reperfusion (4.59 versus 33.1 pg/g tissue), and a high concentration (13.2 pg/g tissue) was maintained even after 48 hours. We concluded that an increase in endogenous endothelin 1 plays an important role in the extension of myocardial infarct size. 
Prospective, randomized controlled trial of interferon-alpha in children with chronic hepatitis B. Thirty-six children with chronic hepatitis B were entered into a randomized controlled trial of recombinant human interferon-alpha. All patients had hepatitis B virus DNA and increased levels of aminotransferases in serum for at least 1 yr. Twelve children received 10 MU of interferon-alpha 2b/m2 body surface area three times a week (group I); 12 children received 5 MU/m2 under the same conditions (group II); and 12 children served as controls (group III). During 6 mo of therapy, 12 of 24 (50%) treated patients (7 from group I, 58%, and 5 from group II, 42%) and 2 of 12 (17%) controls lost hepatitis B virus DNA from serum and subsequently remained negative. Comparison of the rate of response in group I vs. controls showed a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05). Eleven of 12 (92%) treated patients who cleared hepatitis B virus DNA from serum lost HBeAg, seroconverted to anti-HBe and had improvement in liver histological findings with loss of hepatitis B virus DNA from liver. In 10, serum ALT levels became normal. Interferon-alpha was well tolerated and all children finished therapy. These findings indicate that a 6-mo course of interferon-alpha is effective in inducing a serological, biochemical and histological remission of disease in approximately 50% of children with chronic hepatitis B. 
Diagnostic utility of ventilation/perfusion lung scans in acute pulmonary embolism is not diminished by pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of prior cardiac or pulmonary disease upon the utility of ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Ventilation/perfusion scans were evaluated among 365 patients with no prior cardiac or pulmonary disease and compared to V/Q scans in 526 patients with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease. Among patients with no prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, PE was present in 117 and PE was excluded in 248. Among patients with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, PE was present in 140 and excluded in 386. The positive predictive value for PE of high probability V/Q scans among patients with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, 55 of 66 (83 percent), was not significantly lower than among patients without prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, 50 of 54 (93 percent) (NS). The positive predictive value of low probability V/Q scans was similar with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, 25 of 182 (14 percent), and without prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, 17 of 113 (15 percent) (NS), as was the predictive value of near normal/normal V/Q scans, 2 of 51 (4 percent), vs 3 of 79 (4 percent) (NS). The sensitivity of high probability V/Q scans, with pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease and without, 55 of 140 (39 percent) vs 50 of 117 (43 percent), did not differ significantly. The specificity of high probability V/Q scans with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease and without, 375 of 386 (97 percent) vs 244 of 248 (98 percent) was also similar (NS). In conclusion, the diagnostic utility of V/Q scans for acute PE was not impaired by the presence of pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. Fewer patients, however, with no prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, had intermediate (indeterminate) V/Q scans. 
Decision for surgical management of perforation following endoscopic sphincterotomy. Duodenal perforation resulting from endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) is a serious complication with a high mortality. Diagnosis is often problematic and the optimum treatment is controversial. Eight proven perforations occurred following 441 ES at University of Colorado Hospital, a rate of 1.8 per cent. Physical and laboratory findings were of little diagnostic value, whereas plain abdominal radiographs showed evidence of perforation in 86 per cent. All patients were operated on promptly after diagnosis of perforation. Delay in diagnosis of perforation beyond 24 hours in six patients was associated with a high morbidity and two deaths. Analysis of published series confirmed that delay in diagnosis and delay in operation after perforation were associated with a higher mortality rate than early diagnosis with or without operation. We recommend operative intervention in all patients with clinical evidence of perforation following ES. 
Effects of subarachnoid hemorrhage and a thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor on intracranial prostaglandins. The effects of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on intracranial prostaglandins (PGs) were studied in canines. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was produced by the "two hemorrhage" method. Basilar artery caliber and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the occipital cortex were reduced by 42% and 43% during delayed vasospasm, respectively. Once delayed vasospasm had developed, intravenous infusion of OKY-046, a selective inhibitor of thromboxane (TX) A2 synthetase, induced no significant change in angiographic vasospasm but caused a significant increase in rCBF. In delayed vasospasm, cortical levels of PGF2 alpha were significantly decreased, whereas plasma levels of PGF2 alpha and TXB2 in the transverse sinus were significantly increased. The intravenous infusion of OKY-046 in delayed vasospasm induced a significant increase in cortical PGF2 alpha and PGE in the occipital cortex, and caused a significant increase in plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and a significant decrease in plasma TXB2 in the transverse sinus. In delayed vasospasm, decreased cortical levels of PGF2 alpha may reflect a decrease in rCBF and increased plasma PGF2 alpha and TXB2 levels may reflect enhancement of intravascular coagulation. These PGs have very strong and various biological activities. The results suggest that SAH induces complicated changes of intracranial PGs and OKY-046 can improve these pathological changes. 
Reduction of myocardial infarct size by poloxamer 188 and mannitol in a canine model. Poloxamer 188 has been reported to inhibit thrombosis, decrease whole blood viscosity, and improve perfusion of damaged tissue. Mannitol has free radical scavenging capabilities that might contribute to myocardial salvage after ischemia. Because these agents appear to work in different ways, we studied their cardioprotective properties when they were used separately and in combination. After 75 minutes of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion, dogs received poloxamer 188 (48 mg/kg), mannitol (0.5 gm/kg), or both intravenously during an additional 15 minutes of LAD occlusion and for 45 minutes of reperfusion, whereas control dogs received an equal volume of saline solution. After surgery the animals were maintained for 24 hours and then killed. Areas of myocardial infarction (MI) and risk of infarction (R) were calculated by means of planimetric analysis of slices of myocardium stained with 1.5% triphenyltetrazolium and 0.5% Evans blue dye. The ratio of MI/R (mean +/- standard error of the mean) were: control, 25.6 +/- 1.8% (n = 10); poloxamer 188, 12.7 +/- 2.0% (n = 10); mannitol, 10.6 +/- 2.5% (n = 11); and poloxamer 188 plus mannitol, 8.0 +/- 4.1% (n = 10). Measurement of microvascular blood flow indicated a similar 86% to 91% reduction of blood flow to the area at risk in all treatment groups. Consequently both poloxamer 188 and mannitol appear to increase salvage of ischemic myocardium and a combination of the two may be more effective than either agent alone. 
A unified model of atrioventricular nodal conduction predicts dynamic changes in Wenckebach periodicity. The atrioventricular (AV) node responds in a complex fashion to changes in activation rate. A variety of approaches have been used to explain these dynamic AV nodal responses, but none has been able to account fully for AV nodal behavior. Three specific rate-dependent properties of the AV node have been described: 1) time-dependent recovery after excitation, 2) an effect of short cycles to advance recovery ("facilitation"), and 3) a gradual slowing of conduction in response to sustained, high-frequency activation ("fatigue"). We hypothesized that a model incorporating quantitative descriptors of all three processes might be able to account for a wide variety of AV nodal behaviors. Quantitative descriptors of AV nodal recovery, facilitation, and fatigue were developed based on AV nodal conduction changes during selective pacing protocols in seven autonomically blocked dogs. These descriptors were incorporated into a set of mathematical equations that define AV nodal conduction of any beat based on activation history. The equations were then applied to predict pacing-induced Wenckebach periodicity in each dog. Experimental data were obtained after nine to 19 step decreases in atrial cycle length into the Wenckebach zone in each animal. Observed behaviors included complex patterns of block, a progressive increase in the level of block over 5 minutes of rapid pacing, and periods of alternating patterns of block. The model accurately predicted the onset of AV block at each cycle length, the relation between conduction ratio and cycle length as a function of time, and the changing patterns of Wenckebach periodicity during sustained atrial pacing. All three terms of the model equation (describing recovery, facilitation, and fatigue) were essential to account fully for the observed behaviors. Elimination of AV nodal fatigue from the model resulted in failure to account for time-dependent changes in Wenckebach patterns, whereas exclusion of facilitation led to consistent overestimation of the degree of AV block at each cycle length. We conclude that a mathematical model incorporating terms to describe recovery, facilitation, and fatigue accurately predicts a wide range of Wenckebach-type behavior and that complex conduction patterns of the AV node can be fully accounted for by simple functional AV nodal properties. 
Characterization of childhood acute leukemia with multiple myeloid and lymphoid markers at diagnosis and at relapse. To define the clinical and biologic significance of childhood acute mixed-lineage leukemia diagnosed by stringent criteria, we studied 25 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia expressing greater than or equal to 2 myeloid-associated antigens (My+ ALL), and 16 cases of acute myeloid leukemia expressing greater than or equal to 2 lymphoid associated antigens (Ly+ AML). These cases represented 6.1% of 410 newly diagnosed ALLs (two treatment protocols) and 16.8% of 95 AMLs (two protocols). T-lineage--associated antigens were identified in 9 of the My+ ALL cases and in 14 of those classified as Ly+ AML; all but 1 of the 19 cases that could be subclassified had an early thymocyte stage of differentiation. The My+ ALL cases had an increased frequency of French-American-British (FAB) L2 morphology (36%); the Ly+ AML cases were characterized by FAB M1 or M2 morphology, low levels of myeloperoxidase reactivity and combined populations of myeloperoxidase-positive large blasts and small blasts generally of hand-mirror morphology. Karyotypic abnormalities included t(9;22)(q34;q11) in three cases of My+ ALL, 11q23 translocations in two cases of My+ ALL, and 14q32 translocations in three My+ ALL and five Ly+ AML cases. Mixed-lineage expression lacked prognostic significance in either ALL or AML; however, the findings indicate that some patients with Ly+ AML may respond to prednisone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase after failing on protocols for myeloid leukemia. At relapse, two My+ ALLs had converted to AML and two Ly+ AMLs to ALL; one case in each group showed complete replacement of the original karyotype. Acute mixed-lineage leukemia does not adequately describe the heterogeneity of the cases identified in this study and should be replaced by a set of more restrictive terms that indicate the unique biologic features of these leukemias. 
Effects of the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist DuP 753 on blood pressure and renal functions in spontaneously hypertensive PH dogs. A colony of genetic hypertensive dogs with systolic blood pressure of 140 to 220 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg in the trained state was used. The objective of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic and renal effects of the novel angiotensin II receptor antagonist DuP 753 given intravenously to these dogs. Renal functions and blood pressure were measured 45 to 75 min after the intravenous administration of DuP 753 at 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg and were compared to control (placebo) treatment. Arterial pressure was slightly but significantly and dose-dependently reduced by DuP 753. Glomerular filtration rate increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, effective renal plasma flow was dose-dependently increased. Filtration fraction was unchanged. Renal vascular resistance was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg of DuP 753. DuP 753 increased fractional sodium excretion at all doses and increased fractional potassium excretion only at the highest doses. The vasopressor effects of angiotensin I and II were dose-dependently inhibited by DuP 753. These data show that DuP 753 has beneficial renal hemodynamic effects and lowers arterial pressure in this canine model of essential hypertension. 
Muscle sympathetic nerve activity in renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Previous studies, including our own, have demonstrated that muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) is increased in patients with essential hypertension compared with normotensive subjects. However, the features of sympathetic nerve activity are still unknown in secondary hypertension. We examined MSNA in eight patients with renovascular hypertension and in 11 patients with primary aldosteronism. Twenty patients with essential hypertension and 20 normotensive subjects who were age-matched to the patients with renovascular hypertension and those with primary aldosteronism were also studied. The MSNA of a bundle of the tibial nerve was recorded by microneurography in supine subjects and expressed as both burst rate (bursts/min) and burst incidence (bursts/100 heart beats). Plasma renin activity and the plasma concentration of angiotensin II and aldosterone were also measured. MSNA was increased in the patients with renovascular hypertension compared with the patients with primary aldosteronism and those with essential hypertension and the normotensive subjects (p less than 0.01 for each). MSNA was decreased in the patients with primary aldosteronism compared with those with essential hypertension (p less than 0.01), and it was smaller than in the normotensive subjects (p less than 0.1). Furthermore, MSNA, plasma renin activity, and the plasma concentration of angiotensin II decreased significantly in five patients with renovascular hypertension 4-10 days after successful percutaneous renal angioplasty. Thus, the changes in MSNA seem to characterize the pathophysiology of renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system may be involved in the increase in the central outflow of sympathetic nerve activity, thus exacerbating hypertension in patients with renovascular hypertension. 
The growth hormone, prolactin and TSH response to TRH and L-dopa in patients with hyperprolactinaemia and a normal-sized sella turcica may denote a pituitary adenoma. Forty-one patients with hyperprolactinaemia and suspected prolactinomas were studied. Growth hormone (GH) and thyrotropin (TSH) secretory patterns after thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were affected in the majority of patients. The disturbances were observed regardless of tumour size as indicated by the radiological sella size. In patients with hyperprolactinaemia and normal-sized sella turcica, an abnormal GH and TSH response to TRH can be helpful in the diagnosis of a microadenoma. The hyperprolactinaemia per se and its effect on dopaminergic hypothalamic neurones may be the cause of the GH and TSH response. By contrast, many patients with macroprolactinomas showed insufficient GH secretory capacity. 
Progressive congestive heart failure. Ways to approach office management. Treatment of congestive heart failure depends on the cause, precipitating factors, and symptoms of the disease in each patient. Dr Kahn outlines the use of the three main types of pharmacologic agents given for heart failure--diuretics, vasodilators, and digoxin. He describes a stepwise regimen, whereby agents are added as needed to improve symptoms and prolong life. 
Increased plasma apolipoprotein(a) levels in IDDM patients with microalbuminuria. Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) have a significantly increased risk of macrovascular disease, particularly if they have persistent proteinuria. To determine whether altered levels of apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], the plasminogenlike glycoprotein of the potentially atherogenic lipoprotein(a); contribute to the increased risk of atherosclerosis, apo(a) levels were measured in 107 patients with IDDM and compared with nondiabetic control subjects and male elective coronary artery graft patients. Apo(a) levels were increased in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria (geometric mean 245 U/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] 142-427, n = 30) and albuminuria (mean 196 U/L, 95% CI 97-397, n = 18) with levels comparable to patients with coronary artery disease (mean 193 U/L, 95% CI 126-298, n = 40), which were higher than in the control group (mean 107 U/L, 95% CI 85-134, n = 140; P = 0.016). Apo(a) levels in diabetic patients without microalbuminuria (mean 86 U/L, 95% CI 63-116, n = 59) were comparable with the control population and less than in those with microalbuminuria (P less than 0.001) and albuminuria (P = 0.014). The elevated apo(a) levels found in patients with IDDM and increased urinary albumin loss may contribute to their heightened risk of macrovascular disease. 
Deglycosylation of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor is impaired in the faeces of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease). 1. alpha 1-Proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-antitrypsin) was excreted in the faeces of patients with inflammatory bowel disease in different molecular forms: Mr-51,000 and Mr-45,000 forms were widely found in the stools of patients with active disease, whereas a Mr-38,000 species was frequently recovered from healthy subjects and patients with quiescent disease (Mizon, Becuwe, Balduyck et al. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34, 2268-70). 2. N-Terminal sequencing of the Mr-38,000 form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, after SDS/PAGE and electrotransfer on polyvinyl difluoride membranes, showed that it differed from plasma alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor by the loss of 17 N-terminal amino acids. 3. Carbohydrate analysis of the isolated Mr-38,000 form revealed a total lack of neutral sugars. 4. In contrast, the Mr-51,000 form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor is glycosylated and thus could be differentiated by virtue of its reactivity with concanavalin A. The analysis of 25 faecal extracts from patients with Crohn's disease allowed us to confirm that the presence of the glycosylated form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor was closely related to the degree of inflammation. 5. From these data, it may be hypothesized that the hydrolytic activity of some glycosidases is greatly reduced in active Crohn's disease. 
Pattern of treatment failure following laser for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: implications for follow-up protocol. In an effort to devise a rational protocol for the follow-up of patients who have had destructive treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), an analysis has been performed of treatment failures following laser therapy in 2130 women treated between 1980-1989. Of this group, 1253 women have been followed up for 3 years or more and 380 for 6 years or more. There have been 119 treatment failures (5.6%), of which 71% of the women had the second lesion detected during the first year of follow-up, 24% during the second year, 3.3% during the third year, and 1.7% during the sixth year. In 18% of these 119, the second lesion was detected colposcopically in the presence of negative cytology. There were two cases of microinvasion and one frankly invasive lesion following laser, all diagnosed during the second year of follow-up. Our data suggest that if the first year of follow-up includes at least one colposcopic examination, some second lesions will be diagnosed in the presence of negative cytology. 
The potential utility of a rapid CK-MB assay in evaluating emergency department patients with possible myocardial infarction. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of a new rapid creatine kinase-MB (R-CK-MB) assay compared with a standard CK-MB (S-CK-MB) assay and to determine its potential use in the evaluation of emergency department patients with possible myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Retrospective patient identification with subsequent testing of excess sera for CK-MB and total CK using an identity-unlinked procedure. SETTING: Large, urban, teaching hospital ED. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients with excess sera and one of several defined presentations chosen to identify those with possible myocardial ischemia or infarction. Patients with clearly documented noncardiac etiologies of their symptoms or signs were excluded. MAIN RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 271 patient specimens for the R-CK-MB assay compared with the S-CK-MB assay were 100%, 96.8%, 75.0%, and 100%, respectively. The R-CK-MB assay was positive for 32 patients (11.8%). Of these, eight (25.0%) were admitted to unmonitored beds, and five (15.6%) were discharged home. All of these 13 patients had initial ECGs without evidence of ischemia or infarction. On follow-up, at least eight of the 13 had evidence of infarction. CONCLUSION: The R-CK-MB assay demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity compared with the S-CK-MB assay. When used for patients in whom a cardiac care unit admission is not considered, the rapid assay may identify some patients with unsuspected myocardial infarction and prevent inadvertent discharge or admission to unmonitored beds. 
Placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial of growth hormone treatment in prepubertal children with chronic renal failure. Stunted growth is a serious problem for children with chronic renal failure (CRF) despite normal endogenous growth hormone secretion and normal or elevated plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factors (IGF) I and II. Biosynthetic growth hormone (GH) was given to 20 prepubertal children (eleven boys, nine girls; mean age 9.5 years, range 4-16) with CRF and severe growth retardation in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial. 6 months of subcutaneous injection of GH (4 IU/m2 per day) was either preceded or followed by 6 months of placebo injection. The patients had a full examination every 3 months. Sixteen children completed the study. Height velocity improved significantly with GH therapy (p less than 0.0001) and placebo (p less than 0.04), but the GH-induced height-velocity increase exceeded that of placebo by 2.9 cm per 6 months. There was a positive relationship between prestudy height velocity and height-velocity increase. Bone maturation was not affected. GH caused a significant increase in IGF-I and a moderate increase in IGF-II plasma concentrations. The pretreatment elevation of IGF-binding protein-1 decreased by almost 50% during GH therapy, while IGF-binding protein-3 increased significantly in concentration, although this increase was significantly smaller than the GH-induced increase in IGF-I. Fructosamine, lipid, and parathyroid concentrations remained constant. Renal function deterioration did not accelerate. Impressive height-velocity increase can be achieved with GH therapy in children with CRF and growth retardation without changes in renal function. Bone maturation appears unaffected suggesting improved final height. Treatment is best started before growth retardation becomes considerable. 
Intracranial extension of a naso-ethmoid schwannoma. A rare case of intracranial extension of a naso-ethmoid schwannoma is presented. Its subsequent removal with few sequelae confirmed the benign nature and good prognosis of the disease. 
Alpha-blocker therapy of hypertension. An unfulfilled promise. For various reasons, the alpha 1-receptor blocker prazosin has been used infrequently as initial therapy for hypertension. The introduction of additional agents of this class with properties different from prazosin provides slower onset of action, which should reduce the degree of first-dose and postural hypotension and a longer duration of action, which allows for once-a-day dosage. A summary of the published data on efficacy, side effects, and special properties of this class of agents indicates that they will probably be used more extensively, particularly because of their ability to improve lipid and glucose-insulin metabolism. 
Postmortem studies of the heart in three fatal cases of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hearts of individuals who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan, with particular attention paid to the coronary arteries, the neural structures, and the conduction system of the heart because of reported terminal disturbances of cardiac rhythm and conduction. STUDY MATERIAL: Three hearts fixed in neutral formalin and well preserved with all the relevant areas of conduction system intact. METHODS: Light microscopic examination of subserial sections of the sinus node, atrioventricular node and His bundle, coronary chemoreceptor and regional nerves, ganglia, and small coronary arteries. Routine stains used were Goldner trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson. RESULTS: Arterial abnormalities were numerous and primarily of two types: focal fibromuscular dysplasia causing moderate to severe narrowing, as well as endarteritis and panarteritis. Extensive examples of neuritis and ganglionitis were present throughout the heart, including the conduction system, where arterial abnormalities were also abundant. In the coronary chemoreceptor there were both old and new lesions comprising focal inflammation with degeneration as well as older areas of fibrotic destruction. Within the sinus node, areas of dense fibrosis replaced all nodal tissue. These abnormalities were similar in nature and extent in all three hearts. CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic lesions present in the coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system of the heart in patients who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome provide a suitable anatomic substrate for substantial cardiac electrical instability, including the occurrence of sudden death. In cases of unexplained cardiac electrical instability or sudden unexpected death an inquiry should be made about previous use of L-tryptophan. In patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, the possibility of cardiac electrical instability should be considered as part of long-range clinical management. 
Neurokinin and NMDA antagonists (but not a kainic acid antagonist) are antinociceptive in the mouse formalin model. While much evidence implicates substance P (SP), an endogenous neurokinin (NK), as a primary sensory transmitter of acute pain in mammalian spinal cord, its role in continuous (tonic) pain is less clear. Although glutamate is co-localized with SP in dorsal root ganglion neurons, its role in nociceptive processing is uncertain. While antagonists of NKs and excitatory amino acids (EAAs) have been found to be antinociceptive in some acute assays, they have not been tested against tonic pain. We hypothesize that: (1) NKs and EAAs contribute to signaling of tonic chemogenic nociception; and (2) interaction between NK and EAA systems is important in determining the perceived intensity of a continuous noxious stimulus. We therefore evaluated two NK antagonists ([D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9] SP (DPDT-SP, 0.26-6.6 nmoles, non-specific) and [D-Pro4, D-Trp7,9,10,Phe11]-SP(4-11) (DPDTP-octa, 1.6-12.3 nmoles, somewhat NK-1 selective], as well as DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (DL-AP5, NMDA antagonist, 0.05-1 nmole) and urethane (a kainic acid (KA) antagonist at 2.5 mumoles) for antinociceptive activity in the mouse formalin model. Administered intrathecally (i.t.), DL-AP5 and both NK antagonists were significantly antinociceptive while urethane (2.5 mumoles) and naloxone (2.7 nmoles) were inactive. A50 values for mean % analgesia, nmoles/mouse i.t. (95% CLs) were: DPDT-SP, 1.1 (0.79-1.6); DPDTP-octa, 3.9 (2.4-6.1); DL-AP5, 0.29 (0.16-0.71). The antinociception associated with 1.3 nmoles of DPDT-SP was not reversed by co-administering 2.7 nmoles of naloxone. Co-administration of 0.1 nmoles of DL-AP5 with either 1.3 nmoles of DPDT-SP or 3.3 nmoles of DPDTP-octa did not lead to additive antinociception. 
Cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis in total hip replacement. A theoretical analysis was performed regarding the cost-effectiveness in terms of lives saved (reduction of fatal pulmonary embolism [PE]) and in terms of money (dollars spent for prevention and treatment) of seven strategies in the management of venous thromboembolic disease in patients over 39 years of age undergoing elective total hip replacement (THR). Strikingly, this theoretical analysis suggests that low-dose warfarin combined with clinical surveillance of deep vein thrombosis would reduce the incidence of fatal PE from 20 per 1,000 patients to 4 per 1,000 patients and simultaneously reduce the charges for venous thromboembolic disease from $550,000 to about $400,000 per 1,000 patients. Based on this analysis, we strongly recommend this measure on a routine basis. Adding venography or duplex sonography routinely to this prophylactic regimen would, in this theoretical analysis, reduce the incidence of fatal PE from 4 per 1,000 patients to 0.15 per 1,000, but adds charges of $200,000 per extra life saved in the case of routine venography and $50,000 in the case of routine sonography. Low-dose warfarin prophylaxis combined with routine sonography does not generate more charges than no prophylaxis with no screening while drastically reducing the incidence of fatal PE from 20 to 0.3 per 1,000 patients. Where duplex sonography is not easily available, a 12-week postoperative course of low-dose warfarin for every patient with no routine screening will be efficacious in reducing fatal PE and as cost-effective. 
Cell-mediated immunologic responses and recurrent genital herpes in the guinea pig. Effects of glycoprotein immunotherapy. The specific immune alterations associated with HSV recurrences are ill defined although it appears that alterations in cell-mediated immune mechanisms are more likely associated with recurrent disease than humoral immunity. Immunization with HSV glycoproteins B and D (gBgD) after primary HSV infection has reportedly reduced the frequency of recurrences but the mechanisms remain unidentified. We therefore evaluated the effects of immunization with cloned gBgD on selected cell-mediated immune responses and their relationship to recurrent disease by using the guinea pig model of genital HSV-2 infection. In two experiments, immunization with gBgD + CFA on days 21 and 42 after HSV-2 inoculation significantly decreased the number of subsequent recurrent lesion days observed whereas CFA alone had no effect. Immunization with gBgD + CFA increased the lymphoproliferative and in vitro IL-2 response to gBgD more than to whole HSV-2 Ag preparations. Peak responses were observed 2 wk after the second immunization. The HSV-specific cytolytic response was also persistently increased beginning 1 wk after the first immunization. Analysis including both untreated and gBgD-immunized animals revealed that recurrent lesion days were inversely correlated to the IL-2 response to whole HSV-2 Ag (p less than 0.0001), the IL-2 response to gBgD (p = 0.0004), and the HSV-specific cytolytic response (p = 0.005 and 0.003 in two experiments, respectively). When the untreated group was analyzed separately, only the IL-2 response to whole HSV-2 Ag correlated to recurrences (p = 0.007). HSV glycoprotein immunization may increase IL-2 or other cytokines secreted by HSV-sensitized T cells increasing critical immune responses, such as NK- or lymphokine-activated killer-mediated cytolysis, that could eliminate the reactivated virus before the development of clinically apparent lesions. 
Memory and pain: tests of mood congruity and state dependent learning in experimentally induced and clinical pain. The associative network theory of memory [2] is outlined along with the concepts of mood congruity and state dependent learning. Two experiments are reported which investigate the occurrence of these effects where memory for pain is concerned. In experiment 1 the performance of 25 chronic pain patients was compared with that of 25 non-patient controls on a test involving both immediate and delayed recall of a mixed list of stimulus words of 3 types: pain-related, negative or neutral. No significant group differences were found in overall rates of immediate recall. As predicted, however, pain patients recalled more pain-related words than non-patient controls (P less than 0.001). On delayed recall the same significant group x word-type interaction was obtained (P less than 0.02), but in addition the non-patient controls recalled significantly more words overall (P less than 0.02). These results provide some evidence for the occurrence of a mood congruity effect. Experiment 2 investigated state dependent learning and mood congruity effects in experimentally induced pain. Twenty volunteer subjects were allocated to 1 of 4 conditions in which a wordlist (as in experiment 1) was presented following either a painful stimulus (cold pressor test) or a non-painful one (warm water) and was then recalled immediately following further exposure to stimulus conditions which were congruent with the original stimulus (warm/warm and cold/cold conditions) or non-congruent (warm/cold and cold/warm conditions). A 3-way split plot ANOVA yielded no significant main effects for group or word-type, but a significant interaction emerged between state at encoding and at recall (P less than 0.04). 
Chronic subcorneal pustulosis with vasculitis: a variant of generalized pustular psoriasis in black South Africans. A rare, but distinctive chronic eruption in six female black South Africans is reported. The original diagnosis of subcorneal pustular dermatosis of Sneddon and Wilkinson in these patients was refuted by the subsequent histological observation of both spongiform pustules and an underlying vasculitis. This may represent a previously undocumented form of generalized pustular psoriasis. 
Piezogenic wrist papules: a common and asymptomatic finding. The first description of piezogenic wrist papules is presented. Twenty-nine persons were examined; 76% had pedal papules and 86% had wrist papules. Piezogenic papules are a common, nonhereditary finding and are not secondary to an inherent connective tissue defect. 
Review of neurobehavioral assessment tools. Behavioral, cognitive, and memory deficits are frequently observed sequelae of brain injury. Yet in most critical care settings, neurologic assessment is limited to evaluation of arousal, pupillary response, orientation, and motor capability. Behavior, cognition, and memory are not routinely evaluated. Several brief, bedside assessment tools are reviewed. All may be used in the critical care setting to evaluate the type and extent of residual deficits in the neurologically impaired patient. Nursing implications, based on the evaluation of deficits, are also discussed. 
Spontaneous carotid dissection: duplex scanning in diagnosis and management. The clinical, duplex, and angiographic findings in six patients with seven spontaneous extracranial carotid artery dissections are reported. Four dissections resulted in internal carotid artery occlusion. These patients complained of ipsilateral headache followed by contralateral hemiplegia. The other three dissections involved the common carotid artery and resulted in dual (one true and one false) lumens. Two of these dissections were asymptomatic. All dissections were treated nonoperatively with anticoagulant therapy. Neurologic deficits improved or disappeared in all symptomatic patients. On follow-up studies, one of the four internal carotid occlusions completely resolved with normalization of the duplex examination. All three dual lumen dissections remained patent on serial studies. Diagnostic duplex characteristics, both conclusive and supportive, of carotid dissections are described. Duplex scanning is shown to be accurate in diagnosing and ideally suited for serially following spontaneous carotid dissections. 
The induction of epidermal ornithine decarboxylase following tape stripping is inhibited by a topical vitamin D3 analogue (MC903). The efficacy of MC903, a vitamin D3 analogue, in reducing hyperproliferation as determined by levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was investigated in a double-blind study of 15 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. The lesions of psoriasis were treated for 8 weeks with MC903 in one of two different cream bases or with a placebo cream. Biopsies were taken before and after treatment. In addition an uninvolved area of skin was treated during the last 3 weeks and this as well as control areas were then sellotape stripped and biopsied after 8 h. Clinical improvement was seen in eight out of 11 patients treated with MC903 but there was no reduction in the level of ODC in psoriatic lesions after 8 weeks of treatment. The levels of ODC in the tape-stripped uninvolved skin after 3 weeks of treatment with MC903 averaged 22.5 +/- 4.2 pmol/min/mg protein as compared to 58.6 +/- 12.6 pmol/min/mg protein (P = 0.004). The trauma-induced induction of ODC activity was markedly inhibited by the application of MC903. 
Oral mucosal soft tissue necrosis caused by superinfection. Report of three cases. Three patients in whom flap necrosis developed after oral surgeries and antibiotic therapies were studied microbiologically by routine aerobic and anaerobic methods. In all cases the bacteria Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and coagulase-negative penicillinase-producing staphylococci were resistant to the antibiotics used. These bacteria are frequent microorganisms of superinfection and were not found after the necrotic tissues had repaired. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of cutaneous neoplasms: clinicopathologic correlation. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been reported to be clinically useful, in selected cases, in patients with melanocytic skin lesions. This report describes good resolution, clinically useful MRI scans of squamous cell carcinoma, dermatofibroma, and primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. The tumor depth measured by MRI was in excellent correlation with Breslow's depth measurements, indicating that MRI is probably the radiologic technique of choice for preoperative evaluation of the extent and depth of primary and recurrent skin tumors. This report also provides the authors' recommendations for obtaining optimal MRI images of cutaneous lesions. 
Dementing illness: the patient, caregiver and community. Care of the elderly patient with dementing illness involves not only the patient but also the family and other caregivers, and the community. An evaluation and treatment plan must go beyond the patient's immediate medical problems to examine the caregiver's needs and the community services available. 
Comparison of the electrical properties of arterial smooth muscle in normotensive rats and rats with deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt-induced hypertension: possible involvement of (Na(+)-K(+)-Cl-) co-transport. 1. Hypertension was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by left unilateral nephrectomy and deoxycorticosterone acetate--salt administration. After 5 weeks, arterial systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated in these animals (191.5 +/- 6.0 mmHg, mean +/- SD, n = 17) compared with age-matched, unoperated control animals (134.0 +/- 4.2 mmHg, n = 8, P less than 0.001). 2. The membrane potential of femoral artery vascular smooth muscle measured in vitro was -55.1 +/- 6.3 mV (mean +/- SD, n = 154) for normotensive and -50.8 +/- 5.7 mV (n = 82) for hypertensive animals. The difference in membrane potential was significant (P less than 0.001). 3. The relationship between the log of the extracellular K+ concentration and membrane potential was nonlinear over the extracellular K+ concentration range 2.5-20 mmol/l, and showed a small positive shift with hypertension. 4. Tenfold reductions in the extracellular concentrations of Na+ or Cl- resulted in a membrane potential hyperpolarization in vascular smooth muscle from normotensive animals (4.9 +/- 2.0 mV, n = 13 and 12.1 +/- 1.3 mV, mean +/- SD, n = 14, respectively). In vascular smooth muscle from hypertensive animals, the hyperpolarization in low-Na+ media was significantly increased to 12.2 +/- 2.6 mV (mean +/- SD, n = 5), but that in low-Cl- media was unaffected (2.7 +/- 1.6 mV, n = 6). 5. The loop diuretic, bumetanide (10 mumol/l), hyperpolarized the membrane potential in vascular smooth muscle from both normotensive and hypertensive rats, but not in low-Na+ or low-Cl- media. 
Antigen-presenting cells in essential fatty acid-deficient murine epidermis: keratinocytes bearing class II (Ia) antigens may potentiate the accessory cell function of Langerhans cells. Essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD) is a useful model for studying the role of (n-6) fatty acid metabolism in normal physiology. Because cutaneous manifestations are among the earliest signs of EFAD and because abnormalities in the distribution and function of tissue macrophages have been documented in EFAD rodents, we studied the distribution and function of Class II MHC (Ia) antigen-bearing cells in EFAD C57B1/6 mouse epidermis. Immunofluorescence studies revealed 1.9-9.6 (mean +/- SEM = 5.2 +/- 2.6) times more class II MHC (Ia) antigen-bearing epidermal cells in suspensions prepared from EFAD as compared to normal skin. Analysis of epidermal sheets demonstrated similar numbers of dendritic Ia+ and NLDC145+ cells in EFAD and normal epidermis, however. This discrepancy occurred because some keratinocytes in EFAD epidermal sheets expressed class II MHC (Ia) antigens, whereas keratinocytes in normal mouse epidermis did not. Two-color flow cytometry confirmed that all Ia+ cells in normal epidermis are Langerhans (Ia+ NLDC145+) cells, whereas Ia+ cells in EFAD epidermis are comprised of Langerhans cells and a subpopulation of keratinocytes (Ia+ NLDC145-). Similar levels of Ia antigens were expressed on EFAD and normal Langerhans cells. EFAD and normal epidermal cells were also compared in several in vitro assays of accessory cell function. Epidermal cells prepared from EFAD C57B1/6 mice present the protein antigen DNP-Ova to primed helper T cells more effectively than epidermal cells prepared from normal animals. EFAD epidermal cells are also more potent stimulators of T cells in primary and secondary allogeneic mixed lymphocyte-epidermal cell reactions than normal epidermal cells. The functional differences between EFAD and normal epidermal cells do not appear to result from increased cytokine release or decreased prostaglandin production by EFAD epidermal cells. In view of these findings and the observation that the antigen-presenting cell activity of EFAD epidermal cells correlates with the number of Ia+ keratinocytes in epidermal cell preparations, Ia+ keratinocytes (in the presence of Langerhans cells) may potentiate cutaneous immune responses in vitro and perhaps in vivo as well. These results also suggest that (n-6) fatty acids or metabolites of (n-6) fatty acids are involved in regulating the expression of class II MHC (Ia) antigens by keratinocytes in vivo. 
Bilateral sequential lung transplantation: the procedure of choice for double-lung replacement. We recently described a technique for bilateral sequential lung transplantation that replaces the en bloc double-lung operation, a procedure that was accompanied by frequent problems with airway healing. Twenty-seven patients have undergone 28 bilateral sequential lung transplantations over the past 14 months. Eighteen patients had transplantation because of end-stage emphysema; 6, cystic fibrosis; and 1 each, obliterative bronchiolitis, usual interstitial pneumonitis with pulmonary fibrosis, and bronchiectasis. Cardiopulmonary bypass was used electively in the first 5 patients until it was recognized that the procedure could be done safely without it, and in only 3 additional recipients has it been employed. Mean ischemic time for the first lung was 276 +/- 43 minutes and for the second lung, 410 +/- 64 minutes. There have been five deaths, three in the postoperative period (11% operative mortality) and two late. The other patients are alive and well and do not require oxygen 2 to 15 months after transplantation. Mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second rose from 16% +/- 8% of predicted to 84% +/- 17% at 12 weeks. Six-minute walk values increased from a mean of 251 +/- 91 m to 666 +/- 42 m at 24 weeks. The excellent exposure afforded to both hemithoraces by the thoracosternotomy incision and the rare need of cardiopulmonary bypass have allowed us to offer the option of transplantation to patients who formerly would have been turned down because of previous pulmonary resection or pleurectomy. On four occasions, ventilator-dependent patients underwent successful transplantation. 
Microvessel derived endothelial cell isolation, adherence, and monolayer formation for vascular grafts. MVECs can be isolated from animal and human fat in quantities and in a pure enough form to produce a cell-lined vascular graft. In animal studies grafts treated with these cells are associated with prolongation of graft patency. In human implants definitive expression factor VIII related antigen cells has been performed on an MVEC treated graft at 9 months. Further studies will be necessary to provide further insight into the healing and long-term behavior of these grafts, both with respect to the thrombogenicity of the surface as well as the influence on anastomotic hyperplasia. 
Stroke in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The thrombosis in myocardial infarction clinical trial and a review of placebo-controlled trials. The frequency of stroke among patients in six recent placebo-controlled trials of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction is reviewed. Three trials used streptokinase and three used tissue plasminogen activator as the thrombolytic agent. While thrombolytic therapy greatly reduces the morbidity and mortality of acute myocardial infarction, it increases the rate of intracerebral hemorrhage. 
Perinatal hepatitis B virus infection caused by antihepatitis Be positive maternal mononuclear cells. To investigate the infectivity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from mothers to their newborn offspring, HBV-DNA in plasma and peripheral mononuclear cells from 28 antihepatitis Be positive, hepatitis B surface antigen positive carrier mothers was examined by a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction/Southern hybridisation technique. HBV specific DNA was detected in three maternal mononuclear cell samples, but was absent in plasma. Two of four infants born to the three mothers with HBV-DNA positive mononuclear cells developed acute or fulminant hepatitis within three months after birth. Two infants were effectively prevented from infection with HBV by combined hepatitis B immunoglobulin/HBV vaccine administration. The 25 infants born to the HBV-DNA negative mothers were free of HBV infection within the next seven months to 3.5 years. These results suggest that latent infection with HBV in maternal mononuclear cells is responsible for perinatal HBV infection. 
Angiographically assessed coronary arterial patency and reocclusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with anistreplase: results of the anistreplase reocclusion multicenter study (ARMS). In this open multicenter study, 156 patients with acute myocardial infarction received 30 U of anistreplase intravenously over 5 minutes within 4 hours of the onset of chest pain. The patency of the infarct-related vessel was determined by coronary angiography 90 minutes after anistreplase treatment, and also 24 hours after treatment, in patients with a patent infarct-related vessel at 90 minutes, to assess the reocclusion rate. The investigators categorized the infarct-related vessel as patent or occluded, and 2 independent cardiologists graded the infarct-related vessel according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) perfusion criteria. At the 90-minute assessment, 106 of 145 evaluable patients (73%) had patent infarct-related vessels, and 39 of 145 (27%) had occluded infarct-related vessels. Of the 139 independently assessed patients, 98 (71%) had TIMI grades 2 or 3 and 41 (29%) had TIMI grades 0 or 1. At the 24-hour assessment, 98 of 102 patients (96%) had a patent infarct-related vessel, and reocclusion had occurred in 4 of 102 patients (4%). Of the 94 independently assessed patients 90 (96%) had TIMI grades 2 or 3, and 4 (4%) had TIMI grades 0 or 1. The reliability of noninvasive parameters as indicators of achieved patency of the infarct-related vessel was estimated by means of correlation with patency assessed by coronary angiography. A significant correlation of 0.62 was found. The patency rate of 71 to 73% after use of anistreplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction corresponds with findings in earlier studies. The low reocclusion rate of 4% after use of anistreplase probably reflects the prolonged action of anistreplase. 
Angiographic vasospasm and release of platelet thromboxane after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We studied adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and the associated release of thromboxane B2 in 49 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage in relation to angiographic vasospasm. Postoperative cerebral angiography was performed less than or equal to 3 (median 1) days after surgery for an aneurysm 5-14 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Correspondingly, one sample from each patient was taken within 24 hours either before or after angiography. The occurrence of severe as well as diffuse, moderate, or severe angiographic vasospasm was associated with the presence of delayed cerebral ischemia (p less than 0.05). Patients with diffuse angiographic vasospasm had significantly higher (p less than 0.05) values for thromboxane B2 release than the others, even after adjustment by the clinical grades on admission and before surgery, the timing of surgery, the time from subarachnoid hemorrhage to angiography and blood sampling, and nimodipine therapy. Severe and diffuse angiographic vasospasm were also associated with poor outcome at 1 year (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that augmented release of platelet thromboxane may be involved in the pathogenesis of vasospasm in large cerebral arteries. 
Herpes simplex virus DNA in occult lesions: demonstration by the polymerase chain reaction. Herpes simplex virus DNA was identified by the polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for the herpes DNA polymerase gene. A herpes-specific amplimer was detected in two of three cases in which the clinical and histologic features were inconclusive. 
The present status of akathisia. Akathisia is a common and distressing side effect of antipsychotic and some other psychotropic medications. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of its clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment. Restless legs syndrome and akathisia associated with Parkinson's disease are discussed in so far as they help understand drug-induced akathisia. The complexity of the disorder, and the difficulty in characterizing and quantifying it, may explain why researchers have relatively neglected akathisia for so long. The recent upsurge of research interest promises the hope of a better understanding of its pathophysiology so that effective therapy may result. 
Videofluoroscopy in elderly patients with aspiration: importance of evaluating both oral and pharyngeal stages of deglutition. Oropharyngeal functional impairment increases with age so that radiologists frequently are asked to determine the cause of aspiration in elderly patients. Neuromuscular and cognitive impairment often make it difficult to perform and interpret videofluoroscopic deglutition examinations in these patients. We retrospectively reviewed the barium swallow examinations in 50 elderly patients (mean age, 87 years) who were known to aspirate. We looked for specific patterns of oropharyngeal dysfunction that resulted in bolus misdirection. Analysis revealed that aspiration was due to abnormalities of the oral stage in 23, pharyngeal stage in 10, and both stages in 17. Dysfunction in the oral stage was due to ingestion of large volumes or rapid acquisition rates in nine, failure of containment during processing (bolus manipulation) in 18, and dissociation of lingual delivery and swallowing initiation in the transitional phase in 13. Dysfunction in the pharyngeal stage was due to incomplete transport (bolus retention) in 21 and defective closure of the laryngeal vestibule in 11. No significant relationship between conditions known to cause oropharyngeal dysfunction (dementia, stroke, Parkinson disease, disuse deconditioning) and the specific pattern of dysfunction was identified. These results indicate that an accurate and valid assessment of oropharyngeal dysfunction in elderly patients with aspiration is possible if specific patterns of dysfunction are sought. Our study indicates the importance of evaluating the oral and pharyngeal stages of deglutition in elderly patients who aspirate. 
Role of basic fibroblast growth factor in revascularization of rabbit tracheal autografts. Despite omentopexy of the bronchial anastomosis, donor airway ischemia remains a problem after lung transplantation. This study examined the hypothesis that surface abrasion and topical application of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) would enhance omental revascularization of trachea in a rabbit heterotopic autograft model. Tracheal segments were excised, primary tracheal anastomoses performed, and the segments placed in the peritoneal cavity wrapped in omentum. Animals were randomized to one of six groups according to tracheal segment treatment: control, surgical abrasion, Surgicel wrap with topical bFGF, Surgicel wrap with bFGF vehicle, Gelfoam wrap with bFGF, and topical bFGF alone. One week later, animals were heparinized, perfused with Aquablak dye, and killed. Tracheal segments were excised and sectioned for light microscopic quantitative assessment of viability and dye perfusion. There was no significant improvement in viability or perfusion between abraded tracheal segments or segments treated with bFGF/Gelfoam or bFGF alone when compared with control segments. Airways wrapped in Surgicel had significantly greater ischemic injury compared with the control group, regardless of bFGF application. Neither surgical abrasion nor topical bFGF increased omental revascularization of transplanted tracheal segments after 7 days. 
Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia in children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. To determine the significance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) eosinophilia, the charts of 106 patients treated with shunt-related procedures during the calendar year 1985 were reviewed. Sixty-nine patients presented for a shunt revision; their charts were retrospectively reviewed from the time of shunt insertion until January, 1988. The remaining 37 patients had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt inserted during the study period and were subsequently followed to January, 1988. A total of 558 shunt-related procedures were performed on these patients during the study period, with a mean follow-up period of 6.9 years. The infection rate was 3.8%. Eosinophilia was diagnosed when eosinophils accounted for 8% or more of the total CSF white blood cell count. Ventricular CSF eosinophilia occurred in 36 patients sometime during their clinical course. These 36 patients required a mean of 8.5 shunt revisions, while the remaining patients required a mean of 2.5 revisions (p less than 0.001). Shunt infections were also more frequent in patients with eosinophilia (p less than 0.01). In no case was peripheral eosinophilia or a parasitic infection present. This study demonstrates that CSF eosinophilia is common in children with shunts. Children with this laboratory finding will experience more shunt failures. In addition, the new appearance of eosinophilia in the CSF of a patient with a shunt in place suggests the possibility of a shunt infection. 
Transfer of genetic epilepsy by embryonic brain grafts in the chicken. In the Fayoumi chicken, a spontaneous recessive autosomal mutation (F.Epi) is responsible for high susceptibility to seizures that are especially inducible by intermittent light stimulation. Substitution of defined areas of the encephalic neuroepithelium in normal chicken embryos at 2 days of incubation by their counterparts from homozygous F.Epi embryos generates the epileptic phenotype in the chimeras. It was found that grafting primordia of both prosencephalon and mesencephalon of homozygous F.Epi birds is necessary and sufficient for transfer of the full disease. When grafted alone, the homozygous F.Epi prosencephalon, although showing the typical epileptic interictal electroencephalogram, does not allow the complete epileptic seizures to occur in the hosts. Grafts of mesencephalon and/or rhombencephalon modify neither the behavior nor the electroencephalographic pattern of the recipient chickens. Cooperation of forebrain and midbrain activities is therefore required to yield epileptic seizures in this model. 
Vascular complications of cardiac catheterization. Femoral artery injury after diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterization is a frequently encountered clinical problem. This study reviews 150 femoral artery injuries that occurred in 16,350 patients over a 5-year period. A prospective computerized cardiac catheterization data bank was used to determine significant risk factors associated with the occurrence of vascular injury. Logistic regression analysis revealed that congestive heart failure, female gender, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or valvuloplasty procedure were significantly associated with occurrence of vascular injury. Greater age, smaller body surface area, and smaller weight were also associated with injury. Recommendations for management include an aggressive approach to obstruction even if local vascular reconstruction is required. False aneurysms are studied by ultrasonography, and small ones may be observed expectantly. Larger aneurysms and aneurysms that persist beyond a few days are managed by use of general or regional anesthesia and by gaining proximal control of the iliac artery. Arteriovenous fistulas resulting from catheterization are rarely hemodynamically significant and often close spontaneously. Thus repair should be delayed. 
Study of the seminal vesicles in acute epididymitis. Although it has been suggested that seminal vesiculitis is present in patients with epididymitis, it has not been proven. We performed rectal ultrasound assessment of the seminal vesicles in 18 consecutive patients with epididymitis. The seminal vesicles on the same side as the epididymitis was significantly enlarged in 75% of cases; 92% of these enlarged vesicles returned to normal size in 12 weeks. A persistently enlarged seminal vesicle was associated with unresolved epididymitis, and further bacteriological studies in these cases demonstrated continued Chlamydia infection in some patients over 35 years of age. 
Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis B screening in a mental health institution. In 1982, the Ohio Department of Health Screening established guidelines for hepatitis B screening and vaccination for intermediate mental health care facilities. The present study was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these guidelines. Data from an intermediate mental health care institution in Champaign/Urbana, Illinois, were used. The analysis considered the direct costs and benefits accrued over a 3-year period and a range of transmission rates. At a 3-year transmission rate of 0.030, the screening and vaccination policy cost $7300 per case of hepatitis B avoided (or $345,800 per hepatitis B fatality avoided). At a more likely 3-year transmission rate of 0.271, the screening and vaccination policy cost $300 per case of hepatitis B avoided (or $12,100 per hepatitis B fatality avoided). Either way, the active prevention policy compares very well with the amounts of money spent by the US Government on other life-saving programs. A general cost-effectiveness model is given that can be adapted for institution-specific analyses at other mental health care facilities. 
Is the pressure rate quotient a predictor or indicator of myocardial ischemia as measured by ST-segment changes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery? Perioperative myocardial ischemia is associated with an increased risk of perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI). Several attempts have been made to define intraoperative hemodynamic predictors of myocardial ischemia. In a canine preparation with coronary stenosis, a pressure rate quotient (PRQ = mean arterial pressure/heart rate) less than one (PRQ less than 1) indicated subendocardial myocardial ischemia. The authors tested this hypothesis in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft operation (CABG), using electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-segment changes (leads II/V5) to diagnose myocardial ischemia. Sixty (n = 60) patients having CABG surgery were prospectively studied before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Calibrated ECG leads II and V5 (diagnostic mode) were monitored continuously and recorded with the use of a Hewlett-Packard computer ST-segment analyzer. In addition, arterial and pulmonary artery pressures were monitored. Ischemia was defined as new-onset ST deviation (greater than or equal to 1 mm from the baseline ECG). ECG and hemodynamic data were stored at 2-min intervals for subsequent computer analysis. Serial creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) X MB (%) determinations and 12-lead ECGs were collected for the initial 3 postoperative days. Of the 3,463 intervals (2 min) available for study, 3,322 (96%) were satisfactorily recorded for 60 patients. Ischemia occurred during 65 intervals in 9 patients (9 of 60), of which only 34% (22 of 65) were associated with a PRQ less than 1 (P less than 0.01). In contrast, there were 466 intervals during which PRQ was less than 1, but without ECG evidence of ischemia. 
An evaluation of multiple clinical variables for hypoxia during colonoscopy. One hundred consecutive patients undergoing routine colonoscopy were evaluated for changes in arterial oxygen saturation levels. All of the patients were monitored with the Nellcor N-200 pulse oximeter (Nellcor Incorporated) by finger probe and received supplemental oxygen when SaO2 levels decreased below 90 per cent. Forty patients demonstrated a decrease in SaO2 to less than 90 per cent after intravenous sedation but prior to colonoscopy, 14 patients demonstrated a decrease in SaO2 to less than 90 per cent during colonoscopy, and 46 patients maintained SaO2 levels greater than 90 per cent at all times. No statistical differences were found when these three groups were compared for age, body surface area, drug dosage, smoking history and a history of pre-existing hypertension, diabetes, arrhythmias, angina or myocardial infarction and pulmonary disease. These data indicate that all patients undergoing colonoscopy should be placed on supplemental oxygen. We further recommend continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring when available. 
Solvent-associated olfactory dysfunction: not a predictor of deficits in learning and memory. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate associations between olfactory dysfunction and aberrations in learning and memory after chronic occupational exposure to mixed hydrocarbon solvents. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional, epidemiologic study of 187 paint manufacturing workers. The authors administered quantitative tests of olfactory function (the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) and neurobehavioral function (eight computer- and examiner-administered tests of learning and memory) to workers for whom detailed information was available on lifetime occupational exposure to solvents. RESULTS: Olfactory function test scores were positively correlated with performance on seven of eight of the tests of learning and memory in bivariate analyses. After adjustment for important confounding variables (i.e., age, vocabulary score, and cumulative exposure to hydrocarbon solvents) with multiple linear regression, olfactory function scores predicted performance only on the Wechsler Memory Scale Delayed Logical Memory test. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the data did not reveal that olfactory dysfunction was correlated with decrements in various memory functions. 
Dysplastic nevi as risk markers of sporadic (nonfamilial) melanoma. A case-control study. The melanoma risk associated with dysplastic nevi outside the context of familial melanoma was studied by the case-control method. One hundred five newly diagnosed incident melanoma cases with negative family histories for familial melanoma and 181 controls (frequency matched for race, age, and sex) were studied by personal interview and cutaneous examination. The prevalence of dysplastic nevi was 41 (39%) of 105 in the cases and 13 (7%) of 181 in the controls. The odds ratio for dysplastic nevi by multiple logistic regression analysis simultaneously correcting for age, sex, eye color, hair color, actinic damage, freckles, and total number of nondysplastic nevi was 6.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.7, 16.9). This study supports the significance of dysplastic nevi as markers of increased risk for nonfamilial melanoma. 
Experience in the surgical treatment of 331 patients with pulmonary hydatidosis. Echinococcus disease is prevalent in Chile, with a rate of occurrence of 8.2 per 100,000. During a 15-year-period (1970 to 1985) we operated on 331 patients for pulmonary hydatidosis. Chest roentgenography was the main method of diagnosis. Among the total of 508 surgical procedures performed, pulmonary cystectomy was the most common (61.4%), whereas pulmonary resection was used in 31.4% of patients. The arc 5 test was used to confirm the diagnosis. Results were positive in 85% of the patients in whom it was done. There were 12.9% immediate postoperative complications in 12.9%, with late complications occurring in 4.10% and an overall mortality rate of 4.21%. These data suggest that hydatid cyst is still a common disease in our country, causing an important number of hospital admissions and a high percentage of complications. 
Devine exclusion for unresectable carcinoma of the stomach. Between July 1986 and July 1988, Devine exclusion was performed in 20 patients with unresectable carcinoma of the gastric antrum. All 20 patients presented with repeated vomiting. On endoscopy, 16 patients had complete gastric outlet obstruction while the remainder manifested significant gastric outlet stenosis. There was no hospital mortality. All except two patients could take an oral diet after surgery until their demise. Devine exclusion is safe and effective in relieving gastric outlet obstruction and is not associated with prolonged delay in return of gastric emptying. 
Neurologic disorders and dermatologic manifestations in HIV-infected children. Cutaneous manifestations of HIV infections in childhood are common but are not the dermatologic lesions associated with HIV infection in adults. For example, Kaposi's sarcoma, a common finding in adults with AIDS, is rare in children. Other cutaneous manifestations, including bacterial and fungal lesions and viral exanthems, are common in children with AIDS and can be atypical and severe. Because 90% of the pediatric AIDS population acquires the virus via maternal transmission to the fetus, a dysmorphic syndrome associated with intrauterine infection has been described. Physicians caring for and evaluating pediatric patients at risk for AIDS should be aware of these dermatologic manifestations, so that early detection and treatment can be instituted to reduce the morbidity of the complication of HIV infection. 
Double-outlet right ventricle: morphologic demonstration using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Sixteen patients with double-outlet right ventricle, aged 1 week to 29 years (median 5 months), were studied with a 1.5 tesla nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging scanner. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in all patients. Thirteen patients underwent angiography, including nine who underwent subsequent surgical correction. Three patients underwent postmortem examination. Small children and infants were scanned inside a 32 cm diameter proton head coil. Multiple 5 mm thick sections separated by 0.5 mm and gated to the patient's electrocardiogram were acquired with a spin-echo sequence and an echo time of 30 ms. A combination of standard and oblique imaging planes was used. Imaging times were less than 90 min. The NMR images were technically unsuitable in one patient because of excessive motion artifact. In the remaining patients, the diagnosis of double outlet right ventricle was confirmed and correlated with surgical and postmortem findings. The NMR images were particularly valuable in demonstrating the interrelations between the great arteries and the anatomy of the outlet septum and the spatial relations between the ventricular septal defect and the great arteries. Although the atrioventricular (AV) valves were not consistently demonstrated, NMR imaging in two patients identified abnormalities of the mitral valve that were not seen with two-dimensional echocardiography. In one patient who had a superoinferior arrangement of the ventricles, NMR imaging was the most useful imaging technique for demonstrating the anatomy. In patients with double-outlet right ventricle, NMR imaging can provide clinically relevant and accurate morphologic information that may contribute to future improvement in patient management. 
Nerve growth factor rapidly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 by a kinase activity associated with the product of the trk protooncogene. Nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes the survival and differentiation of specific populations of neurons. The molecular mechanisms by which cells respond to NGF are poorly understood, but two clues have emerged recently. First, NGF rapidly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of several unidentified proteins in the NGF-responsive pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 [Maher, P. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 6788-6791]. Second, the protein-tyrosine kinase encoded by the protooncogene trk (p140trk), a member of the receptor class of tyrosine kinases, becomes activated and phosphorylated on tyrosine after NGF treatment of PC12 cells [Kaplan, D. R., Martin-Zanca, D. & Parada, L. F. (1991) Nature (London) 350, 158-160]. We now report that NGF rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1), and we present evidence that the responsible tyrosine kinase is either p140trk or a closely associated protein. Treatment of responsive cells with NGF elicited phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 on tyrosine and serine. PLC-gamma 1 immunoprecipitated from NGF-stimulated cells was phosphorylated in vitro by coprecipitating protein kinase activity, and the phosphorylations occurred principally on tyrosine. The responsible kinase could be depleted from cellular lysates by antibodies specific for p140trk. This procedure also depleted a 140-kDa protein that normally coprecipitated with PLC-gamma 1 and became phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo in response to NGF. Analysis of tryptic peptides from PLC-gamma 1 indicated that the residues phosphorylated in vitro by p140trk-associated kinase activity were largely congruent with those phosphorylated in vivo after NGF treatment. Our findings identify PLC-gamma 1 as a likely substrate for the trk-encoded tyrosine kinase, and they provide a link between NGF-dependent activation of p140trk and the stimulation of intracellular second messenger pathways. 
Genetic basis for p53 overexpression in human breast cancer. Overexpression of an activated form of the p53 protein may be involved in neoplastic transformation. We found widespread overexpression of p53 by immunohistochemical staining in 11 (22%) of 49 primary invasive human breast cancers. Northern blot analysis showed that this overexpression was not due to an increase in the steady-state level of p53 mRNA. The p53 gene was directly sequenced in 7 of these tumors with elevated levels of the protein and, in each case, a mutation that altered the coding sequence for p53 was found in a highly conserved region of the gene. Whereas 4 of these tumors contained only a mutant p53 allele, the other 3 tumors exhibited coding sequences from both a mutant and a wild-type allele. p53 mutations have previously been correlated with allelic loss of part of chromosome 17p that contains the p53 locus. Examination of all 49 breast tumors revealed a 61% frequency of deletion at or near the p53 locus. However, the presence of allelic deletion did not correlate with overexpression of the protein. Six tumors that were deleted but did not express high levels of the protein were sequenced and all retained a wild-type p53 allele. In this series of human breast cancers, overexpression of the p53 protein, not allelic loss on chromosome 17p, was always associated with mutation of the p53 gene. 
Long-term follow-up after sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: Causes, pump failure, and empiric antiarrhythmic therapy that modify survival. We analyzed the actuarial cardiac mortality rate of 295 consecutive patients with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia who were referred to us between 1978 and 1988. Patients were divided into four groups: group I of 156 patients with coronary disease, group II of 55 patients with nonischemic left ventricular disease, group III of 65 patients with right ventricular disease, and group IV of 19 patients without detectable heart disease. Patients were treated empirically according to a prospective schema: (1) class I antiarrhythmic drugs, (2) in case of recurrence of ventricular tachycardia: amiodarone or beta-blockers, (3) in case of recurrence of ventricular tachycardia: drug combinations or surgery. The mean follow-up duration was 61 +/- 40 months after the first occurrence of ventricular tachycardia, and the clinical outcome was known in 67.5% of patients at 5 years. The actuarial mortality rates were considerably higher in groups I and II compared with those in groups III and IV (p less than 0.01). The mortality rate was slightly higher in group I than in group II (p less than 0.05). In groups I and II, actuarial mortality rate were much higher when left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 0.30 (p less than 0.01). Comparisons between treatments showed no difference in actuarial mortality rates in patients with ventricular tachycardia and left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 0.30. 
WT1 mutations contribute to abnormal genital system development and hereditary Wilms' tumour. Wilms' tumour (WT), aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities and mental retardation form a symptom group (WAGR syndrome) associated with hemizygous deletions of DNA in chromosome band 11p13 (refs 1,2). However, it has not been clear whether hemizygosity at a single locus contributes to more than one phenotype. The tumour suppressor gene for Wilms' tumour, WT1, has been characterized: it is expressed at high levels in the glomeruli of the kidney, as well as the gonadal ridge of the developing gonad, the Sertoli cells of the testis and the epithelial and granulosa cells of the ovary, suggesting a developmental role in the genital system in addition to the kidney. We now report constitutional mutations within the WT1 genes of two individuals with a combination of WT and genital abnormalities as evidence of a role for a recessive oncogene in mammalian development. 
Treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia in a renal allograft recipient: implications of cyclosporin immunosuppressive treatment. The clinical effects of cyclosporin were evaluated during cytotoxic treatment in a 61 year old man with acute myeloid leukaemia. He had required a renal transplant 18 months before presenting with acute myeloid leukaemia (FAB subtype M4). He had received cyclosporin 3.5-4.0 mg/kg daily to maintain a plasma cyclosporin concentration of 75-150 ng/ml. Cyclosporin was continued during induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin, cytarabine, and 6-thioguanine (DAT). He had fever and oropharyngeal candidiasis that was unresponsive to anti-bacterial drugs but responsive to systemic amphotericin. Bone marrow examination 14 days after chemotherapy showed complete haematological remission. Subsequently he tolerated consolidation treatment with DAT with no serious complications. Unfortunately he developed fatal septicaemia following a second consolidation with mitozantrone and cytarabine. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity by cyclosporin may not significantly increase the toxicity of aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens, and as benefit may be achieved by this approach further clinical evaluation is justified. 
The detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in HBsAG negative individuals with primary liver cancer. The importance of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the development of primary liver cancer has been established by epidemiological studies. However, the evidence for a direct role of the virus in liver carcinogenesis is still tentative. In addition, the findings of HBV DNA sequences in HBsAg-negative subjects with liver cancer has been reported, although it is controversial. Here we report the use of the polymerase chain reaction to detect HBV DNA in the serum and liver of HBsAg-negative patients. This technique allows both for the detection and cloning of HBV variants. In addition, the demonstration of HBV DNA and RNA molecules in HCC of HBsAg-negative individuals as determined by standard techniques reinforces the role of HBV in the pathogenesis of this tumor. 
Mycotic aortic aneurysm infected by Clostridium septicum--a case history. The authors describe a sixty-seven-year-old hypertensive, diabetic man with a mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm infected with Clostridium septicum. The patient had colonic polyps but no malignant disease. They could find only one other report of a mycotic aneurysm infected with C. septicum. In that case, as in most other cases of C. septicum bacteremia, the patient had gastrointestinal cancer. Their case suggests that treatment for a clostridial infection should be considered in patients with known gastrointestinal disease, signs and symptoms of sepsis, and abdominal pain. Conversely, patients known to have a C. septicum infection should be evaluated for gastrointestinal lesions. 
Hormonal and local factors in hypertension. The cause of primary (essential) hypertension remains unknown, but a number of circulating hormones and endothelium-derived factors are probably involved. This review summarizes recent evidence on the roles of hyperinsulinemia, the renin-angiotensin system, atrial natriuretic factor, and three endothelium-derived factors--prostacyclin, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and endothelin. 
Cauda equina compression associated with breast cancer. A case study in differential diagnosis. The determination of the etiology of spinal cord compression in cancer patients is essential for appropriate therapy. Patients with metastatic disease are not immune to the development of superimposed nonmalignant disease. Although metastatic epidural compression may occur in up to 9% of breast cancer patients, care must be taken to rule out other nonmetastatic lesions causing compression. The association of concurrent breast carcinoma and a spinal neurilemoma simulating a metastatic lesion seems not to have been previously reported. A neurilemoma was observed in a 50-year-old woman. A neurilemoma suspected to be a metastatic lesion may produce the clinical features of pain, neurologic deficit, and weakness. Differentiation will be aided by roentgenograms, radionuclide bone scans, computed tomography, and possible magnetic resonance imaging. Radiologic differentiation hinges on the recognition and the slow-growing nature and noninvasive boundaries of the nonmalignant lesion. Ultimate verification is by biopsy. Treatment should consist of neurectomy, if severely symptomatic, and stabilization as indicated. 
Invasive cervical carcinoma: MR imaging after preoperative chemotherapy. To evaluate assessment of tumor regression with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, the authors studied 21 consecutive patients with cervical carcinoma tumors that were more than 3 cm in diameter. Thirteen of the 21 also demonstrated parametrial invasion. In all cases, MR imaging was performed both before and after chemotherapy. Pathologic specimens were obtained at hysterectomy in all patients. Comparison of pathologic and MR imaging findings after chemotherapy showed that all tumors decreased in size. Size of tumor was correctly determined at MR in 17 cases and was slightly overestimated in four cases. Five patients had residual parametrial invasion that was histologically confirmed. In detecting parametrial spread after treatment, MR imaging had an accuracy of 90.4%. Tumors had high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, whereas intratumoral necrosis was characterized by low signal intensity on the same images. Peritumoral inflammatory tissue found at pathologic examination in four of 21 cases was not specifically identified on MR images. In patients with invasive cervical carcinoma, MR imaging may be useful in evaluating tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy. 
Heterotopic heart transplantation and native heart ventricular arrhythmias. Heterotopic heart transplantation has been said to be contraindicated in patients with serious native heart arrhythmias that produce hemodynamic instability. Placement of heterotopic allografts, however, can theoretically act as a biological biventricular assist device to provide hemodynamic support during these unstable rhythms. Further, this operation might beneficially alter the hemodynamic milieu of heart failure such that the arrhythmias are ameliorated. Described is our experience with 4 patients with heart failure receiving heterotopic cardiac allografts, documenting changes in native heart arrhythmia that occurred. These cases demonstrate that heterotopic grafts can adequately sustain hemodynamics during malignant native heart dysrhythmia. We believe native heart ventricular arrhythmias are not a contraindication to heterotopic heart transplantation. 
Calves as a source of an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis among young children in an agricultural closed community. Transmission of Cryptosporidium from animals to humans, originating mainly in calves, had been suggested previously but has remained unproved. An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis that started among calves was transmitted to multiple pediatric groups living in close contact through one family who had close contact with the calves. Eleven of 19 (58%) infants and young children ages 10 to 15 months had Cryptosporidium compared with 3 of 27 (11%) of those ages 36 to 60 months and none of those ages 16 to 35 months. None of the asymptomatic children was positive for Cryptosporidium. These data emphasize that an extensive human to human transmission does not rule out the zoonotic nature of cryptosporidiosis. 
Hereditary coproporphyria: an imitator of multiple sclerosis. Hereditary coproporphyria can cause both peripheral neuropathy and central nervous system abnormalities. There are several similarities between multiple sclerosis and hereditary coproporphyria that are probably due to the central nervous system dysfunction present in both. This report describes a 62-year-old man with a five-year history of progressive paraparesis initially diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. Supporting evidence for the diagnosis of a demyelinating disease included three oligoclonal bands in the patient's cerebral spinal fluid, a prolonged visual evoked response bilaterally, abnormal sensory evoked potentials, and an area of increased signal in the posterior cervical cord suggestive of demyelination that was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Features atypical for multiple sclerosis were hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes, electromyographic evidence of peripheral neuropathy, and severe constipation. Elevated urine porphyrins and decreased levels of coproporphyrinogen oxidase confirmed the correct diagnosis of hereditary coproporphyria. The patient improved after being placed on a high-carbohydrate diet. Although central demyelination is known to occur in patients with porphyria, delayed evoked potentials and MRI abnormalities have not been previously reported. 
Clofazimine: a review of its use in leprosy and Mycobacterium avium complex infection. This article reviews the chemistry, pharmacology, spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy in leprosy and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, adverse effects, drug interactions, and special considerations of clofazimine. The drug is active in vivo against M. leprae and in vitro against MAC. In addition, it possesses antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Clinical studies support the efficacy of clofazimine as a part of multidrug therapy in treating leprosy. It also appears to reduce the incidence and severity of erythema nodosum leprosum reactions that often occur during the treatment of leprosy. Efficacy in treating MAC infection in patients with AIDS is not well documented, despite the use of clofazimine in combination with other agents. A few patients have responded symptomatically and by clearing their mycobacteremia, although there is no evidence that mortality is reduced. Clofazimine is well tolerated, at least when doses less than or equal to 100 mg/d are used. Adverse reactions include discoloration of the skin, self-limiting gastrointestinal intolerance, severe and life-threatening abdominal pain and organ damage due to clofazimine crystal deposition, and asymptomatic discoloration of the eye. Clofazimine should be considered for formulary inclusion. 
Intraoperative radiotherapy of skull base cancer. As the head and neck surgeon expands the boundaries of resectability into the skull base, the margin of tumor clearance diminishes. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) can be used as an adjunct to skull base surgery and external beam radiation to enhance local control in areas with close margins or remaining microscopic disease. During the period from May 1982 to May 1988, 25 patients underwent IORT of the skull base following resection and prior to closure to treat microscopic disease in 9 patients, sterilize close margins in 14 patients, and attempt to eliminate remaining gross disease in 2 patients. The types of tumors treated were 13 squamous cell carcinomas, 4 adenoid cystic carcinomas, 3 high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas, 3 sarcomas, 1 malignant mixed tumor, and an oncocytic adenocarcinoma. The majority of the tumors either originated in the sinuses or were skull base extensions of oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancers. In 22 patients with 1-year follow-up, IORT prevented local recurrence in 14 (64%) patients. This may represent improved control of local disease in patients who historically have a very dismal prognosis. The indications, techniques, and complications of this exciting therapeutic modality are also reviewed. 
Prevention of postoperative renal dysfunction in patients with obstructive jaundice: a multicentre study of bile salts and lactulose. The role of preoperative lactulose and bile salts in the prevention of postoperative renal failure in patients with obstructive jaundice has been evaluated in a prospective randomized trial. One hundred and two patients undergoing surgery for obstructive jaundice (bilirubin greater than 100 mumols/l) were randomized into three groups: those receiving preoperative oral lactulose (n = 35), those receiving oral sodium deoxycholate (n = 32) and a control group of patients receiving no specific treatment (n = 35). All patients received intravenous fluids commencing the night before surgery. One patient in the control group and none in the treatment groups developed postoperative renal failure. Postoperative deterioration of renal function in patients with normal preoperative function was significantly more common in the control group than in the treatment groups (chi 2 = 8.1, d.f. = 2, P less than 0.02). The incidence of renal failure and impairment was lower in this control group than that reported in previous studies. This may be due to the introduction of adequate preoperative hydration. Additional protection occurs by the preoperative administration of either lactulose or sodium deoxycholate. 
Nonepileptic events in childhood. The medical records of 27 children admitted to the MINCEP Epilepsy Program for evaluation of intractable epilepsy but later shown to have nonepileptic events by EEG with simultaneous video monitoring were reviewed. Four groups were identified: pure psychogenic events (5 patients), psychogenic events plus epileptic seizures (3 patients), pure nonepileptic physiologic events (5 patients), and nonepileptic physiologic events plus seizures (14 patients). Historical data, physical examinations, and neurodiagnostic evaluations (including previous EEGs, neuroradiologic evaluations, and neuropsychologic testing) were reviewed. Children in all groups, except for those with pure psychogenic seizures, had a history of multiple seizure types identified by parents or caretakers. A history of status epilepticus was obtained in 64% (of 22 patients), including 11 of 14 patients with physiologic events plus seizures. Abnormal findings on neurologic examination were common, especially in children with nonepileptic physiologic events. All but two patients had a history of interictal epileptiform abnormalities on previous routine EEGs. Based on identification of nonepileptic events, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were discontinued completely in eight patients (30%) and the total number of AEDs was reduced in nine others (33%). A diagnosis of nonepileptic events should be considered in all children with refractory seizures or multiple seizure types. Abnormal findings on routine (interictal) EEG may actually confound the diagnosis. Intensive neurodiagnostic EEG-video recording is the preferred method for distinguishing nonepileptic from epileptic seizures. 
Cardiovascular effects of bupropion in depressed patients with heart disease. OBJECTIVE: The cardiovascular effects of therapeutic plasma levels of tricyclic antidepressants in depressed patients with and without preexisting cardiac disease have been well characterized and include orthostatic hypotension and conduction delay. Bupropion, structurally unrelated to tricyclic antidepressants, is relatively free of cardiac side effects in depressed patients without cardiac disease. However, it is unknown whether bupropion is safe for depressed patients with preexisting heart disease, so the authors studied the cardiovascular effects of bupropion in such patients. METHOD: The subjects were 36 inpatients with DSM-III major depression and preexisting left ventricular impairment (N = 15), ventricular arrhythmias (N = 15), and/or conduction disease (N = 21). The patients continued their cardiac drug regimens and received bupropion for 3 weeks (mean +/- SD dose = 442 +/- 47 mg/day). Cardiovascular functioning was measured by pulse, blood pressure, high-speed ECG, 24-hour portable ECG, and radionuclide angiography. RESULTS: Although bupropion caused a rise in supine blood pressure, it did not cause significant conduction complications, did not exacerbate ventricular arrhythmias, had a low rate of orthostatic hypotension, and had no effect on pulse rate. However, bupropion treatment was discontinued for 14% of the patients because of adverse effects, including exacerbation of baseline hypertension in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: The cardiovascular profile of bupropion may make this drug a useful agent in the treatment of the depressed patient with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Further studies, with longer durations of bupropion treatment and more subjects, are needed to confirm these findings. 
Hemolytic reactions to nitrofurantoin in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: theory and practice. The prescribing information for nitrofurantoin states that patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may experience hemolysis following administration of the drug. Although there is no doubt that this statement is qualitatively correct, the degree of risk in the general population of patients has not been previously quantified. This study was designed to estimate the degree of risk of a clinically important hemolytic reaction to nitrofurantoin by means of a retrospective analysis of the Norwich Eaton adverse reaction database. Since 1953, approximately 130 million courses of nitrofurantoin therapy have been distributed in the U.S. alone. The database contained 127 reports of hemolytic reactions; a "worst-case" estimate of the incidence rate was 1 in 100,000 courses of therapy. Considering the extensive usage of nitrofurantoin, clinically important hemolytic reactions appeared to be very rare. For the cases in which outcome was recorded, complete recovery occurred in 87 percent of patients. Although nitrofurantoin is contraindicated after the onset of labor and in infants less than one month old, no well-documented cases of hemolytic reactions in neonates were identified. 
Current issues in the performance of Mohs micrographic surgery. Recently, a survey was sent to all members of the American College of Mohs Micrographic Surgery and Cutaneous Oncology concerning their performance of Mohs micrographic surgery. Responses to numerous questions regarding the daily practice of this technique revealed that many useful modifications have evolved over the years that serve to enhance the efficacy and the efficiency of the original Mohs surgical procedure. The results of this survey are presented and discussed. 
Ewing's sarcoma: metastatic tumor to the jaw. Metastatic tumors to the jaw are a rare occurrence. The incidence of metastatic Ewing's sarcoma to the jaw has been reported to be less than 2% of all cases of Ewing's sarcoma. Early detection of such lesions is difficult because the signs and symptoms do not appear until the lesion has progressed considerably. The treatment options are therefore limited to palliative care of the patient rather than cure. This article reports a case of Ewing's sarcoma that had metastasized to the mandible and reviews the literature. 
Cause of death in patients attending multiple sclerosis clinics. Between 1972 and 1988, 145 deaths occurred among 3,126 patients attending the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Clinics in Vancouver, British Columbia (N = 1,583), and London, Ontario (N = 1,543). We could determine the exact cause of death in 82.1% of cases (119 of 145). Of the 119 patients for whom the cause of death was known, 56 deaths (47.1%) were directly attributed to complications of MS. Of the remaining 63 deaths, 18 (28.6%) were suicides, 19 (30.2%) were due to malignancy, 13 (20.6%) to an acute myocardial infarction, seven (11.1%) to stroke, and the remainder (9.5%) to miscellaneous causes, of which two may have been suicides. The proportion of suicides among MS deaths was 7.5 times that for the age-matched general population, and the proportion of MS deaths from malignancy was 0.67 times that for the age-matched general population. The proportion of deaths due to malignancy and stroke was the same for the MS patients and the age-matched general population. 
Non-neoplastic pineal cysts. We identified 53 patients with non-neoplastic cysts of the pineal gland. In contrast to patients with pineal neoplasms, pineal cysts are usually asymptomatic. They infrequently obstruct the aqueduct to cause hydrocephalus or compress the tectum to produce the neuro-ophthalmologic signs of dorsal midbrain dysfunction. Obstructive hydrocephalus was present in only five patients (9.4%); three of them showed clinical signs of Parinaud's syndrome. CT and MRI typically reveal a cystic mass that averages 1.6 cm in anteroposterior (A-P) diameter with calcification at the periphery and faint rim-like contrast enhancement. Sagittal MRI is the most useful diagnostic test because it shows the anatomic relationship of the cyst to the aqueduct. The mass may compress the tectum and distort the proximal aqueduct; occasionally a large cyst may occlude the aqueduct. All patients with obstructive hydrocephalus had cysts greater than 2.0 cm in A-P diameter. Nine patients had suboccipital craniotomy. In all of them, the cysts contained clear fluid and were easily removed. We advocate conservative management with clinical observation of these benign lesions that may be developmental variants of normal pineal gland. 
Imipenem/cilastatin treatment of bacterial meningitis in children. The safety and efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin were evaluated in 21 children, ages 3 to 48 months, with bacterial meningitis. Eradication of bacteria from the cerebrospinal fluid was demonstrated within 24 hours of antibiotic therapy in all but 2 patients who had Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis and ultimately achieved bacteriologic cure after 2 to 3 days of imipenem/cilastatin therapy. Cerebrospinal fluid penetrations of imipenem and cilastatin were determined at various times after drug administration with mean cerebrospinal fluid: serum ratios of 14 and 10% for imipenem and cilastatin, respectively. The study was terminated when 7 (33%) patients developed seizure activity after antibiotic therapy was administered. The usefulness of imipenem/cilastatin for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in children may be limited by a possible increased incidence of drug-related seizure activity. 
Reversal of benzodiazepine sedation with the antagonist flumazenil. The effectiveness of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, was evaluated in a randomized double-blind clinical study in which diazepam 0.2 mg kg-1 or midazolam 0.1 mg kg-1 was used for i.v. sedation. We studied 120 day-case patients undergoing gastroscopy and treated with either flumazenil 0.1-2 mg or placebo after the procedure. Psychometric assessment of four aspects of recovery over a 3-h period showed that flumazenil attenuated the sedative effects of the benzodiazepines, but did not antagonize the sedation completely. For patients sedated with diazepam, there was a significant effect of flumazenil on speed of motor co-ordination after 90 min (P less than 0.01), and for those given midazolam a similar effect was found at 20 min (P less than 0.01). However, after 3 h all four groups of patients had not returned to baseline performance in accuracy of motor co-ordination (P less than 0.01) and cortical arousal (P less than 0.05), and the two groups sedated with diazepam still displayed memory deficits (P less than 0.05). Flumazenil did not attenuate the subjective experience of sedation as measured by visual analogue scales. These results indicate that sedation is multidimensional, differentially affecting the hierarchy of cognitive functions. In day-cases, antagonism of benzodiazepine sedation with flumazenil would not hasten the safe discharge of patients. 
Laceration of the left pulmonary artery during removal of a bronchogenic cyst by right thoracotomy. Major vascular involvement by a bronchogenic cyst is rare; most large cysts cause respiratory symptoms. We present a case in which a large bronchogenic cyst was adherent to the left pulmonary artery. During removal of the cyst by right thoracotomy, the artery lacerated. Repair of the artery in such a situation taxes the surgeon's ingenuity and decision-making process. 
Facilitated referral to asthma specialist reduces relapses in asthma emergency room visits. Facilitated asthma-specialist care delivered by allergists was compared to generalist care on the rate of relapse of asthma emergency room (ER) visits and hospitalizations and on asthma control in a prospective, controlled study of San Diego Kaiser Health Plan members with asthma. Subjects with asthma between the ages of 6 and 59 years presenting for acute ER care for asthma were systematically assigned by alternating, consecutively, the day of their ER visit to receive either (1) facilitated referral to an asthma specialist within the allergy department and concomitant comprehensive ongoing asthma care (intervention group, n = 149) or (2) continued outpatient management from generalist physicians (control group, n = 160). The course of their asthma was evaluated blindly during the subsequent 6 months by review of medical records, initial and follow-up questionnaires, and spirometry. Compared to the control group, the intervention group noted (1) a 75% reduction in the number of, and percent of, subjects with asthma awakenings per night (p less than or equal to 0.0001), (2) an almost 50% reduction in asthma ER relapses (p = 0.017) resulting from a reduction in the frequency of multiple relapse (p = 0.005), and (3) a greater use of inhaled corticosteroids (p less than 0.00001) and cromolyn (p = 0.002). Thus, facilitated referral of subjects with asthma to specialists in asthma therapy after acute ER therapy appears to reduce asthma ER relapses and to improve asthma outcome. 
Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring: the most useful test for evaluating noncardiac chest pain. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic capabilities of traditional esophageal tests (manometry and provocative testing with acid and edrophonium) and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring in identifying an esophageal cause of chest pain. DESIGN: A prospective study of 100 consecutive patients referred by cardiologists to the esophageal laboratory for evaluation of esophageal causes of chest pain. SETTING: Tertiary-referral university hospital. METHODS: Esophageal manometry performed with 10 wet swallows of water. Acid perfusion (0.1 N hydrochloric acid) and edrophonium (80 micrograms/kg intravenously) tests were placebo-controlled with a positive study defined as replication of typical chest pain. Esophageal pH monitoring identified (1) abnormal acid exposure times in the upright, supine, or combined position, and (2) correlation between symptoms and acid reflux, i.e., symptom index. The esophagus was identified as "probably" contributing to chest pain only if the acid or edrophonium test was positive or if there was a positive correlation between symptoms and acid reflux during pH monitoring. RESULTS: Esophageal manometry was abnormal in 32 patients (32%), but patients were asymptomatic during the study. The acid perfusion test was positive in 18 of 95 patients (19%), and the edrophonium test was positive in 15 of 78 patients (19%). Abnormal acid exposure times were found in 48 patients (48%). Of the 83 patients with spontaneous chest pain during 24-hour pH testing, 37 patients (46%) had abnormal reflux parameters and 50 patients (60%) had a positive symptom index (mean positive score 56%, range 6% to 100%). CONCLUSIONS: Acid reflux is a common and potentially treatable cause of noncardiac chest pain. Traditional esophageal tests usually miss this diagnosis. Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring with symptom correlation is the single best test for evaluating patients with noncardiac chest pain. 
Vascular injury: mechanisms and manifestations. Abnormalities in regulatory mechanisms for calcium handling play a key role in cell death and tissue necrosis. In the cardiovascular system this applies to the vasculature and the myocardium alike. In the aged population, where hypertension is a known risk factor, manifestations of vascular injury include atherogenesis and stroke. The newly developed dihydropyridine-based calcium antagonist amlodipine was used in investigations to determine whether calcium antagonists with sustained activity, in addition to lowering blood pressure, slow the development of atherogenesis in rabbits receiving high cholesterol diets, or reduce mortality in stroke-prone hypertensive rats. To establish whether this drug protects the vasculature against excessive atheroma formation in the presence of high cholesterol intake, rabbits were given 2% cholesterol in addition to their normal food intake and either 0, 1, or 5 mg/kg/day amlodipine orally for either 8 or 12 weeks. One day after the conclusion of the treatment protocol, the thoracic aorta was excised, assayed for calcium or cholesterol concentrations, and stained to identify sudanophilic-positive lesions. Amlodipine caused a time- and dose-dependent reduction in lesion formation, calcium overload, and cholesterol level. In the second series of experiments, amlodipine (5 mg/kg/day) was added to the diets of stroke-prone hypertensive rats. Treatment was initiated at age 5 weeks and continued for 30 weeks. During the treatment period, systolic blood pressure was reduced in the amlodipine-treated rats (166 +/- 9 mm Hg) versus those treated with placebo (248 +/- 12 mm Hg) (p less than 0.001). A significant reduction in mortality was observed in the amlodipine-treated rats (p less than 0.001), with 93% surviving versus only 26% in the placebo group at the end of the 30-week treatment period. Concomitantly, cardiac hypertrophy was attenuated in the treated group compared with the placebo group (heart-to-body weight ratios of 4.5 +/- 0.01 vs 5.8 +/- 0.6, respectively [p less than 0.01]). These results extend the evidence that calcium antagonists provide vascular protection in animal models. This finding may become increasingly important in the management of an aging hypertensive population. 
Serum neuron-specific enolase levels after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We examined serum levels of neuron-specific enolase by enzyme immunoassay in 29 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Serum neuron-specific enolase levels were significantly higher in patients with a poor neurological status than in patients with a good neurological status on admission, and the greater the amount of subarachnoid blood, the higher the serum neuron-specific enolase level. Patients with a good outcome had low serum neuron-specific enolase levels throughout their courses. Serum neuron-specific enolase levels increased with development of delayed ischemic neurological deficits and, especially in poor outcome patients, high levels persisted until 3 weeks after the subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Comparison of propranolol, diltiazem, and nifedipine in the treatment of ambulatory ischemia in patients with stable angina. Differential effects on ambulatory ischemia, exercise performance, and anginal symptoms. The ASIS Study Group Episodes of transient myocardial ischemia during ambulatory activities are common in patients with stable coronary artery disease and who are often asymptomatic. Selection of therapy for episodes of asymptomatic ischemia is limited by a lack of direct comparative studies. To determine the most effective monotherapy for patients with stable angina and a high frequency of asymptomatic ischemic episodes, propranolol-LA (mean daily dose, 293 mg), diltiazem-SR (mean daily dose, 350 mg), nifedipine (mean daily dose, 79 mg) were each compared with placebo, each for 2 weeks, in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover trial. Entry criteria were a positive exercise treadmill test during placebo therapy characterized by 1.0 mm or more ST segment depression and angina pectoris, and six or more episodes of transient ST segment depression of 1.0 mm or more on a 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram. One hundred ninety-four patients were screened, 63 were eligible and received randomized therapy, of which 56 patients completed at least two of the four treatment periods and were included in an intent-to-treat analysis. Fifty patients completed all four treatment phases and were included in the protocol-completed analysis. Anti-ischemia efficacy was assessed by 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, exercise treadmill tests, and anginal diaries. Ninety-four percent of all episodes of ambulatory ischemia were asymptomatic. Compared with placebo, only propranolol was associated with a marked reduction in all manifestations of asymptomatic ischemia during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (2.3 versus 1.0 episodes/24 hr; mean duration of ischemia per 24 hours, 43.6 versus 5.7 minutes; both p less than 0.0001). Diltiazem's reduction of the frequency of episodes compared with placebo (2.3 versus 1.9 episodes/24 hr) was associated with a trend (p = 0.08) in the protocol-completed analysis and with a significant reduction in the intent-to-treat analysis (p = 0.03). Nifedipine had no significant effect on any measured variable of ambulatory ischemia. The dosages of medication used may have been excessive for some patients, and a more beneficial effect may have been evident at a lower dose. In contrast to the marked effects of the active agents on ambulatory asymptomatic ischemia, the effects on exercise performance and angina pectoris were slight. The active agents modestly improved treadmill exercise duration time until 1 mm ST segment depression (3%), and only propranolol and diltiazem had significant effects. Only diltiazem significantly prolonged the total exercise time. Anginal frequency was significantly decreased by both propranolol and diltiazem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Comparative histopathology and deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry of random mucosal biopsies in untreated bladder carcinoma. In a study of 290 patients with untreated carcinoma of the bladder, histopathological studies of random mucosal biopsies were compared with the results of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) flow cytometry. By histopathology the findings were classified as severe atypia corresponding to primary grade 3 carcinoma in situ, atypia not fulfilling the criteria for carcinoma in situ and no atypia. The DNA histograms were classified as diploid or aneuploid. Aneuploid cell populations in mucosal biopsies were found mainly in cases with aneuploid tumors of grade 3. Of the biopsies classified as concomitant carcinoma in situ 76% were aneuploid. In biopsies exhibiting less severe or no atypia aneuploidy was found in 41 and 10%, respectively. For these 3 morphological categories the distributions of the aneuploid cell populations were similar irrespective of the histopathological findings and they were also the same as that found in primary carcinoma in situ. We concluded that gross chromosomal aberrations may appear at an early stage of the tumor development and before changes recognizable by morphology. The similarity of the DNA profiles of the aneuploid cell populations, regardless of morphological findings, indicates that apart from gross chromosomal aberrations changes of the phenotype are necessary for the expression of morphological changes. 
Hypertonic nasogastric tube feedings: do they cause diarrhea? Hypertonic NG tube feeding in hospitalized patients, whether on the hospital ward or in the ICU, is considered a common etiology of diarrhea. To evaluate the accuracy of this assumption, five normal volunteers, ten hospitalized postoperative patients with head and neck cancer, and 24 ICU patients were given hypertonic (690 mosm), low residue, lactose-free tube feedings starting at 30 kcal/kg.day. There was no prior history of diarrhea in any of the groups studied. There was a significant difference in albumin levels between the three groups, with an average albumin of 2.8 g/dl in the ICU patient group; different from 4.5 g/dl present in both the normal volunteer and non-ICU hospitalized patient groups (general linear models procedure from SAS, p less than .05) (Duncan test). Diarrhea was not present in the normal volunteers or non-ICU patients during the feedings, but did occur in 3/24 ICU patients. This difference was not significant. The three patients with diarrhea had an average albumin level of 3.0 g/dl, while the other ICU patients had an average albumin of 2.7 g/dl. We conclude that hypertonic NG tube feedings do not cause diarrhea in normal volunteers or postoperative head and neck cancer patients. However, in a small statistically insignificant percent of mechanically ventilated ICU patients, this regimen may cause diarrhea although no risk factors can be identified. 
Clinical benefits of structural and functional changes with calcium antagonists. Calcium antagonists have a large variety of pharmacologic effects in addition to those exploited clinically. All drugs used in the management of hypertension, including calcium antagonists, are coming under increasing scrutiny for the possible beneficial and adverse effects they may have on the circulation and risk factor profile. This is particularly because of concern about the relative resistance of coronary heart disease to antihypertensive drug treatment and the increasing interest in evaluating the impact of blood pressure-lowering drugs on surrogate endpoints such as left ventricular hypertrophy. Given the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic heterogeneity of calcium antagonists, it may be wise to keep in mind the subtypes as exemplified by the prototypes nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil and to extrapolate from one type to another with great caution. The increased understanding of the diversity among calcium antagonists as well as the pathophysiology of hypertension and other vascular diseases promises an exciting future for calcium antagonists in cardiovascular therapeutics. 
Uniparental paternal disomy in a genetic cancer-predisposing syndrome The 11p15.5 region of human chromosome 11 seems to contain a locus or loci involved in congenital overgrowth anomalies as well as in the genesis of many tumours associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Given the unusual differential parental allele involvement in the different aetiological forms of BWS and the loss of maternal alleles in associated tumours, we have now used 11p15.5 markers to determine the parental origin of chromosome 11 in eight sporadic cases of BWS. Probands in three informative families had uniparental paternal disomy for region 11p15.5. Further, an overall greatly increased frequency of homozygosity for several 11p15.5 markers in 21 sporadic BWS patients suggests that isodisomy probably accounts for an even higher proportion of BWS sporadic cases. This demonstrates that uniparental paternal disomy can be associated with a genetic cancer-predisposing syndrome. 
Hepatocellular and biliary expression of HLA antigens in primary biliary cirrhosis before and after ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. Recently, there have been reports that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy has a beneficial effect on liver function in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, information regarding the effects of UDCA therapy on hepatic histology remains insufficient. Aberrant expression of HLA antigens on hepatocytes is regarded important in the progression of hepatocellular damages mediated by cytotoxic T-cells in primary biliary cirrhosis. In this study, we examined immunohistochemically hepatocellular expression of HLA antigens on hepatocytes before and after UDCA therapy in four patients with asymptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis. Piecemeal necrosis, intralobular focal necrosis, and portal inflammation, as well as infiltration of activated T-lymphocytes and expression of HLA class I antigens on hepatocytes, disappeared, or diminished in parallel after the therapy. In two of four patients, expression of HLA-DR on some periportal hepatocytes before the therapy also disappeared after the therapy. These observations imply that UDCA therapy decreases the hepatocellular expression of HLA antigens and thereby reduces or abolishes T-cell-mediated hepatocellular necrosis in primary biliary cirrhosis. 
Genetic control of susceptibility to diethylnitrosamine and dimethylbenzanthracene carcinogenesis in rats. The susceptibility to cancer induction after a single dose of diethylnitrosamine in male rats and a single dose of dimethylbenzanthracene in female rats was examined in the grc- strain R16 and the grc+ strain ACP, both of which have the same major histocompatibility complex genes but differ in the grc region. No tumor-promoting regimens were used, and the animals were fed only laboratory chou. The R16 males developed liver cancer and the R16 females developed breast cancer, there also were malignancies in other organs in some animals. By contrast, the ACP males did not develop any malignancies, and the ACP females had a significantly lower prevalence of malignant tumors. Thus the susceptibility to cancer in these two strains of rats has a genetic basis associated with genes in the grc region, and is independent of the carcinogen used, the action of a promoter, and the sex of the animals. 
Immunohistochemical study of androgen receptors in metastatic prostate cancer. Comparison of receptor content and response to hormonal therapy. A longstanding goal has been to determine whether androgen receptor (AR) levels could be used to predict the clinical response of metastatic prostate cancer to androgen withdrawal therapy. A major limitation of previous studies was the use of homogenized tissue, which yields an average AR content for all cells. By AR immunohistochemical study using an antibody specific for AR the authors assessed nuclear AR content specifically in the malignant epithelial cells of prostate needle biopsy specimens of 17 patients with Stage D prostate cancer. The authors found that prostate cancer contains AR-positive and AR-negative malignant cells before androgen withdrawal therapy, but the percentage of AR-positive cells did not predict the time to tumor progression after therapy. There was no significant correlation between the percentage of AR-positive malignant cells and the time to tumor progression. When patients were divided into two groups based on the median time to progression, the percentage of AR-positive nuclei was not significantly different in poor responders versus good responders. When patients were divided into two groups based on the median percentage of receptor-positive nuclei, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the progression-free interval revealed no significant difference between the group of patients with AR-poor tumors and patients with AR-rich tumors. Potential explanations for these results are discussed. The authors conclude that the percentage of AR-positive nuclei is not a sufficient criterion to predict tumor behavior. 
Reversal of alcohol dependence and tolerance by a single administration of flumazenil. Chronic exposure to ethanol is associated with the development of tolerance to the acute effects of ethanol and a withdrawal syndrome characterized by anxiety and seizure susceptibility. In the present study we examined the ability of flumazenil (Ro15-1788), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, to reverse neuronal and behavioral manifestations of ethanol tolerance and dependence. A single injection of flumazenil (10 mg/kg, 14 hr before withdrawal) to mice administered a liquid diet containing ethanol for 10 days, reduced seizure severity during withdrawal from ethanol. Acute tolerance to ethanol-induced hypothermia was not sensitive to flumazenil treatment, but tolerance and diazepam-induced cross-tolerance to the ataxic effects of ethanol were reversed by a single injection of flumazenil given 2 to 26 hr before evaluation of tolerance. At a biochemical level, the ability of benzodiazepine inverse agonists (e.g., Ro15-4513) to reduce the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-operated chloride channels may represent a neuronal manifestation of ethanol dependence (Buck and Harris, 1990). Flumazenil treatment of ethanol-dependent mice 14 hr before isolation of brain membrane vesicles partially reversed the augmentation of Ro15-4513 inhibition of muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in vitro. These results demonstrate that brief occupation of benzodiazepine receptors by an antagonist may reset the cellular mechanisms responsible for the development of ethanol tolerance and dependence, and support the hypothesis that increased sensitivity to benzodiazepine inverse agonists is involved in the development of ethanol dependence. 
Three-dimensional upper airway computed tomography in obstructive sleep apnea. A prospective study in patients treated by uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. The success of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in treating obstructive sleep apnea varies considerably. Some of this variability may be accounted for by differences in the site of upper airway narrowing. To determine whether preoperative awake upper airway and soft tissue volumes predict the response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, preoperative awake computed tomograms (CT) of the upper airway were performed on 60 consecutive patients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea. Tracings were made from the CT scans of upper airway, tongue, and soft palate. Computer software was used to determine the cross-sectional area and volume of the upper airway, tongue, and soft palate. Patients underwent overnight polysomnograms before and 3 months after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Tongue volume was larger (p less than 0.02) and both upper airway to tongue volume (p less than 0.0005) and oropharynx to soft palate volume ratios (p less than 0.01) were smaller in obese patients. A good response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty as defined by a postoperative apnea index of less than 5 apneas/h or a reduction in apnea index greater than or equal to 50% was seen in 50 patients (83%). Patients who had a good response had a smaller oropharyngeal cross-sectional area (p less than 0.01), a smaller upper airway volume (p less than 0.05), a smaller upper airway to tongue volume ratio (p less than 0.01), and a smaller oropharynx to soft palate volume ratio (p less than 0.05). Obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea have larger tongues and smaller upper airways relative to tongue and soft palate size. Patients with smaller upper airways, particularly relative to tongue and soft palate size, have a good response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. 
PET as a tool in the clinical evaluation of pituitary adenomas. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used in over 400 examinations in patients with pituitary adenoma. It was demonstrated that PET with carbon-11-methionine can give valuable complementary information in the diagnosis of this tumor due to PET's ability to adequately depict viable tumor tissue in contrast to fibrosis, cysts and necrosis. Furthermore, PET with dopamine D2 receptor ligands can characterize the degree of receptor binding and thus give information as to the prerequisites for dopamine agonist treatment. Most important is the very high sensitivity given by PET with carbon-11-methionine in the evaluation of treatment effects. It is concluded that when properly used PET can be fully justified in the clinical handling of patients with pituitary adenomas and other intracranial tumors. 
The decline of mortality due to stroke: a competitive and deterministic perspective. Although stroke mortality has been declining since the first part of this century, the rate of decline increased sharply during the early 1970s. The basis for the fall in stroke mortality is often attributed to effective management of risk factors, particularly hypertension. However, some investigators have questioned whether risk factor reduction alone can adequately account for the magnitude of the recent decline in stroke mortality. When viewed from the perspective of competitive and deterministic mortality dynamics, the major force decreasing stroke mortality is the decreasing deterministic competitiveness of stroke and the increasing deterministic competitiveness of various malignant neoplasms and degenerative diseases as causes of mortality. These reciprocal trends are a natural consequence of the competitive deterministic mortality dynamics which describe these diseases in an environment that is becoming more conducive to human survival. The competitive nature of human mortality makes drawing etiopathogenic conclusions based upon single disease mortality data hazardous. 
Chronic sialadenitis with psammoma bodies mimicking neoplasia in a fine-needle aspiration specimen from the submandibular gland. A 65-year-old woman with a submandibular gland nodule had a fine-needle aspiration specimen that contained groups of duct-type cells and a psammoma body, suggestive of adenocarcinoma. The resected gland showed chronic sialadenitis with sialolithiasis and psammoma bodies. In a series of 81 resected nonneoplastic submandibular glands from 72 patients, psammoma bodies, nonlaminated microcalcifications, or both were found in 46 (57%). They were located most commonly just outside of striated or intercalated ducts. When examining fine-needle aspiration specimens from the submandibular gland, it is important that one be aware that psammoma bodies may occur in normal, inflamed, irradiated, and neoplastic conditions. 
Scrapie-associated prion protein accumulates in astrocytes during scrapie infection. In the course of scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy caused by an unconventional agent, a normal cellular protein is converted to an abnormal form that copurifies with infectivity and aggregates to form deposits of amyloid. We have used immunocytochemistry and methods that enhance detection of amyloidogenic proteins to investigate the types of cells in the central nervous system which are involved in the formation of the abnormal scrapie-associated protein. We show that this protein accumulates in astrocytes prior to the cardinal neuropathological changes in scrapie--astrogliosis, vacuolation, neuron loss, and amyloid deposition. These findings implicate the astrocyte in the formation of the scrapie isoform of the prion protein and amyloid in scrapie and suggest that this cell type might also be involved in the replication of the scrapie agent. 
Solitary myeloma of the talus bone. Solitary myeloma can present as either extramedullary plasmacytoma or solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB). More than half of reported cases of SPB are localized to the spine. The rest include appendage long bones of the skeleton, pelvis, and skull. The first case of SPB (to the authors' knowledge) is reported involving the talus bone of the foot. Although approximately 50% of SPB patients progress to multiple myeloma in the first 3 years after diagnosis, aggressive local therapy is indicated because the median survival of patients with SPB is better than that for multiple myeloma. 
Traumatic carotid-cavernous sinus fistula associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm: a case report. A case of traumatic carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (CCF) associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm is reported. A 42-year-old man developed traumatic CCF after severe head trauma. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a direct CCF associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm at the C2 portion. Transarterial balloon embolization of the CCF caused severe subarachnoid hemorrhage. A CCF with an intradural pseudoaneurysm is life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. However, balloon occlusion in such cases is contraindicated because of possible rupture of a pseudoaneurysm. Trapping or a direct surgical approach is the treatment of choice. 
Fibroblast stimulation in schistosomiasis. XI. Purification to apparent homogeneity of fibroblast-stimulating factor-1, an acidic heparin-binding growth factor produced by schistosomal egg granulomas. Liver fibrosis is the most serious complication of infection with Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum and is responsible for severe morbidity and mortality in hundreds of thousands of patients in many Third World nations. The pathogenesis of this condition remains to be elucidated. We proposed that certain cytokines produced by cells that comprise the chronic granulomas that surround the helminth eggs within the liver initiate hepatic fibrogenesis. We now report our successful purification to apparent homogeneity of the egg granuloma-derived fibroblast mitogen. The high affinity of this factor for heparin (elutes from heparin-Sepharose with 1.5 M NaCl) facilitates its purification by a two-step procedure, and identifies the cytokine as a heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF). Furthermore, because it has an isoelectric point approximately equal to 6.2, it has one of the characteristics of a class 1 (acidic) HBGF. We immunized rabbits with the purified factor and observed that the resulting antibodies (IgG) detected the factor but not acidic fibroblast growth factor (the prototypic class 1 HBGF) either by dot-blot ELISA or neutralization of biologic activity. The granuloma product and fibroblast growth factor also differ in target-cell specificity and amino acid composition. On the basis of these distinctions, we have designated the granuloma-derived mitogen fibroblast-stimulating factor-1. With the availability of purified fibroblast-stimulating factor-1 and the future analysis of its amino acid sequence, its structural relationship to other mesenchymal growth factors can be determined. 
The association between human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid status and the results of cytologic rescreening tests in young, sexually active women. We examined the utility of cytologic rescreening tests in women who had positive test results for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid but who were diagnosed as having benign conditions at cytologic testing. One hundred twenty-five Papanicolaou smears from women who were screened for human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid were sent routinely to a private laboratory for diagnoses. These slides were then reviewed independently by two pathologists who were blinded to the human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid results. The effects of cytologic rescreening in cases of both positive and negative human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid were assessed by calculating z scores. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was diagnosed in 40% by pathologist A and in 20% by pathologist B of the human papillomavirus-positive subjects compared with none diagnosed by the private cytology laboratory (z = 3.09, p less than 0.005 and z = 1.98, p less than 0.05, respectively). No significant differences were found in the human papillomavirus-negative group. We conclude that cytologic rescreening in human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid-positive women who were initially diagnosed as having benign cytologic results will yield a significant proportion of cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. 
Risks of untreated hypertension. A discussion [comment] There is a strong and graded association between blood pressure and the incidence of major coronary heart disease manifestations, congestive heart failure, stroke, and total mortality. The risk of any of these manifestations is also modified by other risk factors. Tobacco smoking affects the risk for all of the previously mentioned end points. Generally, lipid disturbances are only important predictors of coronary heart disease and total mortality. Several facts indicate that elevated blood pressure is causally related to the end points. There are, however, positive relations between blood pressure levels and heart rate, serum cholesterol level, body mass index, and, according to some studies, glucose intolerance. Some more basic abnormality may be responsible for the blood pressure increase and the increases in these other factors. Hypothetically, this abnormality may be more fundamentally related to some of the end points than is hypertension itself. If that is the case, then the type of antihypertensive treatment may be of decisive importance. Different end points may be affected differently by antihypertensive drugs, a factor that may be essential in the choice of drug treatment. Proper management of other risk factors is also essential in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. 
Sympathetic neural responses to induced ventricular tachycardia. Although sympathetic mechanisms play a major role in buffering abrupt arterial pressure reductions, including those that occur during tachyarrhythmias, human sympathetic nervous system responses to ventricular tachycardia have not been measured. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded directly from the peroneal nerve in 16 patients during diagnostic induction of 19 episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (average rate 189 beats/min, range 130 to 250). Average systolic and diastolic pressures decreased from 149/78 to 61/49 mm Hg by 10 s and increased toward baseline levels to 88/64 mm Hg by 1 min of ventricular tachycardia. Average sympathetic nerve activity increased by 92% at 10 s in direct proportion to arterial pressure reductions and in inverse proportion to ventricular rate and remained 83% above baseline levels at 1 min. The late recovery of arterial pressure during ventricular tachycardia was related significantly to the magnitude of early sympathetic responses. Sympathetic activity tended to lose its discrete bursting pattern during ventricular tachycardia, and power spectral analysis showed that the large sympathetic peaks at the heart rate frequency present during sinus rhythm are absent during ventricular tachycardia. This study is the first to delineate human sympathetic nervous system responses to ventricular tachycardia. The results suggest that in the patients studied, large early sympathetic surges differed from those that occur during sinus rhythm and contributed to hemodynamic stability during ventricular tachycardia. 
Intermittent pneumatic compression versus coumadin. Prevention of deep vein thrombosis in lower-extremity total joint arthroplasty. One hundred forty-nine consecutive patients requiring lower extremity total joint arthroplasty were randomized to either coumadin (52 patients) or intermittent pneumatic compression (48 patients) as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Forty-nine patients were excluded. When fully ambulatory, the presence or absence of DVT was diagnosed by ascending venography (90% of patients), nuclear venography, venous dopplers, or impedence plethysmography. The two groups were similar in average age (64 years), indication for arthroplasty (pain because of arthritis in 90%), gender (98% male), and average number of risk factors (2.4). Twenty-five percent of patients on coumadin and 25% of patients on intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) developed DVT. IPC was more effective than coumadin following primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) (16% versus 24% incidence DVT); coumadin was more effective than IPC following primary total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) (19% versus 32% incidence of DVT). DVT developed in 36% of patients following revision arthroplasty. Seventy-five percent of all thrombi were proximal. Both IPC and coumadin were found to be safe; there was no increased perioperative bleeding in the coumadin group. Of three postoperative deaths, one was possibly due to pulmonary embolism (PE). 
Macrophage apolipoprotein synthesis and endoneurial distribution as a response to segmental demyelination. The synthesis and endoneurial distribution of apolipoproteins in response to myelin degradation was elucidated morphologically and biochemically in rodent models of segmental demyelination. At the onset of acute demyelination induced by tellurium (Te) poisoning, macrophages infiltrated the endoneurium and then began to express cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for apolipoprotein E (apo E). When demyelinating nerve slices were incubated with S35-methionine, radiolabeled apo E was released, showing that apo E was actively synthesized by the macrophages. Macrophages secreted apo E into the endoneurial spaces, leading to dense endoneurial accumulations. Other apolipoproteins (apo A1 and albumin) were not synthesized in the endoneurium, but they entered edematous nerves, presumably through an early breakdown in the blood-nerve barrier. During the phagocytosis of myelin, plasma-derived apolipoproteins accumulated within some of the macrophages. In chronic demyelination caused by lead poisoning, the cellular and extracellular distribution of apolipoproteins was similar to Te neuropathy; the amount of apo E accumulation and the macrophage density were proportional to the prevalence of active demyelination in teased fibers. Similar patterns of endoneurial apo E were present in an inherited form of demyelination in the twitcher mouse, after antibody-mediated demyelination, and in demyelination secondary to axonal degeneration. Human sural nerve biopsies had patterns of apolipoprotein E antigenicity that were comparable to the rodent models. We conclude that secretion of apo E by infiltrating macrophages is a generalized response to demyelination, and that endoneurial edema leads to the accumulation of certain plasma apolipoproteins within macrophages. These data suggest that endoneurial apolipoproteins and macrophages might mediate important functions in patients recovering from primary and secondary demyelination. 
CT, MRI, and autopsy findings in brain of a patient with MELAS. Brain autopsy findings in a 14-year-old patient with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes were compared with those of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pathologic examinations revealed extensive laminar necrosis bordered by gliotic tissues throughout the cerebral cortices. Moderate losses of myelin and fibrous gliosis were also observed in the subcortical and deep white matter. These lesions were demonstrated as low-density areas on CT and as high-signal areas on T2-weighted MRI. MRI revealed the lesions more distinctively and precisely than CT. Neither CT nor MRI could reveal abnormalities in the basal ganglia, including vascular proliferation and calcium deposits in the blood vessels. 
Effect of milacemide on audiogenic seizures and cortical (Na+, K+)-ATPase of DBA/2J mice. Milacemide (MLM, CP 1552 S, 2-N-pentylaminoacetamide), a glycinamide derivative, is currently being evaluated clinically for antiepileptic activity. Anticonvulsant properties have been shown in various animal models, but the mechanism of action of MLM is unclear. We studied its activity in audiogenic seizures of DBA/2J mice. MLM was effective in inhibiting the convulsions induced by sound with a biphasic dose-effect relation. The ED50 was 109 mg/kg orally against tonic extension. Higher doses were necessary to abolish clonic convulsion and running response. Because impaired cerebral (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity is supposed to play a role in epileptogenesis, we tested MLM on in vitro cortical enzymatic activity of DBA/2J mice. Basal (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity was unchanged by several concentrations of MLM in normal C57BL/6J and audiogenic DBA/2J mice. K+ activation (from 3 to 18 mM) of (Na+, K+)-ATPase is abolished in DBA/2J mice as compared with C57BL/6J mice, suggesting impaired glial (Na+, K+)-ATPase. In the presence of MLM (from 30 to 1000 mg/L), cortical (Na+, K+)-ATPase of DBA/2J mice is activated by high concentrations of K+, as in C57BL/6J mice. Results suggest that the antiepileptic activity of MLM in audiogenic mice may be secondary to an activation of a deficient glial (Na+, K+)-ATPase. 
Cardiovascular effects of isradipine in essential hypertension. The immediate and short-term cardiovascular effects of oral isradipine therapy were evaluated in 11 patients with mild to moderate systemic hypertension. Isradipine, 5 mg administered orally, induced a significant reduction in arterial pressure from 165 +/- 6/88 +/- 3 mm Hg to 140 +/- 5/76 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) within 2.5 hours by a decrease in total peripheral resistance associated with an increase in heart rate and cardiac output. Contrary to the acute effect, oral therapy with isradipine for 3 months reduced arterial pressure through a decrease in total peripheral resistance but without causing an increase in heart rate or cardiac output or activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Isradipine slightly reduced left ventricular mass and improved cardiac systolic function and left ventricular filling. Renal blood flow increased, and renal vascular resistance (p less than 0.01) and total blood volume (p less than 0.002) decreased without a change in either sodium excretion or body weight. Thus, isradipine, when given for 3 months, decreased arterial pressure by reducing total peripheral resistance without activation of reflexive mechanisms. Its favorable effects on systemic hemodynamics, total blood volume, renal blood flow, and cardiac structure and function suggest isradipine to be an excellent choice for antihypertensive therapy. 
Corneal phaeohyphomycosis caused by Wangiella dermatitidis. A case is described of a corneal abscess of the left eye of a patient, male, 35 years, from which there was found in pure culture a mycotic micro-organism, Exophiala (Wangiella) dermatitidis, determined also in the native preparation from the pus. The patient is feeble-minded, suffers from von Recklinghausen's disease and has an impairment of the immune system (above all the reduction of T lymphocytes). 
Events in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST): mortality in patients surviving open label titration but not randomized to double-blind therapy. The patient characteristics and outcomes were studied in the 318 patients who survived open label drug titration in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) and who were not randomized to double-blind therapy and in 942 patients, who were randomized to double-blind placebo therapy. The patients randomized to placebo therapy had a lower total mortality or resuscitated cardiac arrest rate (4% vs. 8.5%). However, at baseline, nonrandomized patients were dissimilar from patients randomized to placebo in the following ways: older; lower left ventricular ejection fraction; greater use of digitalis, diuretic drugs and antihypertensive agents; lesser use of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and more frequent prior cardiac problems, including runs of ventricular tachycardia and left bundle branch block. A matched comparison that took these inequities into account showed no significant differences in mortality or rate of resuscitation from cardiac arrest between nonrandomized patients and clinically equivalent patients randomized to placebo. Cox regression analysis indicated that two factors significantly increased the hazard ratio for arrhythmic death or resuscitated cardiac arrest in the nonrandomized patients: female gender (4.7, p less than 0.05) and electrocardiographic events (ventricular tachycardia, proarrhythmia, widened QRS complex, heart block, bradycardia) during open label titration (7.0, p less than 0.005). However, some potentially important differences between men and women were not included in the Cox regression model. Of the nonrandomized patients, approximately 70% were not randomized because of lack of suppression of ventricular premature depolarizations or adverse events, or both, and the remaining 30% because of patient or private physician request with no indication of another reason. 
Influence of hypertension and dietary copper on indexes of copper status in rats. The Dahl salt-sensitive rat was used to investigate the effect of hypertension on indexes of copper status and to determine the extent to which dietary manipulation of copper attenuated, or exacerbated, the rate of sodium chloride-induced hypertension. Weanling salt-sensitive rats were fed, in a 2 x 3 factorial design, one of six diets that contained one of three levels of copper (2.0 micrograms/g marginal, 12 micrograms/g adequate, or 50 micrograms/g supplemental) and either control (0.4%) or high (4%) levels of sodium. Diets were fed to the rats for 11 weeks. Rats fed the high sodium diets were characterized by high plasma copper concentrations and ceruloplasmin activities compared with their respective control sodium rats. The magnitude of the sodium-induced rise in plasma copper and ceruloplasmin was affected by dietary copper intake; however, dietary copper intake had no effect on the development of hypertension in the high sodium groups. These results suggest that altered copper metabolism is secondary, rather than primary, to the development of sodium chloride-induced hypertension in the salt-sensitive rat. Red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity was reduced in rats fed the low copper diets compared with the adequate and supplemented copper groups. At the lower levels of copper intake, sodium chloride-induced hypertension increased red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity in a manner consistent with the plasma copper and ceruloplasmin changes observed. However, at adequate or supplemental levels of dietary copper, red blood cell superoxide dismutase activity plateaued, suggesting possible saturation of copper at sites of hematopoeisis. 
A new provocative test for chronic mesenteric ischemia. A new provocative test for chronic mesenteric ischemia is described, based upon the demonstration of a fall in the intramural pH of the small bowel after introduction of a test meal into the stomach. Intramural pH (pHI) is determined indirectly by tonometry, utilizing a tonometer passed per os. Postoperative assessment of revascularization procedures is also possible by the same technique. Application of the test in an 84-yr-old woman showed good correlation between a preoperative fall in jejunal intramural pH and abdominal pain, and the absence of a fall postoperatively after successful revascularization. 
Intestinal ischemia associated with cardio-pulmonary-bypass surgery: a life threatening complication. Intestinal ischemia following open heart surgery is rare but nevertheless extremely dangerous and the causes are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors influencing the occurrence and outcome of patients with this complication. At our institution between 1985 and 1989 1712 patients underwent open heart surgery and 4 female patients suffered from intestinal ischemia. The early mortality was 2.5% for the whole group and 100% for the group with intestinal ischemia. All these 4 patients were elderly and had a history of hypertension and hyperlipoproteinemia. Three of the four patients with intestinal ischemia had various risk factors for thromboembolic events such as pre-existing occlusive arterial disease and cardiac dysrhythmias or had a complicated postoperative course. In two patients an enormous increase in serum lactate to over 10 mmol/l occurred prior to the intestinal ischemia. We therefore consider advancing age, female gender and a susceptibility for thromboembolic events as important risk factors for the development of intestinal ischemia. A serum lactate over 10 mmol/l should lead to an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach including exploratory laparotomy. 
Mitogenic effects of coagulation factor XII and factor XIIa on HepG2 cells. The structure of coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor), inferred from its DNA sequence, includes two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-homologous domains in its amino-terminal region. This suggests that factor XII may exhibit EGF-like activities. Reciprocal antigenic cross-reactivity between factor XII and EGF was shown by exposing purified human factor XII or mouse EGF to anti-mouse EGF or anti-human factor XII. Western blot analysis showed that anti-mouse EGF recognized intact factor XII at 80 kDa. Together, these results suggest that the EGF-homologous domains are accessible for anti-EGF binding in native factor XII. To determine whether factor XII has mitogenic activity, HepG2 or L cells (10(4) cells per well) were grown in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of factor XII or kaolin-activated factor XII (factor XIIa). Both factors XII and XIIa (6.0 micrograms/ml) enhanced cell proliferation by approximately 2-fold (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.005, respectively). In contrast, L cells, which are not EGF target cells, were not affected by either factor XII or factor XIIa. Various doses of factor XII enhanced cell proliferation, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and [3H]leucine incorporation in HepG2 cells cultured under the same conditions. These data indicate that factor XII, like EGF, is a mitogen for HepG2 cells and suggest a possible autocrine role in the liver. 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and complicated diverticular disease: a case-control study. Fifty patients with severe complications of diverticular disease were compared with two groups of 50 controls, matched for age and sex. The first control group (A) was randomly selected from all emergency hospital admissions, and the second group (B) from patients with uncomplicated diverticular disease. Of the 50 study patients, 24 (48 per cent) were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at the time of admission compared with nine (18 per cent) of control group A and ten (20 per cent) of control group B. Both of these differences were statistically significant, indicating a strong association between the ingestion of NSAIDs and the development of severe complications of diverticular disease. 
Stress testing in the period after infarction. Dipyridamole echocardiography is gaining popularity as an exercise-independent diagnostic method in patients with suspected or demonstrable coronary artery disease. To assess its safety, feasibility, and diagnostic accuracy in patients recovering from uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction, 131 patients had the test before hospital discharge. The results were compared with those of maximum treadmill testing. We found that dipyridamole-induced transient asynergy remote from the infarct zone was more sensitive (74% versus 53%, p less than 0.05) and specific (97% versus 68%, p less than 0.01) than treadmill testing for detecting multivessel coronary artery disease. In a subgroup of 42 patients treated with thrombolytic therapy, dipyridamole echocardiography was able to detect in 27 the presence of jeopardized but viable myocardium in the infarct zone. An excellent correlation was found between dipyridamole echocardiography responses and infarct vessel patency. Finally, the prognostic impact of dipyridamole echocardiography on patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction was assessed in a consecutive series of 151 patients. Eighteen months of event-free survival was significantly different in patients with positive versus negative dipyridamole echocardiography results (76.1% versus 50.8%, p less than 0.01). The test was also superior to treadmill testing in predicting cardiac events. Thus, dipyridamole echocardiography performed early after acute myocardial infarction is safe, feasible, and accurate for predicting the extent of coronary artery disease and 18-month clinical outcome. 
Fluid resuscitation with deferoxamine prevents systemic burn-induced oxidant injury. We studied the effect of deferoxamine (DFO) infused after burns on hemodynamic stability as well as local and systemic inflammation and oxidant-induced lipid peroxidation. Eighteen anesthetized sheep were given a 40% of total body surface burn and fluid resuscitated to restore oxygen delivery (DO2) and filling pressures to baseline values. Animals were resuscitated with lactated Ringer's (LR) alone or LR plus 1,500 ml of a 5% hetastarch complexed with DFO (8 mg/ml). Animals were killed 6 hours postburn. The sheep resuscitated with LR and LR plus hetastarch demonstrated significant lung inflammation and significant increases in lung and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) from controls of 47 +/- 6 and 110 +/- 7 nMol/gm to 63 +/- 13 and 202 +/- 59 for LR and 67 +/- 4 and 211 +/- 9 for LR + hetastarch, respectively. The group resuscitated with hetastarch alone required 15% less fluid. VO2 returned to baseline values in both groups by 2 hours. Resuscitation with the 5% hetastarch-DFO decreased total fluids by 30% over LR and prevented the increase in lung and liver MDA. In addition, postburn VO2 increased by 25% above baseline values. Burn tissue edema, measured as protein-rich lymph flow, was significantly increased with the administration of DFO compared with the other groups. We conclude that DFO used for burn resuscitation prevents systemic lipid peroxidation and decreases the vascular leak in nonburn tissues while also increasing O2 utilization. Resuscitation with hetastarch-DFO may accentuate burn tissue edema, possibly by increased perfusion of burn tissue. 
Portal vein thrombosis complicating endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy. Convincing further evidence. Portal vein thrombosis occurred in a patient who bled from gastric varices that developed after obliteration of esophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy. This complication was recognized only at surgery when thrombectomy and endovenectomy preceded the successful placement of an end-to-side portocaval shunt. At histopathology, the presence of an amorphous, eosinophilic material staining negatively for fibrin and similar to sclerosant injected at sclerotherapy was observed within the clot. This latter finding, previously unreported, provides convincing evidence for the causal relationship of portal vein thrombosis to endoscopic sclerotherapy. 
Determinants of genital human papillomavirus infection in young women Carcinoma of the cervix has several well-established epidemiologic risk factors, including multiple sexual partners and early age at first intercourse. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to have an etiologic role in the development of cervical neoplasia, but evidence linking HPV infection to known risk factors for cervical cancer has been inconsistent. The lack of expected correlations may be due to the inaccuracy of HPV assays previously used. A polymerase chain reaction DNA amplification method for the detection of HPV was used to investigate the determinants of genital HPV infection in a cross-sectional sample of 467 women attending a university health service. In contrast to studies using less accurate detection methods, the risk factors for HPV infection found here were consistent with those for cervical neoplasia. The risk of HPV infection was strongly and independently associated with increasing numbers of sexual partners in a lifetime, use of oral contraceptives, younger age, and black race. Age at first intercourse, smoking, and history of a prior sexually transmitted disease were correlated with, but not independently predictive of, HPV infection. These results demonstrate that the key risk factors for cervical carcinoma are strongly associated with genital HPV infection. This correlation suggests that HPV has an etiologic role in cervical neoplasia and reaffirms the sexual route of HPV transmission. 
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) phase II trial: outcome comparison of a "conservative strategy" in community versus tertiary hospitals. The TIMI Research Group In the conservative strategy arm of phase II of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trial, 1,461 patients were treated with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Coronary angiography, with angioplasty if feasible, was to be performed only for recurrent spontaneous or exercise-induced ischemia. In this study results in patients treated by this strategy in community and tertiary hospitals are compared. Despite similar baseline findings in the two groups, coronary angiography was performed within 42 days in more patients (542 [48%] of 1,155) initially admitted to a tertiary hospital (on-site coronary angiography/angioplasty available) than in those (94 [32%] of 306) admitted to a community hospital (transfer to tertiary hospital for coronary angiography/angioplasty) (p less than 0.001). This different approach resulted in a greater use of coronary angioplasty (203 [18%] of 1,155 versus 32 [11%] of 306, p less than 0.01), coronary artery bypass surgery (133 [12%] of 1,155 versus 23 [8%] of 306, p less than 0.05) and blood transfusions (139 [12%] of 1,155 versus 17 [5.5%] of 306, p less than 0.001) in patients admitted to a tertiary than to a community hospital. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction or left ventricular function. These results demonstrate that a conservative strategy after treatment of acute myocardial infarction with rt-PA is applicable in the community hospital setting. 
Physiologic adaptations to prolonged high-intensity exercise training in patients with coronary artery disease. Exercise training elicits numerous beneficial adaptations in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but until 10 yr ago these adaptations were generally believed to be peripheral adaptations rather than improvements in myocardial blood supply. However, animal models of CAD have been shown to elicit improvements in myocardial blood flow and left ventricular performance with prolonged, intense exercise training. More recently we have provided electrocardiographic, echocardiographic hemodynamic, and radionuclide evidence of central cardiovascular adaptations in patients with CAD after a year-long program of 1 h of exercise at 70-90% of VO2max 5 d.wk(-1). These training-induced adaptations are consistent with an improvement in myocardial oxygenation and concomitantly an enhanced left ventricular function in these patients. This program also resulted in improvements in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and plasma lipoprotein-lipid profile. We have also shown that these beneficial cardiovascular and metabolic adaptations are maintained during six additional years of training in patients with CAD. These results do not imply that all patients with CAD should initiate such an intense training program, but rather that, in selected patients undergoing a training stimulus well in excess of that conventionally prescribed for coronary patients, the training-induced adaptations may be substantially greater than previously believed. 
Limb salvage surgery for bone and soft tissue sarcoma. A phase II pathologic study of preoperative intraarterial cisplatin. Preoperative therapy has been tested as part of limb salvage therapy for localized bone and soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities. The activity of cisplatin (CDDP) by intraarterial (IA) infusion was evaluated in 40 cases of which 36 were evaluable for response. All patients had high-grade sarcomas. All but 3 patients received 3 or 4 courses (24 patients received 4 courses) of CDDP at a dosage of 120 to 150 mg/m2 given over 6 hours every 2 weeks by IA infusion. Patients younger than 18 years of age received the higher dose of CDDP. Treatment was well tolerated with combination antiemetics. One patient experienced severe hearing loss with the first cycle of the higher CDDP dose. Pathologic evaluation of resected osteosarcoma showed a favorable response (90% or greater necrosis) in 8 of 20 evaluable cases and in 3 of 4 patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone (without osteoid). In soft tissue sarcomas, minimal (50% to 89%) necrosis was seen in two of nine cases and none had 90% or greater necrosis. Patients received postoperative chemotherapy based on pathologic response, but the value of this postoperative adjuvant therapy requires further follow-up and is uncertain in this small study. IA CDDP can often cause significant tumor necrosis in patients with bone sarcomas, whereas soft tissue sarcomas are less sensitive to this therapy. 
Routine imaging studies for the posttreatment surveillance of breast and colorectal carcinoma. Current recommendations on follow-up procedures for patients who have been treated for cancer include imaging studies and other laboratory tests at relatively frequent intervals. At least two questions should be asked to evaluate the benefits of this practice for patients: Do frequent routine surveillance tests detect recurrences "earlier" in asymptomatic patients? and Does earlier treatment of these recurrences reduce morbidity or prolong survival? The practical import of surveillance with imaging and laboratory tests for recurrence in patients with cancer of the breast and colon is discussed. Reported autopsy data, findings at elective reoperation, and clinical data have been examined to ascertain the justification for routine periodic tests in the treated but asymptomatic patient. It is concluded that earlier detection of a local recurrence or of metastatic disease through periodic tests in the asymptomatic patient with breast or colon cancer rarely alters the treatment or the outcome. A notable exception is regular screening mammography following treatment for adenocarcinoma of the breast. 
A follow-up study of colonic epithelial proliferation as a biomarker ina Native-American family with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. A 7-year follow-up study of colonic mucosa proliferation markers was conducted on members of a Native-American family with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. Reproducibility of a tritiated thymidine autoradiography assay for labeling indexes during this 7-year biologically significant time frame was established. A good correlation between tritiated thymidine and a newer technique, bromodeoxyuridine immunoperoxidase staining, was seen. No confounding effect could be attributed to standard colon preparation. On average, both baseline and follow-up values for epithelial proliferation were within the accepted normal range. The presence of essentially normal labeling indexes among colon cancer patients and their high-risk offspring suggests the possibility of the significant effect of dietary factors in reducing proliferation. Such factors may account for the low risk of colon cancer that characterizes the Native-American population in the American Southwest. 
High-dose intramuscular triamcinolone in severe, chronic, life-threatening asthma [published erratum appears in N Engl J Med 1991 May 9;324(19):1380] BACKGROUND. Despite oral corticosteroid therapy, some patients with asthma have frequent exacerbations requiring emergency room visits, hospitalization, and occasionally, mechanical ventilation. We compared the effects of high-dose intramuscular triamcinolone with oral prednisone in patients with severe chronic asthma. METHODS. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study that spanned all seasons, we treated 12 patients with high-dose intramuscular triamcinolone (360 mg over the first three days of the treatment period) or low-dose oral prednisone (median dose, 12.5 mg per day throughout the period; range 0 to 30). The two three-month treatment periods were separated by a three-month washout period. During all periods the patients were allowed to take additional doses of prednisone for acute exacerbations of asthma. RESULTS. After receiving triamcinolone, the patients had significantly better peak expiratory flow rates than while receiving prednisone (the average [+/- SEM] weekly percent of the predicted value during the triamcinolone period was 91.5 +/- 6.9, as compared with 75.0 +/- 5.9 for the prednisone period; P less than 0.05). During the prednisone period there were 21 emergency room visits and 10 hospitalizations, but there were none during the triamcinolone period (P less than 0.05). There were two episodes of ventilatory failure during the prednisone period. Total steroid doses were significantly smaller during the triamcinolone period than during the prednisone period (P less than 0.04). Steroidal side effects were more pronounced after treatment with triamcinolone than after treatment with prednisone (P less than 0.1). CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that high-dose intramuscular triamcinolone is more effective than low-dose prednisone in patients with severe, chronic, life-threatening asthma, but steroidal side effects are somewhat worse. 
Evaluation of biotinylated DNA probes for the detection of gene rearrangements in clinical specimens. To determine whether a nonisotopic procedure is suitable for analyzing clinical specimens for gene rearrangements, the authors hybridized DNA from 15 specimens of lymphoid tissue with biotinylated DNA probes directed to J beta I + J beta II (T-cell receptor beta chain gene), JH (immunoglobulin gene heavy chain J region), and J kappa (immunoglobulin gene kappa light chain J region). Five cases of benign lymphoid hyperplasia, one case of dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, and one case of small noncleaved follicular center cell lymphoma had germline hybridization patterns when digested with Bam HI, Eco RI, and Hind III restriction endonucleases. Four cases of B-cell lymphoma and three cases of T-cell lymphoma had clearly detectable rearrangements of the genes for immunoglobulin or the T-cell receptor or both. One case of dermatopathic lymphadenopathy had a faint, clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor after digestion with Eco RI and Bam III. The authors conclude that biotinylated DNA probes can be useful for analyzing gene rearrangements in clinical specimens. 
Acute respiratory viral infections in ambulatory children of urban northeast Brazil. The morbidity of acute respiratory infections in young children and the role of respiratory viruses were evaluated in a 29-month household-based study in an impoverished urban population in Fortaleza, Brazil; subjects were 175 children less than 5 years of age in 63 families. Home visits were conducted three times weekly during which staff recorded the presence of respiratory and systemic symptoms and collected upper respiratory tract samples for viral isolation. A large and sustained burden of respiratory illness was observed, and respiratory viruses were isolated in 35% of the samples collected. Of the isolates, 45.6% were rhinoviruses, 16% parainfluenza viruses, 15.8% enteroviruses, 9.9% adenoviruses, 7.0% herpes simplex viruses, and 5.7% influenza viruses. The results indicate that poor children in northeast Brazil have a high prevalence of respiratory illness and that rhinovirus is the most frequent respiratory virus. 
Preoperative evaluation of gastric cancer by endoscopic ultrasound. The preoperative use of endoscopic ultrasound was evaluated in 74 patients with confirmed gastric cancer. It was used in diagnosing the depth of invasion in the gastric wall, the infiltration to the adjacent organs, and the involvement of the perigastric lymph nodes. Results were compared with histological findings in resected specimens. Accuracy in staging gastric cancer using the T grade of the 1987 TNM system was 81.1% (60 of 74 patients). Endoscopic ultrasound provided excellent results compared with computed tomography and conventional ultrasound, particularly in evaluating perigastric lymph node metastasis and direct infiltration to the adjacent organs. The success rate in detecting lymph node metastasis was 50% (11 of 22 patients); the accuracy in diagnosing direct infiltration to the adjacent organs was 60% (three of five patients). This technique is useful in diagnosing malignant invasion and lymph node metastasis of gastric carcinomas but requires further refinement for use in diagnosing the disease itself. Its preoperative use is recommended for establishing surgical and other treatment plans, as well as in predicting the prognosis of gastric cancer. 
Effects of endurance training on baroreflex sensitivity and blood pressure in borderline hypertension. Physical training offers a potential nonpharmacological strategy for control of mild and borderline hypertension, but its effect on blood pressure is controversial. We investigated the effects of endurance training on waking and sleeping blood pressure and on baroreflex sensitivity in 16 borderline hypertensive patients. First, 8 patients were assessed before and after a 6-month endurance training programme. Then, when it was clear that blood pressures were lower after training, a further 8 patients were studied not only at the end of the training programme but also after 4 months' abstention from exercise (detraining). Measurements were taken of baroreflex sensitivity (response to iv phenylephrine), blood pressure, R-R interval, and blood pressure and R-R variability. Ambulatory blood pressures were measured in 13 patients (7 trained, 6 detrained) and sleep blood pressures in 6 patients (3 trained, 3 detrained). Increased fitness was associated with a decline in resting arterial blood pressure of 9.7 (SE 2.0) mm Hg systolic and 6.8 (1.2) mm Hg diastolic, and with a decline in ambulatory blood pressure of 4.8 (1.4) mm Hg and 7.5 (2.1) mm Hg, respectively; both p less than 0.05. Baroreflex sensitivity was 14.0 (1.8) ms/mm Hg in the unfit and 17.5 (2.0) ms/mm Hg in the fit; p less than 0.05. Sleep blood pressures were not lower in the fit despite longer sleep R-R intervals. These findings indicate that, in some subjects with borderline or mild hypertension, a physical training programme is sufficient to bring the blood pressure within normal limits. 
The long-term course of Lyme arthritis in children. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The natural history of Lyme disease is not completely known. We studied the long-term course of Lyme arthritis in 46 children in whom the onset of the disease occurred between 1976 and 1979 and who received no antibiotic therapy for at least the first four years of the illness. RESULTS. Of the 46 children (age range, 2 to 15 years), 33 (72 percent) initially had erythema migrans, 7 (15 percent) had influenza-like symptoms, and 6 (13 percent) had migratory joint pain. These manifestations were followed by brief attacks of arthritis, particularly affecting the knee. The percentage of children with recurrent episodes of arthritis declined each year. By year 4, only 10 children still had a mean of two episodes of arthritis per year; the duration of arthritis was generally longer in older children (P less than 0.05). During the sixth year of illness, two children (4 percent) had keratitis, and more than 10 years after the onset of disease, a subtle encephalopathy developed in two other children. Of the 39 children whom we were able to contact in 1988-1989, 12 (31 percent) still had occasional brief episodes of joint pain and 1 (3 percent) had marked fatigue. All 46 children had positive IgG antibody responses to Borrelia burgdorferi throughout the illness and on long-term follow-up. As compared with those who became asymptomatic, the children with recurrent symptoms more often had IgM responses to the spirochete and had significantly higher IgG titers (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. The course of initially untreated Lyme disease in children may include acute infection followed by attacks of arthritis and then by keratitis, subtle joint pain, or chronic encephalopathy. 
Neuroendocrine activation in congestive heart failure. Several changes in neuroendocrine activity follow failure of cardiac function to satisfy peripheral requirements and contribute to the clinical syndromes of heart failure. Afferent pathways are poorly understood and triggers are both central and peripheral, involving attenuation of atrial and arterial baroreceptor activity. Efferent sympathetic activity is generally increased with resulting vasoconstriction, but responses are organ-specific and differ among heart, kidney, lung and skeletal muscle. Changes in cardiac sympathetic activity are inadequately understood. Enhanced cardiac norepinephrine spillover contrasts with reduced tissue concentration and impaired activity of synthetic enzymes and neuronal catecholamine uptake. Beta-receptor down-regulation further complicates overall adrenergic responsiveness and the balance between enhancement of contractile function and reduction in arrhythmia threshold. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system is potentiated by the sympathetic nervous system and may contribute to vasoconstrictor hyporesponsiveness. Angiotensin II may in turn facilitate the central and peripheral effects of sympathetic activation and the release of vasopressin from the pituitary. Our understanding of the role of vasodilator peptides in heart failure remains rudimentary. It is likely that vasoconstrictor neuroendocrine response adversely influences optimal cardiac function in heart failure and may promote arrhythmogenesis. The neuroendocrine response in individual organs, however, requires intensive study. 
Vipoma of the pancreas complicating ulcerative colitis. We report a case of vipoma of the pancreas in conjunction with ulcerative colitis in a 20-yr-old woman. Twenty months after the onset of ulcerative colitis, the patient complained of watery diarrhea and was found to have an electrolyte disorder. A pancreatic tumor was detected by ultrasonography and computed tomography, along with an elevation of serum vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). The secretory diarrhea diminished dramatically, and the serum VIP level decreased into the normal range immediately after resection of the pancreatic tumor. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a pancreatic vipoma. Despite removal of the vipoma, she underwent restorative proctocolectomy and ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis 2 yr later due to progression of the ulcerative colitis. Postoperative course was uneventful, with excellent functional results. Knowledge of this rare condition accompanying ulcerative colitis may help in the management of the patient with an atypical clinical course. 
Contribution of increased endolymphatic pressure to hearing loss in experimental hydrops. After the induction of experimental hydrops there follows a strict sequence of compound action potential (CAP) audiogram changes. Within days a low-frequency loss (below 8 kHz) is detected; within weeks a very high-frequency loss (above 8 kHz) develops; and finally within months the 8-kHz region is also affected. Following the application of excess pressure, presumably to the endolymphatic spaces, via a cannula placed in the endolymphatic duct, a sequence of CAP audiogram changes occurs that is not similar to that observed with hydrops. There is first a very high-frequency loss (above 4 kHz), then a very low-frequency loss (below 4 kHz), and finally the 4 kHz region is also affected and thresholds for all frequencies become even more raised. The data thus suggest that a slow accumulation of endolymph as induced by blockage of the endolymphatic duct does not produce the same disorder as a rapid onset of a high pressure applied at the base of the cochlea. In addition the data suggest that raised endolymphatic pressure is not likely to be significant in early stages of hydrops, but could contribute to the later high-frequency sensitivity losses. 
Bilateral adrenal tumours in primary aldosteronism: localization of a unilateral aldosteronoma by dexamethasone suppression scan. In a patient with primary aldosteronism, in which the postural endocrine tests suggested the presence of an aldosteronoma rather than hyperplasia, bilateral adrenal tumours were found by computer tomography. Adrenal scintigraphy using 6-131I-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP59) during dexamethasone suppression showed early unilateral adrenal visualization on the left side. After removal of the left adrenal gland, which contained a 2 x 2 x 2 cm adenoma, the blood pressure and aldosterone levels returned to normal. A CT-scan, performed 1 year after the pre-operative CT-scan, showed no change in size of the right adrenal tumour, consistent with a non-functioning adenoma. In this patient, the NP59 scan adequately distinguished a non-functioning from an aldosterone-producing adrenal tumour. 
Long-term postoperative dysphagia in oral/pharyngeal surgery patients: subjects' perceptions vs. videofluoroscopic observations. Dysphagia commonly results from surgical resection of various structures within the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal areas. The type and severity of swallowing dysfunction are based largely on the number and quantity of structures removed as well as the reconstructive procedure. Short term-recovery has been addressed in many studies. However, follow-up studies of long-term functional results and continuing swallowing problems following oral/pharyngeal surgery are unavailable. In this study, perception of swallowing dysfunction was compared with actual videofluoroscopic findings in subjects at least 1 year after oral/pharyngeal surgery. The comparative results of a questionnaire developed to evaluate patients' perception of continuing swallowing difficulty and an analysis of actual videofluoroscopic tapes indicated that the degree or type of dysphagia could not be determined from patients' subjective descriptions of the swallowing problem. 
Partial atrial resection in advanced lung carcinoma with and without cardiopulmonary bypass. Combined pneumonectomy and partial resection of the left atrium was performed in 12 patients with advanced lung carcinoma (T3 and T4 in the new UICC classification). In the eight patients with a T3 lung carcinoma intrapericardial atrial resection with vascular clamping was carried out; four of the patients died within a year. The remaining four patients had a T4 tumour and underwent removal of the right lung and part of the left atrium under total cardiopulmonary bypass. One patient died shortly after the operation from cerebral and cerebellar infarction, and one died 11 months later from brain metastases. Two are alive and well. Complete resection appears to offer a chance for longer survival in patients with advanced lung carcinoma that extends directly into the intrapericardial pulmonary vessels or atrium. 
Use of electron microscopy in examination of faeces and rectal and jejunal biopsy specimens. The stools and rectal biopsy specimens of 44 patients with AIDS and diarrhoea were examined by culture, light microscopy, and electron microscopy. In 13 patients examination of rectal biopsy material and faecal samples showed no pathogen, but in two of these, microsporidiosis was found by electron microscopical examination of jejunal biopsy specimens. This organism was also identified electron microscopically in one of the further five jejunal biopsy samples taken from patients with a known cause of diarrhoea. Blastocystis hominis infection was identified electron microscopically in six patients, all of whom had cryptosporidiosis additionally seen by light microscopy. Four of these six patients remained well for long periods, with only moderate diarrhoea, and follow up showed no evidence of blastocystis infection. In only four of 11 patients found to have cryptosporidium in their stools at light microscopy were organisms found at electron microscopy. Viral inclusions were only identified at electron microscopy in one of 10 patients with an opportunistic viral infection seen at light microscopy (cytomegalovirus n = 7, herpes simplex virus n = 3). No additional viral pathogens were detected in either stools or rectal biopsy material by electron microscopy. It is concluded that routine electron microscopic examination of stool samples or rectal biopsy material taken from patients with AIDS and diarrhoea is unnecessary and does not increase the yield of potential pathogens compared with standard microbiological techniques and histology. 
Maxillofacial considerations in orthotopic liver transplantation. Orthotopic liver transplantation is now a widely used treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease. Lifelong pharmacologic immunosuppression renders these patients susceptible to many infections. The purpose of this article is to provide guidelines for treating the patient with end-stage liver disease, both before and after transplantation. In addition, we shall discuss some of the medical implications associated with end-stage liver disease and their clinical presentations and appropriate presurgical management. Adverse side effects of long-term immunosuppression and their effect on the oral and maxillofacial region shall also be discussed. Last, a brief discussion of FK506, the latest immunosuppressant, will be presented together with the implications of its use on our surgical treatment of these patients. 
Clinical spectrum of bronchogenic cysts of the mediastinum and lung in the adult. Bronchogenic cysts are closed sacs considered to be the result of an abnormal budding of the respiratory system. They are lined by ciliated epithelium and have focal areas of hyaline cartilage, smooth muscle, and bronchial glands within their walls. They are seldom seen in the adult, and most are thought to be asymptomatic and free of complications. During a 20-year period, 86 patients underwent resection of a bronchogenic cyst of the mediastinum (66 patients) and lung (20 patients). There were 47 women and 39 men whose ages ranged from 16 to 69 years. Seventy-two percent of patients (67% with mediastinal cysts and 90% with cysts of the lung) were symptomatic at the time of operation, and the majority had two or more symptoms. Despite extensive investigations, which in some cases included computed tomographic scanning (n = 12) and angiography (n = 22), a positive diagnosis was never made preoperatively even if it was suspected in 57% of patients. In nearly all patients, the operative approach was that of a posterolateral thoracotomy. All but two mediastinal bronchogenic cysts could be locally excised, but all bronchogenic cysts of the lung required pulmonary resection (lobectomy, 13; limited resection, 6; pneumonectomy, 1). Major operative difficulties were encountered in 35 patients, all of whom were symptomatic preoperatively. Thirty-three patients had a complicated cyst; the complications consisted of fistulization (n = 16), ulcerations of the cyst wall (n = 13), hemorrhage (n = 2), infection without fistulization (n = 1), and secondary bronchial atresia (n = 1). Overall, 82% of patients had a bronchogenic cyst that was either symptomatic or complicated or both. 
Medical treatment of chronic otitis media: steroid or antibiotic with steroid ear-drops? The aim of this study was to evaluate whether, in the treatment of active non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media, the effectiveness of gentamicin with hydrocortisone ear-drops is due solely to the contained steroid or to the combination of antibiotic and steroid. Sixty-four patients presenting to the Ear, Nose and Throat outpatient department with active non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media were randomly allocated to receive either gentamicin with hydrocortisone ear-drops, or betamethasone ear-drops, for up to 4 weeks. Activity in the ear was assessed at 2 and 4 weeks. Gentamicin with hydrocortisone combination drops were significantly more effective than betamethasone drops (P less than 0.001) in producing inactivity of chronic otitis media, being effective in 80% as opposed to 29% of cases. The effectiveness of gentamicin with hydrocortisone ear-drops appears to be due to the combination of antibiotic and steroid. 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: evolution, early results, and impact on nonsurgical gallstone therapies Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a surgical technique first performed in France, has gained widespread acceptance among surgeons in the United States. The abdominal cavity is inflated by carbon dioxide, a video monitor is inserted via a laparoscope placed periumbilically, and the gallbladder is freed and removed from the liver bed by using small subcostal ports for access and dissection. Intraoperative cholangiography is routinely performed, but uncertainty exists about how best to manage choledocholithiasis. Compared with traditional cholecystectomy, initial reports describing laparoscopic cholecystectomy cite shorter recovery times because no large incisions are made, thus potentially reducing the cost and morbidity of cholecystectomy. A survey of 614 early cases supports these claims, with a reported complication rate of 1.5% and quick resumption of normal activities by patients. Because of its promise for reduced morbidity, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is challenging open cholecystectomy as the therapeutic gold standard for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Thus, the standard to which the nonsurgical gallstone therapies, such as lithotripsy and contact dissolution, will be compared may shift to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. As the laparoscopic complications are similar to those of traditional cholecystectomy, such as abscesses and bile leaks, their percutaneous treatment should not change. 
Necrotizing soft-tissue infections in the head and neck: a clinicopathological study. The clinicopathological aspects of 15 patients with necrotizing soft-tissue infections in the head and neck are reviewed. Our relatively large series suggests that the disease occurs more frequently than described in the literature. Histological studies showed that tissue superficial and deep to the fascia is frequently involved with the infectious inflammatory process, even in early stages of the disease. These pathologic changes were also found in healthy-appearing tissues at the periphery of the lesions. The early recognition of the disease and the prompt and aggressive surgical and medical therapeutic approach have resulted in far lower mortality rates (7%) than those reported in the literature. Frozen-section examination contributed to the maximal eradication of the pathologic process. This successful outcome was achieved in spite of the adverse associated clinical conditions, such as old age, debilitating disease, or complications, observed in half of the patients. 
Prolonged gastric pH monitoring in responder and nonresponder duodenal ulcer patients: response to placebo and to H2-blocker administration. We evaluated the circadian pattern of gastric acidity by prolonged intraluminal pHmetry in 15 "responder" and 10 "nonresponder" duodenal ulcer patients after nocturnal administration of placebo, ranitidine, and famotidine. Acidity was measured during predefined periods under the different drug regimens in the two groups of subjects, and a comparison was performed both within and between groups. With placebo, significantly lower median 24-h pH values were detected in patients with resistant ulcer than in responders (1.13 versus 1.63). On the contrary, no statistical difference was detected between the two groups during any time of day after administration of either ranitidine or famotidine. Within each group, no significant difference was noted between the two different H2-blockers. Thus, our data suggest that patients with resistant duodenal ulcer display an increased gastric acidity in control conditions but a "normal" response to administration of antisecretory drugs. 
Identification of FAP locus genes from chromosome 5q21. Recent studies suggest that one or more genes on chromosome 5q21 are important for the development of colorectal cancers, particularly those associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). To facilitate the identification of genes from this locus, a portion of the region that is tightly linked to FAP was cloned. Six contiguous stretches of sequence (contigs) containing approximately 5.5 Mb of DNA were isolated. Subclones from these contigs were used to identify and position six genes, all of which were expressed in normal colonic mucosa. Two of these genes (APC and MCC) are likely to contribute to colorectal tumorigenesis. The MCC gene had previously been identified by virtue of its mutation in human colorectal tumors. The APC gene was identified in a contig initiated from the MCC gene and was found to encode an unusually large protein. These two closely spaced genes encode proteins predicted to contain coiled-coil regions. Both genes were also expressed in a wide variety of tissues. Further studies of MCC and APC and their potential interaction should prove useful for understanding colorectal neoplasia. 
A summary index for the assessment of quality of life in angina pectoris. When exploring the effects of anti-anginal therapy on quality of life (QL), it is essential to use concise, reliable, outcome measures which focus on those aspects of the disease which are affected by the anginal pain, and which are expected to be responsive to medical intervention. Analysis based on a single comprehensive index is preferable to the use of several indexes as it avoids the potential for conflicting inferences from multiple comparisons. In this paper, we describe the development of a QL index which summarizes the three questionnaires used in the North Karelian Quality of Life (KarQuol) study. The summary index (SI) will be used to compare transdermal and oral nitrate therapy in patients with angina pectoris, and represents the first stage in the construction of a disease-specific evaluative index for future trials. 
Metabolic and functional recovery of ischemic human myocardium after coronary angioplasty Although revascularization of hypoperfused but metabolically active human myocardium improves segmental function, the temporal relations among restoration of blood flow, normalization of tissue metabolism and recovery of segmental function have not been determined. To examine the effects of coronary angioplasty on 13 asynergic vascular territories in 12 patients, positron emission tomography and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed before and within 72 h of revascularization. Ten patients underwent late echocardiography (67 +/- 19 days) and eight underwent a late positron emission tomographic study (68 +/- 19 days). The extent and severity of abnormalities of wall motion, perfusion and glucose metabolism were expressed as wall motion scores, perfusion defect scores and perfusion-metabolism mismatch scores. Angioplasty significantly increased mean stenosis cross-sectional area (from 0.95 +/- 0.9 to 2.7 +/- 1.4 mm2) and mean cross-sectional luminal diameter (from 0.9 +/- 0.6 to 1.9 +/- 0.5 mm) (both p less than 0.001). Perfusion defect scores in dependent vascular territories improved early after angioplasty (from 116 +/- 166 to 31 +/- 51, p less than 0.002) with no further improvement on the late follow-up study. The mean perfusion-metabolism mismatch score decreased from 159 +/- 175 to 65 +/- 117 early after angioplasty (p less than 0.01) and to 26 +/- 29 at late follow-up (p less than 0.001 vs. before angioplasty; p = NS vs. early after angioplasty). However, absolute rates of glucose utilization remained elevated early after revascularization, normalizing only at late follow-up. 
Comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment of chronic pain: a follow-up study of treated and non-treated groups. There are relatively few outcome studies of multidisciplinary chronic pain programs which have utilized no-treatment comparison groups. The present study compared a group of chronic pain patients (N = 42) treated in a comprehensive multidisciplinary pain program with a group of patients (N = 15) who were evaluated but not treated. Comparisons were made at evaluation and at a follow-up period averaging 11 months later. From evaluation to discharge, the treated group showed significant increases in physical functioning. From evaluation to long-term follow-up, both the treated and non-treated groups showed significant decreases in self-report pain ratings and interference with activities ratings. However, only the treated group showed a significant decrease in addictive medication use and increase in work functioning. The return-to-work rate for the treated group was 48% with an additional 28% of the patients being returned to vocational rehabilitation. None of the non-treated group returned to work or vocational rehabilitation. Results are discussed in terms of their support for the conclusion that comprehensive multidisciplinary pain programs produce marked subjective and functional changes. 
The place of isradipine in the treatment of hypertension. Isradipine is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a high degree of selectivity for the coronary, cerebral, and skeletal muscle vasculature. The drug has minimal depressant activity on sinoatrial node automaticity and negligible negative chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic actions. Isradipine reduces blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance without changes in cardiac output and stroke volume. Renal blood flow is maintained while renal vascular resistance is reduced; this is accompanied by both short- and long-term diuretic and natriuretic effects. Doses of 1.25 to 5 mg twice daily lowers blood pressure effectively over 24 h. In open as well as placebo-controlled trials, 2.5 to 10 mg isradipine twice daily was safe and well tolerated, and reduced systolic and diastolic values in up to 85% of patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Efficacy is similar to those of nifedipine and nitrendipine, and potentially superior to those of propranolol, atenolol, prazosin, hydrochlorothiazide, and diltiazem. The drug can be safely combined with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and diuretics. Adverse effects are dose-dependent and secondary to arterial vasodilatation, such as headache, flushing, ankle edema, dizziness, palpitations, and tachycardia. At the recommended dose of 2.5 mg twice daily, the total incidence of side effects does not differ from that with placebo. The antiatherosclerotic, antitrophic, and cerebroprotective effects seen in experimental animal models are promising for the drug in the treatment of human hypertension. Isradipine may not only reduce blood pressure, but may also reduce the risk for the consequences of this peril, namely, cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction. 
Perianal ulcer in disseminated histoplasmosis. A 65-year-old man with stage I testicular seminoma, treated with surgery and radiation, had fever of unknown origin, adrenal insufficiency, and an isolated perianal ulcer. Tissue diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis was established by biopsy of the perianal ulcer, an unusual cutaneous manifestation of the disease. Treatment with amphotericin B resulted in rapid clinical improvement and complete healing of the perianal ulcer. 
Adjuncts to thrombolysis for myocardial reperfusion. OBJECTIVE: To discuss adjunctive pharmacologic agents for acute myocardial infarction, to critique their initial effects in clinical trials, and to review their potential for improving the clinical conditions of patients with acute myocardial infarction. DATA SOURCES: Relevant studies reported from January 1985 to December 1990 were identified through a MEDLINE search of the English-language literature and through a manual search of the bibliographies of all identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Peer-reviewed experimental and clinical studies evaluating the role of pharmacologic adjuncts to thrombolytic therapy in experimental models of coronary occlusion and clinical trials of patients with acute myocardial infarction were selected for review. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The data presented were abstracted by the investigators. Differences with a univariate P value of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical data suggest that adjunctive pharmacologic therapy to thrombolytic agents should include aspirin, at least 160 mg administered as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms; intravenous heparin; and, in selected patients without contraindications, intravenous beta-blockading agents. 
Does infant feeding method influence maternal postpartum weight loss? We conducted a retrospective study of 411 women to determine whether a significant relationship existed between method of infant feeding (breast vs bottle) and postpartum weight loss at 6 weeks and 12 months. In addition to method of infant feeding, the variables parity, gravidity, mode of delivery, maternal age, maternal prepregnancy weight, infant sex, and payment status (whether receiving assistance from the Aid to Dependent Children [ADC] program) were studied in terms of their association with weight loss. In general, no consistent relationship was found between method of infant feeding and postpartum weight loss. However, in the ADC group at 6 weeks and in the non-ADC group at 12 months, nonlactating women had lost more weight than had their lactating counterparts, in spite of the theoretical energy deficiency of breast-feeding women. Women who gained more weight during pregnancy consistently lost more weight following delivery, regardless of their prepregnancy weight. These results indicate that infant feeding method was not related to differences in postpartum weight loss between lactating and nonlactating counterparts. 
Childhood haemangiomas of the head and neck. Haemangiomas of the head and neck in children may be of several histological types, the clinical course depending on the group to which the haemangioma belongs. Treatment may be required if the haemangioma interferes with the airway, as in the subglottic group, or if the lesion becomes ulcerated with subsequent haemorrhage, as in capillary cavernous haemangiomas. Most haemangiomas require no immediate treatment as they involute spontaneously, though parental reassurance will be of paramount importance. Those lesions which persist may be amenable to treatment at a later date, the laser probably offering the best long-term results in terms of cosmesis as in the case of port-wine stains. Superselective embolization is becoming the treatment of choice for arterial haemangiomas. This paper is designed to clarify the histological and clinical features of these tumours and their management in view of considerable confusion in the literature encountered in our study. 
A public health approach to cholesterol. Confronting the 'TV-auto-supermarket society'. Coronary heart disease has been proved to be associated with a "high-risk" diet and with elevated blood cholesterol levels. The National Cholesterol Education Program has embarked on a campaign based on intensive medical treatment of 60 million Americans with high blood cholesterol levels, but the degree of benefit of dietary change or pharmaceutical intervention or both to reduce blood cholesterol values remains a subject of disagreement within the scientific community. Evidence from comparative international studies suggests that to lower coronary heart disease mortality substantially, dietary alterations and general societal changes must be greater than those possible under the National Cholesterol Education Program's approach of physician-centered patient counseling. The nation's priority to prevent coronary heart disease should be a public policy approach, the goal of which is to reduce for the entire population all coronary disease risk factors. In the dietary area, three proposals to reduce the availability of atherogenic foods are the use of warning labels on atherogenic foods, the prohibition of advertising for such high-risk foods, and the imposition of an excise tax on the same foods. We must confront the "TV-auto-supermarket society" that underlies our nation's high rate of coronary heart disease. 
Scintillating scotomata associated with internal carotid artery dissection: report of three cases. We report three cases of cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection, which presented with visual symptoms resembling the migraine aura. When prolonged and especially when associated with other neurologic symptoms, such transient and positive visual phenomena can be manifestations of ICA dissection that mimic migraine. 
Expression of functional human Epstein-Barr virus/C3d receptor ([CR2] CD21) on insulinoma cell line. Induction of tumor rejection but not diabetes in syngeneic rats. We stably expressed human complement receptor 2 ([CR2] CD21 C3d/Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] receptor) on the rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F with a recombinant retroviral vector. CR2-expressing RINm5F cells secreted 78-33% less insulin than parental cells or cells transduced with an antisense vector and could be infected with high-titer EBV. We tested whether human CR2 expression on RINm5F cells would affect tumorigenesis after transplantation to syngeneic New England Deaconess Hospital rats. Non-CR2-expressing antisense-transduced RINm5F cells rapidly grew tumors and caused hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and the death of the animals after 15.7 +/- 0.7 days. CR2-expressing RINm5F cells were infiltrated by mononuclear cells at an early stage and eventually caused noninfiltrated tumors and the death of the animals after 33.0 +/- 0.4 days. These tumors were CR2- and are believed to have arisen from a minor CR2- population of tumor cells. The pancreatic islets were histologically normal at all time points. We conclude that expression of a xenoantigen on a rat insulinoma cell line induces an immune response in syngeneic rats but does not result in breakage of tolerance to parental or revertant cells. 
Nausea and vomiting with use of a patient-controlled analgesia system. The incidence of nausea and vomiting following patient controlled analgesia and intramuscular morphine injections on demand was compared in a double-blind randomised study of 32 healthy patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy. There were no significant differences between the two groups in mean 24 hour postoperative morphine consumption, subjective experience of pain, nausea and sedation assessed by visual linear analogue scoring, and the postoperative requirements for antiemetic therapy. 
Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in surgical patients. Venous thromboembolic disease is a common, potentially life-threatening, but preventable complication of surgery. Venographic studies have shown a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis in patients who do not receive prophylaxis. The long-term sequelae of deep vein thrombosis in these patients can be disabling, but the exact prevalence of post-thrombotic complications has not been well documented. Fatal pulmonary embolism has been reported in 0.5% to 1% of patients after major abdominal surgery and in 2% to 6% after total hip replacement. Several methods of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism have demonstrated efficacy, but a surprising number of patients still do not receive prophylaxis. A medical record review in 16 hospitals recently disclosed that only 32% of high-risk patients received prophylaxis, with a range from 9% in a community hospital to 56% in a major teaching hospital. The possible reasons for this comparatively low rate of utilization are discussed. Current issues and future trends in the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism are briefly summarized. 
Generation of a nested series of interstitial deletions in yeast artificial chromosomes carrying human DNA. We have generated a nested series of interstitial deletions in a fragment of human X chromosome-derived DNA cloned into a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vector. A yeast strain carrying the YAC was transformed with a linear recombination substrate containing at one end a sequence that is uniquely represented on the YAC and at the other end a truncated long interspersed repetitive element (LINE 1, or L1). Homologous recombination between the YAC and the input DNA resulted in a nested series of interstitial deletions, the largest of which was 500 kilobases. In combination with terminal deletions that can be generated through homologous recombination, the interstitial deletions are useful for mapping and studying gene structure-function relationships. 
Prostate cancer screening in younger men: prostate-specific antigen and public awareness. The American Cancer Society recommends annual digital rectal examination for men over forty years of age. We evaluated 414 men between forty and fifty-nine years of age with a questionnaire, digital rectal examination (DRE), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) determination. One hundred ninety were forty to forty-nine years old, and 224 were fifty to fifty-nine years old. Four patients in the forty to forty-nine age group had elevated PSA determinations, and 7 had abnormal findings on DRE. Using prostate ultrasound and biopsy, no cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed. Ten patients in the fifty to fifty-nine age group had elevated PSA determinations, and 5 were diagnosed to have prostate cancer. These data suggest that PSA may have utility in detecting cancer in younger men. 
Chemical sympathectomy alters the development of hypertension in miniature swine. To determine if the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine could be used to chemically sympathectomize neonatal miniature swine, eight newborn swine were treated with 6-hydroxydopamine beginning on the first day after birth and continuing at regular intervals for the next 6 months. Six littermates served as controls and received vehicle injections. A significant reduction in the pressor response to intravenous tyramine (95%) and in the tissue norepinephrine content of the kidneys, left ventricle, and gastrocnemius muscle (more than 93%) provided evidence for an effective long-term sympathectomy in the 6-hydroxydopamine-treated animals. In addition, the blood pressure response of these young, chemically sympathectomized swine to chronic deoxycorticosterone acetate treatment was evaluated. Mean arterial pressure before deoxycorticosterone was similar in the 6-hydroxydopamine-treated (116 +/- 2 mm Hg) and control (125 +/- 5 mm Hg) groups. One week after deoxycorticosterone, mean arterial pressure had risen significantly by 20-22 mm Hg in both groups. Blood pressure continued to increase in the control group, reaching a value of 163 +/- 6 mm Hg by the third week after treatment. In contrast, mean arterial pressure in the 6-hydroxydopamine group did not increase further during weeks 2 and 3 after deoxycorticosterone. In conclusion, chronic treatment of neonatal swine with 6-hydroxydopamine produced an animal model with an effective, general, peripheral sympathectomy. The significant attenuation of the hypertensive response in these sympathectomized animals lends further support to the hypothesis that an intact sympathetic nervous system is necessary for the full expression of deoxycorticosterone hypertension in miniature swine. 
The epidermal basement membrane in basal cell carcinoma: an immunohistochemical study. An immunohistochemical study of basal cell carcinomas of varying histological type, using a panel of antibodies to constituents of the epidermal basement membrane, showed marked deficiencies in the expression of the antigens identified by the antibodies LH7.2, GB3 and G71. There was no correlation between loss of immunoreactivity to these antibodies and the histological features of the tumour. 
Vitamin K therapy in severe liver disease. A middle-aged man with parenchymatous liver disease and a decrease in vitamin K-dependent factors was given large doses of intravenous phylloquinone (10 mg/d for 20 days) without improvement in the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent factors. During subsequent liver transplantation, he exsanguinated. Although the exact role of over treatment with phylloquinone in this case is unclear, plasma levels of phylloquinone 300 times normal were attained after 5 days of treatment without effect on factors II, VII, IX, and X. Further therapy with vitamin K was unnecessary. 
Primary cutaneous mucormycosis in a healthy young girl. Report of a case caused by Mucor hiemalis Wehmer. We report an unusual case of primary cutaneous mucormycosis caused by Mucor hiemalis Wehmer that occurred in a healthy young girl after an insect bite. The patient had a slowly extending, indurated, erythematous, and scaling eruption on the right cheek. Histologic examination revealed granulomatous dermatitis and characteristic broad, nonseptate, pale-staining hyphae. This is the first report of an infection in a human being caused by Mucor hiemalis Wehmer. The infection was cured with intravenous amphotericin B. 
Serum lipid and apolipoprotein levels in non-hypertensive lean NIDDM patients. To determine the possible role of a glycaemic control in lipid metabolism in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients, serum lipid and apolipoprotein levels were measured in well-controlled and poorly controlled lean NIDDM without proteinuria and hypertension. A sample of 96 lean NIDDM patients (body mass index less than 25 kg m-2 in men and less than 27 kg m-2 in women) were divided into two groups: group I, where the HbA1c concentration had been less than 6% for the previous 3 months, and group II, where the HbA1c concentration had been greater than 8% for the previous 3 months. Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL-cholesterol levels showed no significant differences between groups I and II. Furthermore, serum levels of apolipoproteins AI, AII, B, CII, CIII, and E did not differ significantly between groups I and II. These results suggest that glycaemic control did not influence lipid metabolism in lean NIDDM patients. 
Regional esophageal distribution and clearance of refluxed gastric acid. Regional differences in the esophageal distribution and clearance of refluxed gastric acid was studied in seven asymptomatic volunteers and seven patients with reflux esophagitis. Intraluminal pH was recorded for 3 postprandial hours from the distal, middle, and proximal esophagus on two separate occasions (with subjects in upright and supine positions). With the subjects in a supine position, about half of the acid reflux episodes reached the proximal esophagus in patients as well as in controls. This percentage decreased to 25% in patients and 29% in controls when they were upright. In both groups, the pH drops in the distal esophagus were significantly greater than in the proximal esophagus for both the supine and upright positions. In both patients and controls, a 4-5-fold greater acid exposure occurred in the distal esophagus, than in the proximal esophagus. In both patient and control groups, acid exposure time, as well as the number of reflux episodes in the distal esophagus, were significantly greater than that of the proximal esophagus (P less than 0.05). Spontaneous acid clearance time in the distal esophagus was significantly longer than that of the proximal esophagus in both positions (P less than 0.05) for both subject groups. In conclusion, regional differences exist in the exposure of the esophageal mucosa to refluxed gastric acid. These regional differences are more pronounced when subjects are upright than supine. Regional differences also exist in esophageal acid clearance, with clearance taking longer in the distal esophagus than in the proximal esophagus. The net effect of these phenomena is that acid exposure time in the distal esophagus is greater than that in the remainder of the esophagus. 
Bilateral cerebellopontine angle tumors in neurofibromatosis type 2. In a series of over 500 cases of cerebellopontine angle tumors, 19 patients had bilateral neurinomas. Four of these tumors arose from the facial rather than the acoustic nerve. A conservative policy regarding surgery had been adopted in an effort to prevent hearing loss for as long as possible. Nevertheless, all patients operated on in this series are now totally deaf. The results of managing these patients surgically and conservatively are discussed. 
Congenital biliary cysts in Indian adults. Only one report of congenital biliary cysts has been described so far from India, and that was in children. We present our experience with 22 adult Indian patients with this condition. The main presenting symptoms were abdominal pain, icterus, and fever, and the classical triad of jaundice, pain, and abdominal mass was seen in only one patient. The mean age of presentation was 25.5 +/- 10.1 yr, and females predominated (82%). Type Ia cysts (fusiform choledochal cyst) were the commonest. Intrahepatic cysts were seen in four patients; three of these were associated with extrahepatic biliary ductal cysts (type IVa). Internal drainage procedures performed elsewhere in six patients were followed by recurrent cholangitis, necessitating excision of the cyst. Hence, the preferred operation for congenital biliary cysts is cyst excision and hepaticojejunostomy. 
Post cricoid lymphangioma. A 69-year-old female patient presented with symptoms characteristic of globus pharyngeus and barium swallow examination was normal. Her symptoms persisted and pharyngoscopy was undertaken; a post-cricoid polyp was found and removed. Histological examination revealed this to be a lymphangioma. Histological appearances, pathogenesis and treatment are discussed. The case illustrates that persisting symptoms presenting as globus pharyngeus should be further investigated to exclude rare lesions. 
Hemodynamic consequences of desmopressin administration after cardiopulmonary bypass. Desmopressin acetate is used to reduce blood loss after cardiac surgery. However, there have been reports that hypotension can occur with infusion of desmopressin and that postoperative blood loss is not reduced. In this randomized, double-blinded study, we investigated the effects of desmopressin on hemodynamics, coagulation, and postoperative blood loss in patients undergoing primary elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). After reversal of heparin effect, 20 patients received desmopressin 0.3 micrograms.kg-1, infused over 15 min, and 20 patients received a placebo. Desmopressin produced a small but significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure when compared with the placebo (50.8 mmHg vs. 57.6 mmHg for the desmopressin- and placebo-treated groups, respectively; P = 0.0372). A 20% or greater decrease in mean arterial pressure was observed in 7 of 20 patients receiving desmopressin, whereas only one patient in the placebo-treated group experienced a decrease of this magnitude (P = 0.0177). Reductions in arterial pressure were secondary to decreases in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (mean SVR before and after the drug infusion, 1,006 and 766 dyn.s.cm-5, respectively, for the desmopressin-treated group; and 994 and 1,104 dyn.s.cm-5, respectively, for the placebo-treated group; P = 0.0078). 
Hypertension following erythropoietin therapy in anemic hemodialysis patients. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) corrects the anemia of end-stage renal disease. However, hypertension has been observed as an adverse effect of increasing red cell mass. In our study, 44 of 63 patients (70%) treated with rHuEpo had an increase in mean arterial pressure greater than 10 mm Hg or required new or additional hypertensive medications. Retrospective analysis disclosed that increasing blood pressure was associated with pretreatment hematocrit level less than or equal to 0.20 (P = .05) and dependency on red cell transfusions (P less than .01). Factors not associated with hypertension included the rate of rise of the hematocrit, the net rise in hematocrit, age, sex, the number of years on dialysis, the presence or absence of kidneys, smoking, or the presence of pretreatment hypertension. Noninvasive hemodynamic studies in eight normotensive patients before and after improvement of the anemia demonstrated a normalization of the decreased peripheral vascular resistance and a reduction toward normal in the elevated cardiac output. In three of these patients, clinical hypertension subsequently evolved. Follow-up hemodynamic studies in nine other patients receiving new or additional antihypertensive medications were difficult to interpret. Although the hypertension can be controlled with routine medication, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur if the blood pressure increases rapidly when the hematocrit increases with rHuEpo therapy. 
Prevalence of Type A behavior in untreated hypertensive individuals. Type A behavior has been associated with coronary heart disease as well as high cholesterol and smoking, major risk factors for coronary heart disease, but the data indicating a similar association with hypertension are inconsistent. Since past studies have usually based hypertension on a single blood pressure assessment or have often included treated hypertensive patients, this inconsistency is not surprising. The current study compared the prevalence of Type A behavior (assessed by Rosenman's structured interview) between 109 untreated hypertensive subjects and 109 age-, sex-, ethnic-, and occupation-matched normotensive subjects. Hypertension status was based on five repeated assessments over a 5-month period. Results indicated that Type A behavior is more prevalent in untreated, mildly hypertensive employed individuals than occupationally matched normotensive subjects. Type A component analysis confirmed the importance of hostility and certain vigorous voice stylistics in predicting cardiovascular conditions. These findings, taken together with the evidence linking Type A behavior with high cholesterol and cigarette smoking, further support the view that this behavior pattern is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. 
Neuronal activity up-regulates astroglial gene expression. Neuronal gene expression is known to be modulated by functional activity. This modulation is thought to play a key role in determining the differentiation of developing neurons and regulating the operation of mature neurons. Here we describe a regulation of astroglial gene expression by neuronal activity. We report that intense neuronal activity (electrically induced seizures) in rat hippocampus leads to rapid and dramatic increases in mRNA for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astroglia-specific intermediate filament protein. GFAP mRNA levels increased at sites of stimulation as well as in areas that were synaptically activated by the resultant seizures. When seizures were induced repetitively for many days, levels of GFAP mRNA remained chronically elevated. However, GFAP mRNA returned to control levels within a few days after the cessation of stimulation. The coupling between astroglial gene expression and neuronal activity may be a mechanism through which neuronal activity modulates the function of supporting cells that are responsible for regulating the extracellular microenvironment of the brain. 
Implications of obesity for cardiovascular disease in blacks: the CARDIA and ARIC studies [published erratum appears in Am J Clin Nutr 1991 Sep;54(3):590] To examine the relation of obesity to cardiovascular disease in blacks, we analyzed data from two population studies, including young and middle-aged adults. Obesity, defined by using the sum of subscapular and triceps skinfold measurements, was positively associated with atherogenic plasma lipids, systolic blood pressure, serum glucose and insulin, and prevalence of diabetes mellitus. The strength of these associations, for the most part, was similar in blacks and whites. However, with each unit increase in sum of skinfold thicknesses, plasma triglyceride concentrations in blacks appeared to increase only one-third to one-half as much as in whites. Prevalence of cardiovascular disease in 45- to 65-y-old blacks was associated with obesity; the odds ratio (95% confidence interval), adjusted for age and cigarette smoking, was 1.3 (0.9, 1.8) in both black men and black women. Additional analyses showed that abdominal adiposity conferred increased risk. These findings suggest that both blacks and whites should avoid excess adiposity. 
Usefulness of technetium-99m-MIBI and thallium-201 in tomographic imaging combined with high-dose dipyridamole and handgrip exercise for detecting coronary artery disease Forty-two patients with known stable coronary artery disease, referred for coronary angiography, were examined with technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxy-2-methylpropyl-isonitrile (MIBI) tomography combined with a high-dose dipyridamole infusion (0.7 mg/kg) and handgrip stress. MIBI tomography was unable to show coronary artery disease only in 2 patients, thus yielding a sensitivity figure of 95%. MIBI tomography correctly identified 27 (82%) of 33 stenotic lesions (greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis) of the left anterior descending artery, 17 (61%) of 28 of those of the left circumflex artery, and 28 (90%) of 31 of those of the right coronary artery. The overall vessel sensitivity was 78%. The computed lumen diameter stenoses were more advanced in cases detected than in those not detected with MIBI tomography: 87 +/- 14 vs 76 +/- 14% (p less than 0.01). The 50 to 69% stenoses did not show any tendency to produce less positive findings than those with greater than or equal to 70% stenoses. In the subgroup of 21 patients who also presented for thallium scintigraphy, the overall diseased vessel identification rate was 76% for thallium tomography and 83% for MIBI tomography (p = not significant). Minor noncardiac side effects related to the dipyridamole-handgrip test occurred only in 5% of 63 study sessions. A high-dose dipyridamole combined with isometric exercise is a safe stress method, and when used during scintigraphy, MIBI tomography is at least as efficient a tool as thallium tomography in detecting diseased vessel territories in patients in coronary artery disease. 
Elevated circulating interleukin-6 is associated with an acute-phase response but reduced fixed hepatic protein synthesis in patients with cancer. It has been suggested that, as part of the inflammatory response to the presence of a tumor, various cytokines are produced and these induce hepatic synthesis of acute-phase proteins (APP). Under these circumstances it is not known what changes occur in the fixed component of hepatic protein synthesis. The aim of this study was to compare circulating interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) concentrations and fixed hepatic protein synthesis rates in a group of healthy controls (n = 6) with a group of patients with an established APP response secondary to hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer (n = 6). Fixed hepatic protein synthesis rates were measured following a primed, constant 20-hour infusion of 15N-glycine. The liver was biopsied at laparotomy. The APP response was assessed by serum C-reactive protein concentration and cytokines were assayed by a combination of immunoassay and bioassay. The patients with advanced cancer and an on-going APP response had elevated circulating IL-6 concentrations (p less than 0.01). Rates of fixed hepatic protein synthesis were 30% lower than those observed in controls (p less than 0.01). These findings demonstrate that in patients with hepatic metastasis, although the synthesis of certain acute-phase export proteins can be increased, fixed protein synthesis is reduced. Whether these changes in the distribution of hepatic protein synthesis are mediated by IL-6 will require further investigation. 
Increasing incidence of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The incidence of pyloric stenosis in the Mersey region rose from 1.54/1000 births in 1976-8 to 2.22/1000 births in 1986-8. Reliance on ultrasonography for diagnosis in the 1980s resulted in fewer 'tumours' being felt; diagnostic delay was not shortened overall but serial ultrasonography showed evolving lesions in six patients. Clinical examination and selective use of ultrasonography is advocated. 
Brachial plexus anesthesia in pediatric patients. Between 1980 and 1988 at our institution, brachial plexus anesthesia (BPA) was used in 109 pediatric patients who underwent 142 surgical procedures on an upper extremity, including 134 axillary blocks. Most patients older than 6 years of age had their blocks and surgical procedures with moderate sedation. The success rate was high--92.4% of axillary blocks and 100% of other blocks were adequate for surgical intervention in patients who required only intravenous sedation. The postoperative course in the BPA group was compared with that in 109 age-matched control subjects who underwent 188 procedures on an upper extremity during general anesthesia (GA). Admission to the recovery room after anesthesia occurred less frequently in the BPA group than in the GA group (27.5% versus 91.0%; P less than 0.01). Furthermore, nausea and vomiting were less frequent in the BPA group than in the GA group (P less than 0.01). Outpatients in the BPA group were less likely to require narcotic analgesics before dismissal than were those in the GA group (12% versus 31%; P less than 0.05). Admission of outpatients was infrequent in both groups (2% for BPA and 9% for GA). No significant difference was noted in 24-hour postoperative narcotic requirements between the BPA and GA groups. 
Mechanism of production of scoliosis. A hypothesis. On the basis of previous studies on the vertebral column and thoracic skeleton, the author generated a hypothesis for the mechanism of production of scoliosis. According to this hypothesis, vertical stability of the thoracic spine is maintained by equal support through the ribs from both sides due to the equal load brought to the lamin by both the ribs through the costotransverse articulations and ligaments. Any interference in this balancing mechanism will disturb the mechanism of spinal stability, and the spine will bend toward the more heavier loaded side at the intervertebral joints. On the basis of this hypothesis, mechanisms of production of scoliosis (both in experimental animals and humans) after removal of ribs on one side can be explained. Removal of the ribs from one side produces an imbalance in the symmetric weight transmission through the ribs on the two sides. Pathologic deformations within the vertebrae in scoliosis results from the asymmetric load and the altered route of the load transmission on the convex side of the curve. 
Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia in children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. To determine the significance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) eosinophilia, the charts of 106 patients treated with shunt-related procedures during the calendar year 1985 were reviewed. Sixty-nine patients presented for a shunt revision; their charts were retrospectively reviewed from the time of shunt insertion until January, 1988. The remaining 37 patients had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt inserted during the study period and were subsequently followed to January, 1988. A total of 558 shunt-related procedures were performed on these patients during the study period, with a mean follow-up period of 6.9 years. The infection rate was 3.8%. Eosinophilia was diagnosed when eosinophils accounted for 8% or more of the total CSF white blood cell count. Ventricular CSF eosinophilia occurred in 36 patients sometime during their clinical course. These 36 patients required a mean of 8.5 shunt revisions, while the remaining patients required a mean of 2.5 revisions (p less than 0.001). Shunt infections were also more frequent in patients with eosinophilia (p less than 0.01). In no case was peripheral eosinophilia or a parasitic infection present. This study demonstrates that CSF eosinophilia is common in children with shunts. Children with this laboratory finding will experience more shunt failures. In addition, the new appearance of eosinophilia in the CSF of a patient with a shunt in place suggests the possibility of a shunt infection. 
Drug-induced fever due to diltiazem. To our knowledge, drug-induced fever has not been reported with the use of diltiazem hydrochloride, a commonly prescribed calcium channel blocker. We describe a patient in whom this was the primary manifestation of drug hypersensitivity. A 67-year-old man was admitted for management of a diabetic foot ulcer. His hospital course was complicated by a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, for which diltiazem was prescribed. On the seventh day of therapy, he experienced fever, with temperatures as high as 38.8 degrees C. Despite an extensive evaluation, which included a gallium scan, a technetium bone scan, and abdominal ultrasound, a source could not be found. On the 16th day of therapy, however, relative eosinophilia developed, and 2 days later a pruritic maculopapular rash appeared. Diltiazem therapy was discontinued, leading to resolution of fever within 48 hours. Drug-induced fever should be considered in patients who have unexplained high temperatures during diltiazem therapy. 
Survival of patients with metastases from uveal melanoma. The authors evaluated a series of 145 consecutive patients with metastases from uveal melanoma, after proton beam irradiation, to assess the effect of early diagnosis and treatment for metastases on survival. Metastases were diagnosed between 7 weeks and 8.3 years (median, 2.4 years) after proton beam irradiation. Most patients (n = 94) were symptomatic before diagnosis; the remainder were first detected during screening examination. Liver involvement was documented in nearly all patients (n = 136). The majority of patients had died from metastases by the close of the study (n = 137). Significantly longer survival occurred among patients diagnosed during screening examination (P = 0.004) and among young patients (P = 0.03). The majority of patients received some form of treatment for metastases (69%). Median survival was 2.0 months for patients receiving no treatment compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (P = .0001). However, the overall 1-year survival rate was poor (13%). Prophylactic adjuvant therapy could be explored as a means to increase disease-free survival in patients with uveal melanoma. 
Pharyngeal pouch carcinoma: two unusual cases. Two patients with carcinomata arising in pharyngeal pouches are reported. In one, the tumour was detected preoperatively by a contrast radiographic study. In the second the lesion was a carcinoma in situ. The English literature is reviewed with reference to these two unusual features. 
Carpal tunnel syndrome, subclinical median mononeuropathy, and peripheral polyneuropathy: common early complications of chronic peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Nerve conduction velocity studies were done in median, ulnar, and peroneal nerves, one time each in 46 patients who had been on chronic peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis for varying lengths of time. Only six patients had normal findings; 37 had peripheral polyneuropathy (15 had isolated polyneuropathy; 22 had median nerve dysfunction in addition); 16 had subclinical median mononeuropathy (14 with polyneuropathy, two without); and nine had overt carpal tunnel syndrome (eight with polyneuropathy, one without). Abnormalities were present in seven of the 11 patients studied after one year of dialysis and in 19 of the 24 patients studied after two years of dialysis. Seventeen patients studied after five years of dialysis all had polyneuropathy. Nine patients studied after seven years of dialysis all had median nerve dysfunction. Abnormalities were as common with peritoneal dialysis as with hemodialysis. Nerve dysfunction was independent of the disease underlying renal failure, the side of the dialysis access shunt, and the presence or absence of osteodystrophy. Dialysis patients need frequent nerve conduction studies from the onset of dialysis to identify carpal tunnel syndrome early and to avoid irreversible nerve damage. 
Detection of preclinical Parkinson's disease with PET. Putamen 18F-dopa uptake of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is reduced by at least 35% at onset of symptoms; therefore, positron-emission tomography (PET) can be used to detect preclinical disease in clinically unaffected twins and relatives of patients with PD. Three out of 6 monozygotic and 2 out of 3 dizygotic unaffected PD co-twins have shown reduced putamen 18F-dopa uptake to date. In addition, an intact sibling and a daughter of 1 of 4 siblings with PD both had low putamen 18F-dopa uptake. These preliminary findings suggest there may be a familial component to the etiology of PD. PET can also be used to detect underlying nigral pathology in patients with isolated tremor and patients who become rigid taking dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs). Patients with familial essential tremor have normal, and those with isolated rest tremor have consistently low, putamen 18F-dopa uptake. Drug-induced parkinsonism is infrequently associated with underlying nigral pathology. 
Effects of relief of biliary obstruction on mononuclear phagocyte system function and cell mediated immunity. Obstructive jaundice causes depression of immune system function but it is unclear at present how rapidly immune function recovers after relief of biliary obstruction. To address this issue, we studied 218 Sprague-Dawley rats with common bile duct obstruction. Mononuclear phagocyte function, cell mediated immune function, portal-systemic shunt fraction, liver function tests, and liver histology were evaluated in normal (sham) rats, obstructed rats, and at weekly intervals after relief of biliary obstruction. Hepatic uptake of radiolabelled bacteria was 82 per cent in sham rats and 66 per cent in rats 21 days after CBD obstruction (P less than 0.05). Phagocytic activity returned to normal within 7 days after choledochoduodenostomy. Cell mediated immunity, measured by skin graft rejection, was significantly prolonged in the obstructed group (P less than 0.05) but had returned to normal 7 days after biliary diversion. Return of hepatocellular function, as measured by liver function tests, paralleled recovery of immune function. This study demonstrates prompt recovery of the immune system after internal biliary drainage for obstructive jaundice. This finding is in contrast to previous studies that demonstrated persistent immune suppression months after biliary diversion. These data may have implications concerning the usefulness of internal biliary drainage before surgery in patients with obstructive jaundice. 
Progressive supranuclear palsy: altered sensory processing leads to degraded cognition. We studied the latencies, amplitudes, and scalp distributions of the early and late components of the event-related brain potential (ERP) in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and matched normal controls. In separate choice reaction time (RT) tasks, the subjects pressed buttons to visual stimuli presented randomly at probabilities of either 20/80 or 50/50. Compared with normal controls, PSP patients had significantly reduced amplitudes and increased latencies for both the visual P2 and P300 components at all levels of probability. RTs and percent errors were significantly greater in the patients compared with controls. Neither the amplitude nor latency of the visual N1 component was significantly altered in these patients. There were no significant group differences in the distribution of electrical activity over the scalp for any of these ERP components, a finding which suggests that the neural structures responsible for generating these potentials were intact in these patients. The decreased ERP component amplitudes and increased ERP component latencies, combined with intact scalp distributions and increased RTs and error rates, present a pattern of results suggesting that the stimulus identification or categorization processes in these patients are significantly degraded. 
Gastric emptying after gastric interposition for cancer of the esophagus or hypopharynx. Transhiatal esophagectomy with primary anastomosis to the stomach (gastric pull-up) is an attractive surgical alternative to colic interposition in patients with cancer of the esophagus and hypopharynx. However, the lack of intrinsic gastric peristalsis and complaints by patients of postprandial regurgitation prompted us to measure the effect of body posture on the rates of gastric emptying in these patients. The rates of solid and liquid gastric emptying were measured in 14 patients who had undergone gastric interposition for esophageal and hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Rates of emptying were measured in both the supine and upright position using a dual-isotope radiolabeling technique. In these patients, the rate of gastric emptying of both solids and liquids was significantly slower in the supine position than in the upright position. Emptying in supine patients was also prolonged when compared with supine normal volunteers. Conversely, the upright rate of solid and liquid emptying in the patients was accelerated when compared with published values for upright normal volunteers. We conclude that gastric emptying after gastric interposition is dependent on upright posture after meals. 
Potentially lethal complications of shigellosis. Complications that can lead to death during shigellosis include intestinal as well as systemic manifestations. The former include intestinal perforation, toxic megacolon, and dehydration, and the latter include sepsis, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, seizures and encephalopathy, hemolyticuremic syndrome, pneumonia, and malnutrition. Data on the frequency of these complications come primarily from hospital-based studies, in which sepsis-either with Shigella or with other Enterobacteriaceae-and hypoglycemia are the most common causes of death. Management of these two complications requires broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic treatment of all severely ill, malnourished patients with shigellosis as well as frequent feedings to prevent hypoglycemia. Unfortunately, in developing countries, access to parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents is often limited, and frequent feedings are often precluded by the severe anorexia that is characteristic of shigellosis. Realistic approaches to the reduction of mortality from shigellosis must continue to focus on prevention and early antimicrobial therapy rather than on treatment of established complications. 
The value of the tumor marker CA 15-3 in diagnosing and monitoring breast cancer. A comparative study with carcinoembryonic antigen. To estimate the utility of the tumor-associated antigen CA 15-3 in the diagnosis of patients with breast cancer, this tumor marker was measured preoperatively in 1342 patients. This group included 509 patients with malignant disease (134 breast cancer patients and 375 patients with other malignancies not involving the breast) and 833 patients with benign surgical diseases (95 patients with fibroadenoma of the breast and 738 patients with other benign diseases). The results were compared with those obtained for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the diagnosis of breast cancer. The CA 15-3 level was above normal (25 U/ml) in 31% of the patients with breast cancer, in 22% of patients with other malignancies, and in 9% of patients with benign diseases. The CEA level was elevated in 26% of patients with breast cancer (more than 3 ng/ml). There was a good correlation of CA 15-3 levels with the tumor stage of breast cancer. Both CA 15-3 and CEA also were determined in 671 patients who had received initial curative surgery of breast cancer and who regularly attended our follow-up clinic. The CA 15-3 was found to be more sensitive than CEA in detecting recurrences of breast cancer. In the postcare period, carcinoma recurred in 205 patients. Of these, 73% had CA 15-3 concentrations above 25 U/ml; only 50% had CEA values above 3 ng/ml (P less than 0.0001). Although neither CA 15-3 nor CEA were sensitive enough for the screening and diagnosis of early breast cancer, CA 15-3 was significantly better than CEA in the detection of breast cancer metastases. 
Caesarean section in undiagnosed Eisenmenger's syndrome. Report of a patient with a fatal outcome. An obstetric patient is described in whom the first sign of cardiac disease was unexplained hypoxaemia during emergency anaesthesia for antepartum haemorrhage, with an eventual fatal outcome. The case highlights the importance of patient information at the booking clinic, and the implications of a raised haemaglobin in early pregnancy. 
Fetal phenytoin exposure, hypoplastic nails, and jitteriness. In a prospective study infants born to mothers with epilepsy (n = 61) were found to have an unexpectedly high incidence of congenital anomalies (26/61, 43%) and neonatal conditions (26/61, 43%) compared with controls (0/62, and 6/62, 10%, respectively). There were two neonatal deaths in the study group but none among the controls. Hypoplasia of the finger or toenails was a common congenital anomaly in those infants whose mothers had received phenytoin alone or in combination with other anticonvulsant drugs (11 of 40, 28%). The mean serum phenytoin concentration was higher among mothers of infants with hypoplastic nails than among those with normal nails. Jitteriness was a common neonatal condition affecting infants of epileptic mothers (11 of 61, 18%) but not controls The mean cord serum phenytoin concentrations were similar among jittery and non-jittery infants. At follow up (after excluding one infant with Down's syndrome from the study group) the infants seemed to have developed normally, though one had serious learning difficulties at school. We suggest that hypoplasia of the nails is related to high maternal serum concentrations of phenytoin, and though 18% of infants born to epileptic mothers were jittery compared with no control infants this may not be the result of withdrawal of the drug in all cases. 
Prevalence of epilepsy in Rochester, Minnesota: 1940-1980. The prevalence of epilepsy in Rochester, Minnesota has been determined for a specific date in each of 5 decennial census years. Individuals with a diagnosis of epilepsy (recurrent unprovoked seizures) who were known to have experienced a seizure or who had received antiepileptic medication in the preceding 5 years were considered active prevalence cases. By this definition, the age-adjusted prevalence per 1,000 population, increased steadily from 2.7 in 1940 to 6.8 in 1980. At each of five prevalence dates, for all prevalence cases, 60% had epilepsy manifest by partial seizures, and 75% had no known etiology. Prevalence was higher for males than females for all except the last prevalence day. After 1950, prevalence tended to increase with advancing age and was highest in the oldest age groups. On the average, the 1980 prevalence cases had epilepsy less than 10 years and greater than 50% had their first diagnosis in the first 20 years of life. 
Use of a somatostatin analogue, octreotide acetate, in the management of acute gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease. PURPOSE: Because the secretory diarrhea of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) of the gut induces serious metabolic and nutritional disturbances, this study was initiated to assess the use of a somatostatin analogue, octreotide acetate, as adjunctive therapy for severe GvHD of the gut with massive diarrhea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a pilot study, six patients with biopsy-confirmed acute gut GvHD after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation received octreotide 50 to 250 micrograms three times a day subcutaneously. RESULTS: Three of the six treated patients had a prompt and dramatic reduction in stool volume within 1 to 3 days of initiation of octreotide therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Somatostatin and its analogues have been used successfully in diarrheal states by antagonism of neuropeptide overproduction, although other potential therapeutic mechanisms include inhibition of fluid secretion, enhanced salt absorption, and inhibition of gut motility. Somatostatin and its analogues may be promising adjunctive agents in the treatment of gastrointestinal GvHD, although assessment in a controlled trial will be required to confirm their therapeutic efficacy. 
Steroid receptors in breast cancer. Recent advances in steroid receptor structure and function now indicate that oestrogen binds to the oestrogen receptor (ER) molecule at a specific site, denoted region E. This allows binding of the oestrogen-ER complex to DNA via cysteine residues in region C of the ER molecule, which tetrahedrally co-ordinate zinc. This modulates transcription and stimulates cell growth. A number of newly discovered growth factors are also regulated by ER, as is the progesterone receptor. Steroid receptor concentrations in tissues can now be measured on smaller tissue samples using enzyme immunoassay or on cells obtained by fine needle aspiration using monoclonal antibody technology. The prognostic value of steroid receptor is limited, but still constitutes the best marker for predicting response to endocrine therapy. The role of steroid receptors in selecting patients for adjuvant therapy is discussed. 
Nimodipine and bradycardia in acute stroke--drug or disease? A patient who had suffered an acute ischemic stroke experienced bradycardia while being treated with nimodipine 80 mg tid. This became evident after the initiation of nimodipine and progressed, leading to the drug being discontinued after three days of therapy. The bradycardia resolved shortly after the treatment was terminated and normal heart rate was maintained throughout 23 days of hospitalization and in subsequent outpatient follow-up. Although nimodipine-induced bradycardia is possible, hemispheric cerebral infarction may also cause transient bradyarrhythmias in the acute stroke period. There is a need to monitor the heart rate and rhythm of all acute stroke patients, especially those receiving nimodipine. 
Glomerulopathy in patient with Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate renal structure in a child with Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism), who at 10 yr of age was noted to have hypertension, microalbuminuria, and enlarged kidneys, a renal biopsy was performed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The renal biopsy tissue was evaluated by light and electron microscopy with standard stereological techniques to measure glomerular volume, glomerular basement membrane width, fractional mesangial volume, and peripheral capillary filtering surface density. RESULTS: On renal biopsy, there was a marked increase in glomerular volume, glomerular basement width, and mesangial volume, findings similar to those seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: This patient with marked insulin resistance associated with Donohue syndrome demonstrates renal and glomerular enlargement and morphometric glomerular changes similar to those seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy. In unusual syndromes with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, renal structural and functional changes typical of traditional diabetes mellitus may be seen. 
Pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery: a forgotten complication of tonsillitis? Pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery is an uncommon but potentially lethal complication of tonsillar or peritonsillar sepsis, which appears to have occurred more frequently prior to the introduction of penicillin. Management of such a case is discussed, and a literature review presented. 
Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in head and neck surgery. Patients undergoing head and neck surgery often have significant pain because of the anatomic area involved, the nature of the surgery and trauma associated with the anesthesia and surgery, or the use of packing postoperatively. A patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) infuser is available that allows the patient to direct delivery of their own analgesia. The physician orders the narcotic analgesic dose to be given, the interval between doses, and the total amount of analgesic to be delivered over 4 hours. The patient simply presses a button connected to the analgesic infuser, which delivers a predetermined intravenous dose of the particular analgesic. The infuser is then "locked out" for an interval of 10 to 15 minutes before the patient can direct another dose of medicine. This system allows the patients to initiate intravenous delivery of their narcotic analgesic, and maintain control of pain, using small incremental doses of the analgesic agent. This PCA pump has been used successfully in a number of patients undergoing various general, head and neck, and facial aesthetic procedures. The general concept of the PCA pump, guidelines for use, and contraindications are presented. 
A nine-year experience with crossover femoro-femoro-popliteal sequential bypass. Multisegmental arterial occlusive disease may require a combined inflow and outflow procedure for optimal treatment of limb ischemia. Twenty-one patients with unilateral iliac artery stenosis or occlusion and ipsilateral superficial femoral artery occlusion underwent crossover femoro-femoro-popliteal sequential bypass during a 9-year period. Seventeen operations were for limb salvage. Patency rates were determined separately for each segment of the bypass. Primary patency rates for the femoro-femoral segment were 89%, 83%, and 57% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Primary patency rates for the femoro-popliteal segments were 68%, 62%, and 40% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Limb salvage rates were 100%, 90%, and 77% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. This experience indicates that femoro-femoro-popliteal bypass is an effective treatment in selected patients with severe ischemia due to combined iliac artery and superficial femoral artery disease. 
Initial clinical study of indium-111-labeled clone 110 anticarcinoembryonic antigen antibody in patients with colorectal cancer. A murine monoclonal antibody directed against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was labeled with indium-111 (111In) by means of a benzylisothiocyanate derivative of diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) and used for clinical radioimmunodetection studies. Twenty-one patients having a history of surgically resected colorectal cancer and rising serum CEA levels suggestive of tumor recurrence were studied. Patients were infused over 20 minutes with 5, 10, or 20 mg of the monoclonal antibody labeled with 5 mCi of 111In. The mean radiochemical purity was greater than 96%. No toxicity was seen. The stability of the radiolabel on antibody in patient serum was demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with autoradiography, and immunoprecipitation for up to 96 hours after infusion. Tumor sites were identified in 20 of 21 patients. Sites of antibody accumulation in 20 patients were confirmed as tumor either by resection at laparotomy (16 patients) or fine-needle biopsy (four patients). Nine patients who had the identified lesion resected or irradiated showed return of the serum CEA antigen level to normal or near normal values. In the absence of high levels of circulating CEA (greater than 500 ng/mL), the disappearance of radioactivity from patient serum demonstrated first order elimination kinetics, with a mean half-life of 38 hours. The serum half-life was not affected by the dose of antibody administered or by serum CEA titers below 500 ng/mL. Despite a mean liver uptake of 18% injected dose (ID) 24 hours after administration, hepatic metastases were easily visualized as areas of increased uptake of radioactivity. Radioimmunodetection of recurrent colorectal cancer, not detected by computed tomographic (CT) scans, appears achievable with this agent. This may allow successful clinical intervention in selected patients. 
Detection of preclinical Parkinson's disease with PET. Putamen 18F-dopa uptake of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is reduced by at least 35% at onset of symptoms; therefore, positron-emission tomography (PET) can be used to detect preclinical disease in clinically unaffected twins and relatives of patients with PD. Three out of 6 monozygotic and 2 out of 3 dizygotic unaffected PD co-twins have shown reduced putamen 18F-dopa uptake to date. In addition, an intact sibling and a daughter of 1 of 4 siblings with PD both had low putamen 18F-dopa uptake. These preliminary findings suggest there may be a familial component to the etiology of PD. PET can also be used to detect underlying nigral pathology in patients with isolated tremor and patients who become rigid taking dopamine-receptor blocking agents (DRBAs). Patients with familial essential tremor have normal, and those with isolated rest tremor have consistently low, putamen 18F-dopa uptake. Drug-induced parkinsonism is infrequently associated with underlying nigral pathology. 
Optochiasmal arachnoiditis following muslin wrapping of ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms. Optochiasmal arachnoiditis has been reported following treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms, particularly arising from the anterior communicating artery. It has been suggested that the accompanying loss of vision is due to a muslin-induced optic neuropathy. This paper considers five cases of this condition; the response to steroid therapy was beneficial in three cases. A review of the literature is included. The arachnoiditis is considered to be due to an inflammatory response to muslin gauze placed close to the optic nerves and chiasm. 
Underdiagnosis and poor documentation of acute confusional states in elderly hip fracture patients. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of diagnosis and documentation of acute confusional states (ACS) in the medical records of patients with hip fracture. DESIGN: The diagnosis of ACS in two prospective clinical studies was compared to its diagnosis in the medical records of the same patients on the same hospitalization. In order to determine if the simultaneous prospective study influences the diagnostic and documentary practices evidenced in the medical records, a further comparison was done by reviewing medical records of two series of patients seen some years prior to the prospective studies. SETTING: Patients with femoral neck fractures treated at a department of orthopedic surgery in a university hospital and one retrospective control sample from a department of general surgery in a county hospital. SUBJECTS: Two prospective samples of patients 65 years and older treated for femoral neck fractures (n = 111 and n = 57, respectively) and two earlier retrospective samples (n = 66 and n = 68, respectively). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All comparisons showed that both physicians and nurses diagnosed ACS unsatisfactorily and documented the patients' mental status poorly. The analysis of the two retrospective medical record control samples gave the same results. Neither the physicians nor the nurses used any kind of diagnostic instrument to detect cognitive disorders in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: ACS is a common and severe complication in elderly people treated for femoral neck fractures. Acute confusional states have, by definition, one or more causes that can often be identified and treated. Poor assessment and documentation is a threat to the patients as a correct diagnosis of ACS is a prerequisite for further assessment of its underlying causes and the consequent necessary medical and nursing care. 
Assessment of coronary artery patency after thrombolytic therapy: accurate prediction utilizing the combined analysis of three noninvasive markers. The predictability of patency of the infarct-related artery assessed by means of three noninvasive easily obtainable markers was prospectively examined in 82 patients undergoing thrombolysis for their first myocardial infarction. Positive noninvasive markers were defined as follows: 1) early peak creatine kinase (CK) activity less than or equal to 12 h after the start of thrombolysis; 2) greater than or equal to 50% reduction in ST segment elevation; and 3) occurrence of reperfusion arrhythmias within the 1st 90 min of thrombolytic therapy. In 63 (77%) of the 82 patients, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade II/III reperfusion was achieved within the 1st 90 min as assessed by coronary angiography. Separate analysis of each marker revealed the following respective values for sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value regarding prediction of coronary artery patency: CK peak less than or equal to 12 h: 84%, 95%, 98% and 64%; reduction of the ST segment elevation greater than or equal to 50%: 60%, 95%, 97% and 42%; and reperfusion arrhythmias: 63%, 89%, 95% and 43%. The combined analysis of all three markers utilizing a logistic regression procedure showed that CK peak (p = 0.0001) and resolution of the ST segment elevation (p = 0.005), but not the occurrence of reperfusion arrhythmias (p = 0.26), were independent predictors of vessel patency. From this logistic regression procedure, a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 90%, a positive predictive value of 97% and a negative predictive value of 100% for prediction of coronary artery patency were obtained. 
Biology of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from malignant disease in Western society. Apart from the fortunate few patients who present with a resectable small pancreatic adenocarcinoma, conventional treatment offers no hope of cure and has little palliative value. Over the past two decades major steps have been made in our understanding of the biology of pancreatic growth and neoplasia. This review sets out to explore these advances, firstly in the regulation of normal pancreatic growth, and secondly the mechanism which may be involved in malignant change of the exocrine pancreas. From an understanding of this new biology, new treatment strategies may be possible for patients with pancreatic cancer. 
Delayed plasma clearance of phenylalanine and tyrosine in elderly men. The plasma levels of 17 amino acids were measured in three groups of men: healthy young men, healthy elderly men, and demented tube-fed elderly men living in a nursing home, prior to, and again 2, 4, and 6 hours after the consumption of a standard protein-containing meal. The standard meal provided per kilogram of body weight 8.3 calories, 0.33 grams of protein, 0.90 grams of carbohydrate, and 0.37 grams of fat. The concentrations of all amino acids, except tryptophan, rose significantly at 2 hours and returned to baseline by 6 hours. Plasma phenylalanine and tyrosine were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher at 2 hours in the two groups of elderly men than in the young healthy men. In other respects the pre- and post-prandial amino acid profiles were not influenced by age. The ratio, tyrosine/other large neutral amino acids (tyr/LNAA), was significantly higher in both elderly groups than in the young men at nearly all time points before and after the test meal. It was generally higher in the demented older men than in the healthy older men. The data demonstrated a delayed plasma clearance of phenylalanine and tyrosine in old age. The elevated plasma tyr/LNAA ratio in the elderly men may have tended to augment an entry of tyrosine, the precursor of norepinephrine and dopamine, into their brains. 
Hospital characteristics associated with adverse events and substandard care. To explore the epidemiology of adverse events (AEs), which were defined as injuries due to medical treatment, and that subset of AEs caused by negligence, we studied interhospital variation in these outcomes in a sample of 31,000 medical records drawn from a random selection of 51 hospitals in New York in 1984. We found a substantial variation in both AE rates (0.2% to 7.9%; mean, 3.2%) and the percentage of AEs due to negligence (1% to 60%; mean, 24.9%) among hospitals. Univariate analyses of AEs revealed that primary teaching institutions had significantly higher rates (4.1%) and rural hospitals had significantly lower ones (1.0%). The percentage of AEs due to negligence was lower in primary teaching (10.7%) and for-profit (9.5%) hospitals and was significantly higher in hospitals with predominantly (greater than 80%) minority patients who had been discharged (37%). These findings were corroborated by multivariate analysis. Our results suggest that AEs and negligence are not randomly distributed and that certain types of hospitals have significantly higher rates of injuries due to substandard care. These observations may represent an important improvement on existing measures of quality because they take into account the fact that some hospitals' populations may be at risk of suffering a poor outcome. 
Dobutamine digital echocardiography for detecting coronary artery disease. To assess the value of dobutamine echocardiography for detecting coronary artery disease (CAD), 70 men (mean age 62 +/- 8 years) presenting for coronary angiography were prospectively studied. Dobutamine (2.5 to 40 micrograms/kg/min) was infused in 3-minute stages. Digital echocardiograms were recorded on-line at baseline, during low- and high-dose dobutamine infusion, and at recovery. An echocardiogram positive for CAD was defined as one showing a new wall motion abnormality induced by dobutamine. Compared with coronary angiography, the overall sensitivity of dobutamine echocardiography for detecting CAD was 86%, specificity 95% and accuracy 89%. The sensitivity for detecting 3-vessel CAD was 100%, 89% for 2-vessel and 69% for 1-vessel CAD. The accuracy of predicting multivessel disease by 2 methods was 71% and 84%, respectively. Heart rate at the echocardiographic ischemic threshold was lower in patients with 3- and 2-vessel CAD versus 1-vessel CAD (89 +/- 17, 95 +/- 18 and 118 +/- 18 beats/min, respectively, p less than 0.01); rate-pressure product was also lower in patients with 3- and 2-vessel CAD versus 1-vessel CAD (12.7 +/- 3.6, 13.7 +/- 2.8 and 18.9 +/- 44 x 10(3) beats/min x mm Hg, respectively, p less than 0.01). Heart rate was the most important physiologic determinant of ischemia induced by dobutamine. There were no major complications during the study. Thus, dobutamine digital echocardiography is an excellent test for identifying CAD and should be beneficial in patients unable to exercise. 
Ifosfamide extrapyramidal neurotoxicity. Ifosfamide-associated central nervous system toxicity has been reported in 5% to 30% of patients treated with ifosfamide. Its pattern is characterized by metabolic encephalopathy with confusion, blurred vision, mutism, auditory or visual paranoid hallucinations, seizures, and rarely coma. The biochemical cause of the neurotoxicity is not understood completely, but it is thought to result from an accumulation of drug metabolites with direct central nervous system effects. A case of ifosfamide neurotoxicity is reported that had unusual extrapyramidal features in a patient treated with a 5-day course of infused ifosfamide. Although usually spontaneously reversible with cessation of drug administration, ifosfamide neurotoxicity occasionally has been associated with prolonged psychopathologic sequelae. Death from irreversible encephalopathy has also been reported rarely. The authors believe that classic extrapyramidal symptoms should be considered to be a part of the neurotoxic profile of ifosfamide. 
Activity of doxorubicin and cisplatin combination chemotherapy in patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma. An Italian Lung Cancer Task Force (FONICAP) Phase II study. Twenty-six symptomatic patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma (DMPM) were enrolled in a Phase II Italian Lung Cancer Task Force (FONICAP) study to assess the activity and toxicity of doxorubicin and cisplatin combination chemotherapy. The drug schedule was as follows; 60 mg/m2 of doxorubicin and 60 mg/m2 of cisplatin both given intravenously (IV) on day 1 every 3 to 4 weeks. Of the 24 evaluable patients, 6 objective partial responses (25%; 95% confidence limits, 9.77% to 46.71%) were observed. Twelve of 24 patients (50%), including 6 with no radiologic evidence of response, had a clinical improvement as demonstrated by an objective reduction of symptom or performance status scores along treatment. The overall median survival time was 10 months. Toxicity was mild and dose reductions or suspensions were not required. The combination of doxorubicin and cisplatin is effective and well tolerated. It might be considered for palliation of symptomatic patients with DMPM. 
Effect of potassium intake on blood pressure. Epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical studies suggest that potassium is an important regulator of blood pressure. Surveys conducted in widely divergent geographic locations indicate higher prevalence of hypertension in populations ingesting diets low in potassium. Amelioration of hypokalemia lowers blood pressure in mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension in rats and in essential hypertensive patients receiving thiazide diuretics. We observed that in normotensive subjects ingesting normal amounts of sodium, short-term potassium depletion increases the mean arterial pressure from 90.9 +/- 2.2 mm Hg to 95.0 +/- 2.2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, acute sodium loading increases blood pressure in potassium-depleted subjects but it had no effect in subjects ingesting normal amounts of potassium. Preliminary studies indicate that short-term potassium depletion also elevates blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Potassium supplementation lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients ingesting normal amounts of sodium. Blacks appear to be more sensitive to the hypotensive effects of potassium. The mechanism of potassium-induced changes in blood pressure is not well understood. Potassium depletion consistently induces sodium retention. The hypertensive effects of potassium depletion and hypotensive effects of potassium supplementation are not observed when sodium intake is kept low. Direct vasoconstrictive effects of hypokalemia may contribute to the pressor effect of potassium depletion. The role of altered vascular sensitivity to vasoactive hormones and alterations in divalent cation metabolism in mediating the potassium-induced changes in blood pressure require further study. 
A phase I trial of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta alone and in combination with myelosuppressive doses of 5-fluorouracil in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. We studied escalating doses of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) alone and after a myelosuppressive dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Transient neutropenia, monocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia were observed followed by a 1.3- to 6.0-fold (mean, 3.46-fold) dose-dependent neutrophil leukocytosis (P less than .00001) on the days of IL-1 beta administration. Increases in platelet counts were observed at a median of 14 days (range, 6 to 23) after IL-1 beta administration. Transient hypoglycemia, rebound hyperglycemia, elevations in serum cortisol, and C-reactive protein were observed. Side effects included fever, rigors, and headache in the majority of patients. Hypotension was observed in three of five patients at the highest dose level (0.1 micrograms/kg) and was dose-limiting. Fewer days of neutropenia were noted after 5-FU plus IL-1 beta than after 5-FU alone; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. These data show that IL-1 beta has stimulatory effects in human hematopoiesis. 
CT of acute pancreatitis: correlation between lack of contrast enhancement and pancreatic necrosis. This study was performed to determine if a correlation exists between pancreatic parenchymal enhancement or lack thereof on contrast-enhanced CT and surgical evidence of pancreatic necrosis. Accurate CT assessment of pancreatic vascular perfusion would be helpful in preoperative planning before pancreatic debridement and necrosectomy. The CT scans and medical records were blindly and retrospectively reviewed in 13 patients with the operative diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. In all cases, CT examinations preceded surgery within 72 hr. Surgical and pathologic findings served as the gold standards for the diagnosis of pancreatic necrosis. Seven (54%) of 13 patients had a region or regions of parenchymal necrosis within the head, body, and/or tail of the pancreas seen during surgery. All seven of these patients had no pancreatic enhancement on CT in at least one region of the pancreas (CT sensitivity = 100%). In four of the seven, two regions were found to be necrotic at surgery, but only one of the two segments did not enhance on CT scans. In three of the seven patients, lack of contrast enhancement on CT (no enhancement of the pancreatic head and body in two patients and throughout the gland in another) correlated with necrosis in the same regions at surgery. The remaining six (46%) patients, who had peripancreatic or small, focal, and/or superficial areas of pancreatic necrosis at surgery, had normal pancreatic enhancement on CT. Our results show that regions of pancreatic necrosis found surgically correlate with lack of enhancement of pancreatic parenchyma on CT. Peripancreatic necrosis and minor areas of focal or superficial parenchymal necrosis were not detected on CT. 
Psammomatous melanotic schwannoma: an additional component of Carney's complex. Report of a case. The authors report a case of Carney's complex (the complex of myxomas, spotty pigmentation, and endocrine overactivity) in a 32-year-old white man. Psammomatous melanotic schwannoma has recently been included as a component of this disorder. The complex was recognized after a psammomatous melanotic schwannoma was resected from the sacral canal. Subsequent echocardiography revealed ventricular cardiac myxomata. Resection of these lesions was successfully performed. Review of previous history and pathologic material further supported the diagnosis. The authors conclude that recognition of each component as part of the syndrome is of crucial importance, because it may prevent a fatal outcome. A family screening program should be performed in each case. 
Neurogenic sarcoma of the sinonasal tract. Five cases of a rare malignant sinonasal tumour of neurofibromatous nature are described. The term neurogenic sarcoma (or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour) is advocated instead of malignant schwannoma. The clinicopathological features of this tumour are described, and the different diagnosis are discussed. The necessity of using immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of sinonasal tumours of fibromatous nature is emphasized. The clinical management consists of radical surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Clinically there seems to be a high-grade and a low-grade type of sinonasal neurogenic sarcoma, however, this could not be distinguished histologically in the present series. 
Relative efficacy of antithrombin compared with antiplatelet agents in accelerating coronary thrombolysis and preventing early reocclusion. BACKGROUND. Optimal coronary thrombolysis should be prompt and persistent. Although activation of platelets and increased thrombin activity have been associated with clinical thrombolysis, the role of each in delaying thrombolysis or inducing early coronary reocclusion has been difficult to define. METHODS AND RESULTS. In conscious dogs with coronary thrombosis induced by electrical current, we assessed the impact on the rapidity of thrombolysis and the incidence of reocclusion of two types of adjunctive treatment given concomitantly with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA): 1) inhibition of platelet function with a peptide mimetic antagonist of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors or with lysine acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 2) inhibition of thrombin activity with recombinant hirudin or with heparin. ASA but not the receptor antagonist shortened the time to thrombolysis with t-PA (20 +/- 13 [mean +/- SD] minutes with ASA, 36 +/- 15 minutes with receptor antagonist, and 43 +/- 16 minutes with the saline control). Reocclusion occurred promptly after completion of the infusion of t-PA in all seven dogs given saline. Reocclusion was delayed and prevented in some dogs within 90 minutes after the end of the infusion of t-PA by both antiplatelet agents but still occurred in 42% despite continued inhibition of platelet function (i.e., three of six dogs given ASA and two of six given receptor antagonist). In contrast, inhibition of thrombin activity with recombinant hirudin in a dose that prolonged the partial thromboplastin time modestly (1.5-2-fold) resulted in accelerated lysis (19 +/- 10 minutes) and prevention of reocclusion in each of six dogs. Heparin given in doses that elicited similar prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time did not accelerate lysis nor prevent reocclusion, which occurred in five of six dogs. CONCLUSIONS. Inhibition of thrombin by recombinant hirudin facilitates thrombolysis and maintains patency of coronary arteries recanalized with t-PA particularly effectively. The benefit conferred may reflect direct anticoagulant effects plus diminished activation of platelets secondary to decreased thrombin activity. 
Characterization of the structure of the erythropoietin receptor by ligand blotting. Erythropoietin (Epo) regulates the growth and differentiation of erythroid cells by binding to a specific receptor. We characterized the native Epo receptor on erythroleukemia cell lines by ligand blotting. Solubilized cell membrane proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with 125I-Epo. Specificity was demonstrated by inhibition of 125I-Epo binding by unlabeled excess Epo but not other peptide growth factors and by the cellular distribution of the Epo binding protein. A single membrane protein of 61 Kd +/- 4 Kd was sufficient to bind 125I Epo in both human (OCIM2, K562) and murine (GM979, Rauscher, DA-1) cell lines. This finding is consistent with the predicted size of the Epo receptor from the murine cDNA clone. However, chemical crosslinking of 125I-Epo to its receptor has identified two Epo binding proteins of 105 Kd and 85 Kd. This difference may occur because the receptor is size fractionated before Epo binding in the ligand blot, but after Epo binding in crosslinking studies. Ligand blotting demonstrates that the native Epo receptor is composed of a single 61-Kd Epo binding protein, and suggests the presence of additional proteins of 20 to 25 Kd that associate with the receptor after Epo binding. 
Activation signals leading to proliferation of normal and leukemic CD3+ large granular lymphocytes. The activation signals leading to proliferation of normal and leukemic CD3+ large granular lymphocytes (LGL) were studied in vitro. Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) alone (P less than .01) and recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) alone (P less than .01) caused significant stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from four CD3+ LGL leukemia patients, as measured in a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. Recombinant interleukin-4 (IL-4) alone had no effect (P = .11). The combination signals of anti-CD3 MoAb and either IL-2 or IL-4 produced a proliferative response greater than anti-CD3 MoAb alone (P less than .01) or lymphokine alone (P less than .01). Leukemic LGL, purified by two-color sorting, were subsequently activated by anti-CD3 MoAb and IL-2 and assessed for DNA content by viable Hoechst No. 33342 (HO) staining. Results of these studies demonstrated that leukemic LGL were stimulated directly by anti-CD3 MoAb and IL-2, with the percentage of cells in cell cycle (S + G2/M) ranging from 16% to 72%. Normal CD3+ LGL were also stimulated to enter the cell cycle by anti-CD3 and IL-2. These results show that leukemic LGL proliferate in vitro after activation through the T-cell receptor and/or lymphokine. 
Circulatory adaptation to orthostatic stress in healthy 10-14-year-old children investigated in a general practice. 1. The magnitude and time course of circulatory adaptation to active standing were investigated in healthy premenarchic girls and boys (n = 24; 10-14 years old) by non-invasive measurement of heart rate and continuous finger blood pressure (Finapres). 2. Four subjects (two girls, two boys) showed presyncopal symptoms after 4-9 min of free standing. 3. In the 20 non-fainting subjects, changes in blood pressure and heart rate upon standing did not differ between girls (n = 10) and boys (n = 10). In the initial phase of standing (first 30 s) systolic and diastolic blood pressures dropped by 22 +/- 14 (mean +/- SD) and 16 +/- 7 mmHg, respectively, at 8 +/- 2 s. Blood pressure subsequently recovered and showed an overshoot in all subjects. The transient drop in blood pressure was accompanied by an increase in heart rate of 40 +/- 7 beats/min. These characteristic transient changes were not observed with passive head-up tilt. During the early steady-state phase (2 min), systolic blood pressure was similar to the supine value and diastolic blood pressure rose by 11 +/- 5 mmHg. Heart rate increased by 25 +/- 11 beats/min. In six of the subjects (three girls, three boys) the increase in heart rate exceeded 30 beats/min (postural tachycardia). Little further changes were observed during prolonged (10 min) standing. 
Fetal cephaloceles: diagnosis with US. The prenatal sonograms of 15 fetuses with cephaloceles (13 occipital, one ethmoidal, and one frontoparietal) were retrospectively reviewed. The prognosis for fetuses with cephaloceles was poor: Only three of 14 with follow-up were born alive (21%), and all are likely to be handicapped. Karyotypes were abnormal in four of nine fetuses tested (44%). Associated cranial abnormalities observed in various numbers of fetuses included ventriculomegaly, the "lemon" sign, a flat basioccipital, "beaked" tectum, and bone defect. A wide variety of neural and nonneural anomalies were associated with cephaloceles. At least one sonographically observed concomitant neural or nonneural axis abnormality or an abnormal karyotype was present in nine of 15 fetuses (60%). Some associated neural malformations noted pathologically were not observed prenatally. Cranial meningoceles were not accurately distinguished from encephaloceles sonographically, and they also were associated with a poor prognosis. Comparison of findings in fetuses with cephaloceles with those of 15 fetuses with cystic hygromas revealed that the two abnormalities can usually be distinguished by the relationship of the mass with the neck and by other cranial findings present in fetuses with cephaloceles but absent in association with cystic hygromas. 
Classification and natural history of clinically identifiable subtypes of cerebral infarction. We describe the incidence and natural history of four clinically identifiable subgroups of cerebral infarction in a community-based study of 675 patients with first-ever stroke. Of 543 patients with a cerebral infarct, 92 (17%) had large anterior circulation infarcts with both cortical and subcortical involvement (total anterior circulation infarcts, TACI); 185 (34%) had more restricted and predominantly cortical infarcts (partial anterior circulation infarcts, PACI); 129 (24%) had infarcts clearly associated with the vertebrobasilar arterial territory (posterior circulation infarcts, POCI); and 137 (25%) had infarcts confined to the territory of the deep perforating arteries (lacunar infarcts, LACI). There were striking differences in natural history between the groups. The TACI group had a negligible chance of good functional outcome and mortality was high. More than twice as many deaths were due to the complications of immobility than to direct neurological sequelae of the infarct. Patients in the PACI group were much more likely to have an early recurrent stroke than were patients in other groups. Those in the POCI group were at greater risk of a recurrent stroke later in the first year after the index event but had the best chance of a good functional outcome. Despite the small anatomical size of the infarcts in the LACI group, many patients remained substantially handicapped. The findings have important implications for the planning of stroke treatment trials and suggest that various therapies could be directed specifically at the subgroups. 
Hepatocellular expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 in chronic hepatitis. T lymphocyte-mediated cytolytic immune reactions are considered a major cause of hepatocyte injury in chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis. To further investigate local immune responses, we studied the expression of lymphocyte antigens and cell-cell interaction molecules known to be involved in effector-target cell interactions by light and electron microscopy in liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic viral and autoimmune hepatitis. CD8+ lymphocytes were found to be the predominant population of cells in the inflammatory infiltrate in chronic hepatitis B and non-A, non-B hepatitis. In contrast, CD4+ cells constituted a comparably higher proportion of cells and were more numerous than CD8+ cells in chronic autoimmune hepatitis. In both viral and autoimmune hepatitis, a substantial portion of lymphocytes expressed activation antigens such as T11/3 (CD2R) and IL-2-R (CD25). Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 (CD58), which mediates lymphocyte adhesion and activation and is the natural ligand of the CD2/T11 lymphocyte surface receptor, could be demonstrated on endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Hepatocellular lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3 expression in chronic hepatitis showed membranous and cytoplasmic staining of hepatocytes and had a positive correlation with the degree of inflammatory activity. These results suggest that effector-target interactions between hepatocytes and lymphocytes mediated by the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-3/CD2 pathway play a role in chronic inflammatory liver disease. Possible functional consequences of this interaction include enhancement of antigen-specific immune reactions and antigen-independent mechanisms of T cell activation, which may contribute considerably to the degree of inflammatory activity and tissue damage in chronic hepatitis. 
IgG reactivity in the spinal cord and motor cortex in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The spinal cord and motor cortex of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were examined with immunohistochemical methods for the presence of IgG. In 13 of 15 spinal cords, a population of motoneurons stained positively for IgG in a granular pattern, characteristic of binding to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In 6 of 11 motor cortices, a proportion of pyramidal cells also stained positively for IgG. No such reactivity was noted in motoneurons of control human tissues, although positive IgG staining was present in astrocytes of ALS and control specimens. Reactive microglia and/or macrophages were detected in the territory of degenerating pyramidal tracts and ventral horns. The surface of most of these cells stained positively for IgG, and 50% stained positively for HLA-DR. The accumulation of IgG in motoneurons and the presence of immunologically active macrophages provide additional evidence for the participation of immunologic factors in the pathogenesis of ALS. 
Survival of patients with well-differentiated astrocytomas diagnosed in the era of computed tomography. We report 25 verified cases of well-differentiated cerebral astrocytomas in adults treated between 1978 and 1988. All patients were diagnosed by computed tomographic (CT) scans, with 5 undergoing a craniotomy for debulking and 20 undergoing a biopsy alone. The median survival for the entire group was 8.2 years, the longest survival yet reported for a series of patients with these tumors. A review of the literature suggests that the longer survival observed in more recent series is the result of the earlier diagnosis of tumors afforded by modern brain imaging. Twenty of our patients presented with seizures in the absence of any other focal findings and would probably not have had a biopsy in the era before CT scans until their tumors had progressed. Only 8% of our patients had papilledema at the time of presentation, in contrast to almost half of the patients with low-grade astrocytomas reported before 1975, supporting the hypothesis that patients in the CT era are diagnosed earlier. None of our patients died from progressive low-grade disease. One patient died from a squamous cell cancer, and 7 died as a consequence of their tumors dedifferentiating into a more malignant astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme, with a median time of approximately 5 years after the diagnosis. Our findings, together with the available data in the literature, suggest that death from a focal low-grade astrocytoma, in the absence of malignant degeneration, may be a rare event. Consequently, future therapeutic efforts should be targeted at preventing dedifferentiation. 
A comparison of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. A comparison and survival analysis of 203 patients (21%) with adenocarcinoma and 756 (79%) with squamous cell cancer of the cervix for the time period 1970-1985 is reported. The mean number of new cases of adenocarcinoma (N = 12) remained the same, while squamous cell cases decreased from 57 to 32. The clinical features were compared; oral contraceptive usage, node status, diabetes, and symptoms of bleeding were not related to cell type. Nulliparity was more frequent in patients with adenocarcinoma, whereas obesity and smoking were more frequent in patients with squamous cell cancer. Survival in stage I was significantly influenced by the cell type. Patients with stage I squamous cell disease had a 90% 5-year survival, compared with 60% for adenocarcinoma (P less than .0001). Other features that influenced survival included node status (P = .001), poor differentiation of tumor histology (P = .001), diabetes (P = .001), and Papanicolaou smear interval (P = .001). Patients undergoing radical hysterectomy were analyzed separately, and adenocarcinoma cell type significantly influenced survival (P = .0008). Patients with stage II squamous cell disease had a 62% survival, compared with 47% for adenocarcinoma (P = .01); patients with stage III squamous cell disease had a 36% survival, compared with 8% for adenocarcinoma (P = .002). The percentage of adenocarcinoma has increased because of the decreased number of patients with squamous cell disease. Stage-for-stage survival is significantly decreased for patients with adenocarcinoma as opposed to squamous cell disease. 
Renoduodenal fistula in a patient with chronic nephrostomy drainage: a case report. We describe the occurrence of a renoduodenal fistula related to a nephrostomy tube in a patient with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis and renal calculi. The patient was successfully treated by nephrectomy. Etiological, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects are discussed. 
Piezogenic wrist papules: a common and asymptomatic finding. The first description of piezogenic wrist papules is presented. Twenty-nine persons were examined; 76% had pedal papules and 86% had wrist papules. Piezogenic papules are a common, nonhereditary finding and are not secondary to an inherent connective tissue defect. 
Effects of radiation on fixation of non-cemented porous-coated implants in a canine model. A non-weight-bearing porous-coated rod was implanted bilaterally in the proximal part of the humerus in thirty-five adult male mongrel dogs. In all of the animals, one limb was treated with radiation and the opposite limb served as the control. In twenty-one animals, the dose was 1000 centigrays (rads) and in fourteen, it was 500 centigrays. The strength of fixation and the volume fraction of ingrowth of bone were determined two, four, and eight weeks after the operation in the group that received 1000 centigrays and two and four weeks after the operation in the group that received 500 centigrays. Treatment with 500 centigrays had no significant effect on the strength of fixation or the amount of ingrowth of bone. In contrast, at two weeks, treatment with 1000 centigrays had reduced the strength of fixation to 50 per cent of the control value (p less than 0.01), although, at four and eight weeks, the strength of fixation was not significantly different than that in the control limb. The amount of ingrowth of bone in the irradiated limb was significantly reduced at two weeks (30 per cent of the control value) (p less than 0.01), four weeks (70 per cent of the control value) (p less than 0.05), and eight weeks (56 per cent of the control value) (p less than 0.05). 
Esophagogastric neoplasms: palliation with a modified gianturco stent. Self-expanding metallic stents of a modified Gianturco design were used for palliative treatment of malignant esophagogastric strictures. Over a 10-month period, 10 stents were placed in nine patients. All patients with severe dysphagia due to malignant strictures in whom all other treatment options had failed were candidates for these stents. Neither extensive length of esophageal involvement nor complete esophageal obstruction was a contraindication. All stents were placed with fluoroscopic guidance without any technical failures or procedural morbidity or mortality. Mild reflux occurred in three patients in whom the stent tubes straddled the distal esophageal sphincter. Five patients were still alive after 1-8 months. The remaining four patients died 6-28 weeks after stent placement; all stents were patent at the time of death. These stents are easy to insert, safe, and reasonably effective for short-term palliative treatment of esophagogastric neoplasms. 
Transduodenal exploration of the common bile duct in patients with nondilated ducts. Exploration of the small common bile duct can be technically difficult and is associated with a significant risk of ductal injury or late stricture, or both. Transduodenal common duct exploration after sphincteroplasty (TCDE/S) is an alternative method of duct exploration that avoids choledochotomy. Cholecystectomy followed by TCDE/S was performed upon 28 patients with nondilated ducts and suspected choledocholithiasis. Common duct stones were retrieved in 17 patients. Failure to retrieve stones in the remaining 11 patients was attributed to either false-positive results of cholangiography, forceful passage of stones into the duodenum during the initial insertion of a Fogarty catheter through the cystic duct or a false-negative finding at duct exploration. There was no perioperative mortality. Two patients had asymptomatic postoperative hyperamylasemia. One patient had postoperative pancreatitis, hyperbilirubinemia and cholangitis that resolved with antibiotic therapy by the eighth postoperative day. Other complications included wound infection, delayed gastric emptying, pneumonia and otitis media. The over-all morbidity rate was 28.6 per cent. Long term follow-up was obtained in all 28 patients. All patients in the follow-up group are free of recurrent biliary tract disease. TCDE/S appears to be a safe and effective method of exploring the nondilated common bile duct. 
Acute catastrophic complications of balloon aortic valvuloplasty. The Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry Investigators. Among the initial 492 patients who underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty as part of the Mansfield Investigational Device Exemption Protocol, 31 (6.3%) had acute catastrophic complications. These included ventricular perforation in nine (1.8%), seven women and two men; six cases (67%) involved serial balloon inflations and seven (78%) also involved dual balloon inflations. In six (67%) of the nine patients perforation was fatal. In four patients studied at necropsy, the perforation involved the base of the lateral left ventricular free wall. Pericardiocentesis was performed in five patients, three of whom survived with (one patient) or without (two patients) operative repair. Acute, severe aortic regurgitation developed in four patients (0.8%), all women. None had significant regurgitation before valvuloplasty; dual balloons were used in two of the four. All three patients who underwent emergency valve replacement survived. A fourth patient died 2 days after valvuloplasty without operative intervention. Fatal cardiac arrest complicated balloon aortic valvuloplasty in 13 patients (2.6%), including 7 with cardiogenic shock and 4 with refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Of the seven with shock, four had been treated with serial balloon inflations; dual balloons were used in three. In two of three patients studied at necropsy, the aortic valve was observed to be congenitally bicuspid. A fatal cerebrovascular accident occurred in two patients (0.4%); it was hemorrhagic in one, embolic in another. Both patients were treated with serial (including one dual) balloon inflations. Limb amputation was required in three patients (0.6%), two women and one man; in two patients amputation was above the knee, in the third patient it was limited to two toes. 
Extraspinal causes of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Twelve of 12,125 patients who had been referred during a seven-year period to a specialist in spinal disorders were found to have an extraspinal cause of radiculopathy or neuropathy of the lower extremity. The records of these twelve patients were reviewed retrospectively. The average age of the twelve patients was sixty-five years (range, forty-two to seventy-seven years). The cause of the symptoms was an occult malignant tumor in nine patients and a hematoma, an aneurysm of the obturator artery, or a neurilemoma of the sciatic nerve in the others. The average time from the onset of symptoms to the final diagnosis was eight months (range, one month to two years). The most useful test for determination of the correct diagnosis was computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and bone-scanning of the whole body were of little help in localizing the disease. In four of the twelve patients, an operation was performed on the basis of an incorrect diagnosis. In dealing with elderly patients who have radiculopathy, one should be suspicious that the cause is outside the spine. 
The clinical diagnosis of migraine: the beginning of therapy. Clear symptoms and signs are found in patients during severe migraine attacks. Diagnostic difficulties are encountered in eliciting this episodic clinical picture. A label of migraine, however, is only the beginning: factors that precipitate attacks, fears aroused in the migraineur and the failure, or partial efficacy, of acute and prophylactic therapy need also to be determined. If migraine is complicated by an additional headache, the analysis becomes more difficult, but the diagnosis still has to be accurate. This, however, is not always possible at the initial interview. A successful consultation should be more than just diagnostic; it is the beginning of treatment. 
Postirradiation angiosarcoma of the vaginal vault. We describe a unique case of an angiosarcoma arising in the vaginal vault 21 years after hysterectomy and radiotherapy for stage I carcinoma of the cervix. We also review the literature regarding angiosarcomas arising after previous radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies. 
Ruptured aneurysm of the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta. Analysis according to size and treatment. Acute rupture was confirmed at operation in 117 patients treated for descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Descending thoracic (n = 80) aortic rupture occurred into lung or esophagus in 8, the pleural cavity in 49, and the mediastinum in 23. Upper abdominal aortic (n = 37) rupture occurred into peritoneal cavity in 3 and into retroperitoneal tissues in 34. Aneurysmal size (range, 5 to 17 cm; median, 8 cm) could be determined retrospectively in 86 patients; 59 (74%) descending thoracic and 27 (73%) abdominal aorta. Size (external diameter) in the former was 8 (14%), 5 to 6 cm; 21 (36%), 6 to 8 cm; 23 (39%), 8 to 10 cm; and 7 (12%) greater than 10 cm. Size at the abdominal site was similar. Thus size was not greater than 10 cm in 52 (88%) (range, 5 to 10 cm), which contradicts opinions that thoracic aneurysms rupture only when size exceeds 10 cm. Twenty-nine patients (25%) were hypotensive (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg), of whom 16 (55%) had cardiac arrest before operation. Associated conditions included advanced age (greater than or equal to 75 years) in 26 (22%), coronary artery disease in 41 (35%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 46 (39%), renal insufficiency in 25 (21%), and cardiovascular disease in 22 (18%). The overall early survival rate (30-day) was 89 of 117 patients (76%); 69% in patients with hypotension, 56% of patients with cardiac arrest, 88% in good-risk patients. Five-year (Kaplan-Meier) survival was 28%. Because elective operation is associated with 92% survival, this should be considered before rupture when aneurysm is 5 cm or larger in good-risk patients, in patients with symptomatic aneurysms, and in most patients with larger aneurysms. 
Basal ganglia mass lesions in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. A 2-year-old boy suffered aphasia, hypotonia, dystonia, and loss of activity and spontaneous speech during an active stage of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with pericarditis, fever, anemia, and a high antinuclear antibody titer. These neurologic signs slowly improved with corticosteroid treatment but fluctuated over 1 year. The neuroimaging studies revealed irregular mass lesions in the basal ganglia bilaterally mainly involving the globus pallidus. They gradually decreased in size and almost disappeared after 1 year. A stereotactic brain biopsy revealed a slight proliferation of astrocytes. Chorioretinitis was also observed during the clinical course. A chronic inflammatory process involving cerebral vessels was suspected, although angiography did not demonstrate cerebral vasculitis. The possibility of central nervous system lymphoma could not be eliminated. The type of aphasia and the relation to the lesion sites are discussed. 
Subependymoma with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation: report of a case and literature review. A unique gliomesenchymal neoplasm, consisting of a subependymoma, a form of low-grade glioma, and a rhabdomyosarcoma, is described. It arose and recurred in the brain stem of a 52-year-old man. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the presence of a neuroectodermal marker S-100 protein within some sarcoma cells. The occurrence of this rare tumor supports the concept that striated muscle may derive from a neuroectodermal precursor lesion. 
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for nonmetastatic osteosarcoma of the extremities. Between September 1986 and December 1988, 125 patients with osteosarcoma of the extremities entered the second neoadjuvant study at the authors' institution. Patients received preoperatively two cycles of methotrexate (MTX) intravenously, followed by cisplatinum (CDP) intraarterially, plus adriamycin (ADM) intravenously. After surgery, the patients classified as "good responders" (more than 90% tumor necrosis) received ADM, MTX, and CDP, while the "poor responders" (less than 90% tumor necrosis) had a longer chemotherapy that included ifosfamide and etoposide (VP-16) in addition to MTX, ADM, and CDP. Limb salvage was possible in 85% of patients, 8% had an amputation, and 7% had a rotationplasty. The surgical margins were adequate (radical or wide) in 88% of cases and inadequate (marginal or intralesional) in 12%. At an average follow-up period of 28 months (range, 13 to 41), 109 patients (87%) remained continuously disease free, 15 (12%) relapsed with pulmonary metastases, and one patient (0.8%) had a local recurrence. Compared with the first neoadjuvant study at the authors' institution that used only MTX and CDP preoperatively, the percentage of limb salvages, "good responders," and continuously disease-free survival at two years was significantly higher in the second Rizzoli neoadjuvant study (85%, 74%, and 87% versus 77%, 52%, and 59%). Systemic toxicity because of chemotherapy was superimposable. A retrospective analysis of the real dose intensity for each patient demonstrated a correlation between the intensity of chemotherapy and prognosis. 
Neuroleptic use, parkinsonian symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, and associated factors in child and adolescent psychiatric patients. OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for neuroleptic-induced movement disorders in a group of psychiatrically hospitalized children and adolescents. METHOD: They evaluated the presence or absence of parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, and akathisia in 104 children and adolescents who were in residence in or admitted over a 6-month period to a state-operated child psychiatric center. They applied a standardized, structured assessment procedure used in research on adult and geriatric psychiatric patients and the mentally retarded. RESULTS: The prevalence of parkinsonism among the 61 subjects at risk was 34% and was significantly associated with longer neuroleptic treatment periods immediately before evaluation. The prevalence of treatment-emergent tardive dyskinesia among the 41 subjects at risk was 12% and showed no association with quantitative neuroleptic treatment variables. However, patients with tardive dyskinesia were significantly more likely to have a family history of mental illness and significantly less likely to have a history of assaultive behavior. A pattern of complex pharmacological responses for parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia, some of which are not typical of those most commonly reported in adults, was seen in this group of young patients. CONCLUSIONS: The study data highlight the acute sensitivity of the neuroleptic-treated child and adolescent to the development of parkinsonism, the possible role of certain patient characteristics in the vulnerability to develop tardive dyskinesia, and the possibility that neuroleptic-induced side effects experienced by children and adolescents differ in some ways from those experienced by adults. The data further strongly support the need for systematic monitoring of neuroleptic-treated child and adolescent patients for a full range of side effects. 
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for unstable angina. Coronary angioplasty is an effective treatment for patients with angina at rest, either refractory or initially stabilized but returning despite pharmacologic treatment, and with early postinfarction angina. The procedure has a high initial success rate, but there is an increased risk of major complications resulting from a higher incidence of acute closure, which may be related to preexisting thrombus. Resolution of this problem may be achieved by the use of more potent antiplatelet treatment, pretreatment with thrombolytic agents, or treatment that can be applied locally (e.g., laser energy, atherectomy) at the site of the unstable plaque. Results in this study have been obtained from selected groups of patients: those with predominantly single-vessel disease and well-preserved left ventricular function. It remains to be determined whether the same benefits can be achieved in patients with multivessel disease or in those who have severely reduced left ventricular function. 
Blood supply of nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia. The number of patients who suffer from radicular symptoms due to degenerative diseases of the lumbar spine is increasing. This article discusses the differences in anatomic structure between spinal nerve roots and peripheral nerves. Blood supply and cerebrospinal fluid flow are explained, and the effect of mechanical compression, direct and indirect, is shown as a possible cause of symptoms. 
Relative effects of diarrhea, fever, and dietary energy intake on weight gain in rural Bangladeshi children. Quantitative studies of morbidity, food intake, and somatic growth were done prospectively during 14 mo for 70 children aged 5-18 mo in two Bangladeshi villages. When random-effect regression models were used, monthly changes in weight were inversely related to proportions of days in the month with fever and diarrhea and positively related to energy intake per kilogram body weight. Interestingly, weight changes did not vary with age in this interval. Estimates indicate that increasing energy intakes to the recommended World Health Organization level would have a significantly greater effect on weight gain than would the elimination of diarrhea and fever. With energy at recommended intake and diarrhea and fever prevalence as found in US children, weight gain is predicted to be near that of the international reference population. Therefore, interventions aimed at improving dietary intake may be as important as infection-control programs for improving growth of children in poor developing nations. 
Effects of Vibrio cholerae recombinant strains on rabbit ileum in vivo. Enterotoxin production and myoelectric activity. Previous studies have identified the effects of Vibrio cholerae and its enterotoxin, choleragen (CT A+B+), on the myoelectric activity of rabbit ileal loops in vivo. The response was defined as the migrating action potential complex, the single ring contraction that propels luminal contents aborad. In this study the same rabbit model is used to assess whether migrating action potential complex activity or fluid output is induced by recombinant strains of V. cholerae that produce no subunit of cholera toxin (CT A-B-) or only by the inactive binding subunit (CT A-B+). Three live strains were studied: El Tor wild-type N16961 (CT A+B+) and recombinant strains CVD106 (CT A-B+) and JBK70 (CT A-B-). Controls received sterile culture broth. Migrating action potential complex frequency in animals inoculated with CT A+B+ was significantly increased compared with that in all other experimental groups (P less than 0.01). Fluid output was also increased in animals inoculated with CT A+B+ compared with fluid output in all other groups (P less than 0.05). Migrating action potential complex frequency and fluid output in rabbits given CT A-B+ or CT A-B- did not differ from activity in controls. How these recombinant strains induce diarrhea is unknown, but the mechanism may involve bacterial colonization or production of an unknown toxin. 
A phase II study of idarubicin in the treatment of measurable gastric cancer. Idarubicin is one of the new anthracycline analogues. It has a higher therapeutic index than either doxorubicin or daunorubicin in a variety of murine leukemias and solid tumors. The authors performed a multicenter Phase II trial of idarubicin in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Seventeen patients with measurable metastatic disease were entered into the trial and treated with idarubicin at a starting dose of 15 mg/m2. This dose was escalated or reduced according to toxicity. There were no documented responses. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression. These data did not compared favourably with the data on doxorubicin in the treatment of gastric carcinoma. A conclusion could not be reached on whether idarubicin has minimal activity in the treatment of gastric carcinoma. 
Frequency of adverse systemic reactions after fluorescein angiography. Results of a prospective study. Intravenous fluorescein angiography is a commonly performed and extraordinarily valuable diagnostic procedure. The frequency of adverse reactions after angiography has varied considerably in previous reports. In a prospective study of 2789 angiographic procedures in 2025 patients, the authors found that the percentage of adverse reactions depended strongly on the patient's angiographic history. Overall, adverse reactions followed 4.8% of the angiographic procedures. These reactions included nausea (2.9%), vomiting (1.2%), flushing/itching/hives (0.5%), and other reactions (dyspnea, syncope, excessive sneezing) (0.2%). No cases of anaphylaxis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, or seizures occurred. The percentage of reactions was 1.8% for patients who had had previous angiography without ever having had an adverse reaction. In contrast, the percentage of reactions was 48.6% for patients who had had an adverse reaction to angiography previously. 
Budd-Chiari syndrome in Israel: predisposing factors, prognosis, and early identification of high-risk patients. In twenty-seven patients with venography-documented Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), underlying diseases included polycythemia vera (nine patients), membranous occlusion of the inferior vena cava (three), and cirrhosis (two). In only nine patients did the syndrome occur in the absence of any predisposing factor. All patients with a membranous web were relatively young (mean age 29 years) and were born in Morocco. With regard to prognosis, three groups could be delineated. Eight patients formed a rapidly progressive group, with mean survival from first symptom of only 4.3 weeks, and were characterized mainly by their relatively advanced age and minimal enlargement of the spleen. 
Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction as a predictor of restenosis after successful coronary angioplasty in patients with unstable angina pectoris. BACKGROUND. High rates of restenosis after coronary angioplasty have been reported in patients with vasospastic angina. This study was designed to determine whether the occurrence of abnormal coronary vasoconstriction, detected by means of hyperventilation testing before angioplasty, influences the risk of restenosis after successful dilation. METHODS. Hyperventilation testing was performed 0 to 4 days before coronary angioplasty in 106 consecutive patients with unstable angina and single-vessel coronary artery disease. Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction was considered present if hyperventilation-induced myocardial ischemia occurred during the recovery phase of the test. All patients had follow-up angiography 8 to 12 months after angioplasty. RESULTS. Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction was observed in 48 patients (group 1), whereas 58 patients (group 2) had either a negative response throughout the test or a positive response only during the overbreathing phase of the hyperventilation test. Angioplasty was successful in 40 patients in group 1 and 51 in group 2. Restenosis was documented in 29 patients (73 percent) in group 1 and 13 (25 percent) in group 2 (relative risk of restenosis, 2.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.69 to 4.28; P less than 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the following three characteristics were independently related to the risk of restenosis (in descending order of importance): ST-segment elevation during spontaneous ischemic attacks (P less than 0.001), hyperventilation-induced abnormal coronary vasoconstriction (P less than 0.001), and the presence of a lesion more than 10 mm long in the left anterior descending coronary artery (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. In patients with unstable angina and single-vessel coronary artery disease who have been selected for coronary angioplasty, the presence of hyperventilation-induced abnormal coronary vasoconstriction identifies a subgroup at high risk for restenosis. 
Blood analyses and survival in symptom- and survey-detected lung cancer patients. Commonly recorded blood analyses as indicators of low- and-high risk patients with lung cancer were studied by comparing symptom- and survey-detected patients. During the period 1976-1985, in 41 of 189 non-small-cell lung cancer patients in Western Norway, lung cancer was detected by chest X-ray survey performed in the preventive tuberculosis screening programme. After adjusting for other variables, including developmental stage, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was the only blood analysis which discriminated symptom-detected patients (high ESR) from survey-detected patients (low ESR). Survey-detected patients had a better short-term survival. In multivariate survival analyses leucocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase activity and ESR were significant prognostic factors, in addition to advanced stage and detection due to symptoms. We conclude that common blood analyses such as ESR provide supplementary information concerning low- and high-risk lung cancer patients. 
Storage of saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol-suspended red cells in a new plastic container: polyvinylchloride plasticized with butyryl-n-trihexyl-citrate. Blood collection and component preparation have been performed in integrally connected multiple plastic containers made with a new plastic. This polyvinylchloride (PVC) container plasticized with butyryl-n-trihexyl-citrate (BTHC) is a new material for blood storage; it contains no di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). After removal of plasma and buffy coat, the red cells were suspended in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM) medium. After 42-day refrigerator storage, the total adenine nucleotide concentration remained the same as the initial concentration in the red cells, whereas ATP levels had decreased to 61 percent of the initial value. The 2,3 DPG concentration was 62 percent of normal on Day 7 and 21 percent on Day 14. Glucose consumption, lactate production, potassium leakage from red cells, and pH levels were similar to those found after storage in DEHP-plasticized containers under the same conditions. After 42 days, hemolysis levels were 0.56 +/- 0.21 percent and 0.42 +/- 0.17 percent in two series of units mixed weekly and 0.70 +/- 0.27 percent in units stored unmixed. Although even higher levels of hemolysis were observed in the units stored unmixed and used for 24-hour posttransfusion survival, the autologous red cell recovery results were excellent (83.2 +/- 5.1%, n = 8). BTHC-plasticized PVC is found to be a suitable material for 42-day storage of red cells in SAGM solution. 
Intracanalicular acoustic neurinomas. The cases of 16 patients with acoustic neurinomas confined to the intracanalicular area are presented. These represent 2.7% of the 600 patients with acoustic neurinomas consecutively operated upon at the Neurosurgical Clinic at Nordstadt Hospital during the last 8 years. The comparatively earlier onset of vestibular symptoms and signs was characteristic of this group and precipitated diagnosis. The diagnostic reliability of magnetic resonance imaging was at least equivalent to that of air computed tomographic cisternography. Complete tumor removal was accomplished via the suboccipital approach in all patients, with 100% preservation of facial nerve and facial function; the cochlear nerve was preserved anatomically in 100% of the patients and functionally in 57%. No recurrence has occurred during follow-up periods of up to 8 years in all 16 patients. A broad spectrum of the current literature is considered, and purely intracanalicular acoustic neurinomas are discussed with regard to clinical characteristics, diagnostic steps-including neuroradiological and neurophysiological approaches-and surgical treatment and results. 
Improvement of spontaneous pregnancy rate after stopping gonadotropin therapy for anovulatory infertility. In a prospective study, 140 patients with infertility because of ovulatory factors (group A) were followed up for 6 months after failure to achieve pregnancy using human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) therapy. They included cases of oligomenorrhea, polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD), and hypogonadotropic amenorrhea. They were treated with hMG alone or in combination with clomiphene citrate or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist analog. The control group (B) included 83 infertile patients because of similar ovulatory factors. They were followed up for 6 months not preceded by ovulation induction. The overall pregnancy rate (PR) in group A (20.7%) was significantly higher than group B (7.2%). The PR was significantly higher in oligomenorrhea and PCOD patients when compared with the control group. There was no significant difference in the hypogonadotropic group. 
Adjuvant brachytherapy for treatment of chest wall sarcomas. Thirty patients treated with surgical resection and brachytherapy for chest wall sarcoma at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1980 through 1987 were reviewed. Patients selected to receive adjuvant irradiation were those for whom there was doubt as to the completeness of surgical resection. Overall 5-year survival and locoregional control after brachytherapy were 65% and 54%, respectively. Locoregional control was similar for tumors treated at initial diagnosis (12 patients), at the time of recurrence (13 patients), or for tumors that were metastatic to the chest wall (five patients). Six patients with tumors larger than 10 cm in maximum dimension had a locoregional recurrence rate of 69% versus a recurrence rate of 39% for 18 patients with smaller tumors (p = 0.27). Fifty-four percent of high-grade tumors recurred locoregionally versus 28% of low-grade tumors (p = 0.37). Bone invasion or the presence of positive resection margins was not clearly associated with a higher locoregional failure rate. Only one patient (1/28; 7%) was known to have had recurrence within the irradiated area. Eight patients (8/28; 37%) had recurrence adjacent to the implanted area, and the precise failure site could not be determined for the remaining two patients. Because of the relatively high risk of regional versus in-field recurrence, patients with chest wall sarcoma who receive adjuvant treatment should be treated primarily with external-beam irradiation to allow more generous coverage of the tumor bed. Brachytherapy could be used as a tumor bed "boost" treatment. In patients undergoing resection of recurrent tumor in a previously irradiated site, adjuvant brachytherapy, without external-beam irradiation, should be considered to reduce the risk of extensive soft tissue necrosis. 
Evaluation of three oral dosages of ondansetron in the prevention of nausea and emesis associated with cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin chemotherapy. We assessed the antiemetic efficacy and safety of three different oral doses of ondansetron (GR 38032F), a novel serotonin type-3 receptor antagonist, in three consecutive series of 20 breast cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for the first time. Patients received oral doses of 8 mg, 4 mg, or 1 mg of ondansetron three times daily for 2 days, with the first dose given 30 minutes before the cyclophosphamide infusion. We then evaluated the efficacy of a conventional antiemetic regimen of intravenous lorazepam, metoclopramide, and diphenhydramine given before chemotherapy and 10 mg prochlorperazine given orally twice on study day 1 and three times on study day 2 in a fourth series of 20 patients with comparable characteristics. The number of emetic episodes, assessment of nausea and appetite, and adverse events were recorded throughout the 2-day study period. Pretreatment and posttreatment clinical laboratory data were also collected. No emesis was observed during the 2-day study period in 17 (85%), 13 (65%), and 11 (55%) patients treated with 8-mg, 4-mg, and 1-mg ondansetron doses, respectively, and in seven (35%) patients who received conventional therapy. The incidence and intensity of nausea were lower with increasing doses of ondansetron and were lower than in the conventional group. Ondansetron-related side effects were generally mild and reversible and did not appear to increase in a dose-dependent manner. These effects included headache, stomach cramps, diarrhea, fatigue, and elevated serum transaminase concentrations. One patient who received three 1 mg doses of ondansetron experienced tremors and muscle twitching. Oral ondansetron is an effective and safe antiemetic for patients receiving noncisplatin cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, and its antiemetic activity appears to be dose-related. 
Myocardial infarction due to intracoronary thrombi without significant coronary artery disease in systemic lupus erythematosus. Acute myocardial infarction is a potentially fatal complication of SLE. Reported mechanisms include atherosclerosis, arteritis and coronary arterial spasm. The following case report presents a fourth possible cause; intracoronary thrombus with angiographically normal coronary arteries in a patient with active lupus and AMI. 
Percutaneous balloon pericardial window for patients with malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade. We performed percutaneous balloon pericardial window (PBPW) in 8 patients (age 40 to 70 yrs; 4 men, 4 women) with malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade. Pericardial window was indicated because they continued to drain greater than 100 ml/day of pericardial fluid through the pigtail catheter for greater than or equal to 3 days. A 0.038 inch guidewire was advanced through the pigtail catheter into the pericardial space and then the catheter was removed. A 20 mm diameter, 3 cm long balloon dilating catheter was advanced to straddle the parietal pericardium. Manual inflations were performed until the waist produced by the pericardium disappeared. All patients tolerated the procedure well with minimal discomfort and with no complications. A left or bilateral pleural effusion occurred in all patients after PBPW. No patient developed recurrent pericardial tamponade at a mean follow-up of 6 +/- 2 months. Thus, PBPW is a useful and safe technique to avoid surgery in patients with malignant pericardial effusion and tamponade. 
Medullary arteries in aging and dementia. We examined sclerotic changes of the medullary arteries in 110 nonneuropsychiatric patients ranging in age from the second to the ninth decades, in 20 patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (Binswanger's disease), and in 20 patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type. The principal sclerotic change was fibrohyaline thickening of the wall, which began to appear during the late fourth decade, increased in incidence gradually with age, and was most severe in patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. Morphometry showed that the sclerotic changes of the medullary arteries were most prominent in the frontal lobe, followed by the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, in both the nonneuropsychiatric and demented groups. The sclerotic rate in the frontal lobe of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type was slightly higher than that in the nonneuropsychiatric patients (p less than 0.05) but far less than that in the patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (p less than 0.001). The sclerotic rate correlated well with the degree of ischemic white matter changes as well as with blood pressure. 
Serum cholesterol and mortality among Japanese-American men. The Honolulu (Hawaii) Heart Program. Hawaiian men of Japanese ancestry followed up for 18 or more years after a baseline examination showed a quadratic distribution of death rates at different levels of serum cholesterol. Mortality from cancer progressively decreased and mortality from coronary heart disease progressively increased with rising levels of serum cholesterol. There was a positive association between baseline serum cholesterol levels and deaths from coronary heart disease at 0 to 6 years, 7 to 12 years, and 13 years and longer after examination. The inverse relationship between cancer and serum cholesterol levels was stronger in the first 6 years than in the next 6 years and, although still inverse, lost statistical significance after 13 years. Cancers of the colon and lung showed the strongest association with low baseline serum cholesterol levels, while gastric or rectal cancer failed to show this association. Organ specificity and persistence of the inverse association beyond 6 years suggest that the nutritional demands of cancers may not entirely explain the inverse association with some cancers. The quadratic distribution of deaths in this cohort remained after coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer were removed from the analysis. For the entire period of observation, the lowest mortalities were found in men with serum cholesterol levels between 4.65 and 6.18 mmol/L (between 180 and 239 mg/dL). Manipulation of serum cholesterol levels below this level would not be desirable if this were to result in increased risk of death from cancer or other disease. This study does not rule out this possibility. 
Gallstone lithotripsy: results when number of stones is excluded as a criterion for treatment. The Siemens Lithostar Plus protocol (Siemens Medical Systems, Iselin, NJ) allows investigators to perform gallstone lithotripsy on patients regardless of the number of stones they have, provided the stones occupy less than 50% of the gallbladder lumen. The purpose of this study was to determine the interrelationships between stone burden, fragmentation response, and stone-free rates when treatment is not limited to three stones or fewer. Of 200 patients initially examined, 80 (40%) underwent lithotripsy. The mean number of treatments per patient was 2.1, and the mean number of shock waves per patient was 7386. In 60 patients in whom 6-month follow-up was available, the overall stone-free rate, based on actual results, was 32% (19/60). The stone-free rates for solitary stones, two or three stones, and four or more stones were 50%, 12%, and 26%, respectively. Regardless of number of stones, patients who ultimately became stone free had significantly smaller mean fragment size (0.25 cm) 2 weeks after lithotripsy than did those who did not become stone free (0.51 cm). Retrospective volume analysis showed that seven (47%) of 15 patients with multiple stones occupying less than 2000 mm3 were stone free; none became stone free when this volume was exceeded. Lithotripsy remains a practical option for patients with solitary stones. Comparable stone-free rates to those achieved for solitary stones can be obtained in patients with multiple stones, regardless of their number, provided treatment is aggressive and the stone aggregate is less than 2000 mm3. 
Renin promoter SV40 T-antigen transgenic mouse. A model of primary renal vascular hyperplasia. Transgenic mice containing a ren-2 promoter T-antigen fusion construct (TAG+) develop renal vascular hypertrophy and hyperplasia associated with markedly suppressed renal renin mRNA, renal renin content, and plasma renin concentration. These animals are normotensive. In the present study, the renal and cardiovascular systems are characterized, revealing some surprising findings. Not only are the TAG+ mice normotensive in the face of pronounced renal pathology but also in the presence of an increase in plasma volume. These data raise interesting questions about blood pressure physiology and renal function of the TAG+ mice. Blood nitrogen urea of the TAG+ animal was markedly elevated and plasma creatinine level was in the normal range, indicating prerenal azotemia without renal failure. These findings are consistent with impaired renal perfusion with secondary volume expansion probably as the result of vascular hyperplasia. These transgenic animals provide a unique genetic model for studying the physiology of primarily renal vascular hyperplasia as well as blood pressure control in a low renin state. 
Ifosfamide, Fanconi's syndrome, and rickets. Three of 218 children treated with ifosfamide plus the uroprotectant mesna, in single- or combination-agent protocols, have developed Fanconi's renal syndrome, all of whom were in a subgroup of 86 children who had also received cisplatin or carboplatin therapy. Patients receiving ifosfamide who have received prior cisplatin (or carboplatin) are at significantly higher risk of developing Fanconi's syndrome than are those who have received no prior nephrotoxic therapy (P = .04). The role of prior nephrotoxic therapy, including cisplatin and its derivatives, and the total dose of ifosfamide should be considered in the assessment of this rare but serious and apparently irreversible side effect. 
Cardiac and whole-body [3H]noradrenaline kinetics during adrenaline infusion in man. 1. To investigate the possible role of adrenaline as a modulator of noradrenaline release from the sympathetic nervous system, the responses of cardiac and whole-body noradrenaline kinetics to intravenous infusions of adrenaline (30 ng min-1 kg-1) and matching saline placebo were determined at rest and during supine bicycle exercise in 16 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, in whom beta-adrenoceptor antagonists had been discontinued for 72 h. 2. At rest and compared with placebo, infusion of adrenaline was associated with a small increase in arterial plasma noradrenaline from 211 +/- 29 pg/ml to 245 +/- 29 pg/ml (P less than 0.05). Increases in whole-body noradrenaline spillover to arterial plasma were larger (from 282 +/- 40 ng min-1 m-2 to 358 +/- 41 ng min-1 m-2, P less than 0.01) and there was a trend towards an increase in whole-body noradrenaline clearance. Cardiac noradrenaline clearance was modestly increased during adrenaline infusion, but cardiac noradrenaline spillover was not altered despite increases in heart rate and coronary sinus plasma flow. Adrenaline infusion was associated with symptomatic myocardial ischaemia in four of 14 patients with coronary heart disease. 3. Supine bicycle exercise was associated with significant increases in peripheral noradrenaline concentrations and in cardiac and whole-body noradrenaline spillover. The increases on exercise were not significantly different for these variables during saline and adrenaline infusions. 4. Infusion of adrenaline to produce 'physiological' increases in plasma adrenaline concentration was associated with an increase in total noradrenaline release, as assessed by whole-body noradrenaline spillover to plasma. 
National surveillance of dialysis-associated diseases in the United States, 1989. To determine trends in a variety of dialysis-associated diseases and practices, the Centers for Disease Control surveyed 1,867 chronic hemodialysis centers in the United States in 1989 in conjunction with the annual facility survey performed by the Health Care Financing Administration. The response rate to a mailed questionnaire was 92%. These 1,726 centers represented 122,734 patients and 32,486 staff members. The following results were found. 1) During the last 14 years, the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection decreased from 3.0 to 0.1% among patients, and from 2.6 to 0.1% among staff members. Over the same time, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity declined from 7.8 to 1.4% among patients and from 0.9 to 0.3% among staff members. Hepatitis B vaccine was given by 92% of the centers. By the end of 1989, 19% of susceptible patients and 55% of susceptible staff members had received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. From 1982 to 1989, as a result of receiving vaccine, the prevalence of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) increased from 12 to 19% among patients and from 18 to 54% among staff. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1989 was reported to be 0.7% among patients and 0.1% among staff members. 2) Twenty-two percent of the centers reported pyrogenic reactions in the absence of septicemia among their patients, and 51% reported septicemia. 3) The reported incidence of dialysis dementia among hemodialysis patients was 0.2%, with a case fatality rate of 23%. 4) In 1989, 68% of centers reported that they reused disposable dialyzers; these centers treated 73% of the dialysis patient population. Among centers that reused disposable dialyzers, the average number of reuses ranged from 1 to 50 (mean, 12) and the maximum number of times a disposable dialyzer was ever reused ranged from 3 to 150 (mean, 28). Chemical germicides used for reprocessing dialyzers included formaldehyde, Renalin (a peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide-based germicide), and glutaraldehyde-based germicides. Reuse of disposable dialyzers was not associated with any increased risk of acquiring HBV infection among either patients or staff. However, pyrogenic reactions occurring in clusters were reported more frequently in centers that reused conventional dialyzer membranes compared with centers that did not. This increased risk was associated only with centers that used Renalin or glutaraldehyde for reprocessing (not formaldehyde) and occurred with both automated and manual reprocessing systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Lack of effect of peritoneal endometriosis on fertility in the rabbit model. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the isolated influence of peritoneal endometrial implants on fertility in an adhesion-free rabbit model. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-two rabbits with endometrium implants were used; 31 rabbits with fat implants served as controls. In these rabbits parameters of early embryonic development were investigated. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted in ovulation, ovum pick-up, fertilization, tubal transport, and embryonic and fetal development. CONCLUSION: In the adhesion-free rabbit model, peritoneal implants of endometriosis do not have an effect on fertility. This supports the contention that therapies focused toward the implants are unlikely to change the pregnancy outcomes. Alternatively, it may cast doubts onto the relevance of animal models in studying this disease. 
Intraductal mucin-hypersecreting neoplasms of the pancreas. A clinicopathologic study of eight patients. Intraductal mucin-hypersecreting neoplasms of the pancreas with extreme dilatation of the main duct were studied in eight patients. They included five men and three women, aged 47-85 years. Five patients had a history of symptoms mimicking pancreatitis; four developed steatorrhea and/or diabetes. At endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, five patients showed an open ampulla filled with mucin, and six patients showed patchy filling defects in the ectatic main duct. Morphological examination showed extreme dilatation of the entire pancreatic duct in six patients and its tail segment in two patients. The duct segments filled with viscous mucin were lined by well-differentiated mucin-secreting cells, forming papillary foldings and occasionally showing cellular atypia. None of the patients had invasive tumor or metastasis. Six patients whose lesions were resected are alive and doing well (mean follow-up, 5.5 years). It is concluded that intraductal mucin-hypersecreting neoplasm is a pancreatic tumor with favorable prognosis. Because it shares many features with intraductal papillary neoplasm, a common pathogenesis of these pancreatic tumors is suggested. 
Quantification of vascular graft seeding by use of computer-assisted image analysis and genetically modified endothelial cells. Current methods for the evaluation of retention of endothelial cells seeded on vascular grafts are limited by the inability to specifically identify and quantitate seeded cells on a long-term basis. To address this problem we developed a method of quantification of graft surface coverage using genetic labeling of endothelial cells combined with computer-assisted image analysis. Rabbit aortic endothelial cells were transduced with a marker gene (lac-Z) and seeded on polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. After histochemical staining in which the genetically labeled cells turn blue, computer-assisted image analysis was used to measure the percentage of graft surface covered by the seeded cells. The utility of the method was evaluated by using it to assess the effect on graft coverage of seeded cell density and by precoating with fibronectin. Quantification of surface area coverage was automated and reproducible both between scans and between observers. Use of this method allowed the determination of a linear correlation between cell density in the seeding suspension and graft coverage (r2 = 0.93, p less than 0.0001). The method also permitted confirmation of the positive contribution of fibronectin coating to graft coverage by seeded cells: 73% coverage coated versus 8% coverage uncoated (p less than 0.0001). The ability of this method to specifically identify genetically marked endothelial cells and their progeny makes it attractive for use in studies targeted at optimization of graft coverage in vivo. 
Suppression by traumatic brain injury of spontaneous hemodynamic recovery from hemorrhagic shock in rats. The effects of brain trauma on cardiovascular and endocrine responses to hemorrhage were investigated. Forty anesthetized rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups of 10 rats each: a control group (Group C): a group with induction of hemorrhage at 16.2 ml/kg/10 min (Group H); a group with fluid-percussion brain injury at a peak pressure of 1.7 atm and an impulse duration of 25 msec (Group T); and a group receiving hemorrhagic shock following brain trauma (Group TH). Group C and T rats showed no significant alterations in cardiovascular function. At the end of hemorrhage there were no significant differences between Groups TH and H in the nadirs of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) (mean values +/- standard error of the mean: 42 +/- 2 vs. 40 +/- 4 mm Hg) and stroke volume index (SVI) (0.61 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.10 ml/bt/kg); however, 1 hour post-hemorrhage recovery was blunted in Group TH compared to Group H (MABP 56 +/- 4 vs. 65 +/- 3 mm Hg; cardiac index 182 +/- 15 vs. 220 +/- 15 ml/min/kg; and SVI 0.71 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.06 ml/bt/kg). Since the two groups showed no significant differences in heart rate, preload (central venous pressure), and afterload (systemic vascular resistance), the reduced cardiac index recovery in Group TH is believed due to the attenuation of cardiac contractile performance. The Group TH preparation potentiated hormonal responses to hemorrhage with significantly higher epinephrine and aldosterone levels than in Group H. Brain trauma enhanced the norepinephrine response to hemorrhage, even at an injury level that by itself did not result in an increase in this hormone. Group TH rats also had significantly lower blood pH and HCO3 levels. The data suggest that brain trauma suppresses MABP and cardiac index recovery after hemorrhage mainly by inhibiting cardiac contractile performance, probably due to high catecholamine levels and severe metabolic acidosis. 
Aminophylline therapy for acute bronchospastic disease in the emergency room OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of aminophylline in the treatment of acute exacerbations of bronchospastic disease when used in addition to inhaled beta-agonists and intravenous corticosteroids. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study. PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-three adult patients with either asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the emergency department with asthma or wheezing. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received therapy with both aerosolized metaproterenol and intravenous methyl-prednisolone. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a loading dose of aminophylline followed by a routine infusion (n = 65) or an equal volume of placebo as a loading dose and infusion (n = 68). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At discharge from the emergency department, the median serum theophylline concentration for the aminophylline group was 54 mumol/L (9.7 mg/L). The two groups showed no differences (P greater than 0.2) in measurements of forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at baseline or at 60 or 120 minutes after aminophylline administration. Neither patient satisfaction nor physician assessment of response to therapy differed between the two groups. There was no difference (P greater than 0.2) in the frequency of side effects, except for a trend toward a higher frequency of nausea (P = 0.13) in the aminophylline group. There was, however, a threefold decrease in the hospital admission rate for patients treated with aminophylline (6%) compared with placebo recipients (21%) (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Aminophylline, in doses producing levels just below the commonly accepted therapeutic range, appears to decrease hospital admissions in patients with acute exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This finding, if confirmed in larger studies, may represent a substantial cost savings. 
Perilymphatic fistula: surgical experience in the United States. One survey sent to 6953 individual otolaryngologic practices and 106 departments of otolaryngology at teaching hospitals in the United States, and a more limited survey of 75 patients operated on for perilymphatic fistula (PLF) at the House Ear Institute, addressed aspects of managing PLF: surgical incidence, reliability of diagnostic test, preoperative observations, and disability after surgery. Of surgeons sampled, 93% estimated incidence of PLF surgery to be less than or equal to 1 per 1000 otolaryngologic outpatient visits. The most reliable diagnostic indicators were history, symptomatology, and tympanometric and electronystagmographic fistula tests. About 72% of surgeons reported less than 4 weeks' average delay before surgery. Most surgeons and patients (greater than or equal to 70%) rated length of disability before return to work, exposure to noise, travel by airplane, swimming, and heavy lifting, at several weeks to several months. Diving was the most restricted activity. Results suggest that incidence of surgery and disability with PFL in the United States is very limited. 
Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and Kearns-Sayre syndrome: mitochondrial DNA mutations. Mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) supplies extranuclear (cytoplasmic) genes which program the manufacture of 13 of the 67 peptides of the mitochondrial respiratory enzymes. The remaining 54 are coded by nuclear DNA. All human children and adults, male and female, are entirely dependent on the cytoplasm of the ovum for their complement of mt DNA; the sperm contributes none. Accordingly, mutations in the mt DNA in a mother's ova will be passed on to all her children, although not all are clinically affected. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is in most cases due to a mutation that leads to the replacement of guanine by adenine at position 11778 in mt DNA. This causes histidine to be inserted instead of the normal arginine at the site of the 340th amino acid in the respiratory enzyme NADH subunit 4, hence its defective function. Other point mutations in the mt DNA coding for polypeptides of the respiratory chain complex or controlling sequences coded by mt DNA have been found in other families with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. Mitochondrial DNA is the site of other mutations as well. For ophthalmologists, the most important of these is the rare Kearns-Sayre syndrome (pigmentary retinopathy plus muscular dystrophies, especially of the extraocular muscles). Kearns-Sayre syndrome is due to deletions in the mt DNA, which vary in size and so affect a number of different respiratory enzymes, hence the variable manifestations. Cases are usually sporadic because the disease is often so severe that affected individuals do not reproduce if they survive, but in some cases inheritance from the mother has been reported. 
Optic nerve hypoplasia, encephalopathy, and neurodevelopmental handicap. Abnormalities of the central nervous system are frequently described in optic nerve hypoplasia. In a longitudinal study of 46 consecutive children (32 term, 14 preterm) with bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia 32 (69.5%) had associated neurodevelopmental handicap. Of these, 90% had structural central nervous system abnormalities on computed tomographic brain scans. Neurodevelopmental handicap occurred in 62.5% of the term and 86% of the preterm infants respectively. Term infants had a greater incidence of ventral developmental midline defects and proportionately fewer maternal and/or neonatal complications throughout pregnancy, while encephaloclastic lesions were commoner among the premature infants. An association of optic nerve hypoplasia with the twin transfusion syndrome and prenatal vascular encephalopathies is described. 
The antishock pelvic clamp. Unstable posterior pelvic ring disruptions are frequently accompanied by severe venous bleeding and hypotension. Mechanical stabilization has been shown to help reduce such blood loss. A new external fixator called an antishock clamp provides direct reduction and compression of such fracture-diastases about the sacroiliac joint. It is used acutely to rapidly stabilize the posterior pelvic ring in hypotensive patients. The simplicity of design allows the device to be applied in less than ten minutes in the emergency room. Most importantly, it does not interfere with the ability to carry out subsequent laparotomy or other required procedures. Although more clinical experience is needed, the clamp has provided hemodynamic stabilization accompanying fracture reduction. The device is not expected to be of benefit in the cases with significant bleeding of arterial origin. 
Management of verrucous carcinoma of the larynx. Eight patients with a verrucous carcinoma of the larynx have been seen at the Charing Cross Hospital between 1970 and 1985. Seven patients were treated by primary radiotherapy and one by primary endoscopic laser excision. Four of those treated with radiotherapy developed recurrent disease which was treated by radical surgery in three and by endoscopic laser excision in one. The place of radiotherapy in the management of this condition requires further evaluation in view of the high rate of recurrence. Endoscopic laser excision may be a reasonable alternative to more radical surgery in this highly differentiated neoplasm. 
Motion artifact simulating aortic dissection on CT. We recently imaged two patients clinically suspected of having aortic dissection whose contrast-enhanced CT examinations, obtained on a new scanner with a 1-sec scanning time, showed findings suggesting an ascending aortic dissection. The subsequent clinical course and evaluation implied that the CT findings were predominantly artifactual. We identified identical artifacts in 18% of 50 consecutive contrast-enhanced CT examinations performed for a variety of indications on the same scanner. The double-lumen artifact, simulating an intimal flap, occurs in the proximal ascending aorta and is limited to one or two contiguous transaxial images. The artifact was not detected on two other CT units. We believe the artifact arises from motion of the aortic wall and the surrounding pericardial recesses during image acquisition. 
Management of ventricular septal defect with associated aortic incompetence. Twenty-two patients with a ventricular septal defect and aortic incompetence underwent surgical repair. Mean age was 9.6 years (range, 9 to 15 years). Mean follow-up was 32.4 +/- 15.8 months. The ventricular septal defect was perimembranous in 19 patients and doubly committed or juxtaarterial in 3. Most showed only a small left-to-right shunt. Mean diameter was 11.9 +/- 4.8 mm. Aortic incompetence was mild in 6 patients, moderate in 4, and severe in 12. In 16 patients closure of the ventricular septal defect and aortic valvoplasty were both performed through the aortic root. There were no deaths. All patients retained normal sinus rhythm. No complete heart block was found. In 3 patients secondary aortic valve replacement was required for severe incompetence; in 1 the cause was bacterial endocarditis, in another technical failure, and in a third progressive incompetence over an 8-month period. All patients showed substantial clinical improvement, marked decrease or disappearance of the valvar incompetence, diminution of the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and decreased cardiothoracic ratio. We conclude that primary repair is the operation of choice for this combination of lesions. This can avoid or delay considerably valvar replacement. The left-sided approach proves safe and is our preferred technique. 
Clinical and flow cytometry characteristics of malignant pleural effusions in patients after intracavitary administration of methylprednisolone acetate. Ten patients with recurrent pleural effusions due to advanced cancer were treated by intracavitary methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol [DM], Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI). They received one to six courses of DM (median, three courses per patient) with doses ranging from 80 to 160 mg per course. Effusion cells were cryopreserved before and during DM installation for subsequent determination of ploidy by flow cytometry. Pleural effusion in all three patients with advanced breast cancer resolved and did not reaccumulate throughout follow-up for 11+, 10+, and 8+ months. Pleural effusion in a patient with metastatic gastric cancer and in two of four patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown origin partially resolved. Altogether six of ten patients (60%) subjectively and objectively benefited from this therapy. All patients tolerated the treatment well with no local or systemic side effects. Flow cytometry showed a reduction in ploidy of effusion cells in all three patients with breast cancer, from a peak mean channel of 6C to nearly 2C after therapy. Transient reduction of ploidy was seen also in the effusion of a patient with unknown primary tumor associated with clinical improvement. The clinical and laboratory data reported offers initial evidence that DM when instilled into the pleural cavity after incomplete thoracentesis may act as effective palliative therapy either alone or in combination with other anticancer agents. 
Meningiomas of the lateral skull base: neurotologic manifestations and patterns of recurrence. The eradication of basicranial meningiomas by traditional surgical techniques is often hindered by neoplastic entanglement with critical neurovascular structures. Apparent, complete tumor resection is frequently followed by extensive, yet clinically silent, recurrent disease with local infiltration of bone, cranial nerves, and brain. Fifty-five cases of sphenoid wing or parasellar meningioma were analyzed to identify clinical manifestations suggestive of early tumor recurrence. Regrowth patterns were then defined according to preoperative radiographic and intraoperative surgical findings. Medial tumor regrowth, involving the cavernous sinus, caused neurapraxia of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI, with associated diplopia or ophthalmoplegia. Inferior (caudal) regrowth of disease involved the infratemporal fossa, pterygomaxillary space, or paranasal sinuses by bony erosion of the middle cranial fossa floor or through natural anatomic foramina and fissures. Such inferior extension was manifested clinically by facial hypesthesia, trismus, and referred otalgia caused by trigeminal nerve involvement and by autophony or serous otitis media related to eustachian tube obstruction. Posterior tumor regrowth occurred along the petrous bone and horizontal carotid canal, resulting in internal auditory meatus erosion and cerebellopontine angle extension with associated tinnitus, hearing loss, unsteadiness, and occasional facial twitching. While the clinical and radiographic evaluations of any patient with a suspected recurrent basicranial meningioma are critical in planning the method and magnitude of reoperation, an understanding of potential recurrence patterns can be used in devising more extensive, combined approaches that may allow complete tumor extirpation at the initial surgical intervention. 
Pharmacologic roles of heparin and glucocorticoids to prevent restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Restenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is the major clinical problem limiting the long-term efficacy of this treatment for coronary atherosclerosis. Recent advances in the understanding of the biology of restenosis indicate that intimal hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells is the predominant cause for restenosis. Therefore, therapeutic agents that inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation should be candidate drugs to prevent restenosis. Heparin has documented antiproliferative effects on smooth muscle cells, and the availability of low molecular weight heparins that lack anticoagulant properties makes them ideal agents. Glucocorticoids have wide effects on inflammatory and wound healing events and inhibit smooth muscle cell growth in culture and in animal models of arterial injury. Recent laboratory data suggest that combination therapy with both low molecular weight heparin and hydrocortisone may be a powerful treatment regimen to limit restenosis. 
Carbon dioxide laser treatment for vulval papillomatosis (vulvodynia). Genital papillomatosis accompanied by distressing vulval symptoms is often termed vulvodynia. Common presenting symptoms are vulvar burning, pruritus and dyspareunia. Sixteen patients with vulval papillomatosis (vulvodynia) have been treated by carbon dioxide laser therapy over a 4-year period. Initial responses at 6 weeks appeared encouraging but with follow-up it became apparent that the relapse rate was high, with a mean symptom-free interval of 4.6 months. Of the 16 patients treated, only three remain symptom free. In view of our findings, we recommend that laser therapy should not be offered as a primary procedure, if at all, for patients with vulval papillomatosis. 
Purification of a plasma membrane-associated GTPase-activating protein specific for rap1/Krev-1 from HL60 cells. rap1/Krev-1 is a p21ras-related GTP-binding protein that has been implicated in the reversion of the ras-transformed cell phenotype. We have identified a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specific for rap in plasma membranes isolated from differentiated HL60 cells. The rap GAP activity remained quantitatively associated with the membrane following washes with buffered 1 M LiCl containing 20 mM EDTA but was solubilized with the detergents Nonidet P-40 and deoxycholate. On the basis of size-exclusion chromatography, the membrane-associated rap GAP (rap GAPm) appeared distinct from the rap GAP detected in the cytosolic fraction from HL60 cells. The molecular sizes of the membrane and cytosolic forms were estimated to be 36 and 54 A, respectively. rap GAPm was solubilized and purified to near homogeneity by successive column chromatographies in the presence of detergent. The rap GAPm activity corresponded to a single polypeptide that migrated with a molecular mass of approximately 88 kDa on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. The purified rap GAPm was inactive toward the GTP-bound forms of p21ras, rho, G25K, and rac-1 and did not stimulate dissociation of guanine nucleotide from rap. 
High fecundity of amenorrhoeic women in embryo-transfer programmes. There is uncertainty over whether the steady decline in human fertility with increasing maternal age is due to quality of the oocyte or of the endometrium. To clarify the issue age-related implantation and pregnancy rates in two embryo-transfer programmes were examined in relation to embryo quality and type of menstrual cycle. In both the UK and the US programmes rates were higher in previously amenorrhoeic (acyclic) women than in eugonadal women, irrespective of age and number of embryos replaced. Oocyte quality, as determined by age of oocyte donor, in-vitro growth of embryo, and proportion of defective embryos in culture, did not contribute to the difference, nor did type of cycle during therapy. If a uterus that has not been subjected to regular menstrual cycles is a favourable factor, a period of induced amenorrhoea might be beneficial for infertile women. 
Steroid-responsive tubular aggregate myopathy. We report a man with an acute myalgia/cramp syndrome and tubular aggregates on his muscle biopsy. He was placed on prednisone and was found to be exquisitely sensitive to the drug, with changes of only 5 mg precipitating recurrence of symptoms. He was eventually tapered off all steroids, without symptoms, and repeat biopsy showed no tubular aggregates. We recommend similar patients be given a trial of high-dose steroids. 
Risk factors for stroke in middle aged British men. OBJECTIVE--To determine the risk factors for stroke in a cohort representative of middle aged British men. DESIGN--Prospective study of a cohort of men followed up for eight years. SETTING--General practices in 24 towns in England, Wales, and Scotland (the British regional heart study). SUBJECTS--7735 men aged 40-59 at screening, selected at random from one general practice in each town. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Fatal and non-fatal strokes. RESULTS--110 of the men had at least one stroke; there were four times as many non-fatal as fatal strokes. The relative risk of stroke was 12.1 in men who had high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg) and were current smokers compared with normotensive, non-smoking men. Diastolic blood pressure yielded no additional information, and former cigarette smokers had the same risk as men who had never smoked. Heavy alcohol intake was associated with a relative risk of stroke of 3.8 in men without previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Men with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease had an increased risk of stroke, but only when left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography was also present. CONCLUSIONS--Systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and left ventricular hypertrophy on electrocardiography in men with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease were found to be the major risk factors for stroke in middle aged British men. Heavy alcohol intake seemed to increase the risk of stroke in men without previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease. A large proportion of strokes should be preventable by controlling blood pressure and stopping smoking. 
Diagnosis and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma: comparison of CT and sonography in 36 liver transplantation patients. Radiologic studies are important in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma and the selection of patients for partial liver resection, liver transplantation, or palliation. We retrospectively studied 36 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were examined with both CT and sonography before undergoing hepatic transplantation. Pathologic findings of the entire resected liver were correlated with results of imaging studies before transplantation. Parenchymal lesions were shown by sonography in 29 cases (81%) and by CT in 34 cases (94%). Although CT was more sensitive than sonography was, both CT and sonography frequently failed to depict reliably the size of tumor or the exact number of tumor nodules as determined pathologically. Pathologic findings showed vascular invasion in 19 cases (53%), whereas CT showed invasion in 11 cases (31%) and sonography showed it in only six (17%). Nodal metastasis to the porta hepatis was found in four patients; CT correctly showed two cases (three false-positive) and sonography correctly showed one case. Intrahepatic ductal dilatation was seen in eight patients on CT but was not identified on sonography. We conclude that CT is more accurate for identifying and staging hepatocellular carcinoma, but both CT and sonography frequently fail to depict the extent (size and number of lesions) of disease, especially when underlying cirrhosis is present. 
Doppler sonographic imaging of the vascular system. Report of the Ultrasonography Task Force. Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association. Ultrasonic vascular imaging has been used for more than 20 years to define vascular anatomy, pathologic changes in vessel size, and perivascular abnormalities. In the last decade, development of duplex Doppler technology has permitted the evaluation of both anatomic vascular features and physiologic blood flow parameters in a variety of locations. Doppler "color flow" imaging promises to expand these applications. In many instances, duplex Doppler technology has replaced more invasive angiographic procedures for evaluation of suspected vascular abnormalities. Improved ultrasound duplex technology, combined with the relatively inexpensive, rapid, noninvasive aspects of ultrasonography has made it a valuable screening examination for suspected flow abnormalities. 
Hemodynamic effects of varied graft diameters in the venous system. Both in vivo and mathematical models of venous hypertension were used to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of 4, 6, 8, and 10 mm diameter cross-femoral venous bypass grafts (CFBs). Eighteen grafts (length 138 +/- 3.4 mm) were tested in paired sequential fashion (four grafts, 4 and 8 mm; five grafts, 6 and 10 mm) in nine greyhounds (femoral vein diameter, 7.7 +/- 0.09 mm). Bilateral hindlimb venous pressures and flows were measured before and after unilateral iliofemoral venous ligation, 30 minutes after CFB insertion, and for 5 minutes after venous flow augmentation induced by stimulated muscle contraction. CFBs of all sizes were equally effective at relieving the occlusive venous hypertension at rest. Muscle contraction elevated venous pressure in all ligated hindlimbs (p less than 0.0001); however, the pressure returned to baseline by 3 minutes in dogs with 6, 8, and 10 mm grafts but remained elevated (p less than 0.05) with the 4 mm grafts even after 5 minutes. Peak graft flow (first 90 seconds after contraction) was significantly greater through the 8 mm grafts than through the 4 mm grafts (p less than 0.01), although no difference was noted in flow rates between 6 and 10 mm grafts. The pressure gradient across the graft as predicted by the mathematic model for 6 to 10 mm conduits was less than 5 mm Hg for flows up to 1000 ml/min, although the pressure gradient of the 4 mm graft exceeded 5 mm Hg at 200 ml/min and approached 30 mm Hg at 1000 ml/min. Therefore, data from both canine and mathematical models agreed that, at rates approximating human resting flow (1000 ml/min), no adverse short-term hemodynamic consequences result from CFB conduits of 6 to 10 mm diameter. 
New treatments for Chlamydia trachomatis. Standard regimens of tetracycline, doxycycline, or erythromycin, if compiled with, appear to be effective against Chlamydia trachomatis infections under most circumstances. However, the organism may sometimes persist despite what would seem to be adequate therapy. How often this occurs, to what extent noncompliance is the issue, and the role antibiotic resistance plays remain to be determined. Among newer antibiotics, azithromycin appears to be effective in the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital C. trachomatis infections. Single-dose therapy with azithromycin may be especially useful in overcoming compliance problems associated with the treatment of sexually transmitted disease. 
Actinomycosis in obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis. A quantitative analysis of adenoid and tonsillar specimens from 460 patients was performed. The patients underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy for either recurrent tonsillitis or obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy. Histologic preparations revealed Actinomycetes as statistically more prevalent in the obstructive population. The presence of Actinomycetes in the adenotonsillar core of this diagnostic group may indicate an etiologic role for this organism in tonsillar and adenoidal hypertrophy. 
Management of bleeding ulcers. Hemorrhage is a common complication of peptic ulcer disease and is increased in frequency and severity with aspirin and NSAID use. A variety of clinical and endoscopic factors associated with an increased mortality rate from ulcer bleeding have been identified, the most important of which are presentation in shock and ongoing or recurrent bleeding after routine resuscitative measures. After hemodynamic stabilization, the goal of therapy is to diminish the chance that an ulcer will continue to bleed or will rebleed. Currently, this is best achieved by one of several endoscopic interventions in carefully selected patients. The most effective endoscopic techniques for decreasing the risk of ulcer rebleeding are multipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe thermal coagulation, and injection therapy in patients with active bleeding or a visible vessel in the ulcer base. Injection therapy may be used alone or in combination with either of the other two techniques. The major impact of therapeutic endoscopy appears to be a reduction in the number of emergent operations necessary to control hemorrhage. The mortality of emergent surgery for bleeding ulcer is prohibitive, and any means of reducing the need for surgery is likely to have a beneficial effect on survival. 
Excision of limbal dermoids. We reviewed the clinical files of 10 patients who had undergone excision of unilateral epibulbar limbal dermoids. Preoperatively, all of the affected eyes had worse visual acuity (P less than .02) and more astigmatism (P less than .01) than the contralateral eyes. Postoperatively, every patient was cosmetically improved. Of the eight patients for whom both preoperative and postoperative visual acuity measurements had been obtained, in six it had changed minimally (less than or equal to 1 line), and in two it had improved (less than or equal to 2 lines). Surgical complications included persistent epithelial defects (40%) and peripheral corneal vascularization and opacity (70%). These complications do not outweigh the cosmetic and visual benefits of dermoid excision in selected patients. 
Intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm presenting as recurrent epistaxis. Massive epistaxis from a leaking intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm is a rare occurrence. Such an unusual case is presented with appropriate imaging and a successful treatment program. 
Variable regression of experimental bronchial preneoplasia during carcinogenesis. It has been thought that squamous severe atypical metaplasia of the bronchus is reliably precancerous. The canine subcutaneous bronchial autograft model for studying the progression of epidermoid carcinogenesis (normal----regular squamous metaplasia----mild, moderate, and severe atypical metaplasia----squamous cell carcinoma) provides evidence that severe atypical metaplasia of the bronchial epithelium is reversible. Among 148 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that had serial sampling of the epithelium and exposure to implants of methylcholanthrene, severe atypical metaplasia was noted in 28 that received only a single implant. During the total carcinogen exposure (median 24.5 months), 9 of 28 (32%) developed squamous cell cancer, and 19 of 28 (68%) regressed toward normal. Severe atypical metaplasia was noted in 34 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that received two or more carcinogen implants: epidermoid cancer developed in 26 of 34 (76.5%), and regression toward or to normal occurred in 8 of 34 (23.5%). Severe atypical metaplasia was not detected in 53 subcutaneous bronchial autografts: 19 that received only a single implant and 34 that received two or more implants. Progression and regression occurred among these subcutaneous bronchial autografts in proportions similar to those found in subcutaneous bronchial autografts wherein severe atypical metaplasia was seen. Among 33 subcutaneous bronchial autografts initially studied after 6 months of exposure to carcinogen, progression to severe atypical metaplasia was seen 3 months later in 19 of 33 that had additional exposure; in the same interval regression of epithelial abnormalities occurred in 14 of 33 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that had no additional exposure (p less than 0.05). We have presented evidence that severe atypical metaplasia includes at least three cell populations: one committed to cancer without further stimulus, one that regresses despite further carcinogen exposure, and one that requires additional carcinogen to progress to cancer. At least in this model, severe atypical metaplasia is not inexorably precancerous. The subcutaneous bronchial autograft model is suitable for seeking biologic indicators of irreversibility. 
Failure of motor evoked potentials to predict neurologic outcome in experimental thoracic aortic occlusion. Motor evoked potential monitoring was tested as an alternative to somatosensory evoked potential monitoring in evaluating spinal cord function during thoracic aortic occlusion in dogs. Twenty-seven animals underwent 60 minutes of cross-clamping of the proximal descending thoracic aorta with (n = 18) or without (n = 9) cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Spinal cord blood flow was measured with microspheres, and neurologic outcome was evaluated at 24 hours with Tarlov's scoring system. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage improved neurologic outcome (p less than 0.05). Motor evoked potentials recorded over the lumbar spinal cord were lost in 9 of 20 dogs with ischemic cord injury and were not lost in any of the 7 dogs that were neurologically normal. Somatosensory evoked potential were lost in 19 of 20 paraplegic/paraparetic dogs and lost in 3 of 7 normal dogs (p less than 0.01). After reperfusion, motor evoked potentials returned in all nine neurologically injured dogs that lost the potentials and were still present at 24 hours. Changes in amplitude, latency, or time until loss or return of motor evoked potentials or somatosensory evoked potentials did not predict neurologic injury. Loss of somatosensory evoked potentials had a high sensitivity (95%) but had low specificity (67%) because of peripheral nerve ischemia. Loss of motor evoked potentials recorded from the spinal cord had high specificity (100%) but a low sensitivity (46%) and was therefore not a reliable predictor of neurologic injury. Return of motor evoked potentials during reperfusion did not correlate with functional recovery. Motor evoked potentials stimulated in the cortex and recorded from the spinal cord had low overall accuracy (59%). 
Transoral approach to the upper cervical spine. The transoral approach to pathology of the upper cervical spine is logical, but it is seldom used due to concerns about exposure and infection. The authors report on 16 consecutive patients requiring exposure from clivus through C3 for pathology, including spinal cord compression by rheumatoid pannus, craniovertebral anomalies, and tumor. Exposure was obtained using a Dingman mouth gag and soft palate retraction with silicone rubber sheeting. A horizontal "H" incision was made in the posterior pharyngeal wall creating three layers, closed separately, with attention to a watertight closure of the final mucosal layer. In no case was it necessary to divide the mandible, tongue, soft palate, or uvula. There were no deaths, wound breakdowns, infections, or persistent cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Patients with neurological indications improved postoperatively, and all tumors were grossly resected. Combined otolaryngology/neurosurgical exposure and treatment of pathology involving the upper cervical spine via the transoral approach is safe and effective. Functional results have been excellent, and no major complications were encountered. 
Symptomatic diverticulum of the 4th ventricle. A case of symptomatic diverticulum of the 4th ventricle in a 57-year-old man is presented. This clinicopathological observation supports a relationship between ventricular diverticula and ependyma-lined paraventricular cysts. 
Segregation analysis reveals evidence of a major gene for Alzheimer disease. In an attempt to resolve the relative influences of major genes, multifactorial heritability, and cohort effects on the susceptibility to Alzheimer disease (AD), complex segregation analysis was performed on 232 nuclear families. All families were consecutively ascertained through a single proband who was referred for diagnostic evaluation of a memory disorder. The results suggest that susceptibility to AD is determined, in part, by a major autosomal dominant allele with an additional multifactorial component. Single-locus, polygenic, sporadic, and no-transmission models, as well as recessive inheritance of the major effect, were significantly rejected. Excess transmission from the heterozygote was marginally significant and probably reflects the presence of phenocopies or perhaps the existence of two or more major loci for AD. The frequency of the AD susceptibility allele was estimated to be .038, but the major locus accounts for only 24% of the transmission variance, indicating a substantial role for other genetic and nongenetic mechanisms in the causation of AD. 
Cirrhosis of the liver. A regenerative process. The ancient story of Prometheus, chained to a rock for defying Zeus by stealing fire from Mount Olympus and subjected to daily tearing at his liver by an eagle, attests to the early recognition of the extraordinary regenerative capacity of the human liver. This process had remained an intriguing mystery over the millennia. In the last 20 years, following the pioneering work of Bucher (1) and Moolten et al (2), there has been an explosion of research that has clarified some of the mechanisms underlying the process of hepatic regeneration. Regeneration implies proliferation and regeneration. After the fetal and postnatal growth of the liver is completed, hepatocytes no longer proliferate actively, but they can proliferate in response to cell death or loss (3). Hepatocyte growth responses are of particular research interest because they occur in vivo and involve cells that are normally quiescent. Hepatic regeneration constitutes a highly regulated process that is best shown by the arrest of liver growth following a partial hepatectomy precisely at the moment the hepatic mass reaches the mass of the original intact liver (3). This suggests that hepatic regeneration after a partial hepatectomy is a strictly regulated nonautonomous growth process that is controlled by the same factors that are responsible for the determination and maintenance of hepatic mass in a normal individual. In response to a partial hepatectomy, hepatocytes enter the cell cycle and progress to DNA synthesis and replication but only in numbers sufficient to restore the hepatic mass. The regeneration response is both synchronized and universal in that it affects all intrahepatic cell lines, including nonparenchymal cells. 
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin and interleukin-2 for treatment of superficial bladder cancer. A total of 22 patients with bladder cancer received bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and interleukin-2. Significant bladder tumor remissions were noted in 15 of 17 patients (88%). Of 5 patients with carcinoma in situ 1 was noncompliant and he died of carcinoma in situ. The other 4 patients are in remission. BCG alone was instilled in 22 additional patients with superficial bladder cancer. The remission rates were encouraging. Of the 22 patients 13 (59%) had remission of the bladder tumor. A half dose of BCG (60 mg.) is adequate when given weekly for 6 weeks. Maintenance therapy is important as noted in both of our clinical arms. BCG and interleukin-2 therapy results in a higher remission rate. 
Coronary venous retroperfusion support during high risk angioplasty in patients with unstable angina: preliminary experience. Synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion was used during coronary balloon angioplasty to support the ischemic myocardium of 20 patients with unstable angina and anatomy at high risk of a coronary event. Hemodynamics and left ventricular function were the major end points of the study. Coronary venous catheterization and retroperfusion were successfully performed in 15 patients. The target vessel was an unprotected left main artery in 2, left anterior descending artery in 10, left circumflex coronary artery in 1 and right coronary artery in 2 patients. A nonsupported balloon inflation (mean 44 +/- 13 s) was compared with a later retroperfusion-supported inflation (mean 145 +/- 21 s). Right anterior oblique left ventriculograms, aortic blood pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and thermodilution cardiac output were obtained before and during peak untreated and treated balloon inflations and on completion of angioplasty. All patients had either a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.40 or greater than 40% of contracting myocardium estimated to be at risk for severe ischemia during angioplasty. The cardiac (liters/min per m2) and stroke work (g.m/m2) indexes decreased from mean baseline values of 2.5 +/- 0.52 and 52 +/- 15 to 1.7 +/- 0.47 and 27 +/- 12 (mean +/- SD), respectively, during nonsupported balloon inflations but decreased only to 2.1 +/- 0.52 (p less than 0.01 vs. nonsupported) and to 36 +/- 14 (p = 0.01 vs. nonsupported), respectively, during retroperfusion-supported inflations. Ejection fraction (n = 8) decreased from a baseline value of 55 +/- 13% to 27 +/- 7.3% during nonsupported inflations but only to 39 +/- 10% during retroperfusion-supported inflations (p = 0.01 vs. nonsupported). Regional wall motion (area change) in the ischemic (target) region was reduced from a baseline value of 49 +/- 17% to 11 +/- 16% during nonsupported inflations but only to 27 +/- 15% during retroperfusion-supported inflations (p less than 0.01 vs. nonsupported). All but two patients had a favorable hemodynamic response to retroperfusion. There were no serious adverse effects related to the procedures and no hospital deaths. It is concluded from this preliminary study that coronary venous retroperfusion appears to be safe, to provide hemodynamic support and to improve left ventricular function during angioplasty in patients with unstable angina and anatomy at high risk of a coronary event. 
Improved survival after resection of pulmonary metastases from malignant melanoma The value of resecting pulmonary metastases from malignant melanoma was retrospectively examined. Between 1981 and 1989, 56 patients (35 men and 21 women with a mean age of 49 years) had 65 pulmonary resections for histologically proven metastatic melanoma after treatment of the primary tumor. In patients undergoing thoracotomy, 50% (28/56) had pulmonary metastases as the initial site of recurrence. Twenty-eight patients (50%) had local-regional recurrence before the development of lung metastases. Eight lobectomies, two segmentectomies, and 55 wedge excisions were done. Fifty-four patients (54/56, 96%) underwent complete resection, and there were no operative deaths. The postthoracotomy actuarial survival was 25% at 5 years (median interval, 18 months). Location of the primary tumor, histology, thickness, Clark level, local-regional lymph node metastases, or type of resection was not associated with improved survival. Patients without regional nodal metastases before thoracotomy had a median survival of 30 months compared with 16 months for all others (p = 0.04). Patients with lung as the site of first recurrence had a median survival of 30 months compared with 17 months for patients with initial local-regional recurrence (p = 0.038, log-rank test). Despite systemic spread, patients with isolated pulmonary metastases from melanoma may benefit from metastasectomy. 
Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma viruses. Life cycle, pathogenicity, epidemiology, and diagnosis. Human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) was discovered in 1980, and it subsequently was found to be the cause of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. A progressive neurologic disease known as tropical spastic paraparesis, or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, has also been linked to infection with HTLV-I. A related virus, HTLV type II (HTLV-II), has been isolated from patients with hairy-cell leukemia, but it has not been proved to be the cause of any disease. In late 1988, US blood banks began screening all blood donations for antibodies to HTLV-I/II. This program has resulted in the identification of many unexpectedly seropositive blood donors and provided much information about the prevalence of HTLV-I/II in the United States. In this article, I review the replication of these agents, as well as their pathogenesis, diagnosis, and mechanisms of spread. 
Nutritional aspects and swallowing function of patients with Parkinson's disease. Seven patients with Parkinson's disease and three patients with progressive supranuclear palsy underwent adrenal medullary transplant to the caudate nucleus for treatment of their neurologic disease. Preoperative nutritional assessment demonstrated that a significant number of the Parkinson's patients had mild to moderate nutritional depletion. Motility problems, manifest by dysphagia and delayed gastric emptying causing problems over a number of years, were probably responsible. Of the 10 patients studied, 6 were studied by videofluoroscopy. All patients had variable dysphagia of variable servility with or without aspiration. Etiologic factors included the basic underlying neurologic disease, delay in resumption of anti-parkinsonian medications, use of metoclopramide, and postoperative medical complications leading to a debilitated clinical state. 
The effects of sucralfate and luminal stasis on recovery of the chambered rat gastric mucosa from taurocholate-induced damage. We have previously shown, using a gastric chamber model, that both sucralfate and luminal stasis protected the rat gastric mucosa against the development of hemorrhagic erosions produced by subsequent exposure for 10 minutes to acidified (50 mM HCl) 80 mM sodium taurocholate (NaT). The protection afforded by sucralfate was abolished by inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity but restored by sucralfate. In this study we demonstrate that indomethacin pretreatment decreases both the depth (in microns) and magnitude (in pH units) of the juxtamucosal pH gradient, but that sucralfate restores these parameters to levels characteristic of normal mucosae. The cytoprotective effect of sucralfate is thus prostaglandin-independent and, at least in part, a consequence of sucralfate-induced increases in the thickness of the juxtamucosal pH gradient/unstirred layer. We have also examined the ability of sucralfate to prevent the otherwise inevitable development of hemorrhagic erosions when it was applied after the gastric mucosa was exposed to NaT. When 100 mg sucralfate in 50 mM HCl was applied for 10 minutes, without stirring, subsequent to a 10-minute exposure of the mucosa to NaT, the average lesion area was reduced from about 15% to less than 3%. Unlike its cytoprotective property, the ability of sucralfate to accelerate the recovery process after damage was abolished by indomethacin pretreatment. Studies using antimony microelectrodes revealed that indomethacin pretreatment resulted in reductions in both the depth and magnitude of the pH gradient that resulted from plasma efflux from the mucosa after exposure to the acidified bile salt. These studies demonstrate that sucralfate is capable not only of prevention or attenuation of acute damage when administered prior to damaging agents, but is also capable of arresting the sequence of events that produces hemorrhage in the previously inflamed or damaged stomach. 
Assessment of energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry in healthy subjects and patients with liver cirrhosis. The reliability of resting energy expenditure (REE) measurements by indirect calorimetry with a ventilated hood was investigated in 50 healthy controls and 10 patients with liver cirrhosis. In each subject basal energy expenditure (BEE) was determined once and REE three times (morning REE1, noon REE2, afternoon REE3). In controls and patients the first 5-minute BEE and first 5-minute REE (controls also second 5-minute REE) were higher than in the remainder of the 30-minute recording. Only the last 20 minutes of recordings were used to calculate BEE (1645 +/- 315, mean +/- SD, in kilocalories per day), REE1 (1880 +/- 365), REE2 (1782 +/- 384), and REE3 (1775 +/- 316) in controls, and in cirrhotics: BEE (1530 +/- 235), REE1 (1714 +/- 267), REE2 (1715 +/- 238), and REE3 (1779 +/- 275). REE was higher than BEE in controls and cirrhotics (p less than 0.05). The REE variation coefficient was 5 +/- 3% in controls and 5 +/- 2% in cirrhotics. No systematic difference between REE1, REE2, and REE3 was found. Energy expenditure predicted by the Harris-Benedict equation differed up to 21% from measured BEE in individual controls; group mean BEE, however, was correctly predicted. In cirrhotics differences between measured and predicted BEE up to 26% occurred, while measured BEE was higher than predicted BEE (p = 0.06). It is concluded that REE can be reliably assessed by indirect calorimetry with a ventilated hood system in controls and patients at any time of the day, when values obtained in the first 10 minutes are deleted. 
Left ventricular midwall mechanics in systemic arterial hypertension. Myocardial function is depressed in pressure-overload hypertrophy. BACKGROUND. Left ventricular (LV) midwall geometry has been described conventionally as the sum of the chamber radius and half of the wall thickness; this convention is based on the assumption of uniform transmural thickening during systole. However, theoretical considerations and experimental data indicate that the inner half (inner shell) of the LV wall thickens more than the outer half (outer shell). Thus, an end-diastolic circumferential midwall fiber exhibits a relative migration toward the epicardium during systole. As a result, the conventional method provides an overestimate of the extent of the midwall fiber shortening. METHODS AND RESULTS. We developed an ellipsoidal model with a concentric two-shell geometry (nonuniform thickening) to assess midwall fiber length transients throughout the cardiac cycle. This modified midwall method was used in the analysis of LV cineangiograms from 15 patients with systemic arterial hypertension and 14 normal subjects. Study groups were classified according to LV mass index (LVMI): 14 normal subjects (group I), eight hypertensive patients with a normal LVMI (group II), and seven hypertensive patients with an increased LVMI (group III). There were no significant differences in LV end-diastolic pressure or volume among the three groups; the ejection fraction was slightly greater in group II (70 +/- 5%) than in groups I (65 +/- 8%) and III (66 +/- 4%), but this trend did not achieve statistical significance. Values for endocardial and conventional midwall fractional shortening (FS) were also similar in the three groups. By contrast, FS by the concentric two-shell geometry (modified midwall method) in group III (16 +/- 2%) was significantly less than that seen in groups I and II (21 +/- 4% and 21 +/- 5%, respectively; both p less than 0.05). This difference achieves greater importance when it is recognized that mean systolic circumferential stress was lower in group III (151 +/- 22 g/cm2) than in groups I and II (244 +/- 37 g/cm2 and 213 +/- 38 g/cm2, respectively; both p less than 0.01). The midwall stress-shortening coordinates in six of the seven group III patients were outside the 95% confidence limits for the normal (group I) subjects. Thus, despite a normal ejection fraction, systolic function is subnormal in hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy. CONCLUSIONS. Chamber dynamics provide an overestimate of myocardial function, especially when LV wall thickness is increased. This is due to a relatively greater contribution of inner shell thickening in pressure-overload hypertrophy. 
Impaired potassium-induced dilation in hypertensive rat cerebral arteries does not reflect altered Na+,K(+)-ATPase dilation. We have recently demonstrated that K(+)-induced dilation of cerebral resistance-sized vessels has two independent components, only one of which seemed sodium pump dependent. In our current investigation, potassium-induced dilation of spontaneous tone was compared in cerebral arteries from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats and age-matched stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. Branches of the posterior cerebral artery were cannulated and pressurized, and these vessels developed spontaneous tone. After a 5-minute period in K(+)-free physiological saline solution, K+ was increased in 1-mM increments to a final concentration of 15 mM. In the normotensive arteries, K+ concentrations between 0 and 5 mM K+ resulted in dilations that had a transient (sodium pump-dependent) component, and K+ concentrations in excess of 7 mM produced dilations that lacked a transient (sodium pump-independent) component. Similar branches from the hypertensive rat also responded with transient dilations to K+ (less than 5 mM), and these were significantly greater at 3 mM K+. However, the maintained dilations to K+ (greater than 7 mM), noted in preparations from Wistar-Kyoto rats, were absent in seven of eight preparations. Thus, the impaired dilations, in the hypertensive vessels, to K+ described here is a consequence of altered function of some sodium pump-independent component rather than altered Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity. 
Endocarditis due to Trichosporon beigelii: in vitro susceptibility of isolates and review. Infection with Trichosporon beigelii is an uncommon cause of endocarditis. Of the eight cases of T. beigelii endocarditis that have been reported (one herein and seven previously), six involved prosthetic heart valves and two involved native heart valves. The clinical manifestations of this infection included embolization of the superficial femoral artery or of the bifurcation of the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries in three of these patients (two with prosthetic valve and one with native valve endocarditis). In seven of the eight reported cases, blood cultures were positive for the organism. Although clinical isolates of the organism are generally reported to be susceptible to amphotericin B, isolates can vary in their sensitivities to antifungal agents in vitro depending on the methodology used, and clinical response to therapy with antifungal agents in a regimen that includes amphotericin B is generally poor. Only two of six patients who were treated with antifungal agents survived endocarditis caused by T. beigelii and were apparently cured; one of these patients was also managed surgically with valve replacement. Infection with T. beigelii should be considered in the differential diagnosis of endocarditis in immunocompetent patients, particularly those who have a prosthetic heart valve. Rapid, aggressive therapy may be necessary to eradicate this organism. 
Triangulation of pedicular instrumentation. A biomechanical analysis. Tensile load-to-failure pullout tests were performed on 54 cadaveric spinal segments. The vertebrae were grouped by adjacent levels and matched for bone mineral density (g/cm2), which was measured by dual-photon absorptiometry. Triangulation of Steffee screws and CD pedicle screws was accomplished by transverse plates specifically designed to increase fixation within the same vertebra before the longitudinal Steffee plate or CD rod was applied. A transverse plate with adjustable length was also tested to accommodate variable interpedicular distances. Comparative pullout load-to-failures were as follows: laminar hook, 809 SE 99.4 N; single CD pedicular screws, 863 SE 108 N; single Steffee pedicular screw, 1245 SE 75.3 N; adjustable transverse plate, 1341 SE 114; triangulated Steffee pedicle screws with a transverse plate, 1701 SE 151 N; and triangulated CD pedicle screws with a transverse plate, 2096 SE 115 N. Three triangulated constructs with pedicle screws and a transverse plate (CD, Steffee, and Kirschner) provided significantly greater fixation than conventional pedicular or laminar hook based instrumentation systems (P less than 0.05). Improved treatment of spinal deformities in the elderly and osteoporotic population is dependent on improving the fixation at the metal-bone interface of spinal implants Particularly in osteoporotic vertebrae, the strength of fixation of two triangulated pedicle screws is better than either laminar hooks or single pedicle screws. The strength of fixation of triangulated pedicle screws connected by a transverse plate is superior to a single pedicle screw because it is dependent on the mass of bone between the screws rather than simply the amount of bone within the screw thread. 
Late follow-up after repair of left ventricular aneurysm and (usually) associated coronary bypass grafting. This study assesses clinical and operative data (LV) aneurysm was repaired to determine factors that might predict in-hospital and long-term outcome. Long-term follow-up study was obtained in 296 of 298 patients undergoing LV aneurysm repair with or without coronary artery bypass grafting between 1974 and 1986. No patient had sustained a myocardial infarction within 2 weeks of surgery or was undergoing other concurrent cardiac surgery. The average age of the study patients was 57 +/- 9 years and the average ejection fraction was 35 +/- 13%. Ninety percent of the patients underwent concurrent bypass grafting, with an average of 2.2 +/- 1.3 grafts placed. Fourteen (5%) patients died in the hospital, with most deaths attributable to LV dysfunction. Advanced age and less extensive revascularization were correlates of in-hospital mortality. The 10-year survival was 57%, myocardial infarction-free survival 43%, and freedom from death, myocardial infarction and reoperative coronary surgery 41%. Advanced age, systemic hypertension, significant left main coronary artery narrowing and emergent operative status were multivariate correlates of long-term mortality. A low-risk population was defined by the absence of these risk factors, and high-risk by the presence of greater than or equal to 1 risk factors. The 10-year survival was 71% in the low-risk and 41% in the high-risk groups (p = .0006). The 10-year myocardial infarction free survival was 55% in the low-risk and 31% in the high-risk groups (p = 0.0017). LV aneurysm repair may be performed with acceptable in-hospital mortality, and the long-term risk may be stratified. 
Pericardiac extravasation during intravenous digital subtraction angiography: a case report. The authors reported a case, pericardiac extravasation of contract medium during an intravenous angiographic (IV DSA) procedure. To their knowledge this is the first such case in the literature. They suggest modifications of the IV DSA method to avoid this complication. 
Remission of hepatitis B-associated membranous glomerulonephritis in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been associated with several renal diseases, the most common being membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). The role of concurrent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in affecting the course of the renal involvement is largely unknown. We report the case of a HIV-infected adult male with chronic HBV-associated MGN who had complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome associated with spontaneous seroconversion from hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive to HBeAg-negative. The present case illustrates that HIV infection does not preclude improvement of chronic HBV infection or an associated membranous nephropathy. Such improvement may be dependent on the ability of the host immune system to clear HBeAg. 
Spatial control of gut-specific gene expression during Caenorhabditis elegans development. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was transformed with constructs containing upstream deletions of the gut-specific ges-1 carboxylesterase gene. With particular deletions, ges-1 was expressed, not as normally in the gut, but rather in muscle cells of the pharynx (which belong to a sister lineage of the gut) or in body wall muscle and hypodermal cells (which belong to a cousin lineage of the gut). These observations suggest that gut-specific gene expression in C. elegans involves not only gut-specific activators but also multiple repressors that are present in particular nongut lineages. 
Complex ventricular ectopic activity in patients less than 20 years of age with or without syncope, and the role of ventricular extrastimulus testing. To assess the potential for ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular extrastimulus testing was performed in 33 young patients with complex ventricular ectopic activity defined as multiform ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), couplets or nonsustained VT, or a combination, found during electrocardiographic monitoring. There were 21 male and 12 female patients with a mean age of 11 years (range 1 to 18). Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence (14 patients) or absence (19 patients) of syncope. Patients with syncope had ostensibly normal hearts (9 patients) or miscellaneous heart disease (5 patients). Patients without syncope had ostensibly normal hearts (8 patients) or miscellaneous heart disease (11 patients). Ventricular stimulation protocol consisted of burst pacing and 1 to 4 programmed extrastimuli decreasing to refractoriness at 3 drive-train cycle lengths, and at 2 pacing sites (right ventricular apex and outflow tract) during the drug-free baseline state and isoproterenol infusion. No patient had VT induced with 1 or 2 extrastimuli. VT was induced in 13 of 14 patients (93%) with syncope, and in 9 of 19 patients (47%) without syncope (p less than 0.05). Using a 3-extrastimuli protocol, 8 of 14 patients (57%) with and 3 of 19 patients (16%) without syncope had VT induced (p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that VT may be the cause of syncope in young patients with complex ventricular ectopic activity. 
Hexamethylmelamine chemotherapy for persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the activity and toxicity of hexamethylmelamine chemotherapy in patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. Forty-nine women received hexamethylmelamine 100 to 150 mg/day for 14 days, repeated at 4-week intervals. All patients had previously received at least one chemotherapy regimen, and 46 (94%) had received cisplatin. Among 25 patients with clinically measurable disease there were three complete and two partial responses, for an objective response rate of 20%. The mean progression-free interval for responders was 38.6 months versus 9.6 months for nonresponders or patients with nonmeasurable disease (p less than 0.001). Thirteen patients are alive, eight with no clinical evidence for disease. Only four patients discontinued therapy because of toxic reactions. Hexamethylmelamine appears to be a well-tolerated drug with activity against ovarian cancer previously treated with cisplatin. 
Psychiatric disorders in patients with esophageal disease. Psychiatric disorders have potentially important roles in the manifestations of esophageal disease. A primary causative role for psychiatric factors in the common motility disorders associated with chest pain (esophageal spasm and the nonspecific motor disorders) remains unproven, but psychiatric disorders appear particularly prevalent in this group. In most other esophageal diseases, psychiatric factors interact through recognized psychophysiologic or behavioral mechanisms to affect the clinical presentation. Recognizing the possible levels of interaction has significant therapeutic implications. 
Hearing aid prescribing: is the specialist opinion necessary? A restructuring of the service for provision of hearing aids has been proposed by the Royal National Institute for the Deaf. This is based on the assumption that very few patients referred for hearing aids have significant ear disease and it is not necessary for them to see an ENT specialist. The case notes of 200 consecutive patients referred to the Hearing Aid clinic were reviewed. In only half of these would a hearing aid have been prescribed without a specialist opinion. The remainder either did not need a hearing aid or required further investigation and surgical or medical treatment. In addition there was significant evidence of lack of expertise amongst General Practitioners in recognizing ear disorders. It is imperative that any patient requiring a hearing aid be seen by someone experienced in otology rather than be dealt with by the General Practitioner alone. 
Early thrombolytic treatment reduces analgesic requirement in patients with myocardial infarction. The duration and amount of analgesics required were investigated in 67 patients with myocardial infarction treated with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) or placebo in a randomized double-blind trial. Infusion of rtPA (100 mg)/placebo was started within 5 h after the onset of symptoms, and the requirement for analgesics during the following 48 h was recorded. Sixty-seven per cent of the 30 rtPA-treated patients required analgesic treatment for less than 6 h, compared to 38% of the 37 patients in the placebo group (P = 0.04). During the study period, patients in the rtPA group used the equivalent of 5.3 mg (median value) intravenous morphine, which was significantly less than the 11.2 mg used in the placebo group (P = 0.04). In conclusion, the present study suggests that early thrombolysis with intravenous rtPA reduces the amount and duration of analgesic treatment required by patients with myocardial infarction. 
Immediate and late inflammatory responses to ragweed antigen challenge of the peripheral airways in allergic asthmatics. Cellular, mediator, and permeability changes. Asthma may represent the clinical manifestations of a unique form of chronic airway inflammation and is often associated with allergy. To better define the components of allergic inflammation in the lung, fluids obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were examined for cells, inflammatory mediators, and markers of airway permeability 5 min and 19 h following instillation of ragweed antigen directly into an airway segment of allergic asthmatic subjects. The 5-min response to antigen challenge (n = 10) was characterized by 17- to 208-fold increases in histamine, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and its metabolite, 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2, thromboxane B2, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha compared with a saline-challenged segment (0.004 less than p less than 0.017). The increases in most of these mediators were significantly correlated with each other (0.0001 less than p less than or equal to 0.01), and the magnitude of all significant mediator increases was directly correlated with skin test sensitivity to ragweed antigen (0.007 less than or equal to p less than or equal to 0.05). There was also a slight increase in kinins (p = 0.04). Changes in cells and airway permeability were not detected. In contrast, the 19-h response to antigen challenge (n = 9) was characterized by a 13-fold increase in total cells recovered by BAL. Eosinophils, basophils, and lymphocytes were significantly increased and comprised 38, 1, and 9% of total cells, respectively. A neutrophil influx was also observed but was not specific for antigen challenge since a similar change was observed in a sham, saline-challenged site. 
Antiischemic and metabolic effects of glutamate during pacing in patients with stable angina pectoris secondary to either coronary artery disease or syndrome X. The effects of glutamate on anginal threshold, cardiac metabolism and hemodynamics were studied in 11 patients with stable angina pectoris, positive stress test results, and pacing-induced myocardial lactate release due to coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 9) or syndrome X (n = 2). Data were obtained before, during and after 2 identical periods of coronary sinus pacing, the second being preceded by an intravenous injection of monosodium glutamate 1.2 (n = 7) or 2.5 (n = 4) mg/kg body weight. After glutamate administration, pacing time to onset of angina increased from mean +/- standard deviation 103 +/- 53 to 166 +/- 71 seconds (p less than 0.01) and ST-segment depression after pacing decreased from 2.3 +/- 1.0 to 1.6 +/- 1.1 mm (p less than 0.01). Arterial glutamate concentration increased 60% (p less than 0.01) after the low dose and 150% (p less than 0.01) after the high dose of glutamate. Regardless of dose, myocardial glutamate uptake increased by 25% (p less than 0.01). Pacing-induced cardiac release of lactate diminished 50% (p less than 0.05), whereas the releases of xanthine and hypoxanthine were unchanged by glutamate. Arterial free fatty acids decreased 20% (p less than 0.01). Circulating levels and cardiac exchanges of alanine, glucose and citrate were unchanged. Glutamate did not influence heart rate, arterial blood pressure, coronary blood flow, coronary vascular resistance or myocardial oxygen consumption. One patient complained of short-lasting burning sensations after receiving the high glutamate dose. In conclusion, augmented provision of glutamate enhances pacing tolerance in stable angina, presumably by a metabolic improvement of cardiac energy production during ischemia. 
Oxygen utilization, carbon dioxide elimination and ventilation during recovery from supine bicycle exercise 6 to 8 weeks after acute myocardial infarction. The pattern of oxygen (O2) consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide (CO2) production (VCO2), ventilatory and metabolic responses during and in recovery from supine bicycle exercise was examined in 18 patients with recent myocardial infarction. An increase in VO2 with increasing work load was accomplished by proportional increases in both cardiac output and the arteriovenous O2 difference. During recovery, however, the arteriovenous O2 difference rapidly decreased below levels at rest, whereas VO2 and cardiac output remained elevated, indicating that VO2 during recovery further depended on relatively high cardiac output. The ratio of VCO2 to VO2 further increased after exercise, suggesting that such cardiac output contributed to the remaining high CO2 flow to the lung and therefore enhanced ventilation. Increased arterial catecholamines during exercise remained elevated for the first 5 minutes of recovery. Arterial lactate during this period continued to increase and resulted in profound metabolic acidosis, causing alveolar hyperventilation after exercise. These results suggest that during recovery from exercise, cardiopulmonary responses remain enhanced because of continuing high cardiac output, resulting in subsequent high CO2 flow to the lung and metabolic acidosis, and that this may be associated with profound fatigue or dyspnea after exercise. 
Lipoprotein (a) blood levels in unstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, and after thrombolytic therapy. Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] appears to be involved in atherogenesis and in vitro studies have suggested that it may interfere with thrombolysis. In this study, Lp(a) serum levels were determined by radioimmunoassay in 124 patients with ischemic heart disease. Of these, 47 had acute myocardial infarction, 13 had unstable angina, and 64 were age-matched patients with stable angina. Of the 60 patients with acute coronary artery disease, 34 received thrombolysis and 26 did not. In addition to Lp(a), serum plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin, fibrinogen, and D-dimer (cross-linked fibrin degradation products) levels were measured. These tests were repeated after 6 hours in patients with myocardial infarction and unstable angina. No significant difference was found for admission Lp(a) levels among patients with myocardial infarction (0.324 +/- 0.047 g/liter), unstable angina (0.435 +/- 0.123 g/liter) and stable angina (0.431 +/- 0.023 g/liter), between patients with myocardial infarction with or without thrombolytic treatment, nor between late and early measurements in patients with unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. Plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin and fibrinogen values decreased significantly after thrombolytic treatment. The size of this decrease correlated positively with higher Lp(a) blood levels (p less than 0.05). Patients with Lp(a) greater than 0.25 g/liter had a 66% decrease in fibrinogen and a 53% decrease in anti-plasmin, compared with 35 and 32%, respectively, in patients with Lp(a) level less than or equal to 0.25 g/liter (p less than 0.05). Plasminogen levels revealed a similar trend, with a 61% decrease for the higher values and a 45% decrease for the lower values. 
Orthotopic liver transplantation, Epstein-Barr virus, cyclosporine, and lymphoproliferative disease: a growing concern. Lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) is a well-recognized complication of both solid organ and bone marrow transplantations. The occurrence of LPD in these settings is related in part to the use of the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine. We report 12 cases of LPD after orthotopic liver transplantations in 132 pediatric patients. Lymphoproliferative disease occurred as one of three clinical syndromes: (1) lymphadenopathic, (2) systemic, and (3) lymphomatous. Effective management of LPD with excisional therapy or reduction of immunosuppressive medications or both resulted in the survival of 7 of 12 patients. In an alarming and increasing percentage of patients after orthotopic liver transplantation, progressive LPD develops with lethal outcome (5/12 patients). Early recognition of LPD and aggressive intervention may improve outcome in this group. 
Coffee, coronary heart disease and mortality in middle-aged Swedish men: findings from the Primary Prevention Study. The effect of coffee consumption on the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) was studied prospectively in a population sample of 6765 men aged 51-59 years at baseline during the period 1974-1977, and free of myocardial infarction (MI) prior to the screening. During a 7.1-year follow-up there were 230 non-fatal myocardial infarctions. 169 coronary deaths and 478 deaths from all causes. Among men who were smokers at baseline there was no relationship between either non-fatal MI or death from CHD, and coffee consumption. Among non-smokers, a weak but far from significant trend towards an increasing incidence of CHD in heavy consumers of coffee was observed. There was an inverse relationship between mortality from all causes and coffee consumption. 
Dietary lipid predictors of coronary heart disease in men. The Framingham Study. The relationship between dietary lipids and the 16-year incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity and mortality was examined in two male cohorts, aged 45 to 55 years (n = 420) and 56 to 65 years (n = 393) from the Framingham Study. Dietary lipids were assessed through a single 24-hour recall at the initiation of follow-up in 1966 to 1969. In the younger cohort, there were significant positive associations between the incidence of CHD and the proportion of dietary energy intake from total fat and monounsaturated fatty acids. The proportion of energy intake from saturated fatty acids had a marginally significant positive association with CHD. The associations remained even after adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, including serum cholesterol level, suggesting that their effects are at least partially independent of other established risk factors. In contrast to the younger cohort, none of the dietary lipids were associated with CHD in the older cohort. Dietary intervention for the prevention of CHD in younger men is supported by these findings. 
Pill-esophagitis caused by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. A case of meclofenamate-induced pill-esophagitis is reported, and the relevant literature is reviewed. The role of posture, amount of fluid chaser, esophageal obstruction or dysmotility, drug formulation, physical and chemical properties of the drug, and concomitant ingestion of alcohol, as well as the diagnosis and management of such cases, are discussed. 
Increase in atherosclerosis and adventitial mast cells in cocaine abusers: an alternative mechanism of cocaine-associated coronary vasospasm and thrombosis. Coronary vasospasm has been implicated as a cause of myocardial ischemia and sudden cardiac death in cocaine abusers. However, the mechanism or mechanisms remain unknown. Autopsy records (n = 5,871) from the medical examiner's files at Baltimore, Maryland and northern Virginia were examined and 495 persons (8.4%) were identified with positive toxicologic findings for cocaine. Of these, six subjects (1.2%) had total thrombotic occlusion, involving primarily the left anterior descending coronary artery. The mean number of adventitial mast cells per coronary segment and the degree of atherosclerosis were determined. These observations were compared with findings in age- and gender-matched subjects who died from cocaine overdose and in patients who had sudden cardiac death (acute thrombosis) without a history of illicit drug abuse. There were significantly more mast cells in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis than in the other groups. The number of mast cells showed a significant correlation with the degree of cross-sectional luminal narrowing (r = 0.68) in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis but not in subjects with sudden death due to thrombosis (r = 0.34, p less than 0.03). Subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis also had significant coronary atherosclerosis without plaque hemorrhage (five had one or more vessels with greater than 75% cross-sectional area luminal narrowing) despite a mean age of 29 +/- 2 years. These findings suggest that adventitial mast cells may potentiate atherosclerosis and vasospasm, thrombosis and premature sudden death in long-term cocaine abusers. 
Pineal teratoma and its relationship to intracerebral development: case report. A teratoma of the pineal region in a 20-year-old Australian Aborigine is presented in which an unusual location of the straight sinus and tentorium cerebelli suggests that the tumor arose before 4 months of gestation. In addition, this case provides some insight into the development of the falx cerebri, which might arise from the midline fusion of the left and right tentoria cerebelli caused by the dorsal development of the telencephalon. 
Electrophysiologic and electrocardiographic effects, efficacy and safety of encainide in malignant ventricular arrhythmias associated with coronary artery disease. The electrophysiologic and electrocardiographic effects, efficacy and safety of encainide were evaluated in 48 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing programmed stimulation for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The study group included 41 men and 7 women, aged 64 +/- 8 years (mean +/- standard deviation), who had presented with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (4 patients), sustained VT (32), ventricular fibrillation (8) or unexplained syncope (4). The left ventricular ejection fraction averaged 34 +/- 13%. The arrhythmias induced at the baseline, drug-free electrophysiologic study included nonsustained VT in 8 patients, sustained VT in 35 and ventricular fibrillation in 5. All patients had failed greater than or equal to 1 class IA and a combination of class IA and IB agents (mean 2.2 +/- 1.1 drugs) before encainide. Oral encainide was given in a mean daily dose of 80 +/- 11 mg for greater than or equal to 3 days before repeat programmed stimulation. Encainide was discontinued before follow-up electrophysiologic testing in 5 patients due to spontaneous development of new sustained VT. Of the 43 patients undergoing electropharmacologic testing with encainide, 5 had no inducible arrhythmia. In 9 patients VT was inducible by fewer extrastimuli, in 2 patients a previously stable VT required cardioversion, whereas in 28 patients VT remained inducible by the same number of or more extrastimuli. Thus, encainide prevented the induction of VT or ventricular fibrillation in 5 of 48 patients (10%), while it had a possible proarrhythmic effect in 15 patients (31%). Of the 5 patients without inducible VT administered long-term encainide therapy, 1 returned within 4 weeks of hospital discharge with VT recurrence. 
Usefulness of mammography and sonography in women less than 35 years of age. Indications, clinical history, mammographic findings, and clinical outcome were reviewed in 1,016 women younger than 35 years who underwent mammography during an 8-year period. The indications for mammography were a palpable mass in 454 (44.7%), findings at routine screening in 237 (23.3%), lumpiness in 29 (14.9%), unilateral nipple discharge in seven (3.5%), localized breast tenderness in six (5.1%), adenopathy in three (1.9%), diffuse tenderness in two (2.9%), bilateral nipple discharge in two (1.5%), and miscellaneous in four (2.2%). In 405 women (39.9%), at least two-thirds of the breast tissue was radiodense; however, in 299 (29.4%) women the breast was predominantly fatty, allowing for excellent mammograms. Six women had carcinomas: Mammographic findings prompted biopsy in one patient, indicated a benign-appearing mass (found to be solid at sonography or aspiration) in three patients with a palpable mass (contributing to delay in biopsy in two), and were negative in two. Sonography was performed in 389 women and was useful in preventing unnecessary biopsy of cysts but was not useful in differentiating benign from malignant solid masses. Younger women with persistent localized breast symptoms should undergo a tailored mammographic examination, but negative findings or findings of a benign lesion should not preclude biopsy of a palpable solid mass. 
Pattern of arterial involvement of the head, neck, and eyes in giant cell arteritis: three case reports. The findings of two post-mortem examinations and one CT scan of patients with biopsy proved giant cell arteritis (GCA) are presented. The presence or absence of intracranial involvement in GCA is discussed. 
Prognostic value of serum beta-2 microglobulin in low-grade lymphoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate serum beta-2 microglobulin (beta-2M) and other prognostic indicators in previously untreated low-grade lymphoma. DESIGN: Cohort study of 80 patients with uniformly treated low-grade lymphoma, followed for a median of 21 months. These 80 patients, all of whom had serum beta-2M drawn within 2 weeks before starting therapy, were derived from a cohort of 119 previously untreated patients entered into one of three clinical trials. SETTING: Tertiary referral cancer center. PATIENTS: Eighty previously untreated stage I to IV patients (mean age, 55 years). INTERVENTION: Treatment was given according to Ann Arbor stage: Patients in stage IV were treated with CHOP-bleomycin and maintained on interferon therapy; those in stage III received CHOP-bleomycin and radiotherapy; and those in stages I and II received COP-bleomycin and radiotherapy. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome was determined by assessing complete remission rate and time to treatment failure. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used. RESULTS: The complete remission rate for patients with a beta-2M level of 3.0 mg/L or greater was 36% compared with 71% for those with a level of less than 3.0 mg/L. Using multivariate analysis that tested beta-2M as a continuous variable, it was selected as the most significant factor for complete response. The adjusted odds ratio was 0.285 (95% CI, 0.101 to 0.809). The Ann Arbor stage had marginal significance (adjusted odds ratio, 0.435; CI, 0.150 to 1.263). For time to treatment failure, beta-2M was the only variable retained in the multivariate model. At 42 months, no patient with a beta-2M level of 3.0 mg/L or greater was projected to be in remission as compared with 85% of patients with a beta-2M level of less than 3.0 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: The serum beta-2M level is a good predictor of complete response and time to treatment failure. A larger number of patients should be studied to clarify the role of other potentially independent variables such as stage and age. 
A comparison between iotrolan, a non-ionic dimer, and a hyperosmolar contrast medium, Urografin, in hysterosalpingography. For hysterosalpingography, there were no significant differences between the non-ionic dimeric contrast medium iotrolan (300 mgI/%) and Urografin (370 mgI/%) with regard to ease of application or radiographic quality, and both agents were equally suitable. There were no significant differences between two groups of patients with regard to pain due to instrumentation, pain at the time of injection and pain up to 2 h after the procedure. There was a significant difference (p = 0.04) between the two groups with respect to delayed pain, when iotrolan was associated with a lower incidence and decreased severity of delayed pain. There were no differences in the incidence of nausea, vomiting, headache and syncope. No allergic phenomena were seen in either group. 
Sperm chromosomes and habitual abortion. Genetic factors, especially numerical chromosome anomalies, play an important role in embryonic loss. Because somatic cell analysis cannot assess the risk of errors arising de novo during germ cell maturation, we investigated whether the male gametes from couples with habitual abortion carry a higher rate of anomalies than those from donors without reproductive dysfunction. Our results indicate that there is no significant difference between the two groups for the total rates of aneuploidy and structural anomalies. However, the levels of chromosome breaks and acentric fragments were significantly higher in the abortion group. The implications of this fact remain to be investigated. 
Interactions of serum copper, selenium, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherogenesis. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the interactions between serum copper, selenium, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations with regard to the progression of carotid atherosclerosis. DESIGN--Longitudinal study of a cohort of middle aged men followed up for 24 months. SETTING--Epidemiological survey of the population of seven communities in eastern Finland. SUBJECTS--126 men aged 42, 48, 54, or 60 at examination randomly selected from a population based sample of 2682 men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Increase in maximal carotid intima media thickness. RESULTS--The mean increase in the maximal common carotid intima media thickness after two years was greater in men with high serum copper concentrations (0.16 mm compared with 0.08 mm in men with concentrations less than 17.6 mumol/l; p = 0.010), those with low serum selenium concentrations (0.15 mm compared with 0.09 mm in men with concentrations greater than or equal to 1.40 mumol/l; p = 0.035), and those with raised serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (0.15 mm compared with 0.08 mm in men with concentrations less than 4.0 mmol/l; p = 0.032) after adjustment for age and cigarette pack years in a three way analysis of covariance. A raised serum low density lipoprotein concentration was associated with accelerated progression of atherosclerosis only in men with higher than median serum copper concentrations (net difference 0.22 mm; p less than 0.001 for two way interaction), and this synergism was even more pronounced in men with serum selenium concentrations below the median value (net difference 0.41 mm; p = 0.042 for three way interaction). CONCLUSION--These data provide evidence of a synergistic effect of copper (a pro-oxidant), a low serum concentration of selenium (a cofactor of an enzyme that scavenges free radicals), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration in atherogenesis. 
Presynaptic and postsynaptic striatal dopaminergic function in neuroacanthocytosis: a positron emission tomographic study. Using [18F]dopa, [11C]raclopride, C15O2, and positron emission tomography, we have assessed striatal dopamine storage capacity, dopamine D2-receptor integrity, and regional cerebral blood flow, respectively, of 6 patients with neuroacanthocytosis. The patients with neurocanthocytosis all had chorea and variable combinations of seizures, dementia, axonal neuropathy, and orolingual self-multiation. [18F]dopa positron emmission tomographic findings were compared with 30 normal controls and 16 patients with sporadic, L-dopa-responsive, Parkinson's disease. Caudate and anterior putamen [18F]dopa uptake were normal in patients with neuroacanthocytosis, but mean posterior putamen [18F]dopa uptake was reduced to 42% of normal, similar to that in patients with Parkinson's disease. In patients with neuroacanthocytosis, mean equilibrium caudate: cerebellum and putamen: cerebellum [11C]raclopride uptake ratios were reduced to 54% and 62% of normal, compatible with a 65% and 53% loss of caudate and putamen D2-receptor-binding sites, respectively. Striatal and frontal blood flow was also depressed. The severe loss of D2-receptor-bearing striatal neuron, with concomitant loss of dopaminergic projections from the nigra to the posterior putamen, is consistent with both chorea and extrapyramidal rigidity being features of patients with neuroacanthocytosis. 
Influence of balloon size and stenosis morphology on immediate and delayed elastic recoil after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. After successful coronary angioplasty, the minimal luminal diameter of the dilated coronary artery segment is generally smaller than the diameter of the largest balloon catheter at the maximal inflation pressure. The determinants of this phenomenon were studied in 28 patients. Biplane angiograms were obtained after intracoronary administration of isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) before, immediately and 24 h after coronary angioplasty. Balloon and coronary luminal diameters were measured by automated contour detection. Immediately after the procedure, the difference between inflated balloon diameter and minimal luminal diameter averaged 0.93 +/- 0.43 mm for the entire group and was greater both in eccentric stenoses (1.13 +/- 0.39 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.36 mm; p less than 0.01) and after angioplasty with an oversized balloon (1.20 +/- 0.37 vs. 0.71 +/- 0.33 mm; p less than 0.005). At 24 h, the balloon - minimal luminal diameter difference was unchanged at the group level (0.86 +/- 0.38 mm, but the minimal luminal diameter increased significantly in the subgroup of coronary segments dilated with an oversized balloon (1.97 +/- 0.37 vs. 1.81 +/- 0.28 mm; p less than 0.05). Thus, the difference between the minimal diameter of a dilated coronary segment immediately after a successful coronary balloon angioplasty procedure and the maximal diameter of the inflated balloon catheter is dependent both on eccentricity of the stenosis and on the balloon/artery diameter ratio. Moreover, the increase in minimal luminal diameter 24 h after angioplasty performed with an oversized balloon suggest that in addition to elastic recoil partly reversible factors related to vessel barotrauma are involved. 
DNA ploidy and prostate-specific antigen as prognostic factors in clinically resectable prostate cancer. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and DNA ploidy as measured by flow cytometry were compared with conventional prognostic indicators in 112 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for clinically resectable prostate cancer. The variables examined included age, race, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), Gleason score of the radical prostatectomy specimen, and pathologic stage. No significant relationships were found between DNA ploidy and age, mean PAP value, and absolute PAP value. Of the 112 patients, 65 (58.0%) had disease limited to the prostate (pathologic Stages A and B); 47 (42.0%) had extraprostatic disease (pathologic Stages C and D1). The stage was related to the Gleason score (P less than 0.0001) where extraprostatic disease was associated with a Gleason score of 6 to 10. Nineteen (17.0%) patients had aneuploid tumors, and 93 (83.0%) had diploid tumors. DNA ploidy significantly correlated with pathologic stage (P = 0.04); aneuploidy was identified more frequently in patients with Stages C and D1 tumors. Aneuploid tumors occurred more frequently than diploid tumors in patients with a Gleason score of 6 to 10 (P = 0.034). Mean PSA values were higher in patients with aneuploid tumors (P = 0.078), extraprostatic neoplasms (P = 0.00001), and cancers with a Gleason score of 6 to 10 (P = 0.0004). Furthermore, PSA values greater than 10.0 ng/ml were associated with extraprostatic disease and a Gleason score of 6 to 10 (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.001, respectively). Significant racial differences were found with respect to DNA ploidy, mean DNA indices, and mean PSA values. The 18 black patients had more DNA aneuploid tumors (P = 0.043), a higher mean DNA index (P = 0.017), and a higher mean PSA value (P = 0.043) than the 94 white patients. Both PSA and DNA ploidy analysis by flow cytometry appear to be valuable indicators in the evaluation of patients with prostatic carcinoma. 
Epikeratoplasty for keratoglobus associated with blue sclera. Patients with keratoglobus and blue sclera as part of a generalized connective tissue disorder are at a high risk of developing corneal perforations either spontaneously or after mild trauma. Six patients (6 eyes) between the ages of 2 and 16 years of age (mean, 7.5 years) with keratoglobus, blue sclera, hypermobile joints, and consanguineous parents were treated by epikeratoplasty, using commercially prepared 12.5-mm lenticules. Surgery was performed for tectonic support and/or visual improvement and was successful in five of six patients with a follow-up period of 11 to 27 months (mean, 21 months). One lenticule was removed because the epithelium did not heal. Peripheral interface opacities occurred in three patients. 
Clinical course and outcome in class IC antiarrhythmic overdose. 120 cases of class IC antiarrhythmic overdose, including propafenone, flecainide, ajmaline and prajmaline overdose, were evaluated with respect to clinical course, therapy and outcome. Whereas drug overdose in general has an overall mortality of less than 1%, intoxication with antiarrhythmic drugs of class IC was associated with a mean mortality of 22.5%. Nausea, which occurred within the first 30 minutes after ingestion, was the earliest symptom. Spontaneous vomiting probably led to self-detoxication in about half the patients. Cardiac symptoms including bradycardia and, less frequently, tachyrhythmia occurred after about 30 minutes to 2 hours. Therapeutic measures included administration of activated charcoal, gastric lavage and a saline laxative, catecholamines, and in some patients, hypertonic sodium bicarbonate, insertion of a transvenous pacemaker and hemoperfusion. Fatal outcome was mainly due to cardiac conduction disturbances progressing to electromechanical dissociation or asystolia. Resuscitation, which had to be performed in 29 patients, was successful in only two of them. No correlation was found between fatal outcome, the type of antiarrhythmic, and ingested dose. Since a specific treatment is not available and resuscitive procedures including sodium bicarbonate and insertion of a pacemaker are of limited therapeutic value, early diagnosis and primary detoxification are most important for prevention of fatal outcome. 
Cytologic brushings of ductal lesions during ERCP. Cytologic brushings of ductal lesions noted at ERCP are a reliable method of diagnosing malignancy. However, prior studies have involved only small numbers of patients. This study presents the results of attempted brushings in 69 patients. A satisfactory specimen was obtained in 62 patients (90%). The overall sensitivity was 44% with 100% specificity. Common bile duct brushings had a higher sensitivity rate than did pancreatic brushings. Similarly, biliary tract cancer was more likely to be diagnosed than was pancreatic cancer by brushing. Markedly atypical cells were identified in 36% of patients with a false negative cytology result. These findings were not seen in patients with benign disease. Two patients developed mild pancreatitis and one developed cholangitis. It is unclear what role the act of brushing had on causing these complications. 
Symptomatic diverticulum of the 4th ventricle. A case of symptomatic diverticulum of the 4th ventricle in a 57-year-old man is presented. This clinicopathological observation supports a relationship between ventricular diverticula and ependyma-lined paraventricular cysts. 
External cardiopulmonary resuscitation preserves brain viability after prolonged cardiac arrest in dogs. Standard external cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) steps A-B-C produce a low blood flow that may or may not preserve brain viability during prolonged cardiac arrest. A dog model was used with ventricular fibrillation (VF) of 20 minutes, reperfusion with brief cardiopulmonary bypass, controlled ventilation to 20 hours, and intensive care to 96 hours. A retrospective comparison was made of the results of one series, now called "group I" (n = 10)--which received CPR basic life support interposed from VF 10 to 15 minutes, and CPR advanced life support with epinephrine (without defibrillation) from VF 15 to 20 minutes--to the results of another series, now "control group II" (n = 10)--which received VF no flow (no CPR) for 20 minutes. All 20 dogs within protocol were resuscitated. All 10 of group I and 7 of 10 of group II survived to 96 hours. Pupillary light reflex returned after the start of cardiopulmonary bypass at 7.7 +/- 3.7 minutes in CPR group I, versus 16.3 +/- 7.4 minutes in control group II (P = .032). At 96 hours postarrest, final overall performance categories (1, normal; 5, brain death) were better in group I. Six of 10 dogs achieved normality (overall performance category 1) in group I, as compared with none of 10 in group II (P = .004). Final neurologic deficit score (0%, best; 100% worst) was lower (better) in group I (15% +/- 20%) than in group II (51% +/- 6%; P less than .001). 
Exacerbation of partial seizures and onset of nonepileptic myoclonus with carbamazepine. A child had two to three generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures per week unresponsive to phenobarbital (PB) and valproate (VPA). Interictal EEG demonstrated left occipital spikes. When carbamazepine (CBZ) therapy was started, he developed very frequent (4-6/day) complex partial seizures (CPS) characterized on ictal EEG by focal right temporal lobe discharges. The seizure exacerbation, which was associated with development of nonepileptic, multifocal myoclonus, resolved 24 h after CBZ was discontinued. The exacerbation occurred with therapeutic CBZ serum levels, but may have been related to the toxic levels of carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide (CBZE). 
Neurotoxicity after intracarotid 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea administration in the rat: hemodynamic changes studied by double-tracer autoradiography. Changes in blood-brain (BBB) permeability and local cerebral blood flow after intracarotid administration of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) were examined quantitatively in rats with double-tracer autoradiography using [14C]alpha-amino-isobutyric acid and [18F]fluoroantipyrine. Forty-eight female Wistar rats were divided into four groups. The control group (Group 1) received 1 ml of 5% dextrose. The other three groups received three different doses of BCNU dissolved in 5% dextrose: Group II rats received 1 mg, Group III 3 mg, and Group IV 10 mg. The tracer study was performed on Day 1 or Days 4 to 12 after intracarotid administration of BCNU. In 11 rats in Group II, there were no changes of BBB permeability. Transient BBB permeability changes were seen in the striatum or hippocampus in 3 of the 5 rats (60%) in Group III within 24 hours. In 8 of 9 rats (89%) in the same group, late BBB permeability changes were observed in the hypothalamus with or without histological changes. BBB permeability changes were seen in all rats of Group IV. Focal increase of local cerebral blood flow on the infused side compared with the non-infused side of the brain was observed, although not at a significant level, in 5 of 25 rats examined with [18F]fluoroantipyrine. The results of BBB permeability and histological examinations and study of heterogenous distribution by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose indicated that the ipsilateral subcortical structures such as the hypothalamus, amygdala, internal capsule, and caudate putamen have the highest incidence of neurotoxicity, which are closely related to histopathological damage seen in human BCNU leucoencephalopathy. 
Correlation of clinical and histopathologic features in clinically atypical melanocytic nevi. To define better the evolving entity of dysplastic melanocytic nevus (DMN), studies correlating clinical with histologic features of DMN are essential. However, based on a literature search, no previous quantitative analysis was found of the relationship between gross morphologic features and histologic features of DMN. The authors correlated individual clinical features with histopathologic features and histologic diagnosis of the clinically most atypical nevus in 153 melanoma patients. This nevus was identified, evaluated clinically, and removed for histologic evaluation from each patient. Gross morphologic features assessed for nevi included: size (in mm), the presence of a macular component, irregular border, ill-defined border, haphazard coloration, distortion of skin cleavage lines on tangential lighting, asymmetry, and number of colors present (12 features in all). Nineteen histologic features were assessed in each nevus by a single dermatopathologist. These included architectural, nuclear, and cytoplasmic parameters ascribed to dysplastic nevi. Each of these histologic features was correlated with the 12 individual clinical features. Seventeen percent of the nevi fulfilled the criteria for the histologic diagnosis of DMN. Among individual nevus parameters, size (in mm), irregular border, ill-defined border, macular component, and pink color were associated significantly with histologic DMN. Nevus size (in mm) and irregular borders correlated with the greatest number of individual histologic parameters. A comparison of clinicopathologic correlations for two different examiners revealed that certain clinical features are probably more important than others for the recognition of dysplastic nevi and that individual examiners have different thresholds for the perception of some gross morphologic features. These observations are relevant to the development of clinical criteria for dysplastic nevi. 
Left cardiac sympathetic denervation in the therapy of congenital long QT syndrome. A worldwide report. BACKGROUND. Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a congenital disorder accompanied by a high incidence of sudden cardiac death. beta-Adrenergic blockade is the therapy of choice, and it is successful in 75-80% of patients. For those in whom cardiac events (syncope or cardiac arrest) are not prevented by beta-blockade, experimental studies suggest that left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) may be useful. METHODS AND RESULTS. We identified 85 LQTS patients worldwide who underwent LCSD, and we provide here the first large-scale evaluation of its efficacy. The time interval between the first cardiac event and LCSD and the follow-up period after LCSD were similar (5.6 +/- 6.1 versus 5.9 +/- 5.7 years). The mean age of the patients at surgery was 20 +/- 13 years. LCSD was followed by highly significant (p less than 0.0001) decreases in the number of patients with cardiac events (from 99% to 45%), in the number of cardiac events per patient (from 22 +/- 32 to 1 +/- 3), and in the number of patients with five or more cardiac events (from 71% to 10%). There were seven sudden deaths (8%), and the 5-year survival rate was 94%. The marked reduction in the incidence of tachyarrhythmic syncope suggests that LCSD has also reduced the risk for sudden death in this high-risk population. CONCLUSIONS. The present findings demonstrate that for LQTS patients who continue with syncope or cardiac arrest despite the use of beta-blockers, LCSD is a very effective therapy. 
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma in a recurrent thoracic chordoma: case report and literature review. Malignant transformation in a recurrent chordoma in the thoracic region is extremely uncommon. One new case, as well as a review of spinal chordomas that have undergone malignant transformation, is reported. Such cases emphasize the importance of the aggressive initial surgical treatment of spinal tumors. 
Are patients with primary biliary cirrhosis hypermetabolic? A comparison between patients before and after liver transplantation and controls. Wasting is common in end-stage primary biliary cirrhosis and causes concern in patients facing liver transplantation. We have quantified resting metabolic rate and diet-induced thermogenesis in seven patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, in seven patients after liver transplantation who had previously been diagnosed as having primary biliary cirrhosis and in seven controls. Resting metabolic rate was elevated in the primary biliary cirrhosis group (4.44 +/- 0.81 kJ/hr/kg body wt; mean +/- S.D.) compared with the post-liver-transplantation group (3.39 +/- 0.40 kJ/hr/kg body wt) (p less than 0.005) and compared with control subjects (3.65 +/- 0.23 kJ/hr/kg body wt) (p less than 0.01). A highly significant relationship was found between the severity of liver disease in the primary biliary cirrhosis group, as assessed by Child-Pugh score, and the resting metabolic rate group (r = 0.93; p less than 0.005). After a liquid meal (41 kJ/kg body wt), the metabolic rate increased, with similar peak changes from baseline occurring in all three groups. However, the rise persisted significantly longer in the primary biliary cirrhosis patients, and thus the integrated mean postprandial energy expenditure over the 4-hr postprandial observation period was greater in the primary biliary cirrhosis group than in the other two groups (p less than 0.001). 
Percutaneous intraarterial thrombolysis in the treatment of thrombosis of lower extremity arterial reconstructions. Vascular grafts may be salvaged with thrombolytic therapy after acute occlusion as an alternative to balloon catheter thrombectomy. From October 1987 to May 1990, 15 arterial bypasses to the lower extremity (infrainguinal saphenous vein [n = 7] or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [n = 6], and Dacron aortofemoral bifurcation graft limbs [n = 2]) were treated for 30 occulsions with intraarterial urokinase (390,000 IU to 5,808,000 IU) infused from 3 to 40 hours. The origins of 15 graft occlusions were morphologic defects (intimal hyperplasia with anastomotic or conduit stricture), pseudoaneurysm, or progression of disease distal to the graft. Two occlusions were attributed to coagulation disorders. A cause could not be identified for 13 occlusions. Patency was initially restored to all grafts with use of thrombolytic therapy, however, adjunctive surgical thrombectomy to remove persistent thrombus from the graft or outflow vessels was required after six thrombolytic infusions. One graft in the series could not be salvaged leading to below-knee amputation. Graft defects were corrected by balloon angioplasty (n = 7) or surgical revision of the conduit (n = 8). Five significant hemorrhagic complications occurred from the catheter insertion site requiring four emergent surgical procedures and resulting in the death of a fifth patient from a myocardial infarction. This technique allows chemical thrombectomy of branch arteries distal to the graft and inaccessible to a balloon embolectomy catheter, and permits diagnosis of abnormal graft morphology that may be the cause of the graft occlusion. Graft reocclusion can be expected if technical defects in the arterial reconstruction are not revised or hypercoagulable states are not treated. 
Effects of positive end-expiratory pressure on splanchnic circulation and function in experimental peritonitis. Splanchnic and central hemodynamic effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were studied in anesthetized pigs using mechanical ventilatory assistance, with or without sepsis (fecal peritonitis). One hour after sepsis, PEEP (10 cm H2O) was applied (n = 6). Another group (n = 6) had sepsis without PEEP. In one group (n = 6) without sepsis, PEEP was applied after 1 hour, while a fourth group (n = 5), without sepsis or PEEP, served as a control. The group with PEEP and sepsis had reduced cardiac index, portal venous blood flow, and liver surface blood flow. The group with PEEP alone had reduced splanchnic circulation by increasing gastrointestinal vascular resistance, while the group with sepsis alone had increased portal vascular resistance. In a separate series with sepsis, intermittent PEEP, and vigorous fluid resuscitation, it was demonstrated that avoiding hypovolemia did not seem to protect from the PEEP effects on the splanchnic circulation. The combination of sepsis and PEEP was not additive on portal blood flow reduction but reduced bile production.
