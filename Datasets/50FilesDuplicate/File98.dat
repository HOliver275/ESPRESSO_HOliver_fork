Hamartomas of the breast. The clinical and pathologic findings of 17 hamartomas of the breast were studied. All neoplasms were evident as clinically and mammographically discrete masses. The pathologic findings were varied and included circumscribed fibrocystic disease, adenolipoma, fibroadenoma with fat and fibroadenoma with lobules. The heterologous elements identified were cartilage and smooth muscle. All lesions were treated by simple excision. In this study, four different microscopic patterns of hamartoma are described and the necessity for a close clinicopathologic correlation is pointed out in the diagnosis of this lesion. 
PET studies of fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism in patients with recurrent colorectal tumors receiving radiotherapy. Forty-four patients with recurrent colorectal carcinoma were examined prior to a combination of conventional photon radiotherapy (40 Gy) and neutron therapy (10 Gy). Twenty-one of these underwent a PET examination after photon therapy and 12 also were studied after the end of combined therapy. CEA plasma levels were measured from blood samples taken immediately before the PET study. A significant decrease in FDG uptake despite good palliative results were observed in only 50% of the patients. This may be explained by inflammatory reactions caused by radiation injury. Inflammation and metabolically active residual tumor tissue cannot be distinguished. It is concluded that an observation interval longer than 6 mo may more effectively detect residual tumor activity. In 14 of 41 examinations, an increased FDG uptake was associated with a normal CEA value, and in only two cases were normal FDG uptake values and increased CEA levels found, suggesting that PET is more sensitive than the measurements of CEA plasma levels for tumor recurrence. 
Surgical management of extracranial vertebral artery occlusive disease. Thirty-seven consecutive patients underwent vertebral artery (VA) reconstruction over a 6 years period (1983-1989). Detailed neurologic, medical, and angiographic information was obtained for all patients. Indications for surgery were as follows: (1) stenosis of VA with symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency; (2) very tight stenosis (greater than 75%) of the dominant VA with stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral VA; (3) very tight stenosis of VA with bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA); (4) very tight stenosis of VA with homolateral ICA lesion eligible for simultaneous repair; (5) very tight stenosis of VA and very tight stenosis of the homo or contralateral carotid siphon. There were 15 isolated vertebral lesions (group I), and 22 were VA lesions associated with lesions of the supraaortic trunks which were simultaneously treated (group II). The reconstructions of the first portion of the VA were 30 (12 of group I and 18 of group II) and reimplantation of the VA into the common carotid artery was the procedure of choice. There were 7 revascularizations of the third portion of the VA at C1-C2 level (3 of group I and 4 of group II): carotid-vertebral bypass, using an autogenous vein graft, was the procedure of choice. Three patients in group II died in the immediate postoperative period from myocardial infarction but no patient presented immediate postoperative neurologic deficits. All symptomatic patients but one were relieved of their symptoms in a median follow-up of 31 months. No postoperative complications were observed. Long-term results were satisfactory in all the 28 patients at their last follow-up visit. 
The role of supplemental lag-screw fixation for open fractures of the tibial shaft treated with external fixation. Ninety-nine open fractures of the tibial shaft were treated with unilateral external fixation with or without supplemental lag-screw fixation. We compared the results in forty-four fractures in which only external fixation was used (control group) with those in fifty-five fractures that were stabilized with lag-screws and external fixation, and we found no statistically significant differences between the two groups with respect to the time to full weight-bearing, the time to union, or the rates of delayed union, osteomyelitis, malunion, superficial or deep pin-track infection, or loosening of the pins. The limbs in which the fracture was treated with external fixation and supplemental lag-screws had more than twice the rate of refracture of the control limbs (11 compared with 5 per cent), and the percentage of fractures having supplemental lag-screw fixation that needed bone-grafting to achieve union was more than twice that in the group treated with external fixation alone. We concluded that the routine use of supplemental lag-screw fixation is not indicated in patients who have an open fracture of the tibial shaft that has been stabilized with external fixation. 
Carcinosarcoma of bladder following long-term cyclophosphamide therapy. Since the advent of long-term cyclophosphamide therapy, an association between this agent and the subsequent development of bladder neoplasms has been documented. Only six sarcomas have been reported, to our knowledge. This report describes the first case in which a leiomyosarcoma and an invasive transitional cell carcinoma (ie, carcinosarcoma) developed in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with 240 g of cyclophosphamide over a 6.5-year period. 
Granulomatous angiitis of the spinal cord associated with Hodgkin's disease. A 28-year-old man had a 5-month history of focal and generalized neurologic symptoms culminating in a thoracic myelopathy. Evaluation revealed granulomatous angiitis of the spinal cord in association with occult nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. In previous reports, manifestations indicative of intracranial involvement have dominated the clinical presentation of granulomatous angiitis associated with Hodgkin's disease. Successful therapy for Hodgkin's disease may result in marked improvement of associated granulomatous angiitis, whereas the lack or failure of therapy results in a uniformly fatal outcome. Definitive antemortem diagnosis of granulomatous angiitis requires a biopsy of involved tissue. The cause of granulomatous angiitis, as well as the nature of its association with Hodgkin's disease, remains unexplained. 
Soft-tissue tumors of the foot: value of MR imaging for specific diagnosis. We reviewed MR imaging findings in 14 patients with primary soft-tissue tumors of the foot and compared them with surgical and pathologic findings to determine the value of MR imaging in anatomic localization, delineation, and characterization of such lesions. Nine tumors (64%) were benign, and five (36%) were malignant. The anatomic location (compartment, space, relation to specific tendon) and extent of all tumors were accurately shown by MR imaging. Twelve tumors (86%) were correctly characterized as benign or malignant. Eight (89%) of nine benign lesions showed distinctive MR imaging features that correctly suggested a specific diagnosis. These included hemangioma (high T2-weighted intensity and internal septa), ganglion cyst (homogeneous, high T2-weighted weighted intensity and peritendinous location), plantar fibromatosis (nodularity of plantar aponeurosis with low intensity on all sequences), and pigmented villonodular synovitis (low T2-weighted intensity and lower intensity rim). Aggressive fibromatosis (one case) could not be characterized. Four (80%) of five malignant neoplasms had MR imaging findings suggesting soft-tissue sarcoma. Two synovial sarcomas were inhomogeneous and showed extensive peritendinous growth. Two clear cell sarcomas arose at the origin of the plantar aponeurosis and infiltrated adjacent muscle. A small clear cell sarcoma could not be characterized as benign or malignant. MR imaging of the foot is accurate in showing the extent of soft-tissue tumors, which is helpful for surgical planning. Determination of their specific anatomic location may help characterize some tumors. Although our series is small, it appears that MR imaging often suggests a specific diagnosis in certain benign soft-tissue tumors of the foot and may often correctly distinguish benign from malignant tumors. 
Focal hepatic lesions: differentiation with MR imaging at 0.5 T. Magnetic resonance (MR) examinations of 43 patients with 95 focal hepatic lesions (diameter, greater than 1 cm) were analyzed for lesion shape, homogeneity, and relative signal intensity compared with normal liver parenchyma, spleen, and skeletal muscle. On T1-weighted, balanced, and T2-weighted images, most metastases (74%), cavernous hemangiomas (76%), and cysts (82%) were smooth and round or oval, while the hepatocellular carcinomas all had irregular borders (40%) or were lobulated (60%). All lesions with irregular borders were malignant. Seventy percent of metastatic lesions, 85% of cavernous hemangiomas, and 100% of simple hepatic cysts were of homogeneous signal intensity, while 60% of hepatocellular carcinomas were inhomogeneous. Logistic regression analysis of multiple lesion characteristics showed that inhomogeneous lesions had a high likelihood of malignancy, while markedly hyperintense lesions had a very low probability of being malignant, regardless of other traits. Homogeneous lesions that were isointense or hyperintense compared with spleen on balanced images but were not markedly hyperintense on T2-weighted images also had a high likelihood of malignancy. 
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in Raynaud's phenomenon. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) has been described as resulting in vasodilatation. The effect of 2 Hz TENS of the right hand during forty-five minutes on skin temperature and plethysmography of the third digit of both hands and feet and on transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcpO2) of the right hand was compared with that of a control study using indifferent stimulation of the iliopsoas region in 8 patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. After TENS a slight increase in skin temperature of both hands was found, while plethysmographic amplitude was increased in the contralateral hand only. No changes in TcpO2 occurred. The authors conclude that the observed small effects of TENS are of no clinical value in primary Raynaud's phenomenon. 
Coronary vasoconstriction induced by vasopressin. Production of myocardial ischemia in dogs by constriction of nondiseased small vessels. BACKGROUND. We studied the effect of intracoronary administration of arginine-8-vasopressin on blood flow in nondiseased coronary arteries and determined whether this vasoconstriction was severe enough to produce ischemia in 30 dogs. METHODS AND RESULTS. In group 1 (n = 6), after vasopressin administration coronary blood flow was decreased by 41% (p less than 0.002) without changes in heart rate or aortic pressure, and left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiocardiography was decreased by 18% (p less than 0.0005). In group 2 (n = 6), ischemia was confirmed by measurement of transmural pH changes. Administration of vasopressin decreased subendocardial pH of the infused zone from 7.40 +/- 0.03 to 7.31 +/- 0.07 (p less than 0.01). The subendocardial pH of the zone not infused with vasopressin did not change. To overcome the intrinsic regulation of blood flow, operating primarily in small coronary arteries, we hypothesized that vasopressin must increase resistance primarily in large rather than small coronary arteries. After intracoronary infusion in group 3 (n = 6), however, most (94%) of the increase in resistance during vasopressin administration was explained by an increase of resistance in small coronary arteries. In group 4 (n = 9), vasopressin decreased coronary blood flow by 50% and decreased local shortening by 90% at a time when systemic hemodynamics were unchanged. Coronary constriction induced by vasopressin, or the recovery from it, also was not altered by cyclooxygenase blockade. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, vasopressin produces myocardial ischemia by constricting small, nondiseased coronary arteries severely enough to overcome the competition from normal coronary regulation, and this ischemic event is not mediated by prostaglandin products. 
Clinical characteristics of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema. We present the cases of two patients with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema that required intubation for life-threatening airway compromise. This side effect has been previously reported with all ACE inhibitors, but its incidence and potential for a fatal outcome may not be fully appreciated. A review of the literature reveals 227 reports of this reaction with an overall incidence of approximately 0.1% to 0.2%. The etiology is nonimmunogenic and thought to be related to accentuated bradykinin activity. There is no clinical profile that identifies patients at increased risk for this side effect. There are unique clinical characteristics to this idiosyncratic reaction: angioedema may suddenly occur even though the drug has been well tolerated for months or years; symptoms may regress spontaneously while the patient continues the medication, erroneously prompting an alternative diagnosis; the pathology has a special predilection for the tongue, a circumstance that renders orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation difficult; symptoms may progress rapidly despite aggressive medical therapy, necessitating emergency airway procedures; and a rebound phenomenon following successful medical therapy has been described. We recommend intensive medical treatment before angioedema is severe enough to thwart standard methods to ensure a protected airway. Once even minor angioedema is attributed to an ACE inhibitor, an alternative class of antihypertensive medication should be chosen. Individuals with a history of idiopathic angioedema probably should not be given ACE inhibitors. 
Imaging of cystic and cavitary lesions of the spinal cord and canal. The value of MR and intraoperative sonography. This article discusses the utility and technique of magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative spinal sonography in the evaluation of cystic and cavitary lesions of the spinal cord and canal. The pathophysiology and fluid dynamics of these lesions are also discussed. 
Metabolism of prostaglandin F2 alpha in Zellweger syndrome. Peroxisomal beta-oxidation is a major importance for in vivo degradation of prostaglandins in humans. We have recently shown in vitro that the peroxisomal fraction of a rat liver homogenate has the highest capacity to beta-oxidize prostaglandins. In order to evaluate the relative importance of peroxisomes for this conversion also in vivo, we administered [3H]prostaglandin F2 alpha to an infant suffering from Zellweger syndrome, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of intact peroxisomes. As a control, labeled compound was administered to two healthy volunteers. Urine was collected, fractionated on a SEP-PAK C18 cartridge, and subjected to reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The Zellweger patient was found to excrete prostaglandin metabolites considerably less polar than those of the control subjects. The major urinary metabolite in the control subjects was practically absent in the urine from the Zellweger patient. The major urinary prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolite from the Zellweger patient was identified as an omega-oxidized C20-prostaglandin, 9,11-dihydroxy-15-oxoprost-5-ene-1,20-dioic acid. The major urinary prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolite from the control subjects had chromatographic properties of a tetranor (C16) prostaglandin, in accordance with earlier published data. The present results, in combination with our previous in vitro data, indicate that peroxisomal beta-oxidation is of major importance for in vivo chain shortening of prostaglandins. 
Single photon emission computed tomography in patients with acute hydrocephalus or with cerebral ischaemia after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), cerebral blood flow was studied in eight patients with gradual deterioration in the level of consciousness after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Four had cerebral ischaemia and four had acute hydrocephalus. In patients with cerebral ischaemia, single photon emission computed tomography scanning showed multiple regions with decreased uptake of technetium-99M labelled d,l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (99mTcHM-PAO) mainly in watershed areas. In patients with acute hydrocephalus, decreased uptake was seen mainly in the basal parts of the brain: around the third ventricle, around the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles, and in the basal part of the frontal lobe. After serial lumbar puncture, there was improvement of the uptake of 99mTc HM-PAO in these basal areas in three (convincingly in two and slightly in the other) of the four patients accompanied by clinical improvement in these three patients. These results suggest that patients with acute hydrocephalus and impaired consciousness after SAH, in contrast to patients with cerebral ischaemia, have decreased cerebral blood flow predominantly in the basal parts of the brain. 
Long-term patient survival after cystectomy for regional metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. The records of 280 patients who underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder between 1971 and 1986 were reviewed. A total of 42 patients had either 1 (stage pN1) or more than 1 (stage pN2) positive lymph nodes (20 and 22 patients, respectively). The over-all 3-year survival rate for patients with positive lymph nodes was 27%, and it was 30 and 18.5% for stages pN1 and pN2 disease, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed a sustained survival advantage for stage pN1 over pN2 disease for the first 3 years (p less than 0.05) but the difference was not significant at 5 years of followup. Eleven patients with negative lymph nodes but local extension of tumor into the prostatic stroma and/or ducts had a 5-year survival rate of 36%, which equaled the survival of 49 stage pT3b,pN0 cancer patients in the same series. Surgical mortality for the entire population of 280 patients was 2.1% and there was no increase in mortality or morbidity among the node positive patients. Based on the findings of improved survival of stages pN1 and pT3b,N0 cancer patients compared to stage pN2 cancer patients, the tumor, nodes and metastasis classification offers more specific prognostic information than does a single designation of Jewett stage D disease. 
Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea and cardiovascular collapse in a young child owing to environmentally acquired cocaine. Acute crack cocaine intoxication has become a significant problem in both adolescent and adult patients. Recently, cases of cocaine toxicity in infants and toddlers have been described. We report a four-year-old child with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea and shock after intoxication by crack cocaine. Acute cocaine intoxication should be considered in the differential for hemorrhagic diarrhea and shock. The gastrointestinal decontamination following cocaine ingestion is discussed. 
Osteoid osteoma. Diagnosis, localization, and treatment. The preoperative insertion of a needle under computed tomographic scan, performed under local anesthesia, is a convenient and important new way to localize the nidus in osteoid osteoma. It necessitates less bone removal, which should reduce the postoperative fracture rate. It should also help to locate the lesion during surgery. Some clinical points and previously unstressed pathologic findings are also discussed. 
Attitudes of family practice residents about speech-language-hearing referrals. The "family doctor" has been identified as the professional most likely to be contacted by the general public with concerns about communication disorders; yet the family practice physician is unlikely to refer patients with communicative disorders to speech-language pathologists or audiologists for nonmedical evaluation and treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine attitudes of family practice residents about referral patterns for communication disorders using a survey format. Thirty-nine residents estimated that they had referred an average of 1.5 patients to a speech-language pathologist and 2.2 patients to an audiologist during a six-month interval. The findings indicated that these residents did not routinely refer patients to speech-language pathologists. When they did refer, a limited view of communication problems was used. 
An open-label trial of fluoxetine for obsessive-compulsive disorder in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) occurs commonly in association with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS) and can be a major source of disability. Fluoxetine, a new antidepressant, has been effective for psychiatric patients with OCD. We conducted an open-label trial of fluoxetine (20 to 40 mg/d) for 32 GTS patients with OCD. After 1 week of treatment, six patients (16%) withdrew from the trial due to perceived lack of benefit. Data were analyzed for 26 patients (13 children and 13 adults) who were treated by a neurologist for 3 to 8 months. Following treatment, there was a significant reduction in scores on the Leyton Obsessional Inventory for both the adult and child groups, and 81% of patients reported a subjective improvement in obsessions and compulsions. Since fluoxetine was well tolerated, our findings indicate that the drug may be an effective agent for the treatment of OCD in GTS patients. 
Instantaneous hyperemic flow-versus-pressure slope index. Microsphere validation of an alternative to measures of coronary reserve. BACKGROUND. The instantaneous hyperemic flow-versus-pressure (i-HFVP) slope index is a new method of assessing maximal coronary conductance and can be used as an alternative to conventional measures of coronary reserve. The i-HFVP slope index is determined by measuring the slope of the linear diastolic segment of the relation between instantaneous aortic pressure and hyperemic coronary flow. METHODS AND RESULTS. To validate the i-HFVP slope index as a measure of maximal coronary conductance, we compared this method with a microsphere-derived measurement of maximal coronary conductance (m-HFVP slope index) by determining the slope of the least-squares regression line of the data points for coronary flow during maximal hyperemia and four or five steady-state alterations of aortic pressure in 43 dogs (open-chest, anesthetized preparations) with or without coronary stenoses. The i-HFVP slope index demonstrated no dependence on heart rate, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, or mean aortic pressure and was highly reproducible within the groups studied (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.86 for normal arteries, 0.87 for stenotic arteries, and 0.93 for combined groups; for all coefficients, p less than 0.001). The i-HFVP slope index was significantly decreased in the presence of a stenosis (10.3 +/- 3.9 for normal arteries versus 3.6 +/- 1.6 for stenotic arteries, p less than 0.001) as was the transmural m-HFVP slope index (8.9 +/- 4.6 for normal arteries versus 5.3 +/- 3.1, p less than 0.01). Of special importance, the i-HFVP slope index measurement for normal arteries was not significantly different from the transmural and subendocardial m-HFVP slope index measurements (10.3 +/- 3.9 versus 8.9 +/- 4.6 and 9.2 +/- 5.7, respectively). For stenotic arteries, the i-HFVP slope index measurement was also not significantly different from the transmural and subendocardial m-HFVP slope index measurements (3.6 +/- 1.6 versus 5.3 +/- 3.1 and 4.1 +/- 2.3, respectively). The i-HFVP slope index correlated best with subendocardial m-HFVP slope index measurements (correlation coefficient, 0.57; p less than 0.001). When the 95% confidence intervals for the transmural (or subendocardial) m-HFVP slope index in normal arteries were compared with the i-HFVP slope index values, the latter demonstrated a systematic trend to overestimate the m-HFVP slope index. In the presence of a stenosis, this effect was minimized, and the slope values were nearly identical. CONCLUSIONS. The i-HFVP slope index correlates most closely with subendocardial coronary conductance; the index is a hemodynamically independent measure of coronary reserve that is reproducible over a broad range of aortic pressures; and the methodology is applicable to an intact circulation in experimental preparations and may with future developments also prove useful in humans. 
Duplex Doppler sonography of the hepatic vein in tricuspid regurgitation. Patients with tricuspid regurgitation may present initially with vague abdominal symptoms and elevated liver enzymes. In the absence of diagnostic sonographic findings, patients may be subjected to an unnecessary invasive liver biopsy for an accurate diagnosis. We recently described the association of the pulsatile portal venous waveform on duplex Doppler sonography with tricuspid regurgitation in 15 patients. In this study I describe the changes in the hepatic venous waveform in these patients and compare the findings with the final diagnosis as determined by Doppler echocardiography (n = 14) or ultrafast CT (n = 1). All patients had clinical findings consistent with liver dysfunction and were referred for sonography to rule out diseases of the liver, biliary tree, or hepatic or portal veins. All patients had persistently dilated hepatic veins and inferior venae cavae. Twenty-four volunteers, 11 of whom had simultaneous ECG tracings, served as a control group. The main findings on the hepatic duplex sonogram in the disease group were a decrease in the size of the antegrade systolic wave with a systolic/diastolic flow velocity ratio of less than 0.6 (n = 4) or reversal of the systolic wave (n = 10). In all volunteers, systolic flow was antegrade and the ratio was more than 0.6. Two diagnoses were false positive and one was false negative. In some patients with sonographic signs of congestive heart failure, duplex Doppler sonography of the hepatic vein may be helpful in the diagnosis of one of the causes of liver dysfunction, tricuspid regurgitation. 
Dysplastic nevi. Occurrence in first- and second-degree relatives of patients with 'sporadic' dysplastic nevus syndrome. In this study a cross-sectional survey was undertaken among 156 living family members of 31 probands originally classified as having sporadic (histologically verified) dysplastic nevus syndrome (DNS). Seven (13.2%) of 53 parents had clinically recognizable DNS. Twenty-six (36.1%) of the 72 sibs showed dysplastic nevi. The diagnosis of DNS in family members was based on mainly clinical examination; in eight family members--those with only mild manifestation of DNS--a nevus was removed for histologic confirmation. After correction for pedigree size, we found that 60% of patients with "type A sporadic" DNS actually had one or more relatives with a DNS phenotype. Only 25% (8/30) of the probands were ultimately true sporadic cases without a DNS-affected first- or second-degree relative. In 15% (5/31) of the probands no conclusions concerning the type of DNS could be made because the pedigree size did not allow such a conclusion. We also found a higher prevalence of dysplastic nevi among the younger generation as compared with the older generation in our probands with DNS and their families as well as in a general population study of 400 individuals. This generation-dependent difference in expression of the DNS phenotype suggests that besides a genetic factor, other factors may play a role in the development of the characteristic phenotype. 
The difficult dilation: a method for dilation of severe esophageal strictures in children. Occasionally severe esophageal strictures will develop in children that will not allow the passage of standard Jackson or bougie dilators. These small strictures can be successfully treated using a standard intubating laryngoscope for visualization and Rush urethral Filiform dilators. 
Pyoderma gangrenosum with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma manifested as lower extremity ulcers--case reports. Patients with extensive lower extremity ulcerations initially thought to be vascular disease were subsequently proved to have pyoderma gangrenosum and malignant lymphoma. Both patients died of sepsis; one patient exhibited hypogammaglobulinemia involving immunoglobulins IgA, IgG, and IgE; in the second patient, a polyclonal excess involving IgA and IgE was present. 
Electrophysiological effects of left ventricular hypertrophy. Effect of calcium and potassium channel blockade. BACKGROUND. To define the arrhythmogenic effects of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the intact heart, we carried out a detailed electrophysiological assessment in our previously validated feline aortic-banding model and then tested the effects of agents that blocked either the slow inward calcium or voltage-dependent potassium channel. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured intraventricular and interventricular conduction times, excitability thresholds, ventricular effective refractory periods, and monophasic action potential duration at several sites in cats with LVH as well as in concurrent control (sham-operated) cats. In addition, we assessed vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia using direct measurement of ventricular fibrillation (VF) thresholds and by standard techniques of programmed stimulation. Despite finding no difference between LVH and sham-operated cats in mean values for several electrophysiological parameters, the former group was significantly more vulnerable to VF, with more spontaneous VF and lower VF thresholds. Compared with the sham controls, LVH cats also had a greater dispersion of effective refractory period (35 +/- 11 versus 12 +/- 4 msec, p less than 0.01) and monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (69 +/- 25 versus 39 +/- 7 msec, p less than 0.02). Verapamil had no significant effect on these electrophysiological parameters, nor did it affect VF threshold. However, risotilide, an inhibitor of the voltage-dependent potassium channel, narrowed dispersion of the effective refractory period and monophasic action potential duration concomitant with a marked reduction in ventricular vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS. LVH has a pronounced effect on dispersion of refractoriness and repolarization and renders the ventricle more vulnerable to fibrillation. Blockade of the voltage-dependent potassium channel, but not the slow inward calcium channel, narrows the dispersion of recovery of excitability and protects against VF. 
A comparative study of the cerebrovascular complications of cocaine: alkaloidal versus hydrochloride--a review. Cocaine, especially in its alkaloidal or "crack" form, has been increasingly associated with cerebrovascular disease. Before the crack epidemic, cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) was also implicated as a cause of stroke. However, less is known about the differences in stroke subtypes, age at stroke onset, or presence of underlying structural cerebrovascular disease with different forms of cocaine use. We compared 26 patients (previously reported) from our four institutions plus 16 cases reported in the literature of stroke associated with alkaloidal cocaine to 63 (57 reported in the literature and six not previously reported from our four institutions) cases of stroke associated with cocaine HCl. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes are equally likely after alkaloidal cocaine use, whereas cocaine HCl is more likely (approximately 80% of the time) to cause hemorrhagic stroke, with approximately half the intracranial hemorrhages occurring from ruptured cerebral saccular aneurysms or vascular malformations. The presence of an underlying cerebral aneurysm was more common among patients with cocaine HCl-associated strokes than alkaloidal cocaine-associated strokes. Cerebral infarction was significantly more common among the alkaloidal cocaine users than in all the cocaine HCl users, and this was also true when alkaloidal cocaine users were compared with parenteral cocaine HCl (intravenous and intramuscular) users. Only hemorrhagic stroke has been reported with intravenous cocaine HCl use. We conclude that the pathogenesis of cocaine-related stroke is heterogeneous, and depends, in part, on the form of cocaine used. 
Spinal intramedullary ependymal cyst. Report of three cases. Three cases of spinal intramedullary ependymal cyst, two at the thoracolumbar junction and one in the cervical spinal cord, are reported in women in their fifth to seventh decades. Neurological signs and symptoms were extremity dysesthesias, paresthesias, and weakness. Plain cervical and lumbothoracic x-ray films were normal for the patients' age. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a rounded cystic intramedullary mass at the thoracolumbar junction in two cases and at C3-7 in one case. The signal intensity of the cyst contents approximated that of cerebrospinal fluid on T1- and T2-weighted images. Upon administration of gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA), MR imaging showed no enhancement in the cyst wall or cavity. Myelotomy and cyst drainage were performed in each case, and the neurological status of each patient improved. The lining of the cyst was biopsied in one of the three patients undergoing surgery and was composed of a single layer of cuboidal cells supported by glial tissue. Periodic acid-Schiff staining of the tissue did not reveal a basement membrane. The findings in these cases suggest that the Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging appearance of intramedullary spinal ependymal cyst is consistent and allows for accurate preoperative diagnosis with or without biopsy. 
In vivo detection of somatostatin receptors in patients with functionless pituitary adenomas by means of a radioiodinated analog of somatostatin ([123I]SDZ 204-090). The recent availability of a Tyr3-substituted octreotide (SDZ 204-090) for radioiodination has allowed somatostatin (SRIH) receptor binding to be studied in vivo, and receptor-positive tumors of different origins to be visualized with a gamma-camera. This prompted us to investigate whether this compound could be used for external imaging of functionless pituitary adenomas displaying SRIH receptors. Eight patients with functionless pituitary adenomas, three patients with acromegaly, and three with macroprolactinoma were injected iv with 123I-labeled Tyr3-octreotide and then scanned with a gamma-camera. Positive scans were obtained in the three acromegalics and in two of the eight patients with functionless pituitary tumors. The patients with macroprolactinoma had negative scans. The diagnosis of functionless pituitary adenomas was confirmed by light and electron microscopic examination as well as immunocytochemical studies. In vitro binding of [125I]Tyr11-SRIH to cell membranes was evaluated in four functionless and three GH-secreting adenomas removed from seven of the patients. All of the GH-secreting as well as one of the four functionless adenomas had high affinity SRIH-binding sites, without differences in number or affinity, whereas SRIH-binding sites were not detected in the others. Positive scans were observed only in patients bearing tumors with high affinity SRIH-binding sites. In conclusion, [123I]Tyr3-octreotide appears to be a promising tool for singling out, in vivo, patients with functionless pituitary tumors displaying SRIH receptors who might potentially benefit from octreotide treatment. 
The growing teratoma syndrome. A 26-year-old man presented with multiple pulmonary nodules and a left testicular mass. Combination chemotherapy for a malignant, mixed germ cell testicular tumor resulted in shrinkage of the pulmonary nodules and normalization of the tumor markers (beta-HCG, LDH and AFP). Subsequent surgical excision performed for enlargement of the pulmonary nodules revealed mature teratomas, diagnostic of the GTS. 
Transient myocardial ischemia during Holter registration before and after coronary angioplasty. PURPOSE: Revascularizing procedures like percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) aim at reducing the incidence and severity of myocardial ischemia. To evaluate this, continuous Holter ST analysis is a possible method. DESIGN: 41 patients (35 men, 6 women) with stable angina pectoris had continuous twenty-four-hour two-channel Holter registration (V5/aVF-analogous leads) recorded before and after PTCA. Transient myocardial ischemia (TM) was defined as 0.1 mV ST depression or more 80 msec after the J point for one minute or more. FINDINGS: PTCA was successful for 37 patients (90%). Eleven of these had a total of 53 episodes of TM, 36 (68%) before and 17 (32%) after PTCA (p less than 0.05). Fifteen episodes (28%) were symptomatic, and 38 (72%) were asymptomatic. Six patients had TM after successful PTCA, 5 of whom had one-vessel disease and a clinically uncomplicated course. One patient had multivessel disease, with only one vessel dilated. Follow-up angiograms for 9 of the 11 patients with TM revealed 5 restenoses. There was no significant correlation between TM after PTCA and subsequent restenosis (p greater than 0.05). IMPLICATIONS: TM is common in patients with stable angina pectoris. The incidence significantly decreases after successful PTCA, but TM is seen also with a clinically uncomplicated course. In multivessel disease this is consistent with incomplete revascularization, whereas in single-vessel disease the most likely cause is intermittent spasm or thrombosis. TM after successful PTCA does not seem to be a predictor of restenosis. 
The infrequent association of systemic lupus erythematosus and solid tumors. The authors describe the clinical course of two patients with long-standing, indolent systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) who developed, respectively, a breast carcinoma and a malignant melanoma 8 and 15 years after the diagnosis of lupus; both patients died with evidence of widespread, rapidly progressive metastatic disease at a time when the SLE was minimally active and did not require immunosuppressive therapy. The association of SLE and solid tumors in the same patient is reviewed. The frequency of this association appears to be low and the most often described tumors are of uterine and bladder origin. The clinical course of the solid malignancy in these patients is not always described in detail. Careful epidemiologic studies on the true incidence of solid tumors in patients with SLE are required to better understand this association. 
Sodium regulation in the affinity of renal alpha 2-adrenoceptors for epinephrine in Sabra salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rats. Sodium ions markedly decreased in vitro renal alpha 2-adrenoceptor affinity for epinephrine in Sabra hypertensive (SBH) but not in normotensive (SBN) rats. Under these conditions, affinity of alpha 1-adrenoceptor for epinephrine was unchanged in SBH and SBN rats. If these data could be confirmed in vivo, the sodium ion, by acting as an inhibitor, could modify the effect of agonists on renal alpha 2-adrenoceptors in SBH rats. Conversely, the absence of sodium regulation in SBN rats might represent a genetically mediated change responsible for the resistance to the development of salt-induced hypertension. 
Collagenous colitis with involvement of terminal ileum. We present a case of collagenous colitis with evidence of terminal ileal involvement. The patient suffered from chronic watery diarrhea of three months' duration, and colonoscopy revealed a normal endoscopic appearance. Histologic examination of biopsies revealed a broad subepithelial band of collagen, with similar histologic findings in the terminal ileum. Additionally, the patient exhibited abnormalities of d-xylose and vitamin B12 absorption, although there were no clinical signs of malabsorption. Biopsy of the proximal small intestine was normal. The significance of these findings for the definition of the clinicopathologic entity of collagenous colitis and its pathogenesis are discussed. 
Realistic expectations for the patient with intermittent claudication. To determine the natural history of intermittent claudication 112 patients were followed for a minimum of 5 years and a median period of 82 months. Thirty-seven patients (33 per cent) died during the study period. Myocardial infarction (44 per cent) and cerebrovascular disease (28 per cent) were the most common causes of death. Overall mortality rate was 8, 23 and 40 per cent, at 2, 5 and 8 years respectively. Initial ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) correlated with subsequent death. With an initial ABPI less than 0.5 death occurred in 20, 50 and 69 per cent at 2, 5 and 7 years respectively, compared with 5, 16 and 24 per cent respectively for those with an initial ABPI greater than or equal to 0.5 (P less than 0.0001). Of the survivors only 21 per cent had worsening claudication and 13 per cent progressed to critical ischaemia. Arterial bypass for limb salvage was required in eight patients and four limbs were lost during the study period. ABPI identifies a subgroup of claudicants with an extremely high risk of death from coronary and/or cerebral pathology. In this subgroup an aggressive approach to the correction of atherosclerotic risk factors, rather than emphasis on the peripheral vascular problem alone, may improve survival. 
Management of the failed exstrophy closure. In the last 5 years we have seen 15 boys and 9 girls with failure of exstrophy closure, including 20 who had classical bladder exstrophy and 4 who had cloacal exstrophy. At the time of presentation 18 patients had undergone 1 closure while 6 patients had undergone 2 prior exstrophy closures. Closure was performed for complete bladder dehiscence in 16 cases and for significant bladder prolapse in 8. None of the patients underwent any form of osteotomy at the time of initial closure and in 19 closure was done within 72 hours of birth. Two patients underwent posterior iliac osteotomy elsewhere at the time of secondary closure. All patients referred to our institution underwent either posterior iliac osteotomy (8 patients) or anterior innominate osteotomy (16 patients). Epispadias repair along with reclosure of bladder exstrophy was done in 13 boys. The upper tract remained normal in all patients. There were no instances of failure in this group of reclosures. Eight patients have undergone subsequent bladder neck reconstruction of whom 7 are dry for 4 hours and 1 remains totally incontinent. Two patients have undergone simultaneous bladder neck reconstruction and augmentation cystoplasty, and they are dry on intermittent self-catheterization. The failed exstrophy closure presents a formidable dilemma. However, a secure reclosure can be achieved with careful surgical technique, a well performed osteotomy (even if previously performed) and concomitant epispadias repair for male subjects. 
Ascites and pleural effusions associated with endometriosis. We report a case of ascites and bilateral pleural effusions associated with an endometrioma in a 26-year-old woman of Chinese descent. She had a right salpingo-oophorectomy and partial omentectomy performed, and she received leuprolide acetate depot injections after the operation. We believe this is the first description of use of a GnRH agonist to treat this rare condition. 
Aortic sepsis: is there a role for in situ graft reconstruction? Conventional extraanatomic reconstruction for aortic sepsis is associated with a significant risk of operative death, as well as frequent late complications. We evaluated in situ aortic grafting in the treatment of primary or graft-related aortic infection. Eleven selected patients underwent in situ aortic graft reconstruction in the setting of mycotic aneurysm (n = 5), secondarily infected aortic aneurysm (n = 1), primary aortoenteric fistula (n = 1), and secondary aortoenteric fistula (n = 4). All patients survived: follow-up from 10 to 130 months reveals no evidence for graft thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm, new or recurrent aortoenteric fistula, or subsequent aortic operations in any patient. A literature review produced 110 cases of aortic sepsis managed by in situ aortic reconstruction during the last decade. Thirty-two patients (29%) either died in the operative period or suffered a lethal late complication associated with their aortic reconstruction. This mortality rate declined to 21% if patients undergoing incomplete removal of a contaminated graft were excluded, and to 19% with the addition of our 11 patients. Both our experience and that described in the literature suggest that, in properly-selected patients, in situ aortic graft replacement may be a rational treatment option for localized or circumscribed aortic sepsis. 
Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia after resection of thoracic esophageal cancer. The rate of occurrence of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia (PHB) following esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer was 67%, 115/171 cases, which was significantly higher than those following total gastrectomy (28%, 40/144 cases) and colectomy (12%, 7/59 cases). Among the operative procedures, right thoracotomy with extensive lymphoadenectomy had the highest rate of PHB (87%), perhaps due to the longest operation time and the largest intraoperative blood loss. Preoperative risk factors were glucose intolerance, reduced lymphocyte count, and poor nutritional state. The change in bile acid composition, as well as the elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, indicated the presence of postoperative cholestasis which was relevant to total parenteral nutrition. The results suggest that the development of PHB was related to the extent of surgery and the use of parenteral nutrition. 
A comparative analysis of Giliberty, Bateman, and Universal femoral head prostheses. A long-term follow-up evaluation. This study compares four different types of bipolar hip prostheses used from 1977 to 1984. The devices studied were the Giliberty I and II hip prostheses, the Bateman I prosthesis, and the Universal Hip Replacement (UHR) prosthesis. The surgical indications for prosthetic hip replacement in all cases were displaced subcapital hip fractures (Garden Types 3 and 4). Postoperative evaluation included D'Aubigne's hip rating system and roentgenograms to assess prosthetic placement, dislocation, disassembly of the components, and the presence of inner and outer bearing motion of the prostheses. Results of the study revealed intact inner bearing motion in all of the devices investigated in the immediate postoperative period. The UHR prosthesis demonstrated a statistically significant lower incidence of dislocation and no incidence of prosthesis disassembly. This study demonstrates the superiority of the bipolar prosthesis when compared to published results of the so-called unipolar prosthesis and also suggests superiority of the design and function of the UHR prosthesis when compared to the Bateman I and Giliberty prostheses. Longer follow-up evaluation is needed to assess the effects of a functioning bipolar prosthesis on acetabular wear. 
Pancreatic lesions in the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Common manifestations of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, an autosomally dominant inherited cancer-prone disorder, include retinal angiomatosis, hemangioblastoma of the central nervous system, renal cysts, renal cancer, pheochromocytoma, and epididymal cystadenoma. Multiple cysts and microcystic (serous) cystadenomas of the pancreas have also been reported occasionally in patients afflicted with this syndrome. In the large Freiburg study of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome composed of 66 affected individuals, pancreatic lesions were systematically studied. Fifty-five living individuals were examined by abdominal ultrasound imaging. Abnormal findings were confirmed by computed tomographic scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging. For an additional 11 decreased patients autopsy data were available. Cystic lesions of the pancreas were found in 10 patients (15%). One of these patients presented with multiple pancreatic cysts as the only manifestation of the syndrome. In one patient, a malignant islet-cell tumor was found at autopsy. Because multiple pancreatic cysts did not cause major clinical symptoms and because follow-up examinations over an average period of 5 years did not show significant progression of the lesions, it is concluded that these patients usually do not require surgical treatment. Abdominal ultrasound screening is recommended for patients at risk as a tool to identify potential von Hippel-Lindau syndrome gene carriers with pancreatic manifestations. In all patients with multiple pancreatic cysts, the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis. 
Preventive practices for adult cardiovascular disease in children. BACKGROUND. Differences between family practitioners and pediatricians regarding appropriate interventions for cardiovascular disease prevention in pediatric patients have been described by national surveys of physicians in the two specialties. the purpose of the study reported here was to determine whether similar differences existed in a more complete sample from a confined geographical area in which local standards of care might influence physicians practicing in the locale. METHODS. Members of the Southwestern Ohio Society of Family Physicians and the Cincinnati Pediatric Society were surveyed by questionnaire about their attitudes and practices concerning cardiovascular risk factors in children. The response rate was greater than 70% in each specialty group. RESULTS. Differences in the diagnosis and treatment of hypercholesterolemia were detected: (1) pediatricians screened patients at younger ages and used lower cutoff points for diagnosis (5.0 vs 5.5 mmol/L [192 vs 211 mg/dL]); and (2) family physicians were more likely to treat with medication (57% vs 5%), whereas pediatricians referred hypercholesterolemic patients to specialists more often (71% vs 19%). Both family physicians and pediatricians mislabeled blood pressures at the age-specific 90th percentile as normal (21% and 14%, respectively); this occurred more commonly with younger patients. Blood pressure was the risk factor most often measured, but smoking was the risk factor that received the most counseling by physicians in both specialties. CONCLUSIONS. Both family physicians and pediatricians reported feeling inadequately prepared to counsel lifestyle changes, and ranked obesity, smoking, and cholesterol as topics of greatest interest for continuing medical education courses. Physicians in both specialties did not routinely update family history of cardiovascular disease during well-child visits. 
Prevention of cerebral vasospasm by actinomycin D. The role of endothelin, a newly found vasoconstrictor peptide, is examined in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the dog. Endothelin immunoreactivity was overexpressed in the endothelium of the vasospastic basilar artery. Because endothelin synthesis is regulated at the messenger ribonucleic acid transcription level, the effect of actinomycin D, a ribonucleic acid synthesis inhibitor, was studied as a means of preventing vasospasm. It was found that treatment with intravenous actinomycin D for 5 days beginning on the day of SAH completely inhibited the development of vasospasm. This novel experimental therapy may lead not only to the elucidation of the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm but also to the availability of a prophylactic adjuvant therapy for patients with SAH. 
Liver involvement in Alpers disease. Alpers disease consists of diffuse cerebral degeneration manifested as developmental delay, seizures, vomiting, and progressive neuromuscular deterioration, with liver disease and death. We report the clinical course of the liver disease, histologic progression of the hepatic lesions, and etiologic investigations in five patients (four girls, three kinships). All had grown and developed normally until seen at 6 to 36 months of age (mean 20 months), with vomiting (n = 5), progressive hypotonia (n = 3), or seizures (n = 2). All had been given anticonvulsants, including valproic acid in three. Liver disease was noted at a mean age of 35 months (range 9 to 67 months), with hepatomegaly (two patients), abnormal hepatic synthetic function (three) or transaminase values (three), and cirrhosis in one. Patients survived for a mean of 4.6 weeks (range 1 to 8 weeks) after the identification of liver disease; all died of hepatic failure. Results of evaluation for infectious and metabolic causes of liver disease and causes of degenerative neuromuscular disease were negative in all patients. Premortem liver biopsy specimens (n = 3) demonstrated an early lesion consisting of lobular disarray, microvesicular steatosis, periportal acute and chronic inflammation, and individual hepatocyte necrosis. Autopsy findings (n = 5) consisted of macrovesicular steatosis, massive hepatocyte dropout, and proliferation of bile ductular elements, with almost complete replacement of hepatocytes by proliferating bile ductular elements in two patients. Brain showed characteristic neuronal degeneration. We conclude that Alpers disease can be a cause of rapidly progressive liver failure in early childhood. Although the cause of this autosomal recessive disease is not known, it does not appear to be related to peroxisomal dysfunction. 
Cardiovascular and antiarrhythmic effects of esmolol in children. This prospective study evaluated the cardiovascular and antiarrhythmic effects of esmolol, an intravenous beta-blocker with an extremely short half-life. Twenty patients (aged 2 to 16 years) underwent diagnostic electrophysiologic studies at rest and during beta-blockade induced with esmolol. An initial dose of 600 micrograms/kg was infused for 2 minutes and followed by an infusion of 200 micrograms/kg per minute. The dosage was increased by 50 to 100 micrograms/kg per minute every 5 to 10 minutes until a reduction of greater than 10% in either heart rate or mean blood pressure was seen. The dosage required to achieve beta-blockade ranged from 300 to 1000 micrograms/kg per minute (mean 550 micrograms/kg per minute). Electrophysiologic effects included a decrease in the rate of sinoatrial node discharge and delay in conduction through the atrioventricular node. There was no effect on His-Purkinje conduction. Atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods were unchanged. In six patients with supraventricular tachycardia, esmolol prevented induction of tachycardia in four and slowed the rate of the tachycardia in two. In four patients with ventricular tachycardia, clinical findings were improved in three and unchanged in one. Heart rate and blood pressure returned to near baseline values 10 minutes after the esmolol infusion was stopped. Adverse ventricular electrophysiologic effects were observed in two patients with biopsy evidence of myocarditis. No other adverse effects were seen. We conclude that the effects of esmolol in children are similar to those of other beta-blockers and that it is useful in the evaluation and management of pediatric tachyarrhythmias. The weight-adjusted dosage required to induce beta-blockade in children is larger than the adult dosage, and the effects of esmolol dissipate rapidly. 
Low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) vs dextran 70. The prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. The Danish Enoxaparin Study Group. A prospective randomized study compared the thromboprophylactic efficacy and safety of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), enoxaparin (40.6 mg subcutaneously once daily), with a standard regimen of dextran 70 in patients undergoing elective total hip replacement. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed by bilateral ascending phlebography 7 to 11 days after operation. Two hundred forty-six patients were included and 219 were eligible for analysis. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in seven of 108 patients in the LMWH group and in 24 of 111 patients in the dextran group. Clinical symptoms of pulmonary embolism did not develop in any patients during the study. In the postoperative period, patients receiving LMWH had a lower blood loss in drains and required fewer blood transfusions than patients receiving dextran, although no significant differences were noted between the groups with respect to the total number of blood transfusions required. Bleeding events and adverse events did not differ between the groups. None of the patients died in hospital during the study. One patient in the LMWH group died at home 15 days after the operation. Three patients receiving dextran had development of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis after hospital discharge. In conclusion, enoxaparin was a more effective thromboprophylactic than a standard regimen of dextran in patients undergoing total hip replacement. The two regimens were equally safe under the clinical conditions. 
Radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy for treatment of early stage cervical cancer: clinical experience of 278 cases. This study includes 278 cases of stage I and II cervical cancer subjected to radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. The clinical experience of 278 cases is reviewed. Of these cases, 215 were in stage I, and 63 were in stage II. Intraoperative complications occurred at a rate of 9.7% and involved injuries to the great vessels, lower urinary tract, nerves, and rectum. Operative mortality was found to be 0.3%. Postoperative complications were observed in 20.1% of patients. Fistulae were observed in 8 (2.8%) patients. The overall survival rate was 83.8%. The 5-year survival rates for stages IA, IB, IIA, and IIB were 100.0%, 87.9%, 71.0%, and 64.0%, respectively. Pelvic lymph node metastases varied from 0% for stage IA to 40.0% for stage IIB and paraaortic involvement varied from 0% for stage IA to 50.0% for stage IIB. Radical surgery seems to be the treatment of choice for patients with early invasive cervical cancer. 
Children with epilepsy: the effect of seizures, syndromes, and etiological factors on cognitive functioning. Overall, children with epilepsy have poorer concentration and mental processing and are less alert than age-matched controls. The relationship between cognitive functioning and epilepsy is complex, however, with widely differing degrees of intellectual impairment--ranging from minimal to severe and progressive--related to diverse types of epileptic seizures, syndromes, and etiological factors. Prolonged and frequently repeated seizures are typically associated with more severe effects on cognitive functioning, particularly if epilepsy is symptomatic, i.e., secondary to a demonstrable brain lesion. A combination of such factors may contribute to the mental deterioration seen in many children suffering from severe epilepsy. 
The Western Washington Myocardial Infarction Registry and Emergency Department Tissue Plasminogen Activator Treatment Trial. This study comprised a registry and an emergency department treatment trial using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. During 1 year, 1,028 patients with documented acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were evaluated for eligibility for thrombolytic therapy. Of these, 221 patients (22%) were eligible for thrombolytic therapy under currently accepted criteria, 175 (79%) of them were correctly identified by emergency department physicians for thrombolytic therapy, and 160 were enrolled in the trial. Only 3 patients (2%) enrolled by emergency department physicians did not subsequently evolve documented AMI. In all, 807 patients (78%) were ineligible for thrombolytic therapy: 335 (33%) because of greater than or equal to 1 contraindications, 364 (36%) because of nondiagnostic electrocardiograms on presentation, and 105 (10%) because of age greater than 75 years, or greater than 6 hours of chest pain at presentation, or both. Mortality in treated patients at 14 days was 5.6%, and survival at 1 year was 92%. The mean time from hospital arrival to thrombolytic treatment was 55 +/- 27 minutes. Initial management of AMI with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the emergency department provided rapid and safe treatment comparable to that reported in trials that started treatment in the coronary care unit. The proportions of eligible patients could be increased from 1 in 5 to 1 in 3, if patients currently excluded only because of age greater than 75 years or because of greater than 6 hours of chest pain were offered treatment. 
Somatosensory and magnetic evoked potentials in a postoperative paraparetic patient: case report. Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) testing is increasingly being used to test for spinal cord injuries and to monitor spinal surgery to reduce the risk of paraplegia. It is a sensory test, but it is assumed that any process severe enough to affect the motor tracts will also affect the sensory tracts and, therefore, be identified. Increasingly, however, isolated motor-tract involvement has been reported. A new technique, magnetic coil stimulation of the cortex, directly monitors the motor tracts. We report a case where the SSEP was normal although the magnetic motor-evoked potential was abnormal, supporting the hypothesis that direct testing of motor tracts may be advantageous. 
Partial agenesis of the anterior corpus callosum: correlation between appearance, imaging, and neuropathology. Two patients with partial (semilobar) holotelencephaly are reported with apparent partial agenesis of the corpora callosa. These patients are of interest because they appear to possess the posterior portion of the corpus callosum but not its anterior component. Because the corpus callosum develops in the commissural plate rostrally and is elaborated in a rostral-caudal gradient, this apparent lack of the rostral component is embryologically puzzling. The neuropathologic studies of 1 patient resolved the apparent discrepancy between magnetic resonance imaging and embryology of the corpus callosum. With these data, we addressed the embryologic factors that may explain this malformation. 
Nimodipine and bradycardia in acute stroke--drug or disease? A patient who had suffered an acute ischemic stroke experienced bradycardia while being treated with nimodipine 80 mg tid. This became evident after the initiation of nimodipine and progressed, leading to the drug being discontinued after three days of therapy. The bradycardia resolved shortly after the treatment was terminated and normal heart rate was maintained throughout 23 days of hospitalization and in subsequent outpatient follow-up. Although nimodipine-induced bradycardia is possible, hemispheric cerebral infarction may also cause transient bradyarrhythmias in the acute stroke period. There is a need to monitor the heart rate and rhythm of all acute stroke patients, especially those receiving nimodipine. 
Survival and management considerations in postirradiation osteosarcoma and Paget's osteosarcoma. Postirradiation and Paget's osteosarcomas are high-grade malignancies. The five-year survival was only 10% in recent experience at the author's institution. Progressive pain is an important clinical feature in both conditions. Careful roentgenographic studies demonstrate cortical destruction and a soft-tissue mass in virtually all patients. Metastasis was present in 25% of both groups of patients at presentation. In contrast to previous series, more than 80% of the patients with postirradiation osteosarcoma had had irradiation for malignant entities and more than 70% had been treated with modern radiotherapy regimens (cobalt-60 or linear accelerator). Twice as many patients with postirradiation osteosarcoma were evaluated and treated in the 1980s than in the previous decade. The initial indication for irradiation often was carcinoma of the breast, uterus, or cervix, or lymphoma. Two-thirds of the patients had progressive disease that was not controllable within six months after diagnosis. Early detection may be the only effective means of improving survival with postirradiation or Paget's osteosarcoma. These patients require lifelong follow-up evaluations. 
Rupture of the internal elastic lamina and vascular fragility in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. We studied a possible relation between stroke and an enhanced susceptibility to rupture of the arterial internal elastic lamina by comparing stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with spontaneously hypertensive rats, which have a very low incidence of stroke. We quantified interruptions in the internal elastic lamina in certain arteries and studied the effect of beta-aminopropionitrile, an inhibitor of cross-link formation in collagen and elastic fibers, on rupture of the internal elastic lamina and on mortality in these two substrains. To eliminate any influence of higher blood pressure in the stroke-prone rats on the parameters studied, we used antihypertensive treatment to obtain equivalent blood pressures in the two substrains. Results showed that stroke sensitivity was associated with an enhanced early spontaneous rupture of the internal elastic lamina in the caudal artery, an increased susceptibility to beta-aminopropionitrile-induced rupture of the internal elastic lamina, and earlier mortality, mainly from aortic rupture, under beta-aminopropionitrile treatment. These findings suggest that stroke-prone rats have an enhanced minor connective tissue defect that is expressed by rupture of the internal elastic lamina and may be related, at least in part, to their greater vascular fragility and increased susceptibility to stroke. 
Obstetric accidents: the patient's perspective. Cases from the files of Action for Victims of Medical Accidents which had resulted in stillbirth, perinatal or neonatal death and long term mental or physical handicap were reviewed. In 41 cases there was both a detailed letter from the parents and an independent review by a senior obstetrician. The reviewer's main criticisms were of inadequate fetal heart monitoring, lack of involvement of senior staff and inadequate records. The fetal heart trace was missing in 7 cases and over half of the remaining 34 traces available were misinterpreted or not acted on. In 17 cases junior doctors failed to recognize fetal distress and managed a delivery that they did not have the experience to deal with. In a further 6 cases, senior staff were called but did not come. Records were criticized for being incomplete, illegible or missing. In a few cases unjustified alterations appeared to have been made. Women reported that on some occasions staff ignored their worries, were unsympathetic and gave too little information. Some parents also experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining a clear explanation of the nature and cause of their child's condition. 
Effect of dietary menhaden oil on normal growth and development and on ameliorating mucosal injury in rats. We evaluated the effects of menhaden oil on growth and development of the small intestinal mucosa in growing rats and on the progression and resolution of methotrexate-induced mucosal injury in the rats. One study compared effects of diets containing 10% safflower oil(SO), 9% SO and 1% menhaden oil (MO), 10% MO, or 9% MO and 1% SO on mucosal growth and development for 125 d. In another study, animals fed the 10% MO or the 10% SO diet for 5 wk were subjected to subcutaneous methotrexate injections for 3 consecutive days. Feeding rats a diet containing large amounts of menhaden oil resulted in lower prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 synthesis and lower sucrase activities. Indicators of mucosal mass after methotrexate-induced injury were significantly improved in both the jejunum and ileum at 3 and 10 d after methotrexate administration. Our data suggest that dietary menhaden oil stimulates mucosal regeneration after methotrexate-induced injury. 
Surgical collars: a survey of their prescription and use. We report the results of a questionnaire survey of 124 orthopaedic, rheumatology, medical and accident and emergency outpatients prescribed a surgical collar during a 3-month period. Of these, 99 (80%) returned the questionnaire. Instructions received about when to wear the collar differed widely, especially between specialties. Most patients (76%) found benefit in wearing the collar. Pain was the symptom helped most (78%) whilst dizziness was helped least (40%). Problems with the collars were common, many being too hot (69%) and uncomfortable (48%). A third had difficulty putting the collar on. Despite these problems, compliance was good with 19 patients discontinuing collars for reasons other than recovery or medical advice. We believe this study highlights further areas for research and stimulates a re-evaluation of collar usage. 
Usefulness of severity of myocardial ischemia on exercise testing in predicting the severity of myocardial ischemia during daily activities. To determine the relation between myocardial ischemic indexes on exercise testing and on ambulatory Holter recording, 60 patients with stable coronary artery disease who exhibited an ischemic response to both testing procedures were studied. All patients performed a Bruce protocol exercise test and underwent 24-hour Holter recording within 2 weeks without antianginal medications. Mean exercise duration was 7.4 +/- 2.8 minutes, mean heart rate at 1-mm ST depression was 118 +/- 20 beats/min and mean maximal ST depression during exercise was 2.2 +/- 1 mm. During Holter recording the average number of ischemic episodes was 4.7 +/- 2.6 per patient, mean duration of daily ischemia was 62 +/- 54 minutes, mean maximal ST depression was 3.2 +/- 1.3 mm and average heart rate at 1-mm ST depression was 93 +/- 17 beats/min. Overall, the correlations between ischemic indexes on both testing procedures were very weak (mean r2 = 0.054). The only exercise variable that had a significant correlation (p less than 0.05) with all Holter variables was heart rate at 1-mm ST depression, yet it correlated very weakly (0.064 less than or equal to r2 less than or equal to 0.125) with most Holter covariates and had a better correlation (r2 = 0.256) only with average heart rate at 1-mm ST depression during Holter. Thus, ischemic indexes on exercise testing cannot accurately predict ischemic indexes on ambulatory Holter recording in patients with stable coronary artery disease who exhibit ischemic changes on both tests. 
A molecular genetic study of factor XI deficiency. Factor XI deficiency is a rare bleeding diathesis found predominantly in Ashkenazi Jewish kindreds. A recent study of six Jewish patients identified three distinct mutations (Types I, II, and III) in the factor XI gene that were sufficient to fully define the genotypes of the patients. We have investigated 63 patients with factor XI deficiency and find overall allele frequencies of 44% for the type II mutation, 31% for the type III mutation, and 0% for the type I mutation. Therefore, 25% of the mutant factor XI alleles in our sample remain undefined. However, the distribution of mutant alleles is significantly different between Jewish and non-Jewish populations with hitherto undefined mutations accounting for 84% of the disease alleles in non-Jewish patients. Plasma factor XI:C levels were found to differ significantly between different homozygous and compound heterozygous genotypes and the inheritance of the II/III genotype was found to carry an increased risk of the most severe bleeding tendency. 
Surgical treatment and prevention of vasculopathic impotence in conjunction with revascularisation of the lower extremities in Leriche's syndrome. The results are presented of combined revascularization of the lower extremities and the penis in 29 patients with Leriche's syndrome. This was effected by placing an autogenous venous shunt between the branch of a prosthesis or the common femoral artery and one of the dorsal arteries of the penis. Preoperatively lost sexual function was restored in 6 patients, while in 16 the sexual function was maintained at the preoperative level or improved in the late postoperative period. A comparison of the results obtained with the sexual performance of patients who had undergone bifurcated aortofemoral shunting only, prompted the conclusion that this surgical procedure was effective in the prevention and treatment of vasculopathic impotence in Leriche's syndrome. 
Flecainide in the treatment of fetal tachycardias. Fourteen mothers were treated with flecainide for fetal atrial tachycardias associated with intrauterine cardiac failure. Twelve of the 14 fetuses responded by conversion to sinus rhythm. One of the 12 fetuses subsequently died in utero. The remaining fetuses suffered no morbidity and were alive and well 3 months to 2 years after delivery. The two fetuses in whom atrial tachycardia did not convert with flecainide were successfully treated with digoxin. These results compare favourably with previous forms of antiarrhythmic treatment. After recent reports of the side effects of flecainide treatment, however, it has been advised that this drug should be confined to high risk patients and those with life threatening arrhythmias. The use of flecainide for fetal arrhythmias should be limited to patients with severe fetal hydrops and supraventricular tachycardias. It should not be the first drug of choice in atrial flutter. 
Life-sustaining therapy. A model for appropriate use New strategies are needed to curb the proliferation of life-sustaining therapies that rarely benefit patients. We propose a model for appropriate use of such therapies that incorporates effectiveness, utility, and marginal costs. If a therapy is rarely effective and rarely desirable, it is considered medically inappropriate. If the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio is inordinately high, it is considered economically inappropriate. If a therapy is either medically or economically inappropriate, it should not be automatically offered. The model provides an operational definition of futility and is illustrated with an analysis of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation for chronically ill older people. Advance directives, explicit health care rationing, and defining futile therapy based on survival predictions are alternatives to the appropriate care model, but are insufficient strategies to solve the problem of inappropriate life-sustaining care. 
Serial antiarrhythmic drug treatment to maintain sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion for chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. The sequential use of different types of antiarrhythmic drugs may improve arrhythmia prognosis in chronic atrial fibrillation or flutter after successful electrical cardioversion. The rationale for serial treatment is that the arrhythmogenic mechanism may vary between patients, leading to different responses to 1 specific drug. To investigate this issue prospectively, 127 patients having chronic fibrillation or flutter exclusively, underwent serial drug treatment with flecainide (stage I) followed by sotalol or, if contraindicated, quinidine (stage II) and eventually amiodarone (stage III). Stages II and III were entered after electrical recardioversion for a recurrence during stages I or II, respectively. Calculated on an actuarial basis, the 2-year cumulative percentage of patients free of the arrhythmia increased from 31% after stage I to 63% at the end of serial treatment. To reach this result, a mean of 1.8 +/- 0.8 cardioversions per patient were needed, with 53 patients progressing to stage II and 34 to stage III. Sixteen patients stopped serial treatment prematurely and 15 patients were considered to have intractable atrial fibrillation at the end of stage III. Incidence of proarrhythmia was low. Multivariate analysis disclosed that an older age, in combination with a large number of previous episodes of arrhythmia, a long previous duration of arrhythmia and presence of mitral valve disease, were predictive for medical refractoriness during serial treatment. It is concluded that serial treatment may improve arrhythmia prognosis in atrial fibrillation or flutter, with an acceptable incidence of proarrhythmic events. 
Binding of kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) isolectins to differentiated human colon carcinoma Caco-2 cells and their effect on cellular metabolism. The binding of Phaseolus vulgaris (PHA) isolectins L4 and E4 to the brush border membrane of differentiated Caco-2 cells was studied and the impact on cellular metabolism and microvilli was assessed. Computer analysis of the data based on binding experiments with peroxidase conjugated isolectins gave mean (SD) values for maximal binding of 2540 (151).10(-9) M for PHA-L4 and 2104 (140).10(-9) M for PHA-E4 per mg of brush border membrane protein. The dissociation constants for L4 and E4 binding were 4.3 (1.4).10(-6) M and 1.1 (0.8).10(-6) M, respectively. Incubation of differentiated Caco-2 cells for 30 minutes with ferritin conjugated PHA isolectins showed that, as indicated by the number of ferritin particles, PHA-E4 bound to the microvilli to a greater extent than PHA-L4. Ferritin particles were also localised intracellularly over endocytotic invaginations and vesicles. After incubation for 48 hours with PHA-L4 or PHA-E4, the relative incorporation of precursors for DNA, RNA, and (glyco)protein synthesis into the trichloroacetic acid insoluble fraction of the Caco-2 cells was determined. Both isolectins stimulated the incorporation of thymidine and glucosamine, but neither PHA-L4 nor PHA-E4 were able to influence the incorporation of uridine. With respect to fucose, methionine, and N-acetyl mannosamine, the stimulatory effect remained confined to PHA-E4. Since PHA-L4 and PHA-E4 were tested at the same concentrations, PHA-E4 is more effective than PHA-L4. The changes in the uptake of radioactive precursors were lost after heat inactivation of PHA-E4. Compared with control and PHA-L4 incubated Caco-2 cells, the microvilli of PHA-E4 incubated cells were shortened significantly (p less than 0.01). 
Linear lupus erythematosus profundus in a child. A 9-year-old Japanese boy had a 6-year history of a linear eruption of the left leg. It was characterized histopathologically by an intense lymphocytic panniculitis, perivascular and periappendageal infiltrates of lymphocytes, and vacuolization of the basal cell layer. This case represents a clinical presentation of linear lupus erythematosus profundus not previously reported. 
Transureteroureterostomy with cutaneous ureterostomy: a 25-year experience. We reviewed 67 patients who underwent transureteroureterostomy with cutaneous ureterostomy for benign (32) and malignant (35) disease in regard to the indications for and complications of the procedure. The most common complications included urine leakage at the ureteroureterostomy, stomal stenosis and calculus formation. Renal function improved or remained stable in 75% of the patients. Transureteroureterostomy with cutaneous ureterostomy is a viable alternative diversion technique in a select group of patients. 
Unruptured intracranial aneurysms: seizures and antiepileptic drug treatment following surgery. Twenty-one patients operated on for unruptured intracranial aneurysms were studied retrospectively in order to identify the incidence of postoperative seizures, factors predictive of seizures, and the response to discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs. The overall risk of postoperative seizures in initially seizure-free patients was 15.7%. Although seizures were not uncommon, antiepileptic drugs were successfully tapered in most of the patients before 12 months. 
Fatigue and depression in brain-injured patients correlated with quadriceps strength and endurance. Many brain-injured (BI) patients complain of persistent fatigue that may alter their lifestyles. In order to assess muscular strength and endurance after brain injury, 22 BI men, greater than 9 months postinjury and aged 20 to 51 years, were separated into two groups based on a complaint of fatigue (fatigue n = 13, nonfatigue n = 9); each performed one maximal isometric knee extension at 60 degrees and 20 maximal isokinetic contractions at 20 rpm using a Cybex II dynamometer. A third group of age-matched, able-bodied men (n = 10) were used as controls. A battery of tests assessing the presence of fatigue (using a symptom checklist and two rating scales), depression, anxiety, and health status were given at the time of isokinetic/isometric testing. The mean fatigue rating, a subjective score, for the fatigue group of BI subjects was significantly worse than the other groups (p less than .01). There was a positive correlation between clinically significant Zung depression scores and fatigue rating (r = .46) and between Zung anxiety scores and fatigue rating. The depression scores for those who complained of fatigue were significantly higher than the other groups (p less than .005). Maximal isometric contractions were no different among the three groups. The mean maximal isokinetic torque during the 20 repetitions was greater in controls than in the BI groups, but did not reach statistical significance (p less than .25). There were no significant declines in isokinetic torque in the 20 repetitions for any of the groups, and the fatigue index was nearly equal for all three groups. 
Repairs of the rotator cuff. Correlation of functional results with integrity of the cuff. We evaluated the results of 105 operative repairs of tears of the rotator cuff of the shoulder in eighty-nine patients at an average of five years postoperatively. We correlated the functional result with the integrity of the cuff, as determined by ultrasonography. Eighty per cent of the repairs of a tear involving only the supraspinatus tendon were intact at the time of the most recent follow-up, while more than 50 per cent of the repairs of a tear involving more than the supraspinatus tendon had a recurrent defect. Older patients and patients in whom a larger tear had been repaired had a greater prevalence of recurrent defects. At the time of the most recent follow-up, most of the patients were more comfortable and were satisfied with the result of the repair, even when they had sonographic evidence of a recurrent defect. The shoulders in which the repaired cuff was intact at the time of follow-up had better function during activities of daily living and a better range of active flexion (129 +/- 20 degrees compared with 71 +/- 41 degrees) compared with the shoulders that had a large recurrent defect. Similar correlations were noted for the range of active external and internal rotation and for strength of flexion, abduction, and internal rotation. In the shoulders in which the cuff was not intact, the degree of functional loss was related to the size of the recurrent defect. 
Cocaine and chest pain: clinical features and outcome of patients hospitalized to rule out myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features, electrocardiographic findings, and hospital course in patients admitted with acute chest pain temporally related to cocaine use. DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis. SETTING: A 485-bed county hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and one consecutive patients with cocaine-related chest pain admitted to the hospital to rule out myocardial infarction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The quality of the chest pain frequently suggested myocardial ischemia. Dyspnea was common (56%). The onset of chest pain occurred during cocaine use in 21% of patients, within 1 hour of use in 37%, and after 1 hour of use in 42%. Admission electrocardiographic findings were interpreted as normal in 32% of patients; as acute myocardial injury in 8%; as early repolarization variant in 32%; as left ventricular hypertrophy in 16%; and as "other" in 12%. Forty-three percent of patients had ST-segment elevation meeting the electrocardiographic criteria for use of thrombolytic therapy, but such elevation was usually due to the early repolarization variant. The initial total creatine kinase was elevated more than 3.3 mu kat/L (200 U/L) in 43% of patients, and an elevated total creatine kinase was recorded at some time during the hospital course in 47% of patients. The creatine kinase MB fraction was less than 0.02 in all patients. Myocardial infarction was ruled out in all patients. No patient experienced in-hospital cardiovascular complications. CONCLUSION: The quality of acute chest pain related to cocaine use is indistinguishable from that experienced in acute myocardial ischemia. Abnormal or normal variant electrocardiographic findings are common in patients with chest pain related to cocaine use, but nevertheless the incidence of acute myocardial infarction is low. The ST-segment and T-wave changes can mimic acute myocardial injury and are most likely normal findings in young black men that can be readily recognized in the emergency department. Most of these patients do not require admission to an intensive care unit. 
Leiomyosarcoma of renal vein. Leiomyosarcomas arising from the renal vein are rare tumors: only 13 cases are found in the literature. We report a case in a sixty-one-year-old woman who presented with back pain and hematuria. She underwent resection of the tumor and an ipsilateral nephrectomy. The tumor recurred locally, and the patient died thirty months after diagnosis. Review of the cases reported in the literature reveals the aggressive nature of these tumors and the need for a combined therapeutic approach. 
Administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) results in increased plasma concentrations of IL-5 and eosinophilia in patients with cancer. Peripheral eosinophilia is almost invariably observed during the course of interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy and is frequently accompanied by the development of a capillary leak syndrome characterized by edema, weight gain, and oliguria. We studied five patients with advanced malignancy treated with IL-2. Eosinophilia was not present initially but developed in all patients late in the course of therapy, with counts ranging from 2,328/mm3 to 15,958/mm3. In all patients, there was a temporal relationship between the infusion of IL-2 and the appearance of elevated plasma concentrations of IL-5, a growth factor for eosinophils. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was not detectable in plasma. IL-4 and gamma-interferon plasma levels were variably elevated. Plasma concentrations of major basic protein, a toxic eosinophil granule protein, began increasing before eosinophil counts increased. By the time of the third IL-2 infusion, high concentrations of major basic protein were present in all five patients (up to 5,600 ng/mL) and skin biopsies showed major basic protein deposition in the dermis. Four patients developed significant capillary leak syndrome and all of these patients showed markedly elevated major basic protein levels. The lowest peak plasma concentration of major basic protein (1,751 ng/mL) was observed in the one patient who did not develop edema and weight gain. These results suggest that IL-2 induces IL-5 leading to marked peripheral eosinophilia and extravascular eosinophil degranulation. The release of toxic eosinophil products at extravascular sites and in the circulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of the capillary leak syndrome complicating IL-2 therapy. 
Dramatic response of follicular thyroid carcinoma with superior vena cava syndrome and tracheal obstruction to external-beam radiotherapy. We report a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma progressing to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and tracheal obstruction despite multiple doses of radioactive iodine therapy but subsequently responding dramatically to external-beam radiotherapy (RT). Although RT is not considered to be the treatment of choice for follicular carcinoma, RT in our patient produced unequivocal improvement of SVC syndrome and tracheal obstruction. 
Radiation associated malignant pleural mesothelioma. Malignant pleural mesothelioma of epithelial type developed in a 24 year old woman, 20 years after radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease. This case and a review of published cases indicate that radiation may induce malignant mesothelioma. 
The muscle flap in the treatment of chronic lower extremity osteomyelitis: results in patients over 5 years after treatment. Preliminary reports have indicated that debridement of the bony sequestrum followed by muscle-flap coverage allows successful treatment of chronic osteomyelitis. To determine the long-term effectiveness of this procedure, 34 consecutive patients with chronic osteomyelitis of the distal lower extremity treated with debridement, a 10- to 14-day course of culture-specific antibiotics, and immediate muscle-flap coverage were evaluated. Patients were treated from 1979 through 1984, and long-term (greater than 5 years) follow-up was available for 27 (79 percent). Twenty-three (85 percent) of these patients underwent microvascular muscle transplantation (gracilis or latissimus dorsi), and four underwent local muscle flaps (gastrocnemius or soleus) for immediate wound coverage. Twenty-four patients (89 percent) healed and were without recurrence over long-term (greater than 5 years, mean 7.4 years) follow-up. Of the three with recurrence, two were cured (greater than 5 years follow-up) after additional muscle-flap procedures. Thus the overall success rate was 96 percent, with a minimum 5-year follow-up. Guidelines for muscle-flap selection and treatment techniques in current use are presented. Debridement and immediate muscle-flap coverage provide effective, single-stage treatment of chronic osteomyelitic wounds and allow antibiotics to be restricted to short-term use. Furthermore, muscle flaps covered with skin grafts provide durable coverage while allowing subsequent ancillary procedures (i.e., bone grafts) to be performed under the flaps. 
Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome: findings on chest radiographs in 18 patients. Findings on chest radiographs of 18 patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome were compared and correlated with peak eosinophil counts. Nine patients had normal chest radiographs. Of the nine patients with abnormal chest radiographs, three had fine, irregular linear opacities in the lungs (the opacities were most noticeable at the bases); three had similar irregular linear opacities and pleural effusions; and three had pleural effusions and confluent opacities. One patient demonstrated an enlarged heart; no pulmonary edema was seen in this patient or in any others. Although the mean recorded eosinophil cell counts were higher in those patients with abnormal chest radiographs (6,340 vs 5,454/mm3 [6.3 vs 5.4 x 10(9)/L]), the difference was not statistically significant. 
gamma-Hydroxybutyrate: a health-food product producing coma and seizurelike activity. Sixteen cases of adverse effects due to a new health-food product, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), were reported to the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Poison Control Center in the 5-month period from June to October 1990. Cases have also been reported in eight other states. Adverse effects included coma (four patients) and tonic-clonic seizurelike activity (two patients). Doses ranged from 1/4 teaspoon to 4 tablespoons. Acute symptoms resolved within 7 hours. GHB was investigated as an anesthetic agent during the 1960s until seizures and lack of analgesia precluded its use. It was recently introduced in the health-food market as a food supplement for body builders with claims of anabolic effects by stimulating growth hormone release. GHB remains under investigational new drug status with the Food and Drug Administration and is illegal for over the counter sale. The Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services has prohibited further sale of this product in California as have health departments in Florida and South Carolina; however, new cases continue to be reported. Health professionals should be aware of the potential health hazards of GHB. 
Raynaud's phenomenon. An update. The pathogenesis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon remains an enigma. Most evidence favors a local abnormality in the digital arteries as opposed to an increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. The local fault may involve the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, which are most important in reflex sympathetic vasoconstriction. Cooling blood vessels increase the sensitivity of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, increased levels of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are present in primary Raynaud's disease, and patients show an increased sensitivity to alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonists on finger blood flow. Serotonin has also been implicated, but the evidence is not compelling. In secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, vasospastic attacks can often be explained by a low arterial distending pressure, a thickened vessel wall, or absence of beta-adrenergic receptor activity. Diagnosis of primary Raynaud's disease relies on a typical history and normal physical examination, laboratory studies, and nailfold capillaroscopy. Finger systolic blood pressures during local cooling with ischemia may be helpful to document vasospastic attacks but does not distinguish primary from secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. The treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon is usually conservative. Pavlovian conditioning or biofeedback may be beneficial. When drug therapy is necessary, the calcium channel entry blocker nifedipine or sympatholytic agents have been shown to decrease the frequency and duration of vasospastic attacks in about two thirds of patients, although subjective improvement does not usually correlate with objective testing. Direct-acting vasodilators have not been shown to be of definite benefit. New therapies include prostaglandins, captopril, and the serotonergic antagonist ketanserin. Surgical sympathectomy has not been beneficial. 
Stereographic and stereometric study of sebaceous gland hyperplasia in rabbit pinnas induced by topically applied substances. Tetradecane (TD), testosterone (TS), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were separately inuncted on rabbit pinnas once a day; the pinnas were biopsied on days 1, 3, 7, and 28. Untreated pinnas and squalane-treated pinnas were used as controls. Three-dimensional images of sebaceous glands were reconstructed from their serial histologic sections using a computer-image analysis system. By stereometry, the sebaceous gland volumes gradually increased during the course of treatments with TS and DMSO, whereas the volumes of TD-treated sebaceous glands increased, reached the maximum on day 7, and then decreased. The acinus number was increased by all the substances, the DMSO-treated sebaceous glands on day 28 showing the largest number of acini. The volumes of individual acini increased until day 28 with TS treatment, whereas with TD and DMSO treatments they increased, reached the maximum on day 7, and then decreased. Stereographically, each untreated control sebaceous gland was composed of 20-30 pear-shaped acini. On day 28, acini of TS-treated sebaceous glands were swollen and ovoid in shape, DMSO-treated sebaceous glands resembled a bunch of grapes, and acini of TD-treated sebaceous glands were widely scattered and showed globular swelling arising from an elongated tube. Hyperplastic responses of sebaceous glands are quite different according to substances applied topically. 
Symptom reporting in wanted and unwanted pregnancies. This study examined the association between unwanted pregnancy and the reporting of pregnancy symptoms in a sample of 99 pregnant women drawn from an urban, medical school based family practice residency. Of these women, 51 had unwanted pregnancies, and 48 had wanted pregnancies. Women with wanted pregnancies were more likely than women with unwanted pregnancies to report three pregnancy symptoms (amenorrhea, breast tenderness, and morning sickness). This association of symptoms with a wanted pregnancy persisted after controlling for age, race, marital status, contraceptive use, menstrual irregularity, and days since last menses through multiple logistic regression. Findings suggest that symptoms may be underreported by women with unwanted pregnancies. 
Ethanol-induced gastric injury. Role of submucosal venoconstriction and leukotrienes. Under in vivo microscopic observation, intragastric ethanol instillation has been seen to cause a prompt, marked constriction of submucosal venules, followed by congestion in mucosal capillaries and severe gross mucosal lesion formation. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the venoconstriction is mediated by leukotrienes and that inhibition of the venoconstriction would protect against ethanol injury. Intragastric application of the leukotriene receptor antagonist MK-571 inhibited both venoconstriction and gross lesion formation. However, although local submucosal application of MK-571 inhibited venoconstriction, it did not protect the overlying gastric mucosa against ethanol injury. We conclude that leukotrienes play a significant pathogenetic role in ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury, but while the venoconstriction, mediated by leukotrienes, is one of the factors that promote lesion formation, it is not an essential one. 
Non-acid mechanisms of gastric and duodenal ulcer formation. The pathophysiology of gastric and duodenal ulcer disease has two sides: the aggressive attack, principally by the highly corrosive gastric acid; and the defending forces of mucus, mucosal resistance, and other protective substances and functions. This report reviews the roles of both the attacking and defending forces in the pathophysiology of ulcer disease. It also discusses how an early notion of ulcer formation (e.g., the Schwarz dictum of "no acid, no ulcer," first published in 1910) became the slogan by which ulcer disease was understood and from which therapy took its cue. Subsequent work has since found that the Schwarz dictum holds for duodenal ulcer, but not for gastric ulcer. Non-acid mechanisms of ulcer formation--i.e., impairment of at least one of the defending or protective forces--are also described, as are treatment approaches to ulcer disease. Although suppression of acid secretion is a mainstay of treatment, agents that safely and effectively strengthen the defense are being used more frequently. There are signs that the safe limits for acid-suppressing therapy have been reached or passed. On the other hand, the search for therapy that strengthens the defensive factors has only begun. 
Chimeric gamma-delta signal joints. Implications for the mechanism and regulation of T cell receptor gene rearrangement. Rearrangement of Ag receptor genes requires recognition by the lymphocyte recombinase of heptamer-nonamer signal sequences followed by two endonucleolytic cleavages and two DNA ligations to form the coding and signal joints. The phenomenon of trans-rearrangement, in which Ag receptor gene segments located on different chromosomes recombine to yield chimeric products, provides an in vivo system in which to investigate the ability of the recombinase to carry out each of these functions in trans. Trans-rearrangements between TCRG and TCRD loci, similar in structure and frequency to those observed previously in human lymphoid tissues, were demonstrated in normal mouse thymus by PCR with crossed V gamma/J delta and V delta/J gamma primer pairs. A simple mechanistic model for trans-rearrangement was then tested. This model posits an ability of the recombinase to catalyze the formation of both coding and signal joints in trans and therefore predicts that trans-rearrangements will generate chimeric signal joints. In adult thymus, chimeric D delta 2-J gamma 1 and D delta 2-J gamma 2 signal joints, containing fused heptamer-nonamer sequences, could be detected by PCR and were each present at frequencies sufficient to account for a large proportion of the corresponding TCRG/TCRD trans-rearrangements. In agreement with the predictions of the model, chimeric signal joints were found as both linear chromosomal and circular episomal DNA. The results provide a framework for understanding the formation of chromosomal translocations in normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells and support the possibility of a looping mechanism for standard gene rearrangement. To test the form of regulation of TCRG rearrangement, the frequencies of specific signal joints from standard and trans-rearrangements were compared. Although J gamma 1 and J gamma 2 segments participated with equal frequency in trans-rearrangement with D delta 2, only the J gamma 1 segment participated in standard rearrangement with V gamma 5. The results suggest that V-J recombination in the TCRG locus is regulated directly at the DNA level by cis-acting constraints which do not affect the accessibility of individual TCRG gene segments to recombination in trans. 
Otorhinolaryngologic causes of headache. Pain around the face and neck is common. This pain may be referred from a different area. Because patients usually present with pain and discomfort in a specific location such as the ear, nose, face, throat, or neck, this article discusses separately the innervation of each region and the most frequent causes of pain in each of these areas. 
Effect of recombinant alpha 2 interferon with or without prednisone in Chinese HBsAg carrier children. Ninety Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier children, aged 2-17 years, positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B virus DNA on at least three occasions in 6 months, were randomized into 3 groups. Thirty children received syrup vitamin B complex as control, 29 received 6 weeks of placebo syrup followed by 16 weeks of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon [intron A (rIFN2b)], 5 x 10(6) u/m2 subcutaneously thrice weekly; and 31 received 6 weeks of syrup prednisone (0.6 mg/kg tailed to 0.2 mg/kg) followed by 16 weeks of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon as above. The placebo/prednisone syrup was given on a double-blind basis. At 24 months of follow-up, persistent loss of hepatitis B virus DNA occurred in none of the children in the control group, in one child receiving recombinant alpha 2b-interferon alone, who also seroconverted to anti-HBe and anti-HBs and in five children receiving interferon with steroid priming (p = 0.0571 compared with controls), with four seroconverting to anti-HBe and one also seroconverting to anti-HBs. A rise of transaminases to above twice the upper limit of normal levels during the first 7 months of follow-up occurred in one subject in the control group, four in the group receiving alpha 2b-interferon alone and nine in the group receiving recombinant alpha 2b-interferon with steroid priming (p = 0.0144 compared with controls). Side effects of the steroid were negligible; those of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon were transient and acceptable. We conclude that 6 weeks of prednisone followed by 16 weeks of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon is of use in inducing persistent loss of hepatitis B virus DNA (16.1 per cent) and e-seroconversion (12.9 per cent) in a proportion of Chinese HBsAg carrier children: the prednisone probably enhances the immunomodulatory effect of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon. 
Sarcoid neuropathy. In a case of subacute sensory and motor polyneuropathy associated with sarcoidosis, multiple epineurial and endoneurial granulomas were demonstrated in a sural nerve. Neighbouring nerve fibres were displaced by the granulomas and some were undergoing axonal degeneration. Ultrastructural and teased fibre studies showed axonal atrophy and degeneration with secondary demyelination. Histochemical studies indicated the presence of HLA-DR antigen on epithelioid cells in the granulomas. A non-specific inflammatory process in the nerve does not cause significant primary demyelination. 
The impact of tumor size on the efficacy of monoclonal antibody-targeted radiotherapy: studies using a nude mouse model with human renal cell carcinoma xenografts. Monoclonal antibody (Mab)-targeted radiotherapy is a unique approach in cancer therapy. Multiple factors affect the success of treatment. Internal radiation dosimetry and mini-dose Mab-targeted radiotherapy studies reveal that tumor size affects the efficacy of treatment. For tumors with calculated weight greater than 400 mg., intravenous administration of 131I-labeled A6H or A6H-C5H combination delivers significantly less tumor radiation dose (2070 +/- 580 cGy/100 microCi) than those for tumors of weight less than 200 mg. (5260 +/- 2460 cGy/100 microCi). In the mini-dose (an average of 73 to 86 microCi) Mab-targeted radiotherapy study of 109 mice with small tumors (six, 12, or 19 days after implantation), tumors 12 days after implantation (approximately 60 mg. in weight) showed regression in all mice and in 62% of mice gross tumor elimination was observed. In contrast, mini-dose therapy at day 19 (tumor weights approximately 170 mg.) resulted in tumor regression and tumor elimination rates of 33% and 17% respectively. These studies suggest that Mab-targeted radiotherapy is more suitable for treating small tumors. 
Repair of severe anterior vaginal wall prolapse (grade IV cystourethrocele). The classical approach for the repair of severe anterior vaginal wall prolapse is the use of transvaginal colporrhaphy or, more recently, an abdominal paravaginal repair. Severe cystoceles develop from weaknesses of the levator sling and pubocervical fasciae resulting in 2 main anatomical changes: a central defect between the pubocervical fasciae, and a sliding herniation of the bladder and urethra (paravaginal defect). We developed a new transvaginal technique for the repair of large cystoceles (grade IV) extending outside of the introitus at rest, which includes repair of the central defect by anterior colporrhaphy, and repair of the paravaginal herniation of the bladder base and bladder neck by a needle suspension of these structures. We report our experience within a 5-year period in the treatment of 51 cases of severe bladder prolapse (grade IV cystoceles), 46 of which required this combined procedure regardless of preoperative stress urinary incontinence status. Five patients underwent anterior colporrhaphy as the only procedure, since they were continent and demonstrated a well supported bladder neck from a previous suspension operation. Other vaginal abnormalities should be repaired simultaneously to provide adequate pelvic floor support. 
Composite graft repair of Marfan aneurysm of the ascending aorta: results in 100 patients. One hundred consecutive patients with the Marfan syndrome underwent composite graft repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm between September 1976 and June 1989. Twenty-two patients had ascending aortic dissection at the time of composite graft repair; 18 patients also had a mitral valve procedure. There were no hospital deaths among 92 patients undergoing elective repair. One of 8 patients undergoing emergency repair of a ruptured aneurysm died in the operating room. The overall hospital mortality rate was 1%. There have been ten late deaths among the 99 hospital survivors (10.1%). Five deaths occurred among the first 11 patients in this series and five occurred among the last 88 patients (5.7%). Three late deaths resulted from composite graft endocarditis; 3 other patients with endocarditis are alive after aortic root replacement with cryopreserved homografts. Late coronary dehiscence caused death in 1 patient and was successfully repaired in a second. Actuarial survival for the 100 patients was 92.6% at 5 years and 75.8% at 10 years. Currently, composite graft repair of Marfan aneurysms of the ascending aorta can be performed with low hospital and late mortality. Marfan aneurysms with a diameter of 6 cm or greater should be repaired with the Bentall composite graft procedure, even if the patient is asymptomatic. 
Value and limitations of secondary femoropopliteal bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene. Secondary femoropopliteal bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts are widely regarded to be of questionable value. This has prompted some to abandon all attempts at secondary revascularization with PTFE and others to recommend that primary femoropopliteal bypasses be performed preferentially with PTFE grafts so that vein may be used for secondary procedures. Because we questioned both of these views, we reviewed all femoropopliteal bypasses done at our institution in the past 12 years and identified 73 secondary PTFE femoropopliteal procedures performed after a failed ipsilateral infrainguinal bypass (69 failed femoropopliteal; 4 failed femorodistal). Seventy (96%) secondary bypasses were performed for limb salvage and 3 (4%) for severe disabling claudication. Insertion of grafts to the popliteal artery was above the knee in 26 (36%) and below the knee in 47 (64%). Primary life-table graft patency at 4 years was only 38%. Forty-eight reinterventions in 34 limbs were required to restore or maintain graft patency in thrombosed or failing grafts. For thrombosed grafts, 20 interventions consisted of 9 simple thrombectomies and 11 thrombectomies with additional revision procedures (5 distal or proximal extensions, 6 patch angioplasties). Twenty-eight lesions threatening graft patency were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 3, proximal or distal extensions in 20, and patch angioplasty in 5. As a result of these reinterventions, the overall secondary patency rate was 55% at 4 years, and the limb salvage rate was 74% at 4 years. Although aggressive follow-up and reintervention may be required, the use of secondary PTFE conduits in the femoropopliteal position is a viable option in patients undergoing limb salvage procedures who are at high risk. 
Microorganisms and diarrhea in enterally fed intensive care unit patients. Thirty-six intensive care unit patients, receiving aseptic or manually (routine) reconstituted enteral feeding formulas, were evaluated prospectively for the relationship of microbial involvement, gastric pH, and antimicrobial therapy to diarrhea. The routine protocol group had a significantly higher incidence of bacterial contamination than the aseptic protocol group (Fisher's exact test, p less than 0.05). There were no significant direct associations between isolate category (Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative cocci, yeast), gastric pH, or antimicrobials and diarrhea. However, two organisms (Group D Enterococci and yeast) were indirectly implicated in some cases of diarrhea. 
Subcellular characteristics of phospholipase A2 activity in the rat kidney. Enhanced cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal phospholipase A2 enzymatic activity after renal ischemia and reperfusion. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activities in cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions of rat kidneys were characterized under control conditions, after ischemia, and subsequent to ischemia and reperfusion. Two forms of PLA2 activity were present in the cytosolic fraction: a high molecular weight form, active against phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which upon purification has a molecular mass of 110 kD; and smaller form (Mr approximately 14 kD), active against PE. In mitochondrial and microsomal fractions a single form (Mr approximately 14 kD), active against both PC and PE, was dominant. Activities in each fraction were optimal at pH 8.5-9.5. Cytosolic PLA2 activity was enhanced when Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]) was increased over the range of 10(-7) to 10(-6) M. Mitochondrial PLA2 activity required higher [Ca2+] for activation (greater than 10(-6) M). After 45 min of ischemia cytosolic PLA2 activity was decreased, whereas mitochondrial and microsomal activities were increased. When ischemia was followed by 1 h of reperfusion, cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal activities were enhanced. Ischemia alone did not change the gel filtration chromatography patterns of PLA2 activity, but ischemia and reperfusion resulted in the appearance of a new peak of activity in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions (Mr approximately 2-3 kD). Thus, the rat kidney has multiple forms of PLA2 activity, likely representing distinct enzymes, with Ca2+ dependencies suggesting regulation by Ca2+ in vivo. Ischemia and reperfusion result in stable increases of PLA2 activity in each subcellular fraction, perhaps related to covalent modifications of PLA2's, which likely account for membrane phospholipid degradation, and increased tissue levels of unsaturated free fatty acids. 
Polytetrafluoroethylene vs. polypropylene suture for endoscopic bladder neck suspension. Between May 1989 and October 1989, 24 women underwent a prospective, randomized study comparing polypropylene (Prolene) and polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) sutures for endoscopic bladder neck suspension. Polypropylene was associated with significantly more suture pain than polytetrafluoroethylene. Polytetrafluoroethylene was more difficult to tie at a predetermined tension. 
Diltiazem administration after crystalloid resuscitation restores active hepatocellular function and hepatic blood flow after severe hemorrhagic shock. Studies have shown that active hepatocellular function is depressed after hemorrhagic shock, despite crystalloid resuscitation. It is also known that calcium antagonists produce various beneficial effects on cell and organ function after ischemia and shock. However, it remains unknown whether such agents have any salutary effects on the depressed active hepatocellular function and hepatic blood flow in a nonheparinized model of trauma and hemorrhage. To study this, rats underwent a midline laparotomy (trauma-induced) and were bled to and maintained at a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg until 40% of the maximum bleedout was returned in the form of Ringer's lactate. They were then resuscitated with four times the volume of shed blood with Ringer's lactate over 60 minutes, during and after which diltiazem (400 micrograms/kg body weight) was infused intravenously over 95 minutes. Active hepatocellular function (Vmax and Km) was determined with an in vivo indocyanine green clearance technique. Effective hepatic blood flow (EHBF) was determined by Fick principle and corrected by the indocyanine green extraction ratio. Hepatic microvascular blood flow (HMBF) was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry. Results indicate that Vmax, Km, EHBF, and HMBF decreased significantly at 1.5 and 4 hours after resuscitation. Diltiazem infusion restored the depressed Vmax, Km, EHBF, and HMBF and prevented the occurrence of hepatic edema. Thus, diltiazem may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of trauma and severe hemorrhage even in the absence of blood resuscitation. 
Bradykinin-stimulated inositol phosphate production in NG108-15 cells is mediated by a small population of binding sites which rapidly desensitize. [3H]Bradykinin (BDK) binds to two distinct binding sites (P less than .01, N = 12) in NG108-15 cell membranes; (site 1: Kd1 = 3.09 x 10(-10) M, Bmax1 = 242 +/- 24 fmol/mg protein) and (site 2: Kd2 = 1.94 x 10(-8) M, Bmax2 = 491 +/- 75 fmol/mg protein). Although site 1 comprises only 33 +/- 4% (N = 12) of the total binding site population, comparison of the binding affinity and functional potency for BDK agonist analogs exhibiting differential selectivity for the two sites reveals that this high affinity site is the receptor mediating inositol monophosphate (IP) production in this cell line. BDK-stimulated IP production undergoes a very rapid (5 min) desensitization that is characterized by both a loss in agonist potency (EC50 = 3.57 x 10(-9) M vs. 1.94 x 10(-10) M in controls; P less than .001, N = 12) and a decrease in amplitude of response (fold stimulation = 1.45 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.80 +/- 0.09 in controls; P less than .01, N = 12). Only the decrease in response amplitude is attenuated by down-regulation of protein kinase C by prior long term treatment of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), indicating an involvement of protein kinase C activation in the desensitization process. Desensitization is accompanied by down-regulation of site 1 only (Bmax1 = 71 +/- 8 fmol/mg (N = 10; P less than .001 vs. controls)); Bmax2 and the Kd for BDK at both sites remain unchanged, further supporting the contention that site 1 is the functionally relevant receptor. In contrast to the functional data, long term TPA treatment does not attenuate the receptor down-regulation, indicating that the rapid desensitization involves both receptor-related and postreceptor mechanisms. The implications of this property of the BDK receptor for analog design and receptor classification are discussed. 
Observations on the Kveim reaction using an animal model of granulomatous bowel disease. Striking differences were observed between the visceral and cutaneous responses after tests with validated Kveim and normal spleen suspensions in a guinea pig model of granulomatous bowel disease. Five of six animals sensitised with BCG showed positive responses at the ileal Kveim test site whereas all six had negative cutaneous Kveim tests. Conversely, two of six animals sensitised with irradiated Mycobacterium leprae showed positive cutaneous Kveim tests and only one a positive response in the ascending colon. All six showed negative responses at the ileal Kveim test site. No positive visceral or cutaneous responses were observed in either group of animals after tests with normal spleen suspension. These findings are discussed in relation to the positive Kveim responses previously reported among patients with Crohn's disease, tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy, and among seemingly healthy BCG vaccinated subjects. The findings provide further evidence in support of a possible mycobacterial aetiology for sarcoidosis and Crohn's disease. 
Effects of vascular runoff on myointimal hyperplasia after mechanical balloon or thermal laser arterial injury in dogs. BACKGROUND. Clinical evidence suggests that poor vascular runoff reduces the long-term success rate of femoral angioplasty procedures. The purpose of this experimental study was to examine myointimal hyperplasia of dog femoral arteries after balloon denudation, thermal laser arterial injury, or sham operation in normal and reduced vascular runoff conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS. Before mechanical balloon injury or transluminal heated laser probe motion, the peripheral vascular runoff of dogs was reduced by ligating the femoral artery below its three distal side branches, decreasing the femoral flow rate from 114 +/- 9 to 52 +/- 5 ml/min (mean +/- SEM). Endothelial denudation with a predominantly intact elastic internal membrane and circumferential structural changes in the media were noted by light microscopy 1 hour after balloon injury. Focal completely necrotic lesions of intima and media were found 1 hour after thermal laser arterial injury. After 8 weeks, the maximal thickness of neointima plus media of the site of previous intervention was greater after balloon injury (0.45 +/- 0.03 mm) and thermal laser injury (0.54 +/- 0.03 mm) than after sham operation (0.40 +/- 0.01 mm; p less than 0.001) in normal runoff dogs. Reduced vascular runoff augmented myointimal hyperplasia both in the balloon-injured and thermally damaged arteries; the wall thickness increased from 0.45 +/- 0.03 to 0.93 +/- 0.10 mm and from 0.54 +/- 0.03 to 0.65 +/- 0.05 mm, respectively (p less than 0.001). The neointimal and medial wall area of the balloon-injured arteries contributed 48% to the area encompassed by the external elastic membrane compared with an 81% portion when vascular runoff was reduced (p less than 0.01). A 47% neointimal and medial wall area was found in thermally injured arteries with normal runoff compared with 63% after runoff reduction (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION. This study suggests that hemodynamic factors associated with poor vascular runoff play an important role in extending myointimal hyperplasia independent of method and severity of the arterial injury during angioplasty. 
Human papillomavirus--associated vulvar verrucous carcinoma in a 20-year-old with an intact hymen. A case report. A 20-year-old woman with vulvar verrucous carcinoma, the youngest such patient reported to date, had human papillomavirus DNA 6/11 identified with an in situ hybridization technique. In addition to her youth, the patient was unusual in that she had an intact hymen. Although she denied having engaged in sexual activity, venereal transmission of the virus may have occurred without vaginal penetration. 
DNA/RNA content and proliferative fractions of colorectal carcinomas: a five-year prospective study relating flow cytometry to survival. In our prospective study, flow cytometric analysis of cellular DNA and RNA content was performed on unfixed fresh specimens of colorectal adenocarcinoma taken from 176 patients. Of the 176 tumors, 113 (64%) were aneuploid. There was no correlation between aneuploidy and tumor stage, grade, location, or size. After a median follow-up of 5.6 years, no correlation between DNA or RNA content and patient survival was found. DNA content alone was not an independent prognostic factor when the colorectal carcinomas were segregated by curable and incurable stages. However, normal mucosa, diploid tumors, and aneuploid tumors showed progressively higher proliferation and higher RNA and DNA indices. Proliferative fraction--defined as the percentage of cells in S + G2 and M phases of the cell cycle--was significantly related to ploidy and to Dukes' stage. Despite these correlations, we did not detect a significant influence of proliferative fraction on survival when patients were segregated above or below the mean proliferative fraction for all tumors. More accurate methods of identifying the proliferative fraction of tumor cells are currently being pursued. While the role of flow cytometry in the evaluation and management of patients with colorectal carcinoma is still undefined for a number of other cellular parameters, it seems unlikely that DNA index, RNA index, or the proliferative fractions calculated from the DNA histogram, will, of themselves, represent independent prognostic factors. 
Carotid endarterectomy in Great Britain and Ireland: trends and current practice. Of 309 questionnaires on carotid endarterectomy sent to all surgeons in Great Britain and Ireland who might use this technique, 298 (96 per cent) were returned. In all, 110 (37 per cent) of 298 surgeons performed at least one carotid endarterectomy in 1989; 67 performed less than 10 and 43 greater than 10. In total, these 110 surgeons performed 1417 operations in 1989, a situation that has changed little over 5 years since the previous survey. Transient ischaemic attack and minor stroke remain the main indications for carotid endarterectomy; the operation was hardly ever performed for asymptomatic stenosis. By 1989 almost all surgeons initially assessed prospective patients using a technique less invasive than conventional angiography; duplex scanning was used 'always' or 'sometimes' by 70 per cent of surgeons. While 72 per cent of surgeons in 1984 'always' required conventional angiograms before operation, by 1989 only 21 per cent did so, most now relying on less invasive techniques. During operation there was an increasing use of shunts, carotid sinus nerve blockade and patch closure of the arteriotomy. The overall number of carotid endarterectomies performed annually in Great Britain and Ireland has remained steady over the past 5 years and is relatively low for a population of 60 millions. An increase in the number of surgeons performing the operation is almost entirely accounted for by an increase in those performing less than 10 carotid endarterectomies per year. 
Transplantation of kidneys from pediatric cadaver donors to adult recipients. Pediatric donors (less than 12 years old) are a potentially important source of kidneys for adult recipients. Previous reports of decreased graft survival and increased complication rates have made surgeons wary of using such kidneys. In 64 kidneys from younger donors transplanted to adult recipients the delayed graft function rate (41 versus 42%), and 2 and 3-year graft survival rates (67 versus 72% and 61 versus 65%, respectively) were similar to those seen with kidneys from adult donors. Kidneys from donors 24 months old or less experienced an 80% rate of graft loss at 1 year. When these kidneys are excluded the 1-year graft survival rate was similar to kidneys from older and younger donors (70 versus 77%). Mean serum creatinine at 1 year was similar in both groups (155 +/- 21 versus 151 +/- 10). Pediatric kidneys except those obtained from donors 2 years old or less are suitable for adult recipients. However, kidneys from very young donors may be more appropriate to pediatric recipients. 
Use of social science research to improve epidemiologic studies of and interventions for diarrhea and dysentery. The significance of dysentery has not been recognized in community-based programs for the management of diarrhea. Culturally sensitive methods of classification and algorithms for treatment of these diseases must be developed. Considered in this article is the manner in which ethnographic studies of diarrhea can contribute to descriptive epidemiologic data on diarrhea and dysentery and to procedures of health education and evaluation of interventions for the diseases. Indigenous terms for bloody diarrhea exist in many cultures. Local use of such terms must be carefully examined before they are incorporated in health education efforts and epidemiologic surveillance programs. 
Pneumocephalus associated with benign brain tumor: report of two cases. Two cases of spontaneous pneumocephalus, which developed after ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedures for severe hydrocephalus caused by benign brain tumors, are reported. In both cases there was no previous history of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Operation revealed that both patients had many small defects of the dura mater and the bone in the middle cranial fossa, which were plugged by necrotic brain tissue. These defects were remote from the sites of the original tumors but may have been produced by long-standing raised intracranial pressure, and they presumably allowed air to enter after intracranial pressure was reduced by shunting. Repair of the defects prevented further intracranial air retention. 
Activation of a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily by peroxisome proliferators We have cloned a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. The receptor homologue is activated by a diverse class of rodent hepatocarcinogens that causes proliferation of peroxisomes. Identification of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor should help elucidate the mechanism of the hypolipidaemic effect of these hepatocarcinogens and aid evaluation of their potential carcinogenic risk to man. 
Experimental evaluation of myocardial protective effect of prostacyclin analog (OP-41483) as an adjunct to cardioplegic solution. A stable prostacyclin analog (OP-41483) was evaluated for myocardial protective effect against global ischemia with the use of cardioplegia. Isolated canine hearts (n = 25) were exposed to 60 minutes of warm (37 degrees C) global ischemia after the arrest by crystalloid cardioplegia. Prostaglandin analog was given in three different ways: preadministration (700 ng/kg body weight per minute) before ischemia for 30 minutes (group I, n = 5), given as a component of cardioplegic solution (600 ng/ml, group II, n, = 6), and post-administration (25 ng/kg body weight per minute) during reperfusion for 30 minutes (group III, n = 7). During reperfusion, coronary sinus blood flow, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in coronary sinus blood, and myocardial oxygen consumption were measured during reperfusion. As a result, groups II and III showed significantly better global left ventricular function (developed pressure, maximum dP/dt, and diastolic compliance) than the control group (without prostaglandin analog, n = 7) and group I. Myocardial oxygen consumption at reperfusion (1 minute) was significantly larger in group II than in the control group. 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha flux was significantly larger in group II than in the other three groups during reperfusion. The results indicated that prostaglandin analog has a beneficial effect on myocardial protection under global ischemia with cardioplegia, particularly when used as a component of cardioplegic solution and also during reperfusion. The mechanism may relate to the cytoprotective effect (including protection of endothelium with enhanced endogenous prostacyclin production at reperfusion and also to the modulation of reperfusion per se. 
Cortical control of reflexive visually-guided saccades. Reflexive visually-guided saccade triggering may be facilitated or inhibited by the cerebral cortex. To study this control, saccades made towards suddenly appearing visual targets (saccade task) or away from them (antisaccade task) were recorded electro-oculographically in 45 patients with limited unilateral cerebral infarction. Lesions affected (1) the superior part of the angular gyrus (area 39 of Brodmann) in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), (2) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) (area 46 of Brodmann), (3) the frontal eye field (FEF), or (4) the supplementary motor area (SMA). As these 4 types of lesions were located either in the right or the left cerebral hemisphere, patients were divided into 8 groups. Saccade latency, in the saccade task, and the percentage of errors (misdirected saccades made towards the visual target), in the antisaccade task, were compared in each group of patients with the values of 20 control subjects. In the saccade task, saccade latency was significantly increased bilaterally in the right PPC group. In the left PPC group, the increase in latency was less marked, and significant only for saccades made contralaterally to the lesion. In the different frontal groups, latency was unchanged or only slightly increased. These results confirm that the main area facilitating the triggering of reflexive visually-guided saccades is located in the PPC, in or near the superior part of the angular gyrus. The difference between right and left parietal lesions could be due to the predominance of the right hemisphere in the control of these saccades. In the antisaccade task, the percentage of errors was significantly increased bilaterally in both PFC groups compared with the control group and also to the FEF and SMA groups. These results suggest that the PFC is the main area in the cerebral hemisphere inhibiting reflexive visually-guided saccades. 
An autopsy study of the incidence of lacunes in relation to age, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis. We investigated selected features of lacunes in 1,086 necropsy cases. Lacunes were found in brains from patients above the age of 40 years and were most common in brains from persons in their sixties but decreased in number in brains from older persons. The most common site of lacunes was the frontal lobe white matter, followed by the putamen, pons, parietal lobe white matter, thalamus, and caudate nucleus in descending order of frequency. By dividing the 1,086 cases into three groups according to blood pressure, we found more lacunes in the hypertensive and borderline hypertensive groups than in the normotensive group; the average number of lacunes per brain in each group was 3.61, 2.77, and 1.15, respectively. Diastolic hypertension was more closely related to the number of lacunes than was systolic hypertension. The extent of arteriolosclerosis of the medullary arteries in the frontal lobe white matter was measured and compared with the number of lacunes. There was a close correlation between lacunes and arterioloslerosis in all age groups. 
Treatment of vasospasm with a 480-nm pulsed-dye laser. Laser energy at a wavelength of 480 nm was applied in 1-microseconds pulses of 3 to 10 mJ to two models of vasospasm. Rabbit common carotid arteries (CCA's) were constricted chronically by the application of human blood within a silicone sheath. Peak vasospasm developed 24 to 48 hours later, and persisted for up to 6 days. Endovascular laser treatment was delivered to 40 CCA's via a 200-microns diameter silica quartz fiber introduced through the femoral artery. The CCA caliber increased from 60% of the pre-vasospasm control diameter to a minimum post-laser diameter of 83% of control. No instances of laser-induced perforation or of arterial thrombosis were observed for up to 60 days after treatment. Prophylactic laser application to nine normal vessels was able to attenuate the development of vasospasm if blood was applied immediately thereafter (88% vs. 59% of control diameter, p less than 0.02), but not if blood was applied 7 days later. Studies in 16 normal CCA's established that there was a considerable margin between the laser energy required to induce dilatation and that which caused perforation, providing that the fiber remained relatively central within the artery. Morphological examination demonstrated focal loss of endothelial cells immediately after laser application, followed approximately 7 days later by the development of areas of intimal hyperplasia. Only minimal changes were observed in the medial or adventitial layers. In a second study, the basilar artery of seven dogs was constricted chronically by two intracisternal injections of autologous blood 3 days apart. Five dogs received endovascular laser treatment 7 or 10 days after the first injection, when basilar artery diameter was reduced to a mean of 61% and 77% of control, respectively. Immediately following treatment, basilar artery diameter increased to 104% and 102% of resting diameter, respectively. Both untreated and laser-treated arteries were smaller than the control diameter at 30 days (80% and 82%, respectively), but in each group the vasodilatory response to hypercapnia was preserved. These findings indicate that 1-microsecond laser pulses are well tolerated by systemic and cerebral arteries in two different animal models, and suggest that the 480-nm pulsed-dye laser may have an application for the treatment or prophylaxis of cerebral vasospasm. 
HBxAg in the liver from carrier patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from 110 cases of chronic hepatitis and 108 cases of cirrhosis were stained for HBxAg by the avidin-biotin complex technique using specific antisera made against full-length HBxAg polypeptide or derived synthetic peptides. These tissues were also stained for the HBsAg and HBcAg by the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method. Among patients with chronic hepatitis, 86% were HBsAg positive in liver cells, 60% were surface antigen positive and 32% were core antigen positive. Among patients with cirrhosis, 97% were HBsAg positive in liver cells, 72% were surface antigen positive and 17% were positive for core antigen. Staining specificity was demonstrated, in part, by using preimmune sera in the place of primary antibody, by blocking of the primary antibody with the appropriate antigen before assay and by testing uninfected liver controls. The persistence and high frequency of HBxAg in liver cells from patients with chronic liver disease suggest that it may play one or more important roles in the pathogenesis of chronic infection. It is possible that detection of HBxAg in the liver could be an additional new diagnostic marker for hepatitis B virus infection. However, the function(s) of HBxAg in the pathogenesis of the chronic liver disease, if any, remains to be explained. 
Pyomyositis in patients with the human immunodeficiency virus: an unusual form of disseminated bacterial infection. PURPOSE AND PATIENTS: Pyomyositis, a common disease in the tropics, is rare in the continental United States, with approximately 83 cases described in the literature in the past two decades. The occurrence of pyomyositis complicating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been reported in 10 patients since 1986. We report six cases of this entity in patients with advanced HIV disease seen in our institution over a 20-month period. A common denominator in all of our patients was muscle injury, induced by either exercise or trauma. Unlike most previous reports of HIV-associated pyomyositis, the clinical picture in our cases was complicated by the development of abscesses in multiple muscle groups, requiring prolonged antimicrobial therapy and repeated drainage procedures for successful management. Interestingly, one patient developed concomitant rhabdomyolysis--an otherwise rare event in classical pyomyositis. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant infecting organism in this as well as all other series. Of note, we also observed and report the first case, to our knowledge, of gram-negative pyomyositis in an HIV-infected individual. The pathogenic implications of this catalase-producing gram-negative isolate are discussed in the context of neutrophil abnormalities in HIV disease. CONCLUSION: Like tropical pyomyositis, its HIV-associated counterpart appears to be multifactorial in origin. Its recent recognition suggests that, in addition to underlying abnormalities of host defense, factors relating to the prolonged survival of patients with late-stage disease, including myopathy, might play an important contributory role. 
Propranolol in the prevention of the first hemorrhage from esophagogastric varices: A multicenter, randomized clinical trial. The Boston-New Haven-Barcelona Portal Hypertension Study Group. To assess the effectiveness of propranolol in the prevention of initial variceal hemorrhage, a double-blind, randomized trial was carried out in three centers. Patients with cirrhosis (78% alcoholic), hepatic venous pressure gradients greater than 12 mm Hg and endoscopically proven esophageal varices were randomly assigned to propranolol (51 patients) or placebo (51 patients). Of the 102 patients, 58% were Child's class A, 34% were Child's class B and 8% were Child's class C. Daily dosage was determined by the administration of progressively increasing doses of propranolol with the hepatic vein catheter in place to achieve a 25% decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient, a decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient to less than 12 mm Hg or a decrease in resting heart rate to less than 55 beats/min. During a mean follow-up period of 16.3 mo, 11 patients in the placebo group (22%) bled from esophageal varices compared with 2 in the propranolol group (4%) during a mean period of 17.1 mo (p less than 0.01). Three additional patients (6%) in the placebo group bled from portal hypertensive gastropathy compared with none in the propranolol group. Propranolol appeared effective in preventing bleeding from large varices. Eleven deaths (22%) occurred in the placebo group compared with eight deaths (16%) in the propranolol group (NS). The mean dose of propranolol was 132 mg/day, and the median dose was 80 mg/day. Using a compliance index (pill count, clinic attendance, alcohol and propranolol levels and alcohol history), 81% of the propranolol patients and 77% of the placebo patients were considered compliant. Complications severe enough to require cessation of therapy occurred in eight patients (16%) in the propranolol group and four in the placebo group (8%) (NS). We conclude that propranolol effectively prevents the first variceal hemorrhage in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and large esophageal varices but does not improve survival. 
Verapamil and migraine prophylaxis: mechanisms and efficacy. Calcium channel blockers have demonstrated efficacy in investigative use for prophylaxis of migraine and cluster headaches. In particular, verapamil, with its low side-effect profile, appears to be a promising alternative to the currently available agents for prophylactic treatment of chronic recurring headaches. Although its exact mechanisms of action in this application are unknown, verapamil exerts a vasodilatory effect on cerebral arteries and interacts with serotonergic systems involved in migraine pathogenesis. A review of studies from the past decade indicates that verapamil may be as effective as traditional therapies as prophylaxis for the major types of chronic recurring headache. 
Celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery injury associated with left radical nephrectomy for locally advanced renal cell carcinoma. The superior mesenteric artery and celiac axis were inadvertently ligated during left radical nephrectomy for a large upper pole renal carcinoma with massive perihilar and periaortic adenopathy. Computer-generated 3-dimensional illustrations created from the computerized tomography scan demonstrated the close proximity between these visceral branches and the adenopathy mass complex, and showed how this bulky disease may interfere with surgical anatomy. When left radical nephrectomy is performed for locally advanced and/or bulky node-positive renal neoplasms, surgeons must be cognizant of the location of the major visceral arterial branches and possible anatomical distortions. 
Persistence of symptoms after gall bladder clearance with cholecystolithotripsy. Forty six patients rendered stone and fragment free with successful cholecystolithotripsy without the use of oral chemolitholysis were followed by serial ultrasound for a period of two to 25 months (mean 11 months, median 10 months). Seven patients (15%), six of whom remain asymptomatic, developed recurrent calculi. Of the 39 gall stone free patients, 26 were asymptomatic. Six patients complained of persistent abdominal pain similar to that before treatment. One of these had a bile duct stone. Seven patients complained of a variety of non-biliary symptoms. The patient with recurrent gall stones and recurrent symptoms is eligible for further lithotripsy treatment. The overall 30% incidence of persistent abdominal symptoms is similar to that reported after elective cholecystectomy. 
Pathogenesis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Several pathophysiologic abnormalities known to be associated with the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are reviewed. Among them are the contributions of lower esophageal sphincter pressure, length, and relaxation, the role of hiatal hernia, delayed esophageal acid clearance, and impaired esophageal mucosal resistance. Gastric factors--volume, secretion, the character of the refluxant, and the rate of gastric emptying--also play a role in the pathogenesis of GERD. Treatment requires an individualized approach based on the extent of the symptoms, esophagitis, and other reflux complications. Three phases of treatment--lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic manipulation, and surgery--are discussed, as is maintenance therapy and prevention of recurrent disease. 
Cervical anterior spinal artery syndrome associated with cardiopulmonary arrest. Nontraumatic spinal cord ischemia is uncommon, especially when the cervical cord is involved. We present an elderly man who sustained acute occlusion of the anterior spinal artery at a high cervical level. This was followed by a respiratory arrest due to the paralysis of the diaphragm and chest wall muscles. A review of the vascular supply to the cord and of nontraumatic ischemic myelopathy is provided. 
Dobutamine versus dipyridamole echocardiography in coronary artery disease. Dobutamine and dipyridamole echocardiography are gaining popularity as exercise-independent stress tests for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. To compare the feasibility, sensitivity, and specificity of dobutamine echocardiography to dipyridamole echocardiography, we conducted both tests, on different days and in random order, on 35 patients with chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease. Dobutamine was administered in scalar doses up to 40 micrograms/kg per minute and dipyridamole up to 0.84 mg/kg for 10 minutes. Dobutamine echocardiography testing was positive in eight of 16 (50%) patients with single-vessel disease and in 11 of 12 (92%) patients with multivessel disease, resulting in an overall sensitivity of 68% for the presence of coronary artery disease. Dipyridamole echocardiography testing showed the same sensitivity as dobutamine in patients with multivessel disease but a lower sensitivity (31%) in single-vessel disease, resulting in an overall sensitivity of 57%. The specificity of both tests was 100%. An ST segment shift of more than 1 mm compared with baseline was documented in 74% of the positive dobutamine echocardiography tests and in 81% of the positive dipyridamole echocardiography tests. No major complications occurred during both tests. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 11 patients with dobutamine and in none with dipyridamole (31% versus 0%, p less than 0.001). Thus, in our selected population dobutamine echocardiography testing demonstrated a similar overall sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease compared with dipyridamole, with a slightly better sensitivity for single-vessel disease but a greater arrhythmogenic potential. 
Scintigraphic assessment of sympathetic innervation after transmural versus nontransmural myocardial infarction To evaluate the feasibility of detecting denervated myocardium in the infarcted canine heart, the distribution of sympathetic nerve endings using I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) was compared with the distribution of perfusion using thallium-201, with the aid of color-coded computer functional map in 16 dogs. Twelve dogs underwent myocardial infarction by injection of vinyl latex into the left anterior descending coronary artery (transmural myocardial infarction, n = 6), or ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (nontransmural myocardial infarction, n = 6). Four dogs served as sham-operated controls. Image patterns were compared with tissue norepinephrine content and with histofluorescence microscopic findings in biopsy specimens. Hearts with transmural infarction showed zones of absent MIBG and thallium, indicating scar. Adjacent and distal regions showed reduced MIBG but normal thallium uptake, indicating viable but denervated myocardium. Denervation distal to infarction was confirmed by reduced norepinephrine content and absence of nerve fluorescence. Nontransmural myocardial infarction showed zones of wall thinning with decreased thallium uptake and a greater reduction or absence of MIBG localized to the region of the infarct, with minimal extension of denervation beyond the infarct. Norepinephrine content was significantly reduced in the infarct zone, and nerve fluorescence was absent. These findings suggest that 1) MIBG imaging can detect viable and perfused but denervated myocardium after infarction; and 2) as opposed to the distal denervation produced by transmural infarction, nontransmural infarction may lead to regional ischemic damage of sympathetic nerves, but may spare subepicardial nerve trunks that course through the region of infarction to provide a source of innervation to distal areas of myocardium. 
Vitamin E levels in premenstrual syndrome. To determine whether changes in peripheral vitamin E levels are associated with symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, 10 patients with premenstrual syndrome and 10 control subjects were studied. They gave blood at 2- or 3-day intervals throughout three menstrual cycles. The vitamin E was measured by fluorometry after hexane extraction and luteinizing hormone was measured by radioimmunoassay. In the control group, vitamin E values were 854 +/- 45 micrograms/dl (mean +/- SE) during the luteal phase and 925 +/- 55 micrograms/dl during the follicular phase. No significant changes were noted between the two values. In the patients with premenstrual syndrome, the values were 849 +/- 53 micrograms/dl during the luteal phase, which was not significantly different from 858 +/- 48 micrograms/dl during the follicular phase. No significant changes were noted between the control group and the patients with premenstrual syndrome in either the luteal or the follicular phase. Vitamin E deficiency in patients with premenstrual syndrome was not shown by peripheral vitamin E levels in our study. 
Treatment of pseudotumor cerebri by primary and secondary optic nerve sheath decompression. We performed optic nerve sheath decompression in 53 patients (101 eyes) with pseudotumor cerebri and visual loss. Sixty-nine eyes (85 patients) with acute papilledema uniformly had improved visual function after optic nerve sheath decompression. Of 32 eyes with chronic papilledema (18 patients), only ten had improved visual function after optic nerve sheath decompression. This difference was significant (P = .0001). Thirteen eyes required secondary or tertiary optic nerve sheath decompression after an initial successful result. Eleven of 13 eyes had improved visual function after repeat optic nerve sheath decompression. We believe that patients with acute papilledema and visual loss should be offered optic nerve sheath decompression, and if symptoms recur, repeat optic nerve sheath decompression is a safe and effective treatment option. 
The role of tagged red blood cell imaging in the localization of gastrointestinal bleeding. The records of 162 patients who underwent technetium-99m-tagged red blood cell scans for the localization of gastrointestinal hemorrhage were studied. Ninety-eight scans were read as positive, with bleeding sites determined by a radiologist. Forty-six patients had a definitive diagnosis made by other means. Tagged scans accurately localized the site of bleeding in only 52% of cases. Analysis of the value of these tagged scans in predicting a subsequent positive angiogram indicated that there were 14 positive and 12 negative angiograms of 26 positive scans. Of the nine patients with negative scans who underwent arteriography, the arteriogram was positive in five. These data suggest that tagged red blood cell scanning is a poor diagnostic technique for the localization of gastrointestinal bleeding, and its use as a screening tool before angiography is questionable. 
Double anal canal: complication of rectal fecalith. Fecaliths and stercoraceous ulcerations are well-known complications of chronic constipation. The authors present the case of a double anal canal in an elderly man. This anorectal fistula (complex anal fistula) developed as a complication of an impacted rectal fecalith with resultant stercoraceous ulceration. Eventually, a persistent epithelialized canal developed and was demonstrated at double-contrast barium enema examination. The patient remained continent at all times. 
Antispasmodic effects of flavoxate, MFCA, and REC 15/2053 on smooth muscle of human prostate and urinary bladder. The antispasmodic effects of the flavone compounds flavoxate hydrochloride, 3-methylflavone carboxylic acid (MFCA), and REC 15/2053 (and in the case of the detrusor, oxybutynin), on the human detrusor, prostatic adenoma, prostatic capsule, and bladder neck, were studied by the in vitro isometric method. All the compounds inhibited, in different orders of potency, potassium-induced contractions of the tissues. Flavoxate showed a slightly greater activity than the other two compounds in the prostatic and bladder neck tissues. However, REC 15/2053 displayed greater activity in the detrusor than in the other tissues. The relaxant effect on the prostatic tissues suggests a potential use for these compounds in benign prostatic obstruction. 
Effect of halothane on arrhythmogenic responses induced by sympathomimetic agents in single rat heart cells. The combination of catecholamines and halothane has long been recognized as arrhythmogenic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the mechanism of this interaction originates at the single cell level. The incidence of spontaneous contractile waves occurring between stimulated beats (interbeat waves), early aftercontractions, and late aftercontractions was measured in rat myocytes exposed to sympathomimetics with and without halothane. Each of these endpoints in single cells has the potential to produce arrhythmias in multicellular preparations. Interbeat waves and late aftercontractions were observed with isoproterenol (1 X 10(-7) M) and norepinephrine (1-3 X 10(-7) M). The incidence of these phenomena was significantly reduced in the presence of 0.30 mM halothane. Early aftercontractions occurred in the presence of isoproterenol (1 X 10(-7) M), norepinephrine (1-3 X 10(-7) M), and phenylephrine (5-10 X 10(-6) M). There was a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of early aftercontractions in the presence of 0.30 mM halothane. These results indicate that the mechanism behind the clinically observed increased arrhythmogenicity of catecholamines with halothane does not arise at the level of single ventricular cells because halothane inhibited sympathomimetic-induced arrhythmogenic activity in this model. The probable mechanisms rather include altered impulse propagation, which might lead to phenomena such as reentry. 
Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension. Parallels between human disease and rodent models. There is considerable evidence that abnormalities of glucose, insulin, and lipoprotein metabolism occur more frequently in untreated hypertensive patients than in normotensive control subjects. More recently, it has also become apparent that similar metabolic abnormalities occur in rodent models of hypertension. One purpose of this article is to review the experimental data that have led to the above generalizations. The second goal is to address the significance of these findings, which is certainly not clear. For example, it could be argued that the relationship between high blood pressure and the associated metabolic defects is incidental. On the other hand, there is evidence that the changes in glucose, insulin, and lipoprotein metabolism may play a role in the etiology and/or clinical course of patients with high blood pressure. Although it is impossible at this point to definitively choose between these possibilities, an effort is made to marshal the evidence in support of the latter alternative. 
Controlling gastric pH: the impact of newer agents on the critically ill patient. The critically ill patient is at increased risk for developing erosive injury of the stomach, duodenum, and esophagus. To date, the most effective way to prevent and treat this problem is by assuring excellent intensive care support and by reducing gastric acid secretion. The histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are effective in both prevention and treatment of such gastric mucosal injury. Newer agents are available that have potential for use in this setting, although none have been studied as extensively in critically ill patients as have the H2RAs. These new agents include proglumide, pirenzepine, misoprostol, omeprazole, and somatostatin. To date, only the latter has been extensively studied in critically ill patients. Omeprazole, which suppresses acid very effectively, may be problematic in the critically ill, limited by its oral dosage form, acid-labile properties, and potential drug interactions. 
Experimental hepatocellular carcinoma: MR receptor imaging. Relaxation time measurements and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed in three different animal models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After intravenous administration of asialoglycoprotein-directed arabinogalactan-stabilized ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (10 mumol Fe/kg receptor agent), T2 of normal liver decreased from 41.6 msec +/- 1.0 to 19.4 msec +/- 1.7 (P less than .05) in rats. T2 of HCC implanted in normal liver or liver with chronic hepatitis was essentially unchanged. These results were similar to those obtained by administration of a reticuloendothelial cell-directed conventional iron oxide; however, the required dose of receptor agent was lower. MR imaging in a woodchuck model of virally induced HCC confirmed the distribution of the hepatocyte-directed agent to regions of functioning and differentiated hepatocytes but not to malignant tumor tissue. The results suggest that MR receptor imaging may play a role in the differentiation between primary liver tumor and functional liver tissue such as that in normal liver hepatitis or regenerating nodules. 
Longterm followup after treatment of polyarteritis nodosa and Churg-Strauss angiitis with comparison of steroids, plasma exchange and cyclophosphamide to steroids and plasma exchange. A prospective randomized trial of 71 patients. The Cooperative Study Group for Polyarteritis Nodosa We attempted to define the most effective treatment for polyarteritis nodosa and Churg-Strauss angiitis, with a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial of cyclophosphamide in conjunction with corticosteroids and plasma exchanges, compared to corticosteroids and plasma exchanges. A total of 71 patients who fulfilled clinical, histological and/or arteriographic diagnostic criteria were randomly designated to receive either prednisone and plasma exchanges (group A, n = 39) or cyclophosphamide, prednisone and plasma exchanges (group B, n = 32). The end points of the study were control of the disease (recovery and remission) and death. Upon study entry clinical and laboratory features did not differ in the 2 groups. Treatment was stopped in 19 patients because of ineffectiveness in 10 (9 in Group A) and side effects in 9 (8 in Group B). Initial control of the disease was similar in both groups. At 5 years, 27 patients had completely recovered and 14 patients were in clinical remission. The cyclophosphamide-prednisone-plasma exchange association was beneficial in preventing relapses during longterm followup. Nineteen deaths were reported during the followup period. There was no difference between the 10 year cumulative survival rates of the 2 groups (respectively, 72 and 75%). Thus, the association of cyclophosphamide with corticosteroids and plasma exchanges reduced the incidence of relapses and improved the quality of the clinical response to therapy. 
Intensive liver care and management of acute hepatic failure. In describing acute liver failure, the term fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is used to denote patients with the most rapid progression, normally defined as the onset of encephalopathy within eight weeks of the onset of symptoms. For patients with a slower onset of encephalopathy, ranging from eight weeks to six months after the onset of symptoms, late-onset hepatic failure is the term used to reflect the overlap in clinical features with some patients with FHF. The importance of accurately determining the type of acute liver failure results from increasing evidence of an inverse relationship between the tempo of disease progression and the chances of recovery. Prognosis is also dependent on the underlying etiology. Principles of management are as follows: (1) an accurate recognition of the tempo of the hepatic failure--fulminant, late onset, acute on chronic--and the establishment of a likely etiology; (2) early detection and treatment of complications, particularly metabolic acidosis (early), renal failure, cerebral edema, and infection (late); (3) optimization of conditions for regeneration by maintenance of a near normal metabolic milieu (with removal of toxins by various methods of artificial liver support if necessary); and (4) early consideration of an orthotopic liver transplant for those patients in the poor prognosis group. Variations in the natural history and clinical features of acute liver failure (ALF) have led to a number of different classifications and subgroupings. Knowledge of these is important in relation to the assessment of prognosis and is even more important now that transplantation is a therapeutic option. 
Current management, local management, and survival statistics of high-grade osteosarcoma. Experience in Japan. To report the current management of high-grade osteosarcoma in Japan, the authors studied the results of 55 cases treated in the authors' institutions and data provided by Osaka University (59 cases), Chiba Oncology Group (97), and Sapporo National Hospital (70). Twenty-five of the 55 cases in the authors' series were treated by limb-salvage surgery, 27 by amputation, and the remainder by chemotherapy. In all 226 cases from the three institutes, 106 were treated by amputation and 120 by limb-salvage surgery. Two local recurrences (4%) were found in the authors' series, three in the Osaka series, and eight in the Chiba series. Five-year accumulative survival rates in this study showed some differences, depending upon the institution or upon the protocol employed: in the authors' series it was 60% overall and 68% for a stronger chemotherapy group; in the Osaka series, it was 50% in a mild chemotherapy group and 72% in an intensive chemotherapy group; and in the Sapporo series, it was 36% and 73%, respectively. This study showed that local control of IIB osteosarcoma was successfully achieved by preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and wide resection, and that an intensive chemotherapeutic combination of high-dose methotrexate, cisplatinum, and doxorubicin is promising. 
Successful epicardial pacing in blunt trauma resuscitation. Epicardial pacing wires were used successfully in the resuscitation of a moribund victim of blunt trauma after fluid resuscitation and chemical measures had failed. Application of these wires to treat the bradycardia of shock should be considered in selected patients when standard measures fail. 
Development of sustained achlorhydria in a patient with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated with omeprazole. Spontaneous remission of gastric acid hypersecretion in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome occurs rarely. This study shows the development of gastric secretory mucosal atrophy resulting in achlorhydria and loss of pepsin secretion in a 63-year-old woman with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Reduced secretion began soon after starting treatment with omeprazole, and achlorhydria became complete 6 months later. The patient remains well with normal endoscopy results and is achlorhydric 4 years after the start of treatment and 34 months after stopping omeprazole. She was not colonized with Helicobacter pylori until 36 months after developing achlorhydria. Serum gastrin has increased from 1000 to between 5000 and 12,500 ng/L (pg/mL), was not suppressible by gastric acidification, and was not associated with G-cell hyperplasia. She also has a normal Schilling test and normal immunoglobulins, and lacks antibodies to parietal cells or H+, K(+)-ATPase. Moderate enterochromaffinlike cell hyperplasia is apparent for the first time on the latest biopsy sample. 
Comparison of oral iodine-131-cellulose and indium-111-DTPA as tracers for colon transit scintigraphy: analysis by colon activity profiles. In 11 normal subjects and 11 patients with a clinical diagnosis of constipation, oral 131I-cellulose and 111In-DTPA were compared simultaneously as tracers for radionuclide colon transit scintigraphy. Visual assessment of the images revealed no differences between tracers. Quantitation was performed using total and segmental percent retention and the derived value of clearance half-time. In addition, profiles of the activity distribution along the length of the colon were generated and the mean position of the activity in the colon calculated. For all indices, the results were similar in both normal subjects and constipated patients when comparing tracers, although marked differences were present between normal subjects and constipated patients for each tracer. Indium-111-DTPA was easy to administer and dosimetry was more acceptable than for 131I-cellulose, especially in constipated patients. It is concluded that 111In-DTPA is the preferred tracer for oral colon transit scintigraphy. 
Quality of life before and after orthotopic hepatic transplantation. Fifty-three nonalcoholic patients were evaluated prior to liver transplantation and again approximately 3 years after surgery using the Sickness Impact Profile and Social Behavior Adjustment Schedule. Test-retest scores reflected significant improvement across all health and psychosocial scales of the Sickness Impact Profile. On the Social Behavior Adjustment Schedule, significant improvement was observed on scales measuring disturbed behavior, social role performance, and burden. Comparisons between groups indicated that the liver transplant patients were still impaired on eight of the Sickness Impact Profile scales after transplant; however, the severity of disturbance was not considered to be clinically significant. No between-group differences were noted on the Social Behavior Adjustment Schedule. These results indicate that liver transplantation is associated with substantial improvement in life quality, although as a group, the patients undergoing this surgery do not recover to the level of functioning demonstrated by normal individuals. 
Legionella myositis. Neuromuscular involvement in patients with legionnaires' disease is common, with serum CK elevations in up to 78% of patients. A few cases have been associated with neuropathy. The mechanism of injury to the neuromuscular system is unknown, but organisms have not previously been found in nerve or muscle. We report the clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic findings in a patient with Legionella myositis and motor neuropathy, the first case to demonstrate direct muscle invasion by the Legionella organism. 
Hemorrhagic venous infarction after excision of an arteriovenous malformation: case report. A case of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in which postoperative hemorrhagic infarction developed, probably because of occlusion of the former draining veins, is reported. The hemorrhage developed in the temporal lobe 3 days after the initial operation and was located in the immediate vicinity of the site of the AVM. The following findings suggest that the postsurgical hemorrhage probably resulted from a venous thrombosis: 1) no evidence of residual AVM; 2) delayed onset of the hemorrhage, inconsistent with the time course of a hemorrhage developing according to the breakthrough theory or with insufficient hemostasis with a high-pressure afterload; 3) good correlation between the location of the hemorrhage and the occlusion of the draining veins; and 4) multifocal hemorrhage affecting both the gray matter and the subcortical white matter. Postoperative hemorrhagic infarction caused by thrombosis in the draining veins is rare, but it should be considered as a distinct postoperative complication after removal of an AVM. 
Isolation of Jamestown Canyon virus from boreal Aedes mosquitoes from the Sierra Nevada of California. More than 28,000 mosquitoes in four genera were collected from high elevation (greater than or equal to 1,000 m) areas of California during 1988-89 and tested for virus by plaque assay in Vero cells. Viruses were serogrouped by enzyme immunoassay and serotyped by cross-neutralization. Six strains of Jamestown Canyon virus in the California serogroup were isolated from three species of boreal Aedes in the Aedes communis group of the subgenus Ochlerotatus. All isolates were from mosquitoes collected in Alpine County at approximately 2,300 m elevation in the Sierra Nevada. These included one virus from a pool of male Aedes cataphylla collected in immature stages, which is evidence for vertical transmission; four viruses from adult female Ae. communis (sens. lat.); and one virus from adult female Aedes hexodontus. These are the first isolations of viruses from boreal Aedes mosquitoes in California and the first reported isolations of Jamestown Canyon virus from Ae. cataphylla or Ae. hexodontus. 
Abnormal perception of visceral pain in response to gastric distension in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia. The irritable stomach syndrome. Sensory and pressure responses to gastric distension were evaluated in 24 consecutive patients suffering from chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and 20 healthy subjects. A latex balloon was placed in the proximal stomach and inflated by increments of 100 ml of air up to a maximal volume of 800 ml. Symptom response and intragastric pressure-volume curve were recorded during the gradual balloon distension. Thirteen of the 24 patients experienced pain at a distension volume less than or equal to 400 ml of air, but only one of the 20 controls (P less than 0.001). Intragastric pressure-volume curves were similar in patients and controls, and in patients with and without abnormal pain threshold, suggesting that a compliance defect was not the cause of the sensory anomaly. Gastric emptying of solids and liquids was measured in 20 of the 24 patients using a dual isotopic technique; psychological status was also evaluated in 18 patients using the Mini-Mult test. The frequency of the sensory anomaly was not different in patients with (7/14) or without (4/6) gastric stasis, but was lower in patients with (5/13) than in those without psychological disturbances (5/5, P less than 0.01). Thus, a primary visceral sensory anomaly, either alone or in conjunction with motility disturbances, can play an important role in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and must be taken in account for further therapeutic research. 
Acquired tracheal stenosis in infants and children. Acquired tracheal stenosis in childhood is frequently difficult to manage because of poor healing, infection, and scarring. In a 10-year period, 62 patients (4 weeks to 14 years of age) were treated for acquired tracheal stenosis. The causes of stenosis were endotracheal intubation (44 patients), caustic aspiration (6 patients), recurrent infection (5 patients), bronchoscopic perforation (4 patients), and gastric aspiration (3 patients). The subglottic or upper trachea was involved in 47 patients, mid portion in 8, and distal or carinal area in 7. Fifty children underwent tracheostomy as part of the therapy, and 12 were managed without tracheostomy. Therapy was individualized, frequently sequentially, utilizing rigid or balloon dilatation (20 patients), bronchoscopic electrocoagulation resection (44 patients), steroid injection (48 patients), T tube stent (8 patients), resection with anastomosis (12 patients), cricoid split (3 patients), and rib cartilage graft (12 patients). Most patients required several techniques and repeated procedures to eventually achieve decannulation. Seven patients (11%) died of unrelated causes. Forty-four of 55 surviving patients (80%) are without tracheostomy, although 14 have required continued endotracheal treatment after tracheostomy removal (dilatation, endotracheal resection). This series demonstrates that acquired tracheal stenosis in childhood is a common, difficult problem, but manageable with the use of a variety of techniques. Resection and grafting procedures should be reserved for cases in which less complex modalities fail. 
Labyrinthine ossification after meningitis: its implications for cochlear implantation. Labyrinthine ossification can be found in a high percentage of patients with profound deafness resulting from bacterial meningitis. Radiographic evidence of ossification can be found as early as 2 months after the acute infection, indicating that the intracochlear process probably begins much earlier. If long, intracochlear cochlear implants are to be most successfully used in these patients, an aggressive approach to clinical management following the meningitis should be taken. Illustrative case reports and suggested guidelines for evaluation and treatment are given. 
Limitations of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction complicated by congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock. As many as one quarter of patients treated with thrombolytic therapy present with congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock. Although thrombolytic therapy has been shown to limit infarct size, preserve left ventricular ejection fraction and decrease mortality in most subgroups of patients, no apparent benefit has been demonstrated in patients with clinical left ventricular dysfunction. The lack of correlation between ejection fraction and other measurements of left ventricular dysfunction such as exercise time, cardiac output, filling pressures, activation of the neurohumoral system and regional perfusion bed abnormalities may partly explain this paradox. Alternatively, lower perfusion rates, higher reocclusion rates, associated mechanical complications or completed infarction may explain these findings. Preliminary data indicate that emergency coronary angioplasty or bypass graft surgery improves survival in selected patients with cardiogenic shock. Because these findings suggest that restoration of infarct artery patency is especially important in patients with clinical left ventricular dysfunction, additional studies are needed in these patients to investigate the potential benefit that new thrombolytic strategies, inotropic or vasodilator agents or intraaortic balloon counterpulsation might offer by augmenting coronary blood flow and improving reperfusion rates. Currently, acute mechanical revascularization should be considered for patients who present with congestive heart failure associated with hypotension or tachycardia and for patients with cardiogenic shock. 
Effects of asymptomatic ischemia on long-term prognosis in chronic stable coronary disease. BACKGROUND. Ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring has been shown to adversely affect short-term prognoses in patients with unstable angina, after myocardial infarction, and with chronic stable angina. METHODS AND RESULTS. In this long-term study, we followed 138 patients (mean age, 59 +/- 9 years) with chronic stable angina and positive exercise tests for cardiac events (e.g. death, myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery). In 105 patients, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed after all antianginal medication was withheld for 48 hours. In 26 patients, the diagnostic tests were repeated while on their usual medication. In addition to the 105 patients, 33 patients had their monitoring performed only while on their usual medication. During 37 +/- 17 months of follow-up, there were nine deaths, nine myocardial infarctions, and 35 revascularization procedures. In patients monitored off medication, Cox survival analysis showed that the occurrence of ischemia on electrocardiographic monitoring was the most significant predictor of death and myocardial infarction in the subsequent 2 years (p = 0.02) and all adverse events for 5 years (p = 0.009). Patients who were monitored on medication and did not have ischemia (n = 18) appeared to have more adverse events than patients who had no ischemia while being monitored off medication (n = 43). CONCLUSIONS. Asymptomatic ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in patients with stable angina predicts death and myocardial infarction for 2 years and all adverse events for 5 years. Monitoring performed while on medication may show no ischemia; however, this may not indicate low risk of future coronary events. 
Incidence of left ventricular thrombi formation after thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, heparin, and aspirin in patients with acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate the prevalence of left ventricular thrombi after thrombolytic therapy, 144 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were prospectively studied with two-dimensional echocardiography 1 and 8 days after admission. Patients were treated 2.1 +/- 0.8 hours after the onset of symptoms. Thrombolytic protocol included 120 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), 5000 IU of heparin, followed by a continuous infusion of 25,000 IU/24 hours for at least 5 days, and 250 mg of aspirin a day. Seventy-six patients had AMI of the anterior wall; of these, seven (9.2%) developed left ventricular thrombi. The remaining 68 patients had infarctions of the inferior wall; of these, two (2.9%) developed left ventricular thrombi. Since anterior wall infarction not treated with thrombolytic therapy is associated with a 25% to 40% rate of left ventricular thrombi, we conclude that early thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA, heparin, and aspirin reduces the formation of left ventricular thrombus in AMI of the anterior wall. Apical left ventricular thrombi developed more frequently in patients with previous infarctions compared with those without (4 of 17 versus 4 of 127, p = 0.01). During the 12-month follow-up period, no patient in the study had manifestations of peripheral emboli. 
Auriculotemporal syndrome following the preauricular approach to temporomandibular joint surgery. Forty-seven joints in 28 patients were examined 4 months to 10 years after temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery via a modified preauricular approach. Many patients had undergone multiple procedures. None of the patients had any subjective or objective evidence of auriculotemporal syndrome (ATS), although patients in previous studies with more extensive incisions have demonstrated ATS. It was concluded that ATS is an unlikely complication following TMJ surgery. A small incision without an oblique superior extension may further reduce the risk. 
Scanning electron microscopic study of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The study has been carried out on biopsies taken from four patients affected by squamous cell carcinoma and four patients affected by undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UCNT). Three healthy volunteers have served as controls. All the specimens have been studied by SEM. The neoplastic conditions cause obvious alterations both in the mucosal surface and in the morphology of the cellular apex. 
Human alveolar macrophage antibacterial activity in the alcoholic lung. Alcoholic individuals are predisposed to respiratory infections. However, mechanisms of perturbations leading to increased susceptibility to lung infections of individuals with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) are not fully understood. We studied the antibacterial activity and oxidant generation (before and after stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate or opsonized zymosan) of alveolar macrophages from 16 patients with ALC. Our results were compared with those obtained from 12 healthy control subjects, from 8 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and from 8 alcoholic individuals without cirrhosis. All were nonsmokers, had normal chest X-rays, and did not present evidence of lung infection 3 months before. The total number of cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage did not significantly differ between control subjects and patients. The cellular viability of alveolar macrophages (trypan blue exclusion) was greater than 90% in all cases. The antibacterial activity of alveolar macrophages versus Staphylococcus aureus was severely impaired in ALC (-21 +/- 8.2%) whereas it was normal in PBC (52 +/- 4.2%), in alcoholic subjects (44.6 +/- 5.4%), and in control subjects (60 +/- 5.5%). The same pattern of results was observed versus Escherichia coli (-47.7 +/- 10,28 +/- 8,28 +/- 12, and 29 +/- 8.5%, respectively). Previous incubation of normal alveolar macrophages with serum or BAL fluid from ALC patients or with normal serum or normal BAL fluid did not result in a significant decrease in antibacterial activity of normal alveolar macrophages. To distinguish ingested bacteria from adherent extracellular bacteria, cells that had been incubated with bacteria for 90 min were then incubated with lysostaphin (1 microgram/ml). 
The occurrence of epilepsy and febrile seizures in Virginian and Norwegian twins. Twin studies provide an efficient method for examining the importance of genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of disorders such as epilepsy. Population-based twin registries are especially valuable for studies of this type since effects of reporting and self-selection biases on the resulting data are minimized. Among 14,352 twin pairs contained in the Virginia and Norwegian twin panels for whom questionnaire information was available, there was a history of epilepsy in one or both members of 286 pairs; febrile seizures were reported in 257 pairs. Analyses of questionnaire data revealed no significant differences in concordance rates between Virginian and Norwegian twins for either epilepsy or febrile seizures. Probandwise concordance rates for epilepsy were 0.19 in monozygotic twins and 0.07 in dizygotic twins. Analogous rates for febrile seizures were 0.33 (monozygotic) and 0.11 (dizygotic). These results provide further evidence that genetic factors do have a role in the expression of epilepsy and febrile seizures. 
Effects of acetylsalicylic acid on renal function in patients with chronic heart failure. PURPOSE: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether the administration of acetylsalicylic acid has adverse effects on renal function in patients with moderate chronic congestive heart failure with and without stimulation of the renin system. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: Group 1, low sodium diet and placebo; Group 2, low sodium diet and acetylsalicylic acid; Group 3, normal sodium diet and placebo; or Group 4, normal sodium diet and acetylsalicylic acid. Patients were studied over 8 days. After Day 5, patients in Groups 2 and 4 received acetylsalicylic acid (500 mg three times a day). The low sodium diet consisted of 13.6 mmol of sodium per day and the normal sodium diet consisted of 136 mmol of sodium per day. RESULTS: The low sodium diet resulted in a highly significant increase in the plasma renin (2p = 0.0001), aldosterone (2p = 0.0006), and urinary prostaglandin E2 (2p = 0.01) concentrations and the renal potassium excretion (2p = 0.0009), whereas renal sodium excretion was significantly reduced (2p = 0.0001). Severe sodium depletion led to a reduction of the glomerular filtration rate (2p = 0.007), which was independent from cyclooxygenase inhibition. In patients on the low sodium diet, acetylsalicylic acid reduced the elevated urinary prostaglandin E2 levels to normal values without changing the renal sodium excretion rate. In patients with a normal sodium intake, acetylsalicylic acid significantly reduced the renal sodium excretion rate by 29% (2p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: We conclude that severe sodium depletion has adverse effects on kidney function in patients with heart failure due to a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate. Administration of acetylsalicylic acid in doses that reduce the synthesis of renal prostaglandin E2 significantly reduces renal sodium excretion. 
Cardiovascular and catecholamine responses to head-up tilt in the diagnosis of recurrent unexplained syncope in elderly patients. To increase understanding of the mechanisms causing syncope in patients over the age of 60, hemodynamic and hormonal responses to 60 minutes of 60 degree head-up tilt were examined in 10 patients with recurrent syncope of unknown origin and five controls with no history of syncope. Nine of 10 patients and all five controls experienced orthostatic intolerance on the tilt table. Syncope or pre-syncope occurred later in controls than in those syncope patients who had exact reproduction of their clinical symptoms (median time 52 versus 22 minutes, P = 0.05). Three different mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance were identified in the 14 subjects: (1) vasovagal syncope, n = 9 (sudden hypotension +/- bradycardia); (2) dysautonomic syncope, n = 3 (immediate and gradual parallel declines in both systolic and diastolic pressures with blunted increase in heart rate); (3) psychogenic or vestibular reaction, n = 2 (orthostatic intolerance without hemodynamic changes). Vasovagal syncope patients showed a significant increase in plasma norepinephrine from baseline to maximum level during tilt (100 +/- 39% increase, P = 0.03) and a subsequent decrease at the time of syncope (30 +/- 5% decrease, P = 0.01), while plasma epinephrine increased markedly from baseline to the time of syncope (827 +/- 154% increase, P = 0.0003). Dysautonomic syncope patients had lower supine levels of norepinephrine compared to vasovagal syncope patients (182 +/- 30 versus 614 +/- 146 pg/mL, P = 0.008) and no significant change in norepinephrine over time; epinephrine levels increased significantly less than in vasovagal patients (net change 38 +/- 8 versus 189 +/- 56 pg/mL, P = 0.008). 
DuP 753 increases survival in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats fed a high sodium diet. We studied the effects of the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, DuP 753, on blood pressure, body weight, plasma renin activity, sodium excretion, and mortality in male stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp) fed a 4% NaCl diet for 12 weeks. The rise in blood pressure, due to high sodium intake, was blunted in the first 8 weeks of the study in the DuP 753-treated group; however, it started slowly to rise in the following weeks. In the untreated group, blood pressure rose steadily and it was significantly higher than that of the treated group during the whole experimental period. DuP 753-treated rats gained weight continuously during the study in contrast to the untreated group, where weight gain was arrested after 4 weeks. Plasma renin activity rose significantly after 4 weeks of treatment with DuP 753; by week 6 its values returned to baseline values and remained at these lower values until week 12. In the untreated group, plasma renin activity was not suppressed by high sodium intake after 4 weeks; it continued to rise and it was significantly elevated by 8 and 12 weeks. Survival at 12 weeks was 84% in DuP 753-treated group and 26% in the untreated group. The data demonstrate that DuP 753 decreased mortality and dramatically blunted the blood pressure rise in SHRsp fed a high sodium diet. 
Cardiac tamponade following coronary arterial rupture during coronary angioplasty. We describe a patient in whom percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was complicated by rupture of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) with pericardial tamponade. The outcome was favorable with drastic intervention which included: occlusion of the bleeding vessel with the PTCA balloon, pericardiocentesis, and ligation of the vessel without the need of aortocoronary bypass graft. 
Neurocutaneous melanosis: definition and review of the literature. Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by the presence of large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi and benign or malignant pigment cell tumors of the leptomeninges. The syndrome is thought to represent an error in the morphogenesis of the embryonal neuroectoderm. We review 39 reported cases of neurocutaneous melanosis and propose revised criteria for diagnosis. Most patients with neurocutaneous melanosis presented in the first 2 years of life with neurologic manifestations of increased intracranial pressure, mass lesions, or spinal cord compression. Leptomeningeal melanoma was present in 62% of the cases, but even in the absence of melanoma, symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis had an extremely poor prognosis. Useful diagnostic procedures include cerebrospinal fluid cytology and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast. Patients may be aided by palliative measures such as shunt placement to reduce intracranial pressure. Dermatologists in their follow-up of patients with large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi should be aware of this condition, to aid in prompt diagnosis and because the treatment of cutaneous lesions may be altered in the presence of symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis. 
Bilateral central retinal vein occlusion as an initial manifestation of pseudotumor cerebri. Pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension, is known to produce visual symptoms. Central retinal vein occlusion has been linked with pseudotumor cerebri but rarely as an initial manifestation. We describe a 46-year-old patient--who was obese and mildly hypertensive with bilateral central retinal vein occlusions--who was subsequently diagnosed as having pseudotumor cerebri. In patients with simultaneous bilateral central retinal vein occlusions, unusual underlying systemic conditions such as pseudotumor cerebri should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation. 
Primary sclerosing cholangitis: surgical options, prognostic variables and outcome. The natural history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is poorly defined and its management remains controversial. Forty-eight symptomatic patients (median age 39 years, range 8-67 years; 30 male) with PSC were reviewed retrospectively. Thirty patients had inflammatory bowel disease. Four patients (8 per cent) developed or had an associated malignancy. Twenty-one (44 per cent) died; overall 5 year actuarial survival was 30 per cent. Twenty-three patients had 27 non-transplant related biliary operations (16 patients specifically for PSC) of whom 12 died. Serum bilirubin was the only parameter to improve after biliary surgery. Seventeen patients (35 per cent) underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) of whom nine are currently alive (1 year projected survival of 55 per cent). Previous biliary surgery correlated with a poor outcome (P less than 0.0001) after OLT. Being male, presence of cirrhosis, duration of symptomatic disease (greater than 3 years) and a serum bilirubin level greater than 100 mumol/l at presentation, were independently associated with a poor outcome (P less than 0.05). These data provide evidence that PSC is a progressive disease and conventional surgical options have little influence on the outcome. Previous biliary surgery adversely affects outcome following OLT. For progressive liver disease, liver transplantation should be considered the treatment of choice. 
Total hip arthroplasty. The role of antiinflammatory medications in the prevention of heterotopic ossification. Postoperative prophylaxis with antiinflammatory medications, primarily indomethacin, is extremely effective in preventing the severest degrees of heterotopic ossification (HO) after a total hip arthroplasty (THA) and the recurrence of excised HO developed after a previous hip surgery. Prophylaxis with indomethacin should be given in 25-mg doses three times daily for at least three weeks, starting on the first postoperative morning. However, a shorter treatment period may be equally effective in preventing the severest degrees of HO, and a postoperative delay of five days before the initiation of prophylaxis does not seem to be followed by the development of severe HO. As evaluated one year after surgery, treatment with antiinflammatory medications in the immediate postoperative weeks did not increase the incidence of implant-bone interface radiolucencies, aseptic loosening, or revisions in cemented or cementless THAs when compared with cases that did not have postoperative treatment. However, although no major complications have been reported regarding the use of antiinflammatory medications in the prevention of HO after THA, orthopedic surgeons prescribing such treatment should be aware of their contraindications as well as early and late side effects. Since several antiinflammatory agents are reported to be effective in preventing HO, future reports dealing with HO after THA should always include information about the postoperative antiinflammatory treatment used. 
T-cell receptor tau delta +/CD3+4-8-T- cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias: a distinct subgroup of leukemias in children. A report of five cases. In a 10-year study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) in children, we have identified five cases expressing the T-cell receptor tau delta (TCR tau delta). The incidence (26%) of TCR tau delta+T-cell leukemias in our material was high. Clinically, the TCR tau delta+ leukemias represented a distinct subgroup of T-cell leukemias. Mean age at onset of disease, 1.8 years, was remarkably low for mature T-cell leukemias. White blood cell counts were high, lymph node enlargements were discrete, and no mediastinal tumors were seen. Four of five TCR tau delta+ leukemias carried rearrangements of the C tau 2 gene, and transcribed the T-early alpha genetic element. 
Detection of micrometastatic tumor cells in bone marrow of breast carcinoma patients. To determine the incidence and clinical significance of micrometastases in the bone marrow of breast carcinoma patients, we performed an immunoalkaline phosphatase assay using anticytokeratin (AE1, AE3, MAK-6) and antiepithelial (113F1, 260F9, 317G5) antibodies on the bone marrow aspirates of 71 stage IV disease patients with either recurrent regional or distant metastases. Although we detected tumor cells within the bone marrow of 38% of these patients with this assay, no significant correlation was seen with patient's age, menopausal status, bone scan, bone marrow core histology, response to induction chemotherapy, number of metastatic sites, dominant site of metastasis, or subsequent clinical outcome. The clinical parameters that were associated with improved survival were one dominant site of metastatic disease and regional soft tissue recurrence without distant disease. 
Wegener's granulomatosis with renal involvement: patient survival and correlations between initial renal function, renal histology, therapy and renal outcome. Patient survival and renal outcome were followed in 25 patients with biopsy confirmed Wegener's granulomatosis and renal involvement. Fourteen out of 25 patients required dialysis on admission, 11/25 patients did not. All patients were treated with a novel protocol comprising methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. The median follow-up observation was 36 months (12-113 months). With the exception of 1 patient (who died from causes not related to Wegener's granulomatosis) all patients are alive. Among the patients initially requiring dialysis (n = 14) 4 are in terminal renal failure after 0, 7, 21 and 38 months respectively. In the nondialysis group (n = 11) only 1 patient subsequently required chronic dialysis 30 months after clinical admission. Renal failure was due to non-compliance with immunosuppressive therapy in at least 2 patients. Percentage of obsolescent glomeruli and the degree of tubulointerstitial lesions, but not active glomerular lesions (crescents, necroses) predicted renal outcome. The major cause of renal functional impairment was relapse of Wegener's granulomatosis usually within 2 years after clinical remission. Therefore prolonged treatment with cyclophosphamide for at least 2 years after clinical remission is recommended. Two patients with initially negative immunohistology had a second renal biopsy which revealed de novo appearance of mesangial IgA deposits. 
Prevention and treatment of pregnancy-associated hypertension: what have we learned in the last 10 years? High blood pressure (BP) complicates approximately 10% of all pregnancies. Hypertension in pregnancy falls into four categories: (1) preeclampsia-eclampsia, (2) chronic hypertension of whatever cause, (3) preeclampsia-eclampsia superimposed to chronic hypertension or renal disease, and (4) transient or late hypertension (gestational hypertension). Preeclampsia, the association of hypertension, proteinuria, and edema, accounts for more than 50% of all the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and is a major cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, distinguishing between preeclampsia and other causes of hypertension on clinical grounds can be difficult because of the lack of specific tests for differential diagnosis. Increased vascular resistance has been claimed as the primary cause of preeclampsia; however, a variable hemodynamic profile with relatively high cardiac outputs, normal filling pressures, and inappropriately high systemic vascular resistances is now reported by most investigators. Imbalance between vasodilator and vasoconstrictor eicosanoids may account for platelet activation and increased responsiveness to pressor peptides. Altered prostacyclin (PGI2) to thromboxane A2 (TxA2) ratio in maternal uteroplacental vascular bed may favor local platelet activation and vasoconstriction contributing to placental insufficiency and fetal distress. Alternatively, recent evidence seems to suggest that fetal umbilical placental circulation may be the site of the primary vascular injury. Whether low-dose aspirin prevents preeclampsia because it inhibits the excessive maternal TxA2 or whether the partial inhibition of fetal TxA2 is also of therapeutic value remains to be established. Treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy is probably important to prevent cardiac failure or cerebrovascular accidents in the mother. The need for pharmacological therapy of mild to moderate hypertension is still debated, since no formal studies are available to clarify whether pharmacological treatment in such instances effectively reduces maternal or fetal risk. For the treatment of preeclampsia, hydralazine and nifedipine may be used when delivery is not applicable. Labetalol and diazoxide are effective for hypertensive emergencies. Life-threatening hypertension that does not respond to more conventional therapy is an indication for the use of sodium nitroprusside. For chronic hypertension, alpha-methyldopa remains the treatment of choice; if ineffective, hydralazine or beta-blockers are suitable. Effectiveness and safety of other molecules remain elusive. 
Air enema for diagnosis and reduction of intussusception: clinical experience and pressure correlates. Air enema was used for exclusion, diagnosis, initial movement, and complete reduction of intussusception in 186 pediatric patients. Average pressure needed for initial movement of intussusception was 56.5 mm Hg; average maximum pressure of 97.8 mm Hg was required for complete reduction. Average fluoroscopy time required for intussusception reduction was 94.8 seconds; an average of 41.8 seconds was required to exclude intussusception. Intussusception was diagnosed in 75 patients, and reduction was accomplished in 65 (87%). Of 100 consecutive patients that underwent hydrostatic reduction of intussusception at the authors' institution, reduction was successful in 55. Compared with hydrostatic enema, air enema involves shorter fluoroscopy time and lower radiation dose to the patient. Air enema is safe and effective for diagnosis and treatment of intussusception in infants and children and has replaced hydrostatic enema for such procedures at the authors' institution. 
A transformation-incompetent, nuclear antigen 2-deleted Epstein-Barr virus associated with replicative infection. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) obtained directly from the oropharynx was used to detect viral DNA deleted for the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2)-encoding gene that is essential for lymphocyte transformation. By polymerase chain reaction analysis, the deletion was found in virus from 5 of 33 healthy adult donors and 11 of 12 patients with concurrent human immunodeficiency virus infection. Lymphoblastoid cell lines that produce standard transforming EBV also harbored EBNA2-deleted virus in cells permissive of EBV replication. In vitro infectivity studies indicated that the DNA is packaged and transmissible, with biologic properties similar to those of a laboratory mutant, P3HR-1, which also lacks the EBNA2 gene. These findings, obtained from productively infected cell systems, provide evidence for the existence in nature of a transformation-incompetent EBV variant that may facilitate EBV persistence and the emergence of reactivation diseases. 
Quantitative evaluation of parenchymal liver cell volume and total hepatocyte number in cirrhotic patients. A simple morphometrical method was developed using a color image analyzing system, which allowed quantitative evaluation of parenchymal liver cell volume and total hepatocyte number in cirrhotic patients. With this method, we estimated these values in 29 cirrhotic patients who underwent hepatic resection (nine cases) or nonshunting operation (20 cases). Liver volume, calculated from computed tomographic images, was 976 +/- 196 cm3 (range = 602 to 1,376 cm3); the parenchymal cell volume ratio, obtained based on liver histological appearance with silver stain, was 0.665 +/- 0.092 (range = 0.510 to 0.881); and the parenchymal cell volume, calculated by multiplying the liver volume with the parenchymal cell volume ratio, was 645 +/- 140 cm3 (range = 403 to 936 cm3). The total hepatocyte number obtained in a similar manner using hematoxylin-stained specimens was 1.72 +/- 0.56 x 10(11) (range = 0.74 to 2.94 x 10(11)). The validity and applicability of the method is discussed, and the data are compared with those reported in other studies. 
K-edge digital subtraction arthrography of the painful hip prosthesis: a feasibility study. K-edge energy subtraction radiography is a method for detecting the presence of iodinated contrast material by subtracting two digital radiographs produced by X-ray beams with energies above and below the iodine K edge. We performed a feasibility study on the application of K-edge energy digital subtraction arthrography (KEDSA) to painful hip prostheses. During arthrography, loosening of the prosthesis is implied if contrast material is seen dissecting around the prosthesis, an often difficult detection task because of adjacent prosthesis metal or cement. In conventional arthrography a preliminary mask image is thus used from which films obtained after injection of iodinated contrast material are subtracted. Movement by the patient during this process may preclude subsequent subtraction. With KEDSA, since multiple image pairs may be obtained after the injection of contrast material, the problem of patient motion is virtually eliminated. A conventional X-ray tube operating between 55 and 65 kVp was alternately filtered by iodine and cerium filters to produce the KEDSA images. The apparatus was capable of producing a subtracted image within 3 sec. The technique was applied to phantoms and to six patients immediately after hip arthrography that had been positive for prosthesis loosening. Although of lower spatial resolution, the KEDSA images were, in all cases, positive for loosening in a pattern consistent with the conventional arthrographic images. KEDSA was shown to be successful in detecting extraarticular contrast material. During a single study, subtraction in various imaging planes as well as postexercise subtraction imaging can be accomplished-techniques not heretofore possible in routine subtraction arthrography. 
Colorectal ornithine decarboxylase activity in human mucosa and tumors: elevation of enzymatic activity in distal mucosa. To examine the value of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) assay as a biological marker of potential malignancy in large bowel, we harvested 43 colorectal carcinoma, 7 adenoma, 6 polyps, and 77 normal-appearing mucosa at surgery from patients with colorectal carcinoma. In addition, 13 normal rectal mucosa were obtained at biopsy from patients with benign diseases or diseases unrelated to colorectal carcinoma as normal control. ODC activity was significantly higher in polyps and adenocarcinomas than in normal-appearing mucosa from patients with colorectal carcinoma. ODC activity in normal-appearing mucosa varied throughout the large intestine, with significantly higher activities in the distal segment of the large bowel. The higher ODC activity detected in the sigmoid colon and rectum correlates with the larger incidence of tumor development in this region of the large bowel. This observation needs to be taken into consideration when ODC activities of the colorectal mucosa are measured as biological markers of potential malignancies. 
Cerebral hemodynamic effects of fluid resuscitation in the presence of an experimental intracranial mass. We addressed the impact on intracranial pressure (ICP) of posthemorrhage fluid resuscitation with a protocol in which additional fluid was infused to maintain a stable cardiac output after an initial bolus of fluid was infused. Anesthetized, mechanically ventilated mongrel dogs (n = 27) underwent a 30-minute interval of hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure = 55 mm Hg) during which inflation of a subdural balloon maintained ICP at 15 mm Hg. After shock, animals were resuscitated with one of four randomly assigned fluids: (1) slightly hypotonic crystalloid (Na+, 125 mEq.L-1; designated Na-125); (2) hypertonic crystalloid (Na+, 250 mEq.L-1; designated Na-250); (3) slightly hypotonic crystalloid plus 10% pentastarch (Na-125P); or (4) hypertonic crystalloid plus 10% pentastarch (Na-250P). Supplemental fluid was administered as needed to maintain cardiac output comparable to baseline values. ICP increased progressively in all fluid groups during resuscitation. Cerebral blood flow, measured by the cerebral venous outflow method, increased immediately after resuscitation and then declined steadily over time in all groups. Fluids containing pentastarch maintained hemodynamic stability with minimal supplementation throughout most of the postresuscitation period, compared with crystalloid alone, which required substantial additional volume. If decreased intracranial compliance and hemorrhage are combined, ongoing resuscitation is associated with significantly increased ICP and significantly decreased cerebral blood flow, independent of the tonicity and oncotic pressure of the infused fluid. 
Abdominal muscle activity during CO2 rebreathing in sleeping neonates. Comparison of the abdominal muscle response to CO2 rebreathing in rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep was performed in healthy premature infants near full term. Eight subjects were studied at a postconceptional age of 40 +/- 1.6 (SD) wk (range 38-43 wk) during spontaneous sleep. Sleep stages were defined on the basis of electrophysiological and behavioral criteria, and diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle electromyographic activity was recorded by cutaneous electrodes. The responses to CO2 were measured by a modified Read rebreathing technique. The minute ventilation and diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle electromyographic activities were calculated and plotted against end-tidal CO2 partial pressure. Both the ventilatory and diaphragmatic muscle responses to CO2 decreased from NREM to REM sleep (P less than 0.05). Abdominal muscles were forcefully recruited in response to CO2 rebreathing during NREM sleep. In REM sleep, abdominal muscle response to CO2 was virtually absent or decreased compared with NREM sleep (P less than 0.05). We conclude that 1) the abdominal muscles are recruited during NREM sleep in response to CO2 rebreathing in healthy premature infants near full term and 2) the abdominal muscle recruitment is inhibited during REM sleep compared with NREM sleep, and this REM sleep-related inhibition probably contributes to the decrease in the ventilatory response to CO2 rebreathing in REM sleep. 
Solvent-associated olfactory dysfunction: not a predictor of deficits in learning and memory. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate associations between olfactory dysfunction and aberrations in learning and memory after chronic occupational exposure to mixed hydrocarbon solvents. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional, epidemiologic study of 187 paint manufacturing workers. The authors administered quantitative tests of olfactory function (the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) and neurobehavioral function (eight computer- and examiner-administered tests of learning and memory) to workers for whom detailed information was available on lifetime occupational exposure to solvents. RESULTS: Olfactory function test scores were positively correlated with performance on seven of eight of the tests of learning and memory in bivariate analyses. After adjustment for important confounding variables (i.e., age, vocabulary score, and cumulative exposure to hydrocarbon solvents) with multiple linear regression, olfactory function scores predicted performance only on the Wechsler Memory Scale Delayed Logical Memory test. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the data did not reveal that olfactory dysfunction was correlated with decrements in various memory functions. 
Urinary pepsinogen I as a tumor marker of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy. The possibility that urinary pepsinogen I is a tumor marker of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy was examined. To decide the cutoff level of urinary pepsinogen I after total gastrectomy, urine samples from 15 patients who had undergone total gastrectomy for stomach cancer in the early or advanced stages and had been free from recurrence for more than 5 years were examined by pepsinogen I-specific radioimmunoassay. The mean concentration of urinary pepsinogen I was 17.5 +/- 7.4 ng/ml and the cutoff level of urinary pepsinogen after total gastrectomy was set at 32 ng/ml (mean + 2 SD). Twenty-two of 74 cases who had undergone total gastrectomy for stomach cancer were regarded as positive. And 20 of these 22 positive cases had definite clinical signs of recurrence of stomach cancer. There were only two false-positive cases. These results suggest that urinary pepsinogen I will be an useful tumor marker in detecting the recurrence of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy. 
Management of middle third facial fractures. In the management of fractures of the middle third of the face, it should be apparent to the surgeon that the more sophisticated fixation techniques carry increased liability, and their incorrect and imprecise application mandates identification and correction of any contributing factors if malunion is to be avoided. A less sophisticated stabilization technique that, by convention, generally is reliable, less complicated, less expensive, and less intimidating may be preferred. Given the complexity and diversity of midfacial injuries and the variety of available fixation and stabilization techniques, it is unlikely that any one method precisely suits every situation. 
Radiologic features of closed loop obstruction: analysis of 25 confirmed cases. The obstruction of a segment of bowel at two points results in a closed loop obstruction. Progression to strangulation is not an invariable component of this entity when surgical intervention is delayed. Enteroclysis is increasingly being used to evaluate obstruction of the small intestine. The authors retrospectively analyzed 25 surgically confirmed cases of closed loop obstruction and noted four enteroclysis features suggestive of the diagnosis: (a) crossing defects obstructing two segments of a loop of bowel secondary to dense adhesive bands (14 patients), (b) focal fixation of two limbs or twisting of the folds at the point of obstruction suggestive of volvulus (three patients), (c) abdominal wall herniation with obstruction (six patients), and (d) focal intraperitoneal segregation of a loop of bowel with tight obstruction suggestive of internal herniation (two patients). Recognition of the different patterns allows prompt preoperative radiologic diagnosis prior to strangulation. 
Effect of physiologic hyperinsulinemia on glucose and lipid metabolism in cirrhosis. Insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were evaluated in eight clinically stable cirrhotic patients and in 12 controls. OGTT was normal in cirrhotics but plasma insulin response was increased approximately twofold compared with controls. Subjects received a three-step (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mU/kg.min) euglycemic insulin clamp with indirect calorimetry, [6-3H]-glucose, and [1-14C]-palmitate. During the two highest insulin infusion steps glucose uptake was impaired (3.33 +/- 0.31 vs. 5.06 +/- 0.40 mg/kg.min, P less than 0.01, and 6.09 +/- 0.50 vs. 7.95 +/- 0.52 mg/kg.min, P less than 0.01). Stimulation of glucose oxidation by insulin was normal; in contrast, nonoxidative glucose disposal (i.e., glycogen synthesis) was markedly reduced. Fasting (r = -0.553, P less than 0.01) and glucose-stimulated (r = -0.592, P less than 0.01) plasma insulin concentration correlated inversely with the severity of insulin resistance. Basal hepatic glucose production was normal in cirrhotics and suppressed normally with insulin. In postabsorptive state, plasma FFA conc (933 +/- 42 vs. 711 +/- 44 mumol/liter, P less than 0.01) and FFA turnover (9.08 +/- 1.20 vs. 6.03 +/- 0.53 mumol/kg.min, P less than 0.01) were elevated in cirrhotics despite basal hyperinsulinemia; basal FFA oxidation was similar in cirrhotic and control subjects. With low-dose insulin infusion, plasma FFA oxidation and turnover failed to suppress normally in cirrhotics. During the two higher insulin infusion steps, all parameters of FFA metabolism suppressed normally. In summary, stable cirrhotic patients with normal glucose tolerance exhibit marked insulin resistance secondary to the impaired nonoxidative glucose disposal. Our results suggest that chronic hyperinsulinism may be responsible for the insulin resistance observed in cirrhosis. 
Intravascular stents in the management of superior vena cava syndrome. Superior vena cava syndrome can be effectively palliated with the use of intravascular stents. Adjunctive modalities which may be utilized prior to stent placement are thrombolytic therapy and balloon angioplasty. Six patients with an underlying malignancy were treated with these modalities. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred in five patients, and partial resolution occurred in the sixth. Two of the patients who had initial, complete resolution of symptoms had recurrences. One involved rethrombosis of the superior vena cava which occurred twice and required percutaneous thrombectomy, and the second involved restenosis requiring a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the SVC just distal to the stent. Both of these patients with second procedures, again, had complete resolution of symptoms. Intravascular stents are a valuable additional treatment of superior vena cava syndrome. 
Regional cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in patients with chronic liver disease. Subtle impairments of cognitive function may be an important cause of occupational and psychosocial morbidity in patients with chronic liver disease. Correlation of structural brain abnormalities with cognitive deficits has yielded inconsistent results. 10 patients with cirrhotic liver disease were compared with 10 age, education, and intelligence matched control subjects. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant overall cognitive impairments in cirrhotic patients compared with controls (p = 0.02). Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPET or SPECT) and showed increased uptake of radiotracer in the right and left posterior parts of the basal ganglia and right occipital lobe, together with reduced uptake in the right anterior cingulate region. The degree of cognitive impairment was directly correlated with functional abnormalities in the basal ganglia and limbic cortex (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that impaired cognitive status may be associated with abnormalities of regional brain function in patients with chronic liver disease. Since these deficits are clinically inapparent, our findings have important implications for identification and management of patients with chronic liver disease. 
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with disseminated toxoplasmosis presenting as an acute pulmonary and gastrointestinal illness. Encephalitis due to the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii has emerged as a common cause of central nervous system disease in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Extraneural disease is less common and more difficult to diagnose. We report a case of widely disseminated toxoplasmosis that presented as acute gastrointestinal and pulmonary disease in a patient without a prior diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis was made only at autopsy. Antemortem diagnosis of disseminated T gondii infection requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and the prompt utilization of appropriate diagnostic testing. Since toxoplasmosis is a potentially treatable opportunistic infection, diagnosis allows the swift institution of anti-Toxoplasma therapy. 
Recurrent severe traumatic brain injury. Series of six cases. Six of 141 persons treated for severe traumatic brain injury at the Medical College of Virginia were found to have a history of similar previous injury. These cases are presented in the context of the phenomenon of recurrent severe traumatic brain injury, which has received no systematic attention in epidemiologic studies of trauma. 
The incidence of recurrence and hypothyroidism following treatment with antithyroid drugs, surgery or radioiodine in all patients with thyrotoxicosis in Malmo during the period 1970-1974. The incidence of recurrence and of hypothyroidism was determined in all new patients treated for thyrotoxicosis during the period 1970-1974 in an unselected, well-defined urban population. A total of 309 patients were followed up for a median time period of 108 (1-192) months. There was a cumulative incidence of 51% recurrence in patients who were treated with antithyroid drugs for Graves' thyrotoxicosis, whereas after surgery or radioiodine treatment there were few recurrences, but 32% and 78% cumulative incidences of hypothyroidism. There were no recurrences after surgery or radioiodine treatment in patients with toxic multinodular goitre or solitary toxic adenoma, but 29% and 40% cumulative incidences of hypothyroidism following radioiodine treatment. Late hypothyroidism occurred after surgery for Graves' thyrotoxicosis, and in all groups treated with radioiodine. Thus it is advisable that all patients with Graves' thyrotoxicosis, regardless of treatment, and all patients with toxic multinodular goitre or solitary toxic adenoma treated with radioiodine, should be followed up for many years, and probably for life. 
Intraoperative duplex sonography during renal artery reconstruction. To assess renal duplex sonography as an intraoperative study to detect technical defects during repair, 57 renal artery reconstructions in 35 patients were studied. Sixteen men and 19 women (mean age, 62 years) underwent unilateral (13 patients) or bilateral (22 patients) renal artery repair to 57 kidneys. Methods of repair included aortorenal bypass grafting in 29 cases (20 saphenous vein, 5 polytetrafluoroethylene, 4 Dacron), reimplantation in 7, transrenal thromboendarterectomy with patch angioplasty in 13, and transaortic extraction thromboendarterectomy in 8. Branch renal artery repair was required in six cases (five in vivo, one ex vivo). Fourteen patients had combined aortic replacement (11 patients: 8 abdominal aortic aneurysms, 3 aortic occlusions) or visceral artery reconstruction (three patients: three superior mesenteric artery thromboendarterectomies, one inferior mesenteric artery thromboendarterectomy). Intraoperative renal duplex sonography (mean scan time, 4.5 minutes) was complete in 56 of 57 repairs (98%), and renal duplex sonography was normal in 44 repairs (77%). Overall, B-scan defects were present in 13 repairs (23%). Six of these (11%) were defined as major B-scan defects by Doppler spectra with focal increases in peak systolic velocity greater than or equal to 2.0 meters/sec (major defect, mean renal artery peak systolic velocity, 3.1 m/sec), which prompted immediate operative revision. Seven B-scan defects were defined as minor by Doppler spectra (minor defect, mean renal artery, peak systolic velocity, 0.7 m/sec) and were not revised. Postoperative evaluation (range, 1 to 22 months; mean follow-up, 12.4 months) of 55 renal artery repairs in 34 operative survivors (surface renal duplex sonography, 33 patients; renal angiography, 9 patients) demonstrated 42/43 renal artery repairs with normal intraoperative renal duplex sonography, and 6/6 repairs with minor B-scan defects were patent and free of critical stenosis. Of the 6 renal artery revisions prompted by major B-scan defects, 4 remained patent, 1 stenosed, and 1 occluded. Our experience suggests that intraoperative renal duplex sonography during renal artery repair provides valuable anatomic and physiologic information. Renal artery repairs with normal renal duplex sonography and minor B-scan defects without Doppler spectral changes demonstrated 98% patency without critical stenosis at 12.4 months of mean follow-up. However, major B-scan defects defined by a focal increase in renal artery peak systolic velocity should be considered for immediate correction. 
Circumvention of multi-drug resistance in human kidney and kidney carcinoma in vitro. This report investigated whether the calmodulin inhibitor, trifluoperazine, can circumvent multi-drug resistance both in primary tissue cultures of human kidney and kidney carcinoma. For detection of inherent multi-drug resistance, the expression of P-glycoprotein was determined by immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry using the monoclonal antibody C219. For detection of doxorubicin resistance and reversal of this resistance by trifluoperazine, the incorporation of nucleic acid precursor was measured after addition of doxorubicin and trifluoperazine, respectively. Both P-glycoprotein expressing resistant normal and malignant kidney tissue cultures could be modified by trifluoperazine. However, sensitive normal kidney and kidney carcinoma cultures were little affected by trifluoperazine. Thus, circumvention of primary resistance to doxorubicin is not limited to tumor cells. This might have important implications for the use of resistance modifiers in the clinical setting. 
Noninvasive detection of functionally significant coronary artery stenoses with exercise and positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography has been employed in vivo to assess flow using N-13 (nitrogen-13) ammonia and glucose metabolism, with the glucose analog F-18 (fluorine-18) fluorodeoxyglucose. Flow metabolism mismatches in which glucose metabolism is increased with respect to flow have been used to define ischemic, but viable myocardium. The feasibility of detecting exercise-induced ischemia using this technique was explored. Eleven normal volunteers and 16 patients who had undergone coronary arteriography were studied with N-13 ammonia at rest and with bicycle exercise, and with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose in the postexercise period. Each image was divided into 16 sectors. Comparison of absolute net extractions of N-13 ammonia at rest and with exercise was not sensitive in detecting functionally significant coronary artery lesions. Myocardial uptakes of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose and exercise N-13 ammonia were normalized to the sector with the highest N-13 ammonia uptake (corresponding to the highest flow rate). The differences and ratios of these normalized uptakes were successfully used to objectively define flow metabolism mismatches and to identify functionally significant coronary artery disease. Our data suggest that exercise flow and metabolic imaging are superior to rest and exercise flow imaging, particularly in patients with prior myocardial infarctions. 
Surgical management of diffuse subaortic stenosis: an integrated approach. An integrated approach to the surgical management of diffuse subaortic stenosis has been designed to provide adequate relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction whatever the anatomical features encountered at operation. This approach was used in 22 patients with tunnel subaortic stenosis (19 patients) or diffuse hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (3 patients). The obstructive tissue was resected through an aortoseptal approach. In 18 patients, associated hypoplasia of the aortic orifice necessitated aortic valve replacement using the Konno procedure; in 4 patients with a normal-sized aortic orifice, the native aortic valve was preserved. There were two early deaths and one late death (all after a Konno operation). Long-term adequate relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was achieved in all survivors. Operation for diffuse subaortic stenosis should be performed with two main goals: (1) to obtain complete relief of the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction by the appropriate procedure and (2) to preserve the native aortic valve whenever possible, particularly in young patients. 
Selective antibiotic prophylaxis in biliary tract operations. A prospective study of 397 patients with primary biliary operations performed for benign disease included a perioperative culture of the bile. Two main groups of patients in whom bacteria in the bile and, thus, probably increased risk postoperative infection was common, are patients undergoing emergency operation (60 per cent bacteria in the bile, as compared with 22 per cent in those with elective operations) and patients with a history of acute cholecystitis or pancreatitis, or both, or jaundice (49 per cent bacteria in the bile with a positive history as compared with 11 per cent without). The rate of infection was 2.8 per cent in high-risk groups, as compared with 0.6 per cent in patients undergoing elective operative procedures with no history of acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis or jaundice. Thus, antibiotics can probably be reserved for those patients who had emergency surgical treatment and for those with elective operations and a history of acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis or jaundice. In addition, antibiotic prophylaxis might be indicated for all patients who are 75 years of age or older, as bacteria in the bile seems to be common in this age group even without a history of the aforementioned complications. 
The Sugiura procedure for patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis. The Sugiura procedure (SP) was performed upon 27 patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (EPVT) without associated hepatic disease. There were 14 female and 13 male patients. The mean age was 28 +/- 14 years. The causes of EPVT were protein C deficiency in two; antithrombin III deficiency in one patient, a history of omphalitis in two patients, a history of pancreatitis in one patient and idiopathy in 21 patients. The SP was completed in two surgical stages in 14 patients and in one stage in nine. There was one operative death. One patient had mild postoperative encephalopathy, and two patients rebled at long term follow-up study. Actuarial survival rate was 82 per cent at five and ten years. It is concluded that the SP is a good alternative for the management of hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to EPVT. 
Malignant transformation of a Hurthle cell tumor: case report and survey of the literature. Hurthle cell carcinoma is a relatively uncommon type of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Its diagnosis has been controversial due to the difficulty in separating Hurthle cell adenoma from Hurthle cell carcinoma, thus the term Hurthle cell tumor is often used to describe both lesions. The present case of anaplastic giant-cell carcinoma in an 81-yr-old woman arose in a Hurthle cell tumor. This case illustrates the propensity of Hurthle cell tumor to undergo "malignant transformation" and argues for a more aggressive approach to such tumors. 
Pulmonary nodule: evaluation with spiral volumetric CT. Spiral volumetric computed tomography (CT) was used prospectively in 20 patients with a suspected solitary pulmonary nodule less than 1 cm in diameter on plain chest radiographs. Four additional nodules were detected with spiral CT than were detected with conventional CT. This technique required a 12-second breath hold; patient cooperation was excellent. 
Alterations in influence of granuloma-derived cytokines on fibrogenesis in the course of murine Schistosoma mansoni infection. Schistosomiasis is the main cause of hepatic fibrosis worldwide, yet its pathogenesis remains unknown. We previously reported that conditioned medium from cultures of hepatic egg granulomas (isolated from mice acutely infected with Schistosoma mansoni) can stimulate fibroblast proliferation and matrix production in vitro. We have proposed that initiation of hepatic fibrosis in this infection might be under the control of granuloma-derived cytokines. We now report that conditioned medium from cultures of schistosomal egg granulomas isolated from liver of chronically infected mice has reduced fibrogenic activity compared with medium from cultures of granulomas obtained from more acutely infected mice. In related studies, we adoptively transferred splenocytes from infected mice and examined the fibrogenic activity in culture supernatants of hepatic egg granulomas isolated from the recipients. Those prepared from recipients of splenocytes from chronically infected mice contained substantially less fibrogenic activity than did those from recipients of splenocytes of acutely infected mice. These findings suggest that the fibrogenic influence of schistosomal egg granuloma products decreases during the course of chronic murine S. mansoni infection. Furthermore, our preliminary findings suggest that immunoregulatory cells may be responsible for the down-regulation of this influence. Previous observations indicating that in murine schistosomiasis hepatic collagen and hyaluronate synthesis and deposition are elevated in acute but not chronic infection might be explained on the basis of our observations. 
HBxAg in the liver from carrier patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from 110 cases of chronic hepatitis and 108 cases of cirrhosis were stained for HBxAg by the avidin-biotin complex technique using specific antisera made against full-length HBxAg polypeptide or derived synthetic peptides. These tissues were also stained for the HBsAg and HBcAg by the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method. Among patients with chronic hepatitis, 86% were HBsAg positive in liver cells, 60% were surface antigen positive and 32% were core antigen positive. Among patients with cirrhosis, 97% were HBsAg positive in liver cells, 72% were surface antigen positive and 17% were positive for core antigen. Staining specificity was demonstrated, in part, by using preimmune sera in the place of primary antibody, by blocking of the primary antibody with the appropriate antigen before assay and by testing uninfected liver controls. The persistence and high frequency of HBxAg in liver cells from patients with chronic liver disease suggest that it may play one or more important roles in the pathogenesis of chronic infection. It is possible that detection of HBxAg in the liver could be an additional new diagnostic marker for hepatitis B virus infection. However, the function(s) of HBxAg in the pathogenesis of the chronic liver disease, if any, remains to be explained. 
Use of parenteral medium-chain triglyceride emulsion for maintaining seizure control in a 5-year-old girl with intractable diarrhea. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are an important component of an enteral ketogenic diet for seizure control. Previously, it was difficult to maintain ketosis when parenteral (iv) nutrition therapy was necessary. The use of iv MCT in a 5-year-old girl with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who had diarrhea and dehydration is reported. Conventional 20% iv fat emulsion (long-chain triglycerides, LCT) and dextrose free hyperalimentation (HAL) in a 4:1 ketogenic ratio did not maintain adequate ketosis during bowel rest. Compassionate use of iv MCT (Clintec Nutrition) infused as a 70:30 MCT/LCT ratio plus HAL maintained moderate ketosis. Seizures were well controlled during the iv MCT regimen, which allowed normal daily functioning. Complications included abnormal liver function tests and severe iron deficiency anemia of unknown etiology. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels increased to 1717 mg/dl and 614 mg/dl, respectively, but decreased with a reduction of lipid infusion and use of an antihyperlipemic drug. Nutritional status was maintained. In this case, iv MCT proved to be a relatively safe and effective short-term method of continuing parenteral nutrition while maintaining ketosis for seizure control. 
Differential effects of gallium nitrate on proliferation of brain tumor cells in vitro. Gallium nitrate possesses antineoplastic activity against certain solid tumors; however, no studies exist regarding the effect of this metal on brain tumor cell proliferation. Several human brain tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines were incubated with increasing concentrations of gallium nitrate and cell proliferation was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The growth of medulloblastoma 324, rhabdomyosarcoma TE671, and RD cells was markedly inhibited by gallium nitrate, while glioblastoma cell growth was only moderately inhibited (U373 cells) or actually stimulated (U87 cells). Gallium inhibited the cellular uptake of 59Fe; however, this block in 59Fe uptake was variable and closely paralleled the inhibitory effects of gallium on cell growth. Intracellularly, gallium may interfere with DNA synthesis by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase. Such effects may be of relevance in the treatment of brain tumors with this metal. 
Mixed cryoglobulinemia associated with chronic Q-fever. A 41-year-old woman who presented with purpura, glomerulonephritis and mixed cryoglobulinemia was found subsequently to have developed chronic Q-fever. Since Q-fever is a frequent cause of culture negative endocarditis in some endemic areas, the diagnosis of Q-fever endocarditis should be considered in patients presenting with mixed cryoglobulinemia of unknown cause. 
Suppressive effect of SUN1165 on supraventricular tachycardia. The electrophysiologic properties of SUN1165 and its suppressive effect on supraventricular tachycardia were assessed in 14 patients, nine with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) and five with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). This new agent prolonged the PR interval and QRS duration but did not alter the QT interval or the corrected QT interval. It did not alter the sinus cycle length or sinus node recovery time. The drug prolonged the AH interval, HV interval, and intraatrial conduction time but did not change the effective refractory periods of the right atrium or right ventricle. SUN1165 prevented the induction of tachycardia in six of nine patients with AVRT by a complete retrograde block of the accessory pathway and prevented AVNRT in four of five patients by a complete retrograde block of the fast atrioventricular nodal pathway as well. We conclude that SUN1165 is very effective in preventing AVRT or AVNRT. Larger studies with more patients are warranted. 
Family history in patients with transient ischemic attacks. To determine the influence of family history on vascular disease, we surveyed hospital patients discharged with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack. Of 117 respondents, 81 knew their family history for myocardial infarction and 81 knew their family history for stroke. Of 83 responding 43 reported a personal history of myocardial infarction, and of 85 responding 66 reported a personal history of stroke. As expected, there was an association between positive family and personal histories of myocardial infarction in younger (aged less than 70 years) patients (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.014). This association was reversed for stroke (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.017). Older (aged greater than or equal to 70 years) patients had a stronger association between positive family and personal histories of stroke; 14 (74%) of 19 older patients with a positive personal history of stroke had a positive family history of stroke. The reason for this reversal in the relation between family and personal histories of stroke compared with myocardial infarction may relate to the older age at onset of most strokes, differing stroke subtypes in older age groups, or lower rates of fatal myocardial infarction. This study suggests that familial factors may be important in some subtypes of cerebrovascular disease. Familial effects may be different in vascular diseases of the heart and brain. 
Interleukin-6 secreting human pituitary adenomas in vitro. Interleukin-6 was found to be secreted from seven out of ten human pituitary tumours cultured in vitro. These tumours included prolactin-secreting, growth hormone-secreting and clinically non-functioning adenomas. The amount of Interleukin-6 secreted was variable from 58 to 10,000 units per ml. in medium removed after a four-day incubation under basal conditions. Four tumours secreted IL-6 in excess of 500U/ml, three of which were clinically non-functioning, but each secreted follicle stimulating hormone in vitro. This is the first report of a cytokine growth factor being released basally by human pituitary tumours. 
Pancreatoduodenal carcinoma: a clinicopathologic study of 304 patients and immunohistochemical observation for CEA and CA19-9. A total of 304 patients with pancreatoduodenal carcinoma were studied clinicopathologically and immunohistochemically in order to clarify features of carcinoma of four different sites of origin; carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (Am), the distal common bile duct (DCBD), the head of the pancreas (PH), and the extra-ampullary duodenum (Du). The mean greatest diameter of 87 PH was 3.5 cm compared with 2.7 cm of 149 Am and 2.7 cm of DCBD. Histopathologically, 40% of Am were papillary adenocarcinoma, while about half of DCBD, PH and Du were tubular adenocarcinoma. PH invaded lymphatic (85%), vascular (62%), and perineural (95%) spaces and metastasized lymph nodes (72%) more frequently than Am (77%, 35%, 24%, 50%), DCBD (47%, 61%, 65%, 45%), and Du (76%, 29%, 35%, 65%), respectively. More than 50% of PH invaded the resected margins, whereas in only 2% of Am, the surgical margins were affected by malignant cells. Immunohistochemically, PH was more frequently positive for both carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (98%) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 (91%) than Am (83%, 62%), DCBD (94%, 58%), and Du (56%, 11%), respectively. The stromal staining type of CEA and CA 19-9 was more frequently seen in PH (27%, 44%) than in Am (9%, 31%), DCBD (11%, 8%) and Du (0%, 0%), showing a more dedifferentiated nature of PH. The cumulative 3-year survival rate of 87 patients with PH (15%) was worse than that of 149 with Am (42%, P less than 0.001), of 51 with DCBD (25%) and of 17 with Du (58%, P less than 0.001). The survival curve of 87 with PH was worse than that of 51 with DCBD, of 149 with Am (P less than 0.001) and of 17 with Du (P less than 0.001). Cox regression analysis, using eleven profound prognostic variables, revealed that venous invasion, perineural infiltration, surgical margin, and histopathologic type were profound prognostic factors. Pancreatic carcinoma has a more dedifferentiated histopathologic nature, showing a more aggressive growth and fares worse than Am, DCBD, and Du. 
A 21-year experience with major hemorrhage after percutaneous liver biopsy Nine thousand two hundred twelve liver biopsies were performed according to a defined protocol, and data were prospectively recorded to identify risk factors for major bleeding. There were 10 fatal and 22 nonfatal hemorrhages (0.11% and 0.24%, respectively). By comparison with a control group that did not hemorrhage, malignancy, age, sex, and the number of passes were the only predictable risk factors. The risk of fatal hemorrhage in patients with malignancy is estimated to be 0.4%; for nonfatal hemorrhage, 0.57%. In patients undergoing liver biopsy for nonmalignant disease, the risks are 0.04% and 0.16%, respectively. 
Skeletal actin mRNA increases in the human heart during ontogenic development and is the major isoform of control and failing adult hearts. Expression of the two sarcomeric actins, alpha-skeletal and alpha-cardiac, is regulated in the rodent heart in response to developmental, hormonal, and hemodynamic stimuli. Little is known in man, except that both isogenes were found to be coexpressed in three adult ventricles. In this report, we investigated the isoactin mRNA composition in ventricles from 21 control patients (4 fetal, 5 juvenile, 12 adult) and from 15 patients undergoing cardiac transplantation (5 idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathies, 5 ischemic myopathies with myocardial infarcts, 5 diverse etiologies) by two different and complementary techniques: RNA dot blot analysis with specific cDNA probes, and primer extensions with an oligonucleotide common to alpha-cardiac and alpha-skeletal actins. In the case of dot blot analysis, quantification of each isoform was performed by using as standards RNA transcripts obtained from cloned human alpha-actin sequences, and the total amount of sarcomeric actin mRNA was evaluated as a function of total poly(A+)RNA. We found that both isogenes are always coexpressed, and that the isoactin pattern changes during development. In utero and in neonatal hearts, alpha-skeletal actin mRNA represents less than or equal to 20% of sarcomeric actins, it increases to 48 +/- 6% during the first decade after birth and becomes the predominant isoform of adult hearts (60.4 +/- 8.5%). The 15 adult failing hearts exhibited the same isoactin pattern as the control ones (62.84 +/- 11.06%), and there was no difference in expression between patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease. These observations demonstrate that cardiac development in man, in contrast to rodent heart, is characterized by an up-regulation of the skeletal actin gene, the expression of which does not change in hypertrophied and failing hearts, and suggest that the actin and myosin heavy chain families are independently regulated in human heart. 
Pregnancy outcome among native Indians in Saskatchewan. OBJECTIVE: To determine the difference in pregnancy outcome between native Indians and the provincial population in Saskatchewan. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data collected from all birth and death registration forms. SETTING: Saskatchewan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of low birth weight and rates of stillbirth and of neonatal and infant death. RESULTS: The neonatal death rate was higher in the Indian population than in the provincial population during the study period; the difference between the two groups in the rate decreased markedly after 1982. The rates of stillbirth and infant death were also higher among the Indians, and the difference persisted during the study period. The incidence of low birth weight and the rate of stillbirth were highest in the youngest and oldest maternal groups in the provincial population; however, the pattern was markedly different among the Indians, teenaged mothers having the best outcomes. CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to determine the relation between maternal age and fetal outcome among native Indians. 
Possible linkage of the estrogen receptor gene to breast cancer in a family with late-onset disease. The estrogen-receptor locus is a candidate gene for inherited susceptibility to human breast cancer, particularly among families with later onset, primarily estrogen-receptor-positive tumors. For one extended family with eight patients with late-onset disease, one estrogen-receptor haplotype was consistently coinherited with breast cancer, yielding a +1.85 lod score for linkage at zero recombination. Simulation of this pedigree assuming independent inheritance of breast cancer and estrogen-receptor genotypes led to a lod score greater than or equal to 1.85 only once in 2,000 replicates. We suggest testing linkage of this gene to breast cancer in other families with late-onset disease. 
Quantitative coronary arteriographic methods in the interventional catheterization laboratory: an update and perspective. Recent research advances in the area of quantitative coronary arteriography are described with respect to their potential role in assessing the effects of interventional therapy and monitoring the restenosis process. Specific areas emphasized are the importance of quantitative arteriography and absolute measures of arterial dimension in monitoring restenosis, the development of a computerized method for measuring lesion roughness, the potential role of measuring stenosis flow reserve based on component analysis principles, limitations of direct measures of myocardial flow reserve using a digital angiographic method and cautionary notes about clinical applications of videodensitometry. The current use of radiography and quantitative measures in limiting arterial injury are briefly reviewed. Finally, a perspective is put forth on the need to develop complementary roles for endovascular echocardiography and angioscopy with existing radiographic imaging technology. 
Diuretic agents and beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension. Benzothiadiazine diuretic agents and beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking drugs are two of the main groups of drugs used to treat mild hypertension. Recently, questions have been raised about their relative efficacy in preventing morbidity and mortality from vascular disease in addition to their effect on lowering blood pressure. Attention has been focused on the unfavorable metabolic effects of diuretic drugs and the proven value of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Four randomized controlled trials comparing drugs in these two classes have been published: the Medical Research Council trial, the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension trial, and the Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertension study. These trials, especially that of the Medical Research Council, have raised some questions about the relative efficacy of these two classes of drugs in preventing stroke in smokers and nonsmokers. Overall, there is little evidence of a reduction in morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction. The predicted advantage of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade over diuretic therapy has not been realized although there are sufficient hints of a differential benefit to encourage the performance of further trials. 
Stenting of coronary arteries: has a modern Pandora's box been opened? Interventional cardiology has recently witnessed the growth of several alternatives to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, including coronary stenting. Although stenting appears to be useful in treating abrupt closure after coronary angioplasty, its effectiveness in limiting the complex processes responsible for late restenosis is much less certain. Pathologic examination of stented human saphenous bypass grafts shows extensive deposits of platelets, fibrin and leukocytes along the stent wires within the 1st week and formation of a neointima of variable thickness after 3 months without evidence of foreign body reaction. The long-term effects of continuous barotrauma induced by the expanded stent remain unknown. It is difficult to assess the relative merits of the new devices, but stenting has several theoretic advantages. It seems less disruptive to the underlying architecture of the vessel wall and enjoys favorable theoretic and effective expansion ratios. Wide-spread clinical acceptance for stenting will depend on demonstrating that its safety, efficacy and cost efficiency are superior to those of balloon angioplasty. 
Magnetic resonance imaging and 31P spectroscopy of an interictal cortical spike focus in the rat. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to be an effective noninvasive technique for identifying lesions in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. It has also been suggested that MRI may be sensitive to transient functional or metabolic changes in brain tissue. Increased brain electrical activity as monitored by electroencephalography causes changes in cerebral metabolism that may be responsible for focal or regional alterations in signal in the MRI of some patients. To test this hypotheses, experimental interictal cortical foci were produced in rats by topical application of penicillin to one hemisphere of the brain. In vivo MRI and phosphorous-31 (31P) spectroscopy of the focal and contralateral hemifield were performed in a 30-cm bore 1.89-T Bruker MSL system. 31P spectroscopy revealed no quantifiable differences in pH or in phosphocreatinine and ATP levels between the focal area and the contralateral hemisphere or between experimental and saline-treated control animals. There were also no differences in proton MRI. Similar areas of prolonged T2 were found near the cortex and in the deeper parenchyma in 55% of the experimental animals and 50% of the controls. These results suggest that the electrical activity from an interictal cortical spike focus is not severe enough to perturb cerebral metabolism sufficiently to be detectable by 31P spectroscopy or proton imaging techniques. 
Antisense-mediated reduction in thrombospondin reverses the malignant phenotype of a human squamous carcinoma. Thrombospondin (TSP) is a trimeric glycoprotein which is synthesized and incorporated into the extracellular matrix by a wide variety of cells. TSP is involved in a number of cellular processes which govern tumor cell behavior including mitogenesis, attachment, migration, and differentiation. To directly assess the role of TSP in tumor cell growth and spread, a human squamous carcinoma cell line, with high TSP production and an invasive phenotype, was transfected with a TSP cDNA antisense expression vector. Five unique transfected clones were obtained with reduced TSP production. Expression of the transfected antisense sequence in these clones was verified by a ribonuclease protection assay. These clones demonstrated reduced growth rates in vitro when compared with a vector transfected control. After subcutaneous inoculation into athymic mice, the antisense clones formed either no tumors or tumors that were slow growing and highly differentiated. This contrasted with the vector-transfected clone which produced poorly differentiated, rapidly growing, invasive tumors. Our results argue in favor of a direct role for TSP in determining the malignant phenotype of certain human tumors. 
Cardiac transplantation. How recipients are selected. Your patients with heart disease may ask about transplantation. Those who are potential candidates need a physician who knows enough about the selection system to get them into it. For other patients, an explanation of why the procedure is contraindicated in their case can help them refocus on compliance with recommended therapy. The authors discuss the principles of recipient selection. 
Mucosal dysplasia and DNA content in ulcerative colitis patients with ileorectal anastomosis. Follow-up study in a defined patient group. In a follow-up study of an epidemiologically defined patient group comprising 1,274 patients with ulcerative colitis diagnosed in Stockholm County during 1955-1979, 55 patients had undergone colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA). Nine of these were found to have Crohn's disease after histopathologic review of the colectomy specimens. Of the 46 patients with ulcerative colitis remaining for evaluation, two died postoperatively. Twenty-five patients were subsequently reoperated with rectal excision owing to intractable inflammatory activity (n = 22, one postoperative death) or owing to dysplasia (n = 3). Of 19 patients with their IRA still intact at time of follow-up, 15 patients (median disease duration 23 years) had a flexible sigmoidoscopy with multiple biopsies performed. The average length of the remaining rectum and sigmoid colon was 26 cm. No patient had findings of dysplasia, carcinoma, or DNA aneuploidy. None of the four remaining patients had developed dysplasia or carcinoma at the time of the latest regular rigid sigmoidoscopy. The risk of malignant transformation in this selected group of patients with ulcerative colitis operated upon with colectomy and IRA derived from an epidemiologically defined population seems to be low. 
Short and long term outcome of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in unstable versus stable angina pectoris: a report of the 1985-1986 NHLBI PTCA Registry. In a cohort of 1,720 consecutive patients from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) Registry (August 1985-May 1986), we compared 768 patients (45%) with stable angina and 952 patients (55%) with unstable angina pectoris. Unstable angina patients exhibited at least one of the following characteristics: new onset angina, rapidly progressing angina, angina at rest, angina refractory to medication, variant angina, acute coronary insufficiency, or angina recurring shortly after an acute myocardial infarct. The distribution of single- and multi-vessel disease was similar among stable and unstable angina patients; multi-vessel disease predominated. Average severity of stenosis and incidence of tubular and diffuse stenosis morphology were higher among patients with unstable angina (both p less than 0.001). Patient success rates were similar in stable and unstable patients. However, on a per lesion basis, overall angiographic success rate and average reduction of severity of stenosis in successfully dilated lesions were significantly higher among patients with unstable angina (both p less than 0.001). Incidence of major patient complications (p less than 0.01) and of emergency coronary bypass surgery (p less than 0.05) were also higher in patients with unstable angina but consistent with their more precarious clinical condition and stenosis morphology. During a two year follow-up, the cumulative distributions of death, myocardial infarct, repeat PTCA, and coronary bypass surgery were not significantly different in patients with stable angina compared to patients with unstable angina. Comparison of the current PTCA Registry cohort with the cases reported in the 1979-1982 Registry revealed a 19% higher success rate for both stable and unstable angina patients. Major complication rates decreased between time periods for stable but not for unstable angina patients. Incidence of emergency bypass surgery decreased more for stable than for unstable angina patients. Coronary angioplasty is indicated in properly selected patients with unstable angina and both single- and multi-vessel coronary disease. 
Reversal of nonresponders and postexposure prophylaxis by intradermal hepatitis B vaccination in Japanese medical personnel. Thirty-one Japanese nonresponders to subcutaneous hepatitis B vaccination and 15 medical personnel who were accidentally exposed to specimens positive for hepatitis B e antigen and were given hepatitis B immunoglobulin were intradermally immunized with 5 micrograms of plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine every 2 weeks until delayed type hypersensitivity skin reaction to hepatitis B surface antigen became positive. Thirty (97%) of the 31 nonresponders developed delayed type hypersensitivity skin reactions to hepatitis B surface antigen after 2.3 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- SD) revaccinations. Twenty-nine (94%) of the 31 nonresponders had anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody levels greater than 10 IU/L. The immunoglobulin subclass of the antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen was mainly IgG1. After 1 year, 23 (74%) of the 31 nonresponders continued to have anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody levels greater than 10 IU/L. Persons accidentally exposed to specimens positive for hepatitis B e antigen developed delayed type hypersensitivity skin reactions to hepatitis B surface antigen following 3.1 +/- 1.1 revaccinations. None developed clinical hepatitis. There was no production of anti-hepatitis B core antigen antibody 1 year after exposure, indicating that protection was 100%. Intradermal hepatitis B vaccination is useful in reversing nonresponsiveness to hepatitis B surface antigen and for prophylaxis after exposure. 
The value of bupivicaine hip injection in the differentiation of coxarthrosis from lower extremity neuropathy. A series of 18 consecutive patients with roentgenographically proven osteoarthrosis (osteoarthritis, OA) of the hip and spine were evaluated because of concomitant lower extremity pain below the knee. To determine whether the leg symptoms were coxalgic or neuropathic, intraarticular hip bupivicaine was injected as a provocative test. This test allowed correct identification of the source of the pain with a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 100%, and an efficiency of 88%. This office test also provides significant savings in terms of diagnostic tests and patient discomfort. 
Diagnostic imaging in puerperal febrile morbidity. This retrospective study was conducted to assess the value of imaging in patients with refractory puerperal febrile morbidity. During a 36-month period, 31 patients were referred for ultrasound and/or computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging because of postpartum fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy of at least 72 hours' duration. Hematomas were identified in 11 women. Abscesses were diagnosed in seven patients, ovarian venous thrombosis in two, vesicouterine fistula in one, small-bowel obstruction in one, and a subcutaneous seroma in one. Twenty-one women had endomyometritis, 13 of whom also had other extrauterine abnormalities (abscess in six, hematoma in four, and ovarian venous thrombosis, vesicouterine fistula, and small-bowel obstruction in one each). Retained placental tissue was found in two women with endomyometritis. Only two subjects had negative imaging studies. In most patients, imaging led to definitive diagnosis and specific therapeutic measures resulting in resolution of the febrile morbidity. Our experience suggests that these imaging techniques may be helpful in evaluating puerperal fever. 
Eosinophil-rich, granulomatous inflammatory response to Plasmodium berghei hepatic schizonts in nonimmunized rats is age-related. Inflammatory responses to Plasmodium hepatic schizonts within the livers of non-immunized animals have long been assumed to be initiated only after the parasites have matured and begun to burst. However, recent reports of inflammatory responses around hepatic schizonts suggested a re-examination of this issue. We injected Norway-Brown rats of various ages intravenously with Plasmodium berghei sporozoites and studied subsequent liver histopathology. We found that the ability of these rats to mount an inflammatory response is age-dependent. Young (4 weeks) rats had weak inflammatory responses against hepatic schizonts, whereas older (8-10 weeks) rats mounted a strong response. Older rats had many granulomatous reactions within the liver; eosinophils represented a pioneer component of the cellular infiltrate. There was a reduction in the numbers of surviving hepatic schizonts in the older rats, suggesting that these granulomatous and eosinophilic reactions had effectively destroyed some of the hepatic schizonts. We found clear evidence of inflammatory cells (eosinophils) infiltrating hepatic schizonts as early as 40 hours post-injection with sporozoites, a time well before any hepatic schizonts could have burst within the liver. This presents histological evidence that inflammatory cells can recognize and infiltrate intact hepatocytes containing schizonts in immunologically naive animals. 
A prospective study of maturity-onset diabetes mellitus and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke in women. We examined the relationship of maturity-onset clinical diabetes mellitus with the subsequent incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke, total cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in a cohort of 116,177 US women who were 30 to 55 years of age and free of known coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer in 1976. During 8 years of follow-up (889 255 person-years), we identified 338 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 111 coronary deaths, 259 strokes, 238 cardiovascular deaths, and 1349 deaths from all causes. Diabetes was associated with a markedly increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (age-adjusted relative risk [RR] = 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3 to 8.4), ischemic stroke (RR = 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3 to 9.0), total cardiovascular mortality (RR = 6.3; 95% CI, 4.6 to 8.6), and all-cause mortality (RR = 3.0; 95% CI, 2.5 to 3.7). A major independent effect of diabetes persisted in multivariate analyses after simultaneous control for other known coronary risk factors (for these end points, RR [95% CI] = 3.1 [2.3 to 4.2], 3.0 [1.6 to 5.7], 3.0 [1.9 to 4.8], and 1.9 [1.4 to 2.4], respectively). The absolute excess coronary risk due to diabetes was greater in the presence of other risk factors, including cigarette smoking, hypertension, and obesity. These prospective data indicate that maturity-onset clinical diabetes is a strong determinant of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular mortality among middle-aged women. The adverse effect of diabetes is amplified in the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, many of which are modifiable. 
Fetal and neonatal effects of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in pregnancy. We conducted a systematic search of the world literature up to January 1, 1990 on the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for treatment of hypertension during pregnancy. A total of 25 publications reported 85 pregnancies in 81 women, including three twin pregnancies. Captopril had been used in 49, enalapril in 35, and both drugs in one of these pregnancies. The number of unbiased data are too limited to permit firm conclusions on teratogenicity, if any, of these agents. Contrary to earlier suggestions, we found no evidence that the use of these agents increases the likelihood of low weight for gestational age, respiratory distress syndrome, and/or persistent ductus arteriosus. Use of these agents in pregnancy can cause severe disturbance of fetal and neonatal renal function, such as oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and long-lasting neonatal anuria. Although the true incidence of these perinatal problems cannot be derived from the type of data hitherto available, there are strong suggestions that renal dysfunction is more common with the use of enalapril than with captopril. The frequency of serious perinatal complications is high enough to warrant extreme reluctance in prescribing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during pregnancy. 
Respiratory symptoms in Indian women using domestic cooking fuels. The effect of domestic cooking fuels producing various respiratory symptoms was studied in 3,701 women. Of these, 3,608 were nonsmoking women who used four different types of cooking fuels: biomass, LPG, kerosene, and mixed fuels. The overall respiratory symptoms were observed in 13 percent of patients. Mixed fuel users experienced more respiratory symptoms (16.7 percent), followed by biomass (12.6 percent), stove (11.4 percent), and LPG (9.9 percent). Chronic bronchitis in chulla users was significantly higher than that in kerosene and LPG users (p less than 0.05). Dyspnea and postnasal drip were significantly higher in the women using mixed fuels. Smoking women who are also exposed to cooking fuels experienced respiratory symptoms more often than nonsmokers (33.3 percent vs 13 percent). 
Thrombolytic therapy in acute MI. Weighing the risks and benefits. The underlying cause of acute myocardial infarction can now be effectively treated with thrombolytic agents, thereby increasing myocardial salvage and reducing mortality. Clinicians should always be aware of the risk-to-benefit ratio in treating patients with thrombolytic agents and treat each patient on an individual basis. 
Specific release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IFN-gamma by human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes after autologous tumor stimulation. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) have been cultured from a variety of human tumors, and some melanoma TIL have demonstrated specific, MHC-restricted recognition of autologous tumor in short term lysis assays. The current study investigates cytokine release by TIL as an indicator of specific tumor recognition. We have identified two of four melanoma and one of seven breast carcinoma TIL cultures that specifically release granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma after autologous tumor stimulation. The other cultures either do not secrete cytokine or secrete cytokine in a nonspecific fashion. The amount of specific cytokine released is directly related to the number of TIL and stimulating tumor cells. Studies of TIL, from two melanoma patients, separated into CD4+ and CD8+ populations revealed that CD8+ cells were responsible for virtually all of the specific cytokine secretion, although both populations released cytokines when activated by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody. Specific cytokine release by CD8+ TIL was inhibited by anti-MHC class I mAb. Specific cytokine release was also detected from a CD4+ breast cancer TIL culture, and this was inhibited by anti-MHC class II mAb. The clinical significance of this specific mode of immune antitumor reactivity is currently under investigation. 
Study of 156 cases of polyhydramnios and congenital malformations in a series of 118,265 consecutive births. Polyhydramnios associated with congenital anomalies was studied over nine years in 118,265 consecutive pregnancies. The prevalence of this association was 1.32% (156 cases). A case-control study allowed the examination of genetic and environmental factors for the origin of polyhydramnios associated with congenital malformations. Diagnosis of polyhydramnios associated with congenital malformations was performed prenatally in 41% of the cases; 16% of the infants were stillborn. Fifty-five percent of the cases had more than one malformation, 13.4% of them had a chromosomal aberration, and 32% had multiple malformations that do not constitute a syndrome. There was an increase of consanguinity in the parents of our patients. The incidence of polyhydramnios and congenital anomalies in first-degree relatives was 3.8%, and first-degree relatives had more malformations than the controls had (8.3% vs 3.2%). Our study demonstrated the low capacity of a general prenatal screening program because the diagnosis of malformations associated with polyhydramnios was made in only 41% of the cases and only six of 21 chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed prenatally. We recommend the use of fetal chromosome analysis and careful ultrasonographic examination in every pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios. 
Mortality in acute cerebral infarction in young adults--a ten-year experience. We reviewed the one-month mortality among 213 patients aged fifteen to forty-five years (mean thirty-five) with acute cerebral infarction (CI) evaluated during the period July 1, 1977, to February 1, 1988. Atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) was diagnosed in 59 (27.7%) patients, 53 (24.9%) had non-atherosclerotic vasculopathies (NAV); 46 (21.6%) had cardioembolic infarcts (CEI). Hematologically related disorders were diagnosed in 30 (14.1%) patients; the cause of CI could not be established in 25 (11.7%) patients. Fourteen patients (9 men, 5 women, mean age 34.8 years), (6.6%) died within thirty days of their CI: 7 had CEI (7/46,15.2%); 4 had ACI (4/59, 6.7%); and 3 had NAV (3/53, 5.6%). Our data suggest that young patients with acute CI have a thirty-day mortality rate lower than older patients. Deaths were most common in patients with CEI. Brain edema and herniation accounted for 6 (43%) of the deaths. 
Effect of cell wall skeleton and monophosphoryl lipid A adjuvant on the immunogenicity of a murine B16 melanoma vaccine. We examined the effect of a new adjuvant consisting of purified mycobacterial cell wall skeleton (CWS) and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) on the immunogenicity of a murine melanoma vaccine. C57BL/6 mice were immunized to partially purified B16 melanoma vaccine given alone or together with different dose levels of adjuvant, or with saline or adjuvant alone. Humoral response, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), in vitro cytotoxicity, and tumor-protective immunity to melanoma were measured following three biweekly immunizations. The adjuvant potentiated the antibody response to some, but not all, melanoma antigens in a dose-dependent fashion. The adjuvant also potentiated cellular immunity as measured by in vitro cytotoxicity assays. No potentiation of tumor-protective immunity was detected. In comparison to Freund's complete adjuvant, cell wall skeleton plus monophosphoryl lipid A (CWS:MPL) induced fewer cutaneous toxic effects and stronger antibody and DTH responses but resulted in no greater in vitro cytotoxicity or tumor-protective immunity. Thus, the adjuvant had a selective and dose-dependent effect on humoral responses to vaccine immunization but did not potentiate a tumor-protective immunity to B16 melanoma. 
Histopathologic comparison between human oral squamous cell carcinomas and their xenografts in nude mice. Tumor portions were obtained from 11 oral squamous cell carcinomas and used to produce tumors in a xenogeneic gnotobiotic nude mouse model system. The tumors that developed were examined histologically. The cellular features and tumor growth patterns were compared between the original oral squamous cell carcinoma (T0) and the tumor that developed in the xenogeneic host (T1). The T1 tumors were more highly differentiated in comparison with the T0 tumors. The T1 tumors exhibited less cellular pleomorphism and a more uniform pattern of stratification. The cells in the T1 tumors exhibited an increased mitotic index but did not contain abnormal mitoses. The T1 tumors usually exhibited nodular growth patterns rather than the infiltrating pattern exhibited by the parenchyma of the T0 tumors. The desmoplastic reaction was markedly reduced in the T1 tumors. The results indicated that the gnotobiotic nude mouse model system either selects for or induces a more differentiated pattern of tumor growth than that found in the original human oral squamous cell carcinomas. 
Potential errors in pulse oximetry. II. Effects of changes in saturation and signal quality. The published studies of pulse oximeter performance under conditions of normal, high and low saturation, exercise, poor signal quality and cardiac arrhythmia are reviewed. Most pulse oximeters have an absolute mean error of less than 2% at normal saturation and perfusion; two-thirds have a standard deviation (SD) of less than 2%, and the remainder an SD of less than 3%. Some pulse oximeters tend to read 100% with fractional saturations of 97-98%. Pulse oximeters may be suitable hyperoxic alarms for neonates if the alarm limit chosen is directly validated for each device. Pulse oximeters are poorly calibrated at low saturations and are generally less accurate and less precise than at normal saturations; nearly 30% of 244 values reviewed were in error by more than 5% at saturations of less than 80%. Ear, nose and forehead probes respond more rapidly to rapid desaturation than finger probes, but are generally less accurate and less precise. Ear oximetry may be inaccurate during exercise. Low signal quality can result in failure to present a saturation reading, but data given with low signal quality warning messages are generally no less accurate than those without. Cardiac arrhythmias do not decrease accuracy of pulse oximeters so long as saturation readings are steady. 
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of proximal subclavian artery stenosis after left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery bypass surgery. A patient is described who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, through a brachial approach, of a high grade stenosis at the proximal portion of the left subclavian artery 1.5 years after coronary artery bypass grafting including left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery anastomosis. Symptoms of class IV angina, vertebrobasilar insufficiency and occupational arm claudication that developed after bypass surgery were promptly relieved after balloon dilation. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian artery can be performed safely and provides an alternative to carotid-subclavian or axillary-axillary bypass surgery for treatment of internal mammary artery graft malfunction. 
An analysis of the retrolabyrinthine vs. the retrosigmoid vestibular nerve section. Vestibular neurectomy is gaining widespread acceptance as a primary means of controlling medically refractory vertigo. However, debate continues over the adequacy of vestibular neurectomy within the cerebellopontine angle, long-term control, and the most appropriate surgical approach. To address these issues, we retrospectively reviewed 118 patients who underwent vestibular neurectomy between October 1984 and January 1988. Forty-two patients who underwent a retrolabyrinthine approach and 44 patients who underwent a retrosigmoid approach completed a written questionnaire and provided a recent audiogram. According to American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines, complete or substantial vertigo control was achieved and maintained in 95% of patients in both surgical groups. Hearing, tinnitus, and fullness results over the long term are variable. The advantages and disadvantages of the various vestibular neurectomy approaches will be detailed. On review of our results and surgical experience, we now prefer the retrosigmoid approach. 
Surgical repair of rectovaginal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease: transvaginal approach. The surgical management of rectovaginal fistulas complicating Crohn's disease has been associated with unacceptably high failure rates. We sought to modify the available surgical techniques to provide a solution to this challenging problem. Between December 1983 and January 1990, 14 patients with Crohn's disease underwent repair of a rectovaginal fistula. A modified transvaginal approach was employed by the authors. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed on all patients, either as the initial step in the staged management of intractable perianal disease or concurrent with the repair of the rectovaginal fistula. The fistula was completely eradicated in 13 of the 14 women and did not recur during the mean follow-up period of 55.0 months (range, 3-77 months). Intestinal continuity was reestablished in these 13 patients within 6 months after the initial fistula repair. One patient with a very low-lying fistula constituted our only failure. We have found the transvaginal method preferable to the transanal approach because of the relative ease in raising the vaginal flap as compared with a flap of fibrotic and inflamed anorectal mucosa. On the basis of this study, we conclude that a modified transvaginal approach is an effective method for repair of rectovaginal fistulas secondary to Crohn's disease. 
Effect of ischemia on protein synthesis in the septic liver. The effect of ischemia on hepatic protein synthesis during sepsis is not known, but is of clinical relevance, since hepatic blood flow decreases during the late phase of sepsis. In this study, synthesis of acute-phase proteins was measured in perfused livers of rats 16 hours after sham operation or cecal ligation and puncture. Livers from each group had 45 minutes of complete ischemia or control perfusion. Protein synthesis was measured during two hour perfusion after the ischemia or control period, by determining incorporation of 3H-leucine into total secreted trichloracetic acid precipitated proteins, immunoprecipitated complement component C3 and albumin and phosphotungstenate-precipitated alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Lactate, glutamine-oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels in the perfusate were measured during preischemic and postischemic perfusion. Tissue glutathione levels were measured at the end of the perfusion. Synthesis of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was increased by 100 per cent and albumin synthesis decreased by 46 per cent in septic livers, consistent with an acute-phase response and apparent downregulation of albumin synthesis during early sepsis. Synthesis rates were reduced by 50 to 60 per cent after ischemia in perfused livers from sham operated rats and 70 to 80 per cent in livers from septic rats. Hepatic production of interleukin-1 was not different between the groups during perfusion. GOT and GPT levels increased significantly during ischemia of both nonseptic and septic livers and rapidly returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Lactate levels were higher in perfusate of septic than of nonseptic livers before ischemia and increased further during ischemia. The results suggest that ischemia inhibits production of secreted hepatic proteins similarly in nonseptic and septic livers, but perhaps to a slightly greater extent in septic livers. 
A case of candidal umbilical granuloma. A case is reported of a 14-year-old boy with a mass arising from the umbilicus, which was a large, well-organized candidal granuloma. Cell markers showed normal numbers and distribution of peripheral T and B lymphocytes but there was no reaction to intradermal injection of Candida, suggesting a specific T-cell defect such as occurs in chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. 
Invasive treatment of pancreatic fluid collections with surgical and nonsurgical methods. Pancreatic fluid collections (PFC) can be drained surgically or nonsurgically with endoscopic or radiologic techniques. To define subgroups of patients with PFC who would benefit from the new modalities, we reviewed a period (1977 to 1990) during which both surgical and nonsurgical invasive techniques were available. Patients with phlegmon or necrosis at initial diagnosis were excluded. Sixty-five patients (35 male, 30 female) underwent 1 or more drainage procedures. A mean postprocedure follow-up of 10.2 months was available for 59 patients. Initial management was nonsurgical in 80% of patients. Procedures in patients with follow-up comprised invasive nonsurgical drainage (n = 25), invasive nonsurgical drainage plus surgery (n = 22), and surgery only (n = 12). Results for each group, respectively, were: morbidity, 20%, 20%, and 24%; mortality, 8%, 5%, and 0%; and successful drainage, 92%, 82%, and 83%. The choice of management appeared to be based on etiology and radiologic characteristics. Patients with nonalcohol- and nonbiliary-associated pancreatitis without a radiographically defined wall were more common in the invasive nonsurgical group and were successfully treated without surgery. Nonsurgical invasive techniques are efficacious in the treatment of PFC in this subgroup of patients. 
Haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome: false positive reaction with a rotavirus latex agglutination test. A stool sample from a child with haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome gave a positive reaction with the RotaScreen latex agglutination test in the absence of other evidence of rotavirus infection. When this test is performed on bloody specimens, positive reactions should be interpreted with caution and confirmed by other means. 
Chronic streptozotocin diabetes in rats facilitates the acute stress response without altering pituitary or adrenal responsiveness to secretagogues. We have used streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats to determine whether this represents a sustained stimulus to the adrenocortical system and whether STZ-diabetic rats are able to mount an acute stress response. Furthermore, we compared pituitary responsiveness to CRF and/or arginine vasopressin, and adrenal responsiveness to ACTH in STZ- vs. vehicle-treated rats. We also compared the efficacy of dexamethasone inhibitory feedback in STZ-diabetic and control rats. Our results show that STZ-treated rats chronically hypersecrete corticosterone (B) as evidenced by their decreased thymus weights, their increased urinary B excretion, and their elevated mean plasma B levels during the light hours of the day. Despite the evidence for sustained hypersecretion of B, STZ-treated rats showed greater and more prolonged ACTH and B responses to the acute stress of histamine injection. However, when tested separately, neither pituitary nor adrenal responsiveness to their secretagogues were increased in STZ-diabetic compared to control rats. Dexamethasone inhibition of stress-induced B secretion was tested using two different paradigms: pentobarbital-anesthetized rats were given iv injections of acid saline, and awake rats were given ip injections of histamine. In both experiments the STZ-treated rats were relatively resistant to glucocorticoid inhibition of stress responses. This finding, taken together with the exaggerated ACTH and B responses to stress, strongly suggests that the facilitatory effects of chronic STZ-diabetes are a consequence of changes in sensitivity of central neural components of the adrenocortical system to stimulatory and/or inhibitory inputs, in conjunction with changes in glucocorticoid feedback sensitivity. 
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome following bone marrow transplantation in adults for hematologic malignancies. One hundred and sixty eight adult patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and other hematologic malignancies who underwent autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were investigated for the subsequent development of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). All patients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. When examined at 3-month intervals for the first year post-BMT, all patients had uniform measurements of hematocrit (Hct) and serum creatinine. Sixteen patients who initially exhibited Hct and creatinine values that were normal range for the BMT populations developed a sudden decrease in Hct and increase in creatinine between 3 and 11 months post-BMT and fulfilled the clinical and laboratory criteria for HUS. None of these patients had known active cytomegalovirus infection, graft-versus-host disease, or cyclosporine administration. The degree of decrease in Hct and creatinine elevation ranged from solely laboratory abnormalities to a clinically significant syndrome. Twelve of the 16 patients developed acute clinical complications of congestive heart failure, hypertension (HTN), or peripheral edema. Twelve patients required red blood cell support, whereas only four patients required platelet transfusions. Both hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia have resolved in virtually all cases. At a mean follow up of 18 months postdiagnosis, creatinine elevations have persisted along with HTN. All patients have survived without life-threatening long-term sequelae. With the increasing use of BMT as a curative modality for patients with hematologic malignancies, it becomes important to prospectively monitor patients for the development of HUS and its potential long-term impact on renal function. 
Hemorrhagic shock and bacterial translocation in a swine model. Bacterial translocation is proposed as an explanation for sepsis associated with hemorrhagic shock. This study attempted to document these events in a large animal model. Male swine were randomly assigned to control (n = 10) or experimental (n = 10) groups. Animals were anaesthetized, and the bladder, portal vein, and a mesenteric lymphatic vessel cannulated. Experimental animals were bled 40% of blood volume. Over the next six hours maintenance fluids were given, and cultures of portal blood and mesenteric lymph taken. Before the swine were killed, cultures were taken from portal and systemic blood, mesenteric lymph, and lymph nodes, and a portion of terminal ileum was resected for histologic study. Experimental animals experienced significant shock as demonstrated by changes in hemodynamic and biochemical variables. Cultures and histologic examination of the terminal ileum showed no significant difference between control and experimental animals. In an unresuscitated swine model, significant bacterial translocation was not demonstrated within six hours of hemorrhagic shock. 
Beta-Lactam-beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations are active in experimental endocarditis caused by beta-lactamase-producing oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Optimal therapeutic strategies for serious infections caused by borderline and heterotypic oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA and ORSA) strains have not been fully characterized. Recent evidence suggests that the dominant penicillin-binding protein of ORSA strains (PBP 2a) shows good affinity for ampicillin and that these strains commonly produce beta-lactamase. Therefore, we compared the in vivo efficacy of the combination of ampicillin plus sulbactam with that of vancomycin against ORSA strains. Also, the moderate resistance of BORSA strains appears to be attributable mainly to the hyperproduction of beta-lactamase. Therefore, we also studied the in vivo efficacy of ampicillin plus sulbactam against such organisms. Experimental aortic endocarditis was induced in rabbits by the following three strains: beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strain VP-986, beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain 67-0, and its beta-lactamase-negative clone. In animals with BORSA endocarditis, ampicillin plus sulbactam and oxacillin were highly effective in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities, with each being significantly better than either ampicillin alone or no therapy. In animals with endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain, ampicillin plus sulbactam was significantly better at reducing mean vegetation bacterial densities than the other regimens. For endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-negative ORSA clone, ampicillin was better than vancomycin in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities. These data show that infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strains respond therapeutically in a manner similar to that of infections caused by oxacillin-susceptible strains, with both oxacillin and ampicillin plus sulbactam being highly efficacious. 
Management of solitary pulmonary nodules. The solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN), a single intrapulmonary spherical lesion that is fairly well circumscribed, is a common clinical problem. About half of SPNs seen in clinical practice are malignant, usually bronchogenic carcinomas. Some nodules are primary tumors of other kinds or metastatic. Virtually all benign SPNs are tuberculous or fungal granulomas. The standard management of the SPN of unknown cause is prompt surgical removal unless benignity is established by prior chest roentgenograms showing that the nodule has been stable (i.e., showing no growth) for 2 years or by the presence of a "benign" pattern of calcification. Less universally accepted criteria for benignity include (1) transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy (TNAB) showing a specific benign process, and (2) patient's age under 30 to 35 years. Bronchoscopy has a low diagnostic yield, particularly for benign nodules. SPNs usually grow at constant rates, expressed as the "doubling time" (DT). A nodule with a DT between 20 and 400 days is usually malignant. Benign nodules usually have a DT greater than 400 days. The prospective determination of DT by serial chest roentgenograms (the "wait and watch" strategy) is widely criticized but has clinical utility in special circumstances, particularly if the likelihood of malignancy is low and/or the anticipated surgical mortality is high. The presence and pattern of calcification are best shown by high-resolution thin-section computed tomography (CT). Diffuse, laminated, central or "popcorn" patterns of calcification indicate benignity. An eccentric calcium deposit or a stippled pattern does not rule out malignancy. CT densitometry will often show "occult" calcification in nodules that show no direct visual evidence of calcium deposition. The characteristics of the edge of the nodule correlate with the likelihood of malignancy. Nodules with irregular or spiculated margins are almost always malignant. The probability that the nodule is malignant (pCA) is related to the age of the patient, the diameter of the nodule, the amount of tobacco smoke inhalation, the overall prevalence of malignancy in SPNs, the nature of the edge of the lesion, and the presence or absence of occult calcification. It is possible by Bayesian techniques to combine these factors to calculate a more precise and comprehensive prediction of pCA in any given nodule. The 5-year survival after nodule resection depends on the size of the nodule at the time of surgery; it may be as high as 80% with nodules that are 1 cm in diameter. Lymph node involvement is uncommon with small tumors, and many authorities question the need for CT staging in such cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Stroke from other etiologies masquerading as migraine-stroke. There has been a recent increase in the number of studies dealing with migraine-stroke. I describe five patients in whom migraine-stroke was the clinical diagnosis but in whom the subsequent clinical events or autopsy showed a different mechanism for the cerebral infarction. Three patients had arterial dissection (one proven at autopsy), one had marantic endocarditis that had been missed on two echocardiograms (proven at autopsy), and one had generalized atherosclerosis and diabetes. These patients demonstrate that important and different etiologies may produce what seems to be the migraine-stroke syndrome. The result may be failure to recognize specific therapeutic measures that could have vitally important benefit to the patient. 
Early loss of neurogenic inflammation in the human diabetic foot. 1. Neurogenic inflammation, mediated by nociceptor C fibres, is part of the acute neurovascular response to injury producing the axon reflex flare. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure the flare response induced by the electrophoresis, at various current strengths, of a ring of acetylcholine solution into dorsal foot skin. 2. Nineteen control subjects and 52 long-duration insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetic patients of similar age (20 without complications; 19 with laser-treated retinopathy; 13 with reduced vibration perception and retinopathy) were studied in order to investigate the possible attenuation of this defence mechanism in diabetes. 3. The maximal (1 mA) flare response [control median (interquartile range): 1.55 (1.16-2.06) arbitrary units] was reduced greatly in neuropathic patients [0.37 (0.24-0.66) arbitrary units; P less than or equal to 0.001 with respect to all other groups], especially those with a previous history of foot ulceration. The flare was also reduced in some patients with retinopathy alone [1.06 (0.56-1.27) arbitrary units; P less than 0.005 with respect to control subjects]. 4. No rightward shift of the curve of hyperaemic response plotted against current strength was found, suggesting that the abnormal response was due to axonal loss rather than to dysfunction. 5. Neurogenic inflammation, mediated by small pain fibres, was markedly impaired in a group of diabetic patients at risk of foot ulceration. Furthermore, impairment of this nociceptor C fibre response can develop before clinical large-fibre neuropathy and could itself predispose to foot complications. 
Sex differences in the perception of noxious heat stimuli. This study compared pain perception in young male and female subjects, using experimental noxious heat stimuli. During 2 sessions, each of 40 subjects rated the magnitude of 120 heat stimuli, ranging from 45 degrees C to 50 degrees C. The study included a comparison of visual analogue and magnitude matching rating procedures, as well as a test of simulated analgesia, in which the range of stimuli presented during the 2 experimental sessions was shifted by 1 degree C. We found that females rated noxious heat stimuli as more intense than did males, independent of the gender of the experimenter or the type of rating scale. In addition, the data suggest that females discriminate among the painful heat intensities better than males. For example, female subjects showed significant between-session discrimination of noxious heat stimuli, while male subjects did not, and females produced steeper within-session stimulus-response functions than did males. These observed differences in nociceptive discrimination between males and females indicate that the sex-related variation in pain perception is probably related to sensory factors rather than differences in attitude or emotional response. 
Ridogrel in the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The safety of the combination of heparin and ridogrel therapy and its antiplatelet efficacy was examined in the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). In 32 patients without known aspirin intake for 10 days before PTCA, therapy with ridogrel (300-mg intravenous bolus) was begun just before PTCA and continued orally at a dose of 300 mg twice daily until discharge. Heparin was administered as a 10,000 IU bolus dose before PTCA and followed by an intravenous infusion at a rate of 1,000 IU/hour for 24 hours. Bleeding problems at the arterial entry site occurred in 13 patients, which required a blood transfusion in only 2 patients. One patient underwent emergency bypass surgery without specific problems of hemostasis. Ridogrel virtually eliminated thromboxane B2 from the serum (29,990 +/- 6,555 pg/0.1 ml before vs 63 +/- 7 pg/0.1 ml at 2 hours after ridogrel), with a concomitant increase in serum 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (511 +/- 34 pg/0.1 ml before vs 1,190 +/- 146 pg/0.1 ml at 24 hours after ridogrel). There were no acute reocclusions in the ridogrel-treated patients, whereas acute reocclusions occurred in 5.6% of the patients taking the standard aspirin + heparin regimen during the same period. Furthermore, at 6-month clinical follow-up patients treated with ridogrel compared favorably with those receiving standard treatment. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of white clot syndrome. This study describes our experience with 12 patients with white clot syndrome encountered during a recent 36-month period. The diagnosis was based on the following criteria: (1) development of thrombocytopenia of less than 100,000/mm3 during administration of heparin therapy, (2) normalization of the platelet count after an interruption in heparin therapy, (3) exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia, (4) a positive heparin-induced platelet aggregation test, (5) detection of white clots on pathologic examination, and (6) the presence of thrombotic complications. Of 2,500 patients who received heparin therapy, 12 (0.48%) developed white clot syndrome. Various indications, routes of administration, and types of heparin were implicated. The mean platelet nadir was 26,900/mm3, and the mean time to onset of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was 5 days. Thrombotic complications included arterial occlusions of the legs in 11 patients, deep vein thrombosis of the legs in 9 patients (4 had pulmonary embolism), and combined arterial and venous thrombosis in 8 patients. Treatment strategies included discontinuation of heparin in all patients and intravenous infusion of dextran, followed by arterial thrombectomy in four patients, urokinase therapy in two patients for arterial complications, and insertion of Greenfield filters in six patients. All patients were given warfarin. The mortality rate was 25% and the morbidity rate was 50%. An initial platelet count should be obtained on all patients prior to receiving heparin, followed by repeat platelet counts every 2 to 3 days. Once thrombocytopenia or thrombosis is diagnosed, heparin should be discontinued and other methods of therapy considered. 
Lower urinary tract reconstruction following cystectomy: experience and results in 126 patients using the Kock ileal reservoir with bilateral ureteroileal urethrostomy. Between May 1986 and February 1990, 126 consecutive men underwent lower urinary tract reconstruction by means of bilateral ureteroileal urethrostomy using a Kock ileal reservoir. The early complication rate was 11.1%. Late complications requiring rehospitalization or reoperation have been surprisingly few: 1 for prolapse of the afferent antirefluxing nipple valve, 1 for calculi and 4 for artificial urinary sphincter placement due to unsatisfactory continence. Good continence has been achieved in 94% of the patients during the day and in 84% at night. Tumor recurred in the pelvis in 5 patients, with 4 requiring cutaneous urinary diversion. All patients had progression or died of metastatic disease. Our experience has yielded extraordinary results in terms of patient acceptance with few late complications or need for reoperation. 
Functional results after total or near total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation. Locally advanced tongue cancer is a devastating disease for which there are limited therapeutic options that will result in a high rate of cure while preserving function. To determine the oncologic effectiveness of total or near total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation and the possibility of speech and swallowing rehabilitation following treatment, we reviewed our experience with 27 patients treated between 1982 and 1989. Twenty-four patients were eligible for 2-year follow-up and their disease-specific survival was 51%. Swallowing was achieved initially in 18 patients (67%), while 12 had successful long-term deglutition (44%). Oral communication was accomplished in 25 patients (92%). Significant aspiration occurred in three patients and was severe enough to require interval laryngectomy in two patients. The role of laryngeal suspension, palatal augmentation prosthesis, and videofluoroscopy as rehabilitation adjuncts for the total glossectomy patient are described. 
Retrospective analysis of the incidence of pulmonary disease in hypogammaglobulinemia. To determine the best predictors of chronic pulmonary disease in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, we evaluated the clinical records, chest x-ray films, and pulmonary function tests of 10 patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) followed for a mean of 12.5 years, and 12 patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) followed for a mean of 10.5 years. These patients, most of whom were treated with intramuscular gamma globulin and long-term oral antibiotics, had very few pneumonias after diagnosis. The patients with XLA had 0.10 pneumonias per treatment year, and the patients with CVID had 0.18 pneumonias per treatment year. Seven of the 10 patients with XLA had normal chest x-ray films 8 to 15 years after diagnosis, and none had bronchiectasis. Pulmonary disease was more common and more severe in the group with CVID, but five patients in this group also had normal chest x-ray films after long follow-up. In the entire group of 22 patients, nine of the 10 patients with abnormal chest x-ray films on most recent evaluation already had pulmonary disease at the initial visit (p = 0.00002). These studies indicate that the best predictors of good pulmonary function in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia are early diagnosis and good compliance with gamma globulin replacement therapy and oral antibiotics. 
Stage I seminoma of the testis. Adjuvant radiotherapy or surveillance? Lately the role of radiotherapy in stage I seminoma of the testis has been questioned by some authors who reported on a "surveillance" strategy for these patients. Since 1980, 124 patients with seminoma of the testis have been referred to this institution; 97 of 116 patients analysed presented with stage I disease and 10 of these had elevated levels of beta HCG. A total of 64 patients were given radiotherapy after orchiectomy and 33 entered a surveillance protocol. After a median follow-up of 48 months, 3 patients in the surveillance group relapsed after 5, 13 and 49 months and 2 of the irradiated patients did so after 25 and 33 months. Elevation of beta HCG was not significant because none of these patients showed progression. A low rate of progression and excellent survival are associated with standard treatment (orchiectomy and radiotherapy) and good results have been achieved with chemotherapy in cases of relapse. A surveillance policy is not recommended in stage I seminoma because of its slower growth compared with non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT), the absence of a specific tumour marker, the 10% risk of occult metastases and the 3-fold higher progression rate compared with irradiated patients. We suggest the use of a reduced dosage and radiation field. 
Remodeling of ventricular conduction pathways in healed canine infarct border zones. Remodeling of myocyte interconnections may be an important determinant of ventricular tachycardia in regions bordering healed infarcts. We used quantitative electron microscopy to characterize the distribution of gap junctions in 10 canine left ventricles 3-10 wk after coronary occlusion. In three normal canine left ventricles analyzed ultrastructurally, myocardial gap junctions were distributed anisotropically; gap junction profile length was significantly greater in the transverse than in longitudinal planes of section. In infarct border zone tissues, the normal anisotropic distribution was completely abolished and fewer gap junctions per unit intercalated disk length were observed. Analysis of individual gap junction profile length distributions revealed selective disruption of the largest gap junctions that collectively comprised only 9.6% of total junction profiles, but encompassed nearly 40% of aggregate gap junction length in the transverse plane of section. Three-dimensional reconstructions of myocyte interconnections by high resolution quantitative light microscopy of serial sections demonstrated a reduction in the number of cells connected by intercalated disks to a single myocyte from 11.2 +/- 1.0 in normal myocardium to 6.5 +/- 1.3 in border zone tissues (P less than 0.001). Connections of cells in primarily side-to-side apposition were reduced by 75%, whereas primarily end-to-end connections were reduced by only 22% (P less than 0.05). These alterations would disproportionately enhance axial resistivity in the transverse direction, potentially contributing to development of reentrant arrhythmias. 
Bilateral impairment of somesthetically mediated object recognition in humans Thirty adult patients (six in each of five groups--neurologically normal, lacunar infarct-related hemiparesis, unilateral thalamic lacunar infarction, right cortical infarction with mild left hemineglect, and extensive right cortical infarction with severe left hemineglect) were asked to perform various tasks that encompassed basic and intermediate somatosensory functions and tactile and visual object recognition. Patients with thalamic and cortical infarctions had severe impairment of contralateral hand-mediated somatosensory functions in all three categories of somesthetic tasks, although patients with cortical infarction were more impaired on the object recognition task than were patients with thalamic infarction. Patients with extensive damage to the right hemisphere and severe left hemineglect also had impairment of somesthetically mediated object recognition in the ipsilateral hand despite normal basic and intermediate somatosensory function and visually mediated object recognition analogous to unilateral tactile agnosia. All other groups had normal ipsilateral tactile object recognition. 
Single-lung transplantation with atrial septal defect repair for Eisenmenger's syndrome. Heart-lung transplantation has been used successfully for patients with pulmonary vascular disease but its application has been very limited due to the scarcity of donors. We report a patient with Eisenmenger's syndrome who underwent right single-lung transplantation with closure of atrial septal defect; postoperative convalescence was uneventful. Serial magnetic resonance imaging examinations demonstrate improved right heart function. 
Toxic shock syndrome associated with pharyngitis and submandibular space abscess. Toxic shock syndrome continues to be encountered more frequently with the head and neck areas as sources of the toxin. In head and neck surgery practice it is most commonly noted following nasal packing. An unusual case associated with staphylococcal pharyngitis and spontaneous submandibular space abscess is reported and the literature concerning the subject is reviewed. Treatment is eradication of the infective focus, aggressive support of vital functions, and parenteral antistaphylococcal antibiotics. 
Hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia: specific findings at dynamic contrast-enhanced US with carbon dioxide microbubbles. Dynamic contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) with intraarterial infusion of carbon dioxide microbubbles was performed for four cases of histologically proved focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in four patients and for 167 cases of various hepatic nodules in 144 patients. No complications due to dynamic US were observed in any of the 148 patients. All FNH nodules were less than 3 cm in diameter. Consistent specific findings of FNH were not obtained with US, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, radiocolloid scanning, or angiography in the four cases of FNH. In contrast, the characteristic vascular pattern (ie, early central hypervascular supply with centrifugal filling to the periphery at the arterial phase and a uniform or lobulated dense stain at the capillary phase) was observed in all four cases of FNH with dynamic US. This vascular pattern demonstrated in FNH with dynamic US was not seen in any of the 167 hepatic nodules, including 44 small hepatocellular carcinomas less than 3 cm in diameter. Therefore, the newly developed, dynamic contrast-enhanced US technique seems to be extremely sensitive and specific for diagnosing FNH and is useful in the differentiation of FNH from other hepatic tumors, especially hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Expression of mdr-1/P-glycoprotein in human neuroblastoma. Increased expression of the mdr-1 gene encoding the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein is a well-established mediator of acquired drug resistance in vitro, and a similar role has been hypothesized in vivo in human malignancy. Because expression of mdr-1 is increased in neuroblastoma cell lines by differentiating agents, the authors hypothesized a similar correlation with differentiation in vivo in neuroblastomas. In 12 tumors from 11 patients, total RNA analysis demonstrated no correlation with differentiation, but a correlation could be detected in the cell-based methods of analysis. The very primitive 'stroma'-poor, poorly differentiated neuroblastomas had low levels of mdr-1/P-glycoprotein. The intermediate grades had higher levels of expression and although heterogeneity of differentiation appeared within these tumors, both primitive and more differentiated cells expressed the gene at comparable levels within the tumor. One very well-differentiated neuroblastoma, a ganglioneuroma, had no detectable expression in the neurofibrillary material, but demonstrated expression in adjacent large ganglionic cells. Thus mdr-1/P-glycoprotein expression increased with increasing differentiation among tumors, and was present in ganglionic cells in the most well-differentiated tumor. The three tumors with the highest levels of expression were obtained from patients who received preoperative chemotherapy. 
Pathophysiological basis for noninvasive functional evaluation of coronary stenosis. A number of tests are used for the noninvasive detection of coronary stenosis, which results from the combination of different stimuli (exercise, pacing, dobutamine, dipyridamole, etc.) and different signals and methodologies (ECG, echocardiography, scintigraphy). In this article, the theoretical assumptions for and the methodological limitations of the functional evaluation of the degree of coronary stenosis are considered within the framework of pathophysiology. In particular, the issues of dilating coronary circulation by either increasing myocardial O2 demand or infusing dipyridamole and of assessing coronary reserve by either flow- or ischemia-related techniques are examined. In addition, the hypotheses of a physiological blood steal during exercise, a decrement of exercise ischemic threshold secondary to additional pharmacological vasodilation, and coronary vasospasm in Prinzmetal's angina patients, following the sequence dipyridamole-aminophylline, are discussed on the basis of preliminary studies. 
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Systemic and regional hemodynamics in rats and humans. The systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been investigated using different experimental methods (pulsed Doppler, radioactive microspheres), either in rats (normotensive NT or genetically hypertensive SHRs) or in humans (healthy volunteers or patients with congestive heart failure CHF). All ACEIs decreased systemic vascular resistance but the profile of their peripheral vasodilating properties was heterogeneous. ACEI-induced vasodilation primarily affected the kidney in rats and in humans and this effect was accompanied by a strong and consistent increase in renal blood flow. This occurred even at non-hypotensive doses in SHRs and CHF patients and resulted in a favorable redistribution of cardiac output towards the kidney. In the muscular vascular bed, ACEIs also decreased local vascular resistance in rats and in humans, whether normotensive or hypertensive. In humans, this vasodilation affected both the arterioles and the large conductance vessels, more markedly in CHF patients than in normotensive subjects. Muscular blood flow was increased and a favorable redistribution of cardiac output towards the muscle occurred. Cerebral blood flow in SHRs and carotid blood flow in humans were augmented, whereas hepatosplanchnic blood flow was increased in rats but not modified in humans. There was no major difference between the regional vasodilating profiles of the different ACEIs, but captopril was somewhat less active at the muscular level. In conclusion, ACEI-induced regional vasodilation is heterogeneous, preferentially affecting the kidney and the muscle. In the latter, both arterioles and large conductance vessels are dilated. 
Milk-induced malabsorption in malnourished African patients. Fifty malnourished rural African patients were randomly assigned to whole milk (50 g lactose/L), acidified milk (24 g lactose/L), or a commercial lactose-free diet (LFD) as a constant nasogastric infusion for 3 d, starting at 2 L/d and increasing to 3 L/d if tolerated. During the first 2 d mild symptoms of intolerance developed in 63% of patients on whole milk, 37% on acidified milk, and 54% on LFD whereas severe intolerance, necessitating withdrawal, was encountered in 22% receiving whole milk and none receiving LFD. Stool weights and fat excretion on day 3 were greater (P less than 0.02) in the remaining milk-fed patients whereas nitrogen balance remained strongly positive in all three groups. Eighty-seven percent of patients were methane producers, and high excretion rates were associated with better milk tolerance. The results suggest that although undiluted cow milk will not form a suitable tube feed for malnourished African patients, products such as acidified milk may prove cost effective. 
Transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage: a reappraisal 25 years after its introduction. Most cerclage operations for cervical insufficiency are performed transvaginally. The transabdominal route is beneficial in treating patients with cervices that are either extremely short, congenitally deformed, deeply lacerated, or markedly scarred because of previously failed transvaginal cerclage procedures. The average gestational age at surgery was 11.5 weeks and the operation was performed after early ultrasonographic verification of fetal viability. Patients with advanced cervical effacement or dilatation in the second trimester were excluded. A 5 mm wide Mersilene band was applied in an avascular space above the junction of the cervix and the uterine isthmus without dissection or tunneling among broad ligament vessels. This simplified surgical approach resulted in little operative blood loss (mean, 75 ml; range, 50 to 200 ml). After transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage, 21 pregnancies in 20 patients resulted in 18 term births, one premature birth with favorable outcome, and two early fetal deaths (90% salvage rate). A review of the world literature indicated 130 pregnancies with transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage during pregnancy and a cumulative success rate of 89%. Preconceptional transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage was reported in 30 pregnancies with an overall fetal survival rate of 81%. A survey of specialists in maternal-fetal medicine indicated an increasing interest and familiarity with transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage since its introduction more than two decades ago although this procedure is still not widely applied in obstetric practice. 
The incidence of attempted CPR in nursing homes. We studied the frequency with which cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is attempted on residents of American nursing homes. Each author (all members of the Clinical Practice Committee of the American Geriatrics Society) completed a questionnaire in 1989 about policy and practice regarding CPR during 1988 in each of three to seven nursing homes, by questioning the medical or nursing director or the administrator. Because of the vagaries of nursing home record-keeping, data from some homes were allowed when they were "accurate to within 10%." Data from 58 nursing homes, totalling 10,836 bed-years were available. In 33 of these homes, accounting for 5,425 bed-years, CPR was never attempted. CPR was more likely to be foregone in nursing homes with religious affiliation than in nursing homes without (13 of 17 vs 18 of 38; chi 2 = 4.0; P less than 0.05). Religious affiliation was unknown for three nursing homes. Academic affiliation (10 of 16 vs 20 of 37 in non-affiliated nursing homes) and non-profit status (14 of 19 vs 16 of 23 in for-profit nursing homes) did not significantly affect the likelihood that CPR would never be used. In 31 of 54 nursing homes with explicit do not resuscitate (DNR) policies, CPR was never performed, compared to 2 of 4 homes without such policies. For nursing homes with complete data, there were 1,196 deaths in 32 facilities where CPR was never attempted compared to 1,294 deaths for 24 nursing homes with CPR. For 22 nursing homes without CPR, there were 2,172 emergency room transfers compared to 1,363 emergency room transfers in 18 nursing homes where CPR was attempted. 
High-dose cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide followed by autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation for patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease. Between February 1986 and March 1990, 56 patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide (CBV) received an autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT) rather than an autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) because each patient had a marrow abnormality, either hypocellularity or tumor involvement. At least 6.5 x 10(9) mononuclear cells/kg patient weight were collected from the peripheral blood of each patient, cyropreserved, and returned intravenously following CBV administration. Three patients had an early death 2, 22, and 25 days after PSCT. The actuarial event-free survival for these 56 patients at 3 years was 37% and was at least as good as that reported for relapsed Hodgkin's disease patients treated with CBV and ABMT. The 30 patients who had no marrow metastases at the time of PSC harvesting had an actuarial event-free survival of 47%, while those 26 patients with marrow metastases had a significantly different actuarial event-free survival of 27% (P = .02). CBV and PSCT for patients with relapsed Hodgkin's diseases who have marrow hypocellularity in traditional harvest sites or histopathologic evidence of BM metastases can result in long-term event-free survival. 
Benign and malignant adrenal masses: CT distinction with attenuation coefficients, size, and observer analysis. In a retrospective study of adrenal masses evaluated with computed tomography (CT), lesion x-ray attenuation was compared with size and radiologists' interpretations in discriminating benign lesions from malignant ones. Unenhanced CT attenuation coefficient and size were analyzed electronically in 55 patients with 66 adrenal masses. There were 38 nonhyperfunctioning adenomas in 33 patients and 28 malignant masses in 22 patients. Primary extraadrenal malignancies were present in 45 of the 55 patients. Three blinded readers characterized the adrenal masses using a seven-point scale of certainty. Results were subjected to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The mean CT attenuation coefficient for benign adrenal masses was -2.2 HU +/- 16.0 and was significantly different from the mean for malignant lesions (28.9 HU +/- 10.6). The area under the ROC curve for CT attenuation coefficients (0.91 +/- 0.04) was significantly larger than that for lesion size (0.84 +/- 0.05) or best observer interpretation (0.84 +/- 0.05). A threshold CT attenuation value of 0 HU had a sensitivity-to-specificity ratio of 47%:100% for characterizing benign adrenal masses, whereas a threshold attenuation of 10 HU had a ratio of 79%:96%. 
Inactive subretinal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration. Inactive subretinal new vessels (SRNVs), showing minimal leakage by fluorescein angiography and little progression, were observed in 15 eyes of 12 patients with age-related macular degeneration. In 8 (57%) of 14 eyes followed for longer than 6 months, the new vessels involuted and produced circumscribed areas of retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris atrophy; 6 (43%) showed a further decrease in the fluorescein leakage during the follow-up period (average, 30.1 months). None of the new vessels organized into an exudative fibrovascular scar. Visual acuity was improved or unchanged during the entire follow-up period in 12 (86%) eyes and deteriorated in 2 (14%). Nine patients (75%) were 80 years of age or older; three (25%) were between 65 and 70 years of age. These observations suggested that SRNV showing minimal fluorescein leakage, particularly when it occurs in patients older than 80 years, do not require photocoagulation because they are usually self-limited. 
Patterns of mortality in sickle cell disease in the United Kingdom. Eighteen of 384 patients entered on the Brent sickle cell disease register died between 1974 and 1989, a mortality of one per 128 years of follow up. Two children died from acute splenic sequestration and a third died from fulminant pneumococcal septicaemia: none was taking prophylactic penicillin. Acute chest syndrome was the cause of death in eight young adults and one child. Three deaths occurred after surgery. Cerebrovascular accidents contributed to the cause of death in three cases and there were two sudden unexplained deaths. Ten of the deaths occurred at home or within 24 hours of admission to hospital. Post mortem examinations were made in 14 cases, but the histological appearances of acute chest syndrome were often not recognised. In most cases for whom information was available, the cause of death (chest syndrome, pneumococcal sepsis, postoperative complications) could have been prevented. 
The effect of theophylline on hypoxic, hypercapnic hamster diaphragm muscle in vitro. Hypoxic, hypercapnic acidosis (HHA) decreases tension and enhances fatigue in hamster diaphragm in vitro. We hypothesized that theophylline would decrease the harmful effect of HHA. Hamster diaphragm strips were studied in Krebs solution aerated with 21% O2 and 12% CO2. The force-frequency responses and the tension and relaxation of brief, submaximal contractions were studied. Mild fatigue was produced by a series of 45 submaximal contractions, after which recovery of force was followed for 15 min. Theophylline (0.55 mM) was added at the time of exposure to HHA (early theophylline) in half the strips and at the end of the fatigue run (late theophylline) in the others. In contrast to our hypothesis, early theophylline had a limited effect on force production in unfatigued HHA diaphragm strips and resulted in lower force production in the recovery period. Late theophylline improved force in the recovery period for low-frequency contractions. Thus the effect of theophylline in the setting of HHA depended on the time it was added and was beneficial only if added after the muscle stopped contracting. 
Congenital keratinizing desquamative squamous epithelium of the entire urinary tract. We report the clinical and pathological findings of a case of congenital desquamative squamous epithelium of the entire urinary tract associated with body dysmorphism. This entity has not been described previously in the literature. 
Seminal polyamines as agents of cervical carcinoma: production of aneuploidy in squamous epithelium. The effects of several polyamines found in seminal fluid on the cell cycle and ploidy of three cervical cell lines and of primary epithelial cells cultured from cervical biopsy specimens were monitored by fluorescent flow cytometry. The rate of cell growth did not change but there were indications of either hypodiploidy or hyperdiploidy in some cultures at certain concentrations of spermine and spermidine. An interaction of exogenous polyamines with the DNA of cervical cells was shown to occur, leading to changes in ploidy with, perhaps, the potential to induce or promote dysplasia. 
Intracellular pH in rat resistance arteries during the development of experimental hypertension. 1. In order to examine the effects of experimental hypertension on intracellular pH in mesenteric resistance arteries, intracellular pH was measured in mesenteric resistance arteries from rats with coarctation 72 h, 9 days and 28 days after the aorta was partially constricted between the origins of the renal arteries. Carotid arterial pressure was significantly raised at all time points. 2. Second-order mesenteric resistance arteries were mounted in a myograph and were loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. Morphological measurements demonstrated that arteries from rats with coarctation had an increased media volume at 9 days and at 28 days compared with vessels from sham-operated control animals, but this was only statistically significant at 28 days. 3. Resting intracellular pH was not significantly different at any time point in arteries from rats with coarctation compared with control animals, although there was a rise in intracellular pH in both groups of rats between 72 h and 9 days. The application of 4,4-di-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid produced a fall in intracellular pH which was significantly greater in the sham-operated rats at 9 days; this difference was not found at 28 days. Blockade of Na+/H+ exchange with 60 mumol/l ethylisopropylamiloride led to a similar fall in intracellular pH in both groups of rats at 9 days but a significantly greater fall in intracellular pH in arteries of rats with coarctation at 28 days. Activation with noradrenaline (10 mumol/l) induced acid changes in intracellular pH that were similar in both groups of rats. 
Prognostic factors in Japanese patients with colorectal cancer: the significance of large bowel obstruction--univariate and multivariate analyses. In order to define prognostic factors in colorectal carcinoma, univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out on data from 113 Japanese patients treated in a typical general hospital in Japan. In the univariate analysis, a poor prognosis was seen in those with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, in tumors that perforated the visceral peritoneum or that invaded directly other organs or structures (T4), in metastasis to the nodes along the main vascular pedicle (N3), in lymphatic permeation, in blood vessel invasion, in peritoneal dissemination, in Dukes C stage, and in those with lesions presenting with large bowel obstruction. Of these, only lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination had an independent prognostic significance when a multivariate Cox analysis was performed. The significant risk factors related to an obstructing tumor were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The significant variables were patient's age, nodal involvement and peritoneal dissemination. Since lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination proved significant in both multivariate analyses, we propose that the presence of large bowel obstruction is not an independent prognostic factor in patients with colorectal carcinoma. In poor-risk patients who have an obstructing tumor, a staged operation should be attempted for definitive curative surgery. 
Incremental spinal anaesthesia using a 32-gauge catheter. Incremental spinal anaesthesia using a 32-gauge intrathecal catheter was studied in 13 males scheduled for transurethral resection of the prostate or repair of inguinal hernia. The spinal technique failed in four patients. Dose-response curves were obtained in the remaining nine patients using increments of 0.5% plain bupivacaine. The spinal block was extended safely and reliably without cardiovascular instability. No patient had any postoperative headache and all catheters were removed intact. 
Molecular cloning of PC3, a putatively secreted protein whose mRNA is induced by nerve growth factor and depolarization. PC3 is an immediate early gene induced by nerve growth factor in PC12 cells, a cell line derived from a tumor of the adrenal medulla that undergoes neuronal differentiation in the presence of nerve growth factor. This induction is independent of new protein synthesis as it can occur in the presence of cycloheximide. PC3 is also induced with similar kinetics, but at lower levels, by membrane depolarization (both in vivo and in vitro) and epidermal growth factor. It is induced at much lower levels by fibroblast growth factor and interleukin 6. In vivo it is found expressed in tissues, such as brain at embryonic day 13.5, placenta, amnion, and spleen, which are proliferating and/or differentiating. The deduced protein sequence from the cDNA indicates the presence of a signal peptide, suggesting that PC3 is secreted. 
Diagnostic imaging of heterotopic ossification with coexistent deep-venous thrombosis in flaccid paraplegia. Heterotopic ossification and deep-venous thrombosis can coexist. This raises potential problems because diagnosis depends heavily on imaging studies, and an ideal imaging study which will cost-effectively and noninvasively diagnose both conditions simultaneously is not readily available. A case of coexistent heterotopic ossification and deep-venous thrombosis in flaccid paraplegia is presented. In this case, deep-venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus were diagnosed and treatment was begun without knowledge of the coexistent heterotopic ossification. Alternative imaging and laboratory diagnostic strategies are discussed. It was concluded that, at this time, clinical acumen and judicious use of traditional diagnostic alternatives is the best means of selecting appropriate treatment. Awareness of the coexistence of the two conditions are careful attention to the patient's clinical course can minimize treatment delays and resultant morbidity. 
Evaluation of combined systemic aspirin and cromolyn sodium in intractable vernal catarrh. The steroids in vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) are not always effective and may result in glaucoma. Cromolyn sodium inhibits degranulation from mast cells, thus preventing release of prostaglandins and the mediators of inflammation when used topically. Aspirin, which blocks the production of inflammation-producing prostaglandins in mast cells released in VKC, especially prostaglandin D2, was used orally in 11 patients with intractable VKC of mixed type with limbal predominance. The chi 2 test of combined therapy showed a significant improvement in itching, lacrimation, and limbal edema (P less than .005) and improved photophobia, palpebral lesions, and corneal staining (P less than .02) at six weeks. 
Sarcoidosis of the CNS: comparison of unenhanced and enhanced MR images. Sarcoidosis involving the CNS has a predilection for the leptomeninges, although parenchymal involvement occurs. We retrospectively evaluated the appearance of CNS sarcoidosis on unenhanced and enhanced MR images. MR studies were abnormal in 17 of 20 patients with CNS sarcoidosis. In all 17 patients, meningeal disease was detected on the gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced T1-weighted images; the disease was detected on unenhanced images in three patients. Well-defined leptomeningeal patterns of enhancement were present in 15 patients. Other areas of involvement were the dura; brain parenchyma including hypothalamus, periventricular white matter, and ventricular ependyma; optic chiasm; and pituitary gland. Gadopentetate dimeglumine optimally evaluates meningeal disease and highlights the importance of the leptomeninges and Virchow-Robin spaces in the pathogenesis of CNS sarcoidosis. Enhanced MR is the preferred imaging technique for the evaluation of CNS sarcoidosis. 
Obesity and cardiovascular risk intervention through the ad libitum feeding of traditional Hawaiian diet. The Waianae Diet Program is a community-based intervention strategy designed to be culturally appropriate by using a pre-Western-contact Hawaiian diet to reduce chronic-disease risk factors in Native Hawaiians. This paper describes a trial of the traditional Hawaiian diet fed ad libitum to Native Hawaiians with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease to assess its effect on obesity and cardiovascular risk factors. Twenty Native Hawaiians were placed on a pre-Western-contact Hawaiian diet for 21 d. The diet was low in fat (7%), high in complex carbohydrates (78%), and moderate in protein (15%). Participants were encouraged to eat to satiety. Average energy intake decreased from 10.86 MJ (2594 kcal)/d to 6.57 MJ (1569 kcal)/d. Average weight loss was 7.8 kg (P less than 0.0001) and average serum cholesterol decreased 0.81 mmol/L (P less than 0.001) from 5.76 to 4.95 mmol/L. Blood pressure decreased an average of 11.5 mm Hg systolic (P less than 0.001) and 8.9 mm Hg diastolic (P less than 0.001). 
A phase II evaluation of menogaril in cisplatin-refractory advanced ovarian carcinoma. A collaborative trial of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and the Mayo Clinic. Forty-one women with advanced, recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma (in whom prior chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen failed) were treated with menogaril 200 mg/m2 intravenously every 4 weeks in a Phase II trial. Partial responses were seen in two of 19 (10.5%) measurable disease patients and three of 12 (25%) nonmeasurable but evaluable patients, an overall objective response rate of 16.1% (95% confidence interval, 5% to 34%). Median time to progression for all patients was 2 months and median survival, 5 months. Toxicities were acceptable and consisted primarily of leukopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity. Twenty-nine percent of the patients had venous irritation or painful phlebitis at the intravenous injection site. Menogaril, as administered in this protocol, had modest antineoplastic activity in previously treated ovarian carcinoma patients. The responses were of short duration, and there appeared to be no survival advantage with menogaril treatment. 
Factors influencing postoperative urinary retention in patients undergoing elective inguinal herniorrhaphy. We retrospectively studied 295 men who had undergone herniorrhaphy under spinal or general endotracheal anesthesia to determine the incidence of postoperative urinary retention and to assess factors influencing it. The type and location of hernia had no effect on retention. In contrast, the use of general anesthesia, patient age above 53 years, and perioperative administration of more than 1,200 mL of fluid were significantly associated with an increase in retention. Our results suggest that urinary retention after herniorrhaphy may be prevented by limiting the amount of fluid given perioperatively and by using a spinal anesthetic, especially in older patients. 
Effects of felodipine ER and hydrochlorothiazide on blood rheology in essential hypertension--a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. The haemorheological effects of felodipine extended release (ER), a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, were compared with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in 28 mild to moderate hypertensives (18 men and 10 women, aged 30-70 years) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Antihypertensive drugs were gradually discontinued. Felodipine Er, 10 mg, was given once daily for 2 weeks, and after another wash-out period of 1 week, patients were switched to 25 mg HCTZ, once daily, and vice versa. Whole blood viscosity (BV) at three different shear stresses, haematocrit (Hct), plasma viscosity (PV), red blood cell (RBC) aggregation, RBC deformability, and fibrinogen were measured under standardized conditions 2.5 h after medication, and after 2 week of treatment (24 h post-dosing). Felodipine ER improved BV acutely, but not during treatment over a 2-week period. By contrast, HCTZ did not affect BV, but decreased RBC deformability 2.5 h after medication intake. After 2 weeks of treatment, the negative effect on RBC deformability had increased slightly. Furthermore, fibrinogen and PV were significantly elevated at this stage. In summary, felodipine ER did not improve blood rheology over a 2-week treatment period in this study. HCTZ exhibited marginal but significant negative effects on fibrinogen, PV and indices of RBC deformability, but not on RBC aggregation. 
Effect of hemoglobin concentration on maximal O2 uptake in canine gastrocnemius muscle in situ. O2 delivery to maximally working muscle was decreased by altering hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and arterial PO2 (PaO2) to investigate whether the reductions in maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) that occur with lowered [Hb] are in part related to changes in the effective muscle O2 diffusing capacity (DmO2). Two sets of experiments were conducted. In the initial set (n = 8), three levels of Hb [5.8 +/- 0.3, 9.4 +/- 0.1, and 14.4 +/- 0.6 (SE) g/100 ml] in the blood were used in random order to pump perfuse, at equal muscle blood flows and PaO2, maximally working isolated dog gastrocnemius muscle. VO2max declined with decreasing [Hb], but the relationship between VO2max and both the effluent venous PO2 (PvO2) and the calculated mean capillary PO2 (PcO2) was not linear through the origin and, therefore, not compatible with a single value of DmO2 (as calculated by Bohr integration using a model based on Fick's law of diffusion). To clarify these results, a second set of experiments (n = 6) was conducted in which two levels of Hb (14.0 +/- 0.6 and 6.9 +/- 0.6 g/100 ml) were each combined with two levels of oxygenation (PaO2 79 +/- 8 and 29 +/- 2 Torr) and applied in random sequence to again pump perfuse maximally working dog gastrocnemius muscle at constant blood flow. In these experiments, the relationship between VO2max and both PvO2 and calculated PcO2 for each [Hb] was consistent with a constant estimate of DmO2 as PaO2 was reduced, but the calculated DmO2 for the lower [Hb] was 33% less than that at the higher [Hb] (P less than 0.05). 
Group-specific serum antibody responses in children with primary and recurrent respiratory syncytial virus infections. Antigenic group-specific serum antibody responses to first and second respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections were studied in children who had been followed longitudinally from early infancy in a research day-care center. Plaque-reduction neutralizing (PRN) antibody assays and ELISAs for the fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins were done using antigens of prototype RSV strains from groups A and B. Responses to antigens of viruses homologous and heterologous to the antigenic group of the infecting viral strain were compared. Primary group A infection elicited antibodies cross-reactive with group B virus in the PRNB and the ELISAS for GB and FB. In contrast, primary group B infection induced significant increases in mean concentrations of antibody cross-reactive with group A virus only in the FA ELISA. Second RSV infections caused by group B viruses in children with histories of primary group A infection induced heterologous rises in the PRNA and GA assays, suggesting that prior group A infection had primed for a more extensive cross-reacting antibody response at the time of second RSV infections with group B viruses. 
Evaluation of restenosis after balloon dilatation in adult aortic stenosis by repeat catheterization. To evaluate the restenosis rate after successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty, clinical evaluation and repeat catheterization were performed in 96 patients who had undergone balloon dilatation 7 +/- 5 months earlier. Restenosis, defined as a loss of greater than 50% of the benefit in aortic valve area obtained after balloon valvuloplasty, was observed in 48% of the patients. Actuarial analysis showed that the restenosis rate was time dependent and was 80% at 15 months. However, functional improvement was observed in most of the patients with or without restenosis. The restenosis rate was not correlated with the degree of enlargement of the aortic orifice produced by the valvuloplasty procedure. Because of the high incidence of restenosis, balloon aortic valvuloplasty should be limited to patients who have a contraindication to surgery or are at high risk for surgery, or as a bridge to surgery. 
Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in morbidly obese patients. Twenty-seven morbidly obese patients (13 men and 14 women) with body mass index greater than or equal to 40 kg m-2 were examined. The mean age of the subjects was 36.9 +/- 8.2 years (range 23-51 years), and the mean BMI was 50.2 +/- 6.2 kg m-2 (range 40.0-62.9 kg m-2). A whole-night sleep recording was made for all patients with signs or symptoms indicative of possible obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). If the first nocturnal sleep recording was abnormal, it was controlled after 1 year. Eleven (10 men and one woman) of the 27 patients had an oxygen desaturation index (ODI) of 10 h-1. They were symptomatic with excessive daytime sleepiness or other daytime symptoms of OSAS. The occurrence of OSAS in men and women was 76.9 and 7.1%, respectively. Arterial hypertension was associated with OSAS, but not with smoking or the degree of obesity. Antihypertensive treatment was received by nine of the 27 patients; six of them had OSAS. Thus six of the 11 (54.5%) patients with OSAS and three of the 16 (18.8%) nonapnoeic patients were treated for arterial hypertension (Fisher exact test, P = 0.042). The odds ratio of OSAS for arterial hypertension is 5.2 (95% CI, 0.71-43.6). Vertical-banded gastroplasty was performed in 14 patients, three of whom had OSAS. The selection of patients for gastroplasty was made without taking into account the results of sleep recordings. In the three OSAS patients, a 30-38% reduction in BMI was achieved by surgery. Eight patients with OSAS were treated with an intensified dietary regimen, and the reduction in BMI ranged from -2.6 to 33%. OSAS was either cured or significantly improved in six (55%) patients, with a mean reduction in BMI of 27%, while in patients with persistent OSAS the mean reduction in BMI was only 7%. 
Ultrasonographical investigation of periportal fibrosis in children with Schistosoma mansoni infection: reversibility of morbidity seven months after treatment with praziquantel. Five hundred thirty six Sudanese schoolchildren with Schistosoma mansoni infection were treated at random with either 20 mg or 40 mg/kg praziquantel. Seven months later 420 children could be reinvestigated by ultrasonography. Reduction of egg excretion and reversibility of sonographically-proven periportal fibrosis (PF) was not significantly different in the two groups. Schistosoma mansoni-induced PF grade II decreased from 22.9% to 6.7% and grade III from 5.2% to 1.6%. An increased prevalence of PF grade I, from 10% to 29.8% of the investigated patients, was observed. This increase was caused partly by a downshifting of patients who had PF II (n = 45) and PF III (n = 8) before therapy, but also by patients who developed PF I in the seven months after therapy (n = 56). The overall percentage of patients with PF before and after treatment was 38.1%. Of 420 children, 17.4% increased in their PF grade, 55% remained at the same level and 27.6% improved. Children younger than 11 years of age had a higher rate of complete reversibility than older ones. The percentage of patients with hepatomegaly decreased significantly (11.6% to 6.9%; p = 0.001). The rate of splenomegaly remained unchanged. It was concluded that within seven months therapy with praziquantel resulted in a considerable qualitative improvement of PF in Sudanese schoolchildren with S. mansoni infection. 
Cimetidine and ranitidine may not cross-react to cause thrombocytopenia. We report the case of a patient with peptic ulcer disease who developed cimetidine-induced thrombocytopenia. The thrombocytopenia resolved spontaneously following discontinuation of cimetidine, and did not recur with ranitidine. We concluded that cimetidine and ranitidine do not necessarily cross-react to induce thrombocytopenia. Thus the exclusion of both H2-blockers in the event that one has caused thrombocytopenia may not be justified. 
Lack of association between neutropenia and the incidence of bacteremia associated with indwelling central venous catheters in febrile pediatric cancer patients. To assess the incidence of bacteremia in pediatric cancer patients with indwelling central venous catheters with fever, we reviewed the records of all 67 such patients sequentially admitted during a 10-month period at our institution. There were a total of 140 episodes of fever in these 67 patients. In 55 of the episodes (39%) patients were nonneutropenic (absolute neutrophil count, greater than 500/mm3); 85 episodes (61%) were associated with neutropenia. Twenty-four percent of all episodes of fever in nonneutropenic patients were related to bacteremia vs. 9.5% of episodes of fever in the presence of neutropenia (P less than 0.05). When clinical evidence of an exit site infection was absent, the incidence of bacteremia in the neutropenic and nonneutropenic groups was similar (11% in the neutropenic group; 10% in the nonneutropenic group). We conclude that bacteremia is frequently observed in febrile pediatric cancer patients with indwelling venous catheters who are not neutropenic, particularly if there is clinical evidence of an exit site infection. Thus empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted in all pediatric oncology patients with indwelling catheters who develop fever. 
Arterial hemodynamics in human hypertension. Effects of adrenergic blockade. BACKGROUND. Resistance, pulse wave velocity, and wave reflections have been shown to be increased in patients with essential hypertension compared with normotensive controls. These alterations are completely normalized by nitroprusside infusion but exacerbated during beta-adrenergic blockade, suggesting an enhanced smooth muscle tone that is in part modulated by adrenergically mediated vasodilation. The present study was performed to examine the extent to which this apparently enhanced smooth muscle tone is a result of alpha-adrenergically mediated vasoconstriction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Age-matched normotensive and hypertensive Chinese subjects were instrumented with catheter-tipped micromanometers and an electromagnetic flow velocity sensor positioned in the ascending aorta. Aortic impedance and wave reflection properties were obtained from Fourier analysis of the pressure and flow signals during baseline conditions, after beta-blockade with propranolol (0.15 mg/kg i.v.), and after alpha-blockade with intravenous phentolamine (range, 15-80 mg) that was sufficient to either normalize blood pressure or produce a pressure that could not be further lowered. Compared with normotensives, in the baseline state, hypertensives had elevated resistance (1,962 versus 1,268 dyne.sec/cm5, p less than 0.001), total power (1,893 versus 1,568 mW, p less than 0.08), reflected pressure wave component (25.6 versus 13.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), ratio of reflected to forward wave (0.65 versus 0.42, p less than 0.001), and pulse wave velocity as determined from the frequency of the first zero-crossing of impedance phase angle (4.6 versus 3.5 Hz, p less than 0.03). During combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, blood pressure decreased into the normal range (from 162/103 to 131/87 mm Hg) but was still somewhat higher than that in the normotensive subjects. Resistance (1,914 dyne.sec/cm5, p less than 0.03), reflected wave (19.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and ratio of reflected to forward wave (0.61, p less than 0.001) were, however, persistently elevated above normal values. CONCLUSIONS. alpha-Adrenergically mediated vasoconstriction cannot account for all of the hemodynamic alterations seen in essential hypertension. 
Relationship between glucose tolerance and quantitative changes of islet cells in chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer. This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between indicators of preoperative glucose tolerance and quantitative changes of endocrine cells in the islet of Langerhans in patients with chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer. Twenty-one specimens of pancreatic tissue obtained from patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy for pancreatoduodenal cancer were divided into four groups according to the degree of fibrosis (Grades 0-III). Islet cells in serial sections were stained immunohistochemically to determine the proportions of B-, A-, D-, and PP-cells in the islets of Langerhans. In patients with pancreatic tissue with the most severe fibrosis, of several preoperative glucose metabolism indices measured, it was found that the ratio of integrated value of change in serum insulin to that of serum glucose (sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS) was significantly decreased. There was a significant positive correlation between proportion of B-cells, and both the ratio of change in insulin to that of glucose (delta IRI:delta BS) and sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS. On the other hand, there was a significant negative correlation between proportion of A-cells and sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS. The present data strongly suggest that it is possible to estimate the degree of fibrosis and to quantify changes of the islet cells prior to surgery in patients with obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer by calculating these glucose metabolism indices, and that sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS is a particularly useful index. 
Pathophysiological basis for noninvasive functional evaluation of coronary stenosis. A number of tests are used for the noninvasive detection of coronary stenosis, which results from the combination of different stimuli (exercise, pacing, dobutamine, dipyridamole, etc.) and different signals and methodologies (ECG, echocardiography, scintigraphy). In this article, the theoretical assumptions for and the methodological limitations of the functional evaluation of the degree of coronary stenosis are considered within the framework of pathophysiology. In particular, the issues of dilating coronary circulation by either increasing myocardial O2 demand or infusing dipyridamole and of assessing coronary reserve by either flow- or ischemia-related techniques are examined. In addition, the hypotheses of a physiological blood steal during exercise, a decrement of exercise ischemic threshold secondary to additional pharmacological vasodilation, and coronary vasospasm in Prinzmetal's angina patients, following the sequence dipyridamole-aminophylline, are discussed on the basis of preliminary studies. 
Nutritional consequences of major gastrointestinal surgery. Patient outcome and starvation. Advances in major gastrointestinal surgery and the existence of a significant number of high-risk patients necessitate a detailed knowledge of the metabolic response to surgery and the need for adjunctive nutritional therapy. Such surgery has the potential to cause significant nutritional consequences affecting patient outcome. Often, patients present malnourished preoperatively because of their chronic gastrointestinal disease, advanced age, or comorbidity. Still others are at great risk for developing malnutrition postoperatively secondary to the hypercatabolism of prolonged illness or postoperative complications. In addition, the surgical alterations of the gastrointestinal tract might disrupt normal function sufficiently to result in chronic nutritional deficiencies. Because starvation is no longer an acceptable condition, these concerns need to be recognized prior to surgery, and if indicated, nutritional support must be initiated preoperatively. Placement of feeding jejunostomy catheters for early enteral support should be considered for all high-risk patients. Equally important, surgeons should maintain a watch for future nutritional innovations that will improve their ability to meet patients' nutritional requirements. 
Mutations in the precore region of hepatitis B virus DNA in patients with fulminant and severe hepatitis BACKGROUND. The presence of the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in serum is known to be a marker of a high degree of viral infectivity. However, fulminant hepatitis may occur in persons who are negative for HBeAg. A single point mutation has been reported to produce a stop codon in the precore region of hepatitis B virus DNA and prevent the formation of the precore protein required to make HBeAg. To determine whether a precore-mutant virus is causally related to severe liver injury, we analyzed the entire precore region in viral strains isolated from patients with fatal cases and uncomplicated cases of hepatitis B. METHODS. Serum was obtained from 9 patients with fatal hepatitis B (5 with fulminant and 4 with severe exacerbations of chronic hepatitis) and 10 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. Serum samples from a sex partner implicated as the source of the virus in one case of fulminant hepatitis were also studied. The 87 nucleotides in the precore region of the hepatitis B virus were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and then directly sequenced. RESULTS. Of the nine patients with fatal hepatitis, seven had retrievable hepatitis B DNA. In all seven there was a point mutation from G to A at nucleotide 1896 of the precore region, converting tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG). In contrast, this mutation was not found in the 10 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis B. The hepatitis B DNA from the implicated source contained a sequence with the stop-codon mutation that was identical to the sequence in her partner, who had fulminant hepatitis. CONCLUSIONS. The presence of a mutant viral strain is associated with and may be involved in the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis B and severe exacerbations of chronic hepatitis B. 
Assessment of severity of coronary narrowings by quantitative exercise echocardiography and comparison with quantitative arteriography. To determine the correlation of quantitative assessment of coronary narrowings with left ventricular functional impairment induced by exercise, 57 patients with 1-vessel coronary artery disease and without evidence of collateral flow were studied. A significant relation was observed between minimal cross-sectional area, percent area stenosis, minimal lumen diameter, percent diameter stenosis and the percentage of segmental area change from rest to peak exercise in a vascular distribution territory (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001; r = -0.55, p less than 0.001; r = 0.56, p less than 0.001; r = -0.75, p less than 0.001, respectively). For minimal cross-sectional area, the best cut-off value to separate significantly patients who had a decrease in contractility at peak exercise testing from those who had a normal response was 2 mm2 (p less than 0.001); for percent cross-sectional area stenosis, it was 75% (p less than 0.001); for minimal lumen diameter, it was 0.7 mm (p less than 0.001); and, for percent diameter stenosis, it was 85% (p less than 0.001). High cut-off values for angiographic variables are necessary to separate significantly patients who have a decrease in contractility at peak exercise testing from those who have a normal response. Several patients with mild coronary stenoses may have either normal or abnormal wall motion during exercise. Thus, exercise echocardiography is a useful tool in detecting the presence of fairly severe anatomic narrowing, whereas it is of limited clinical use in the assessment of intermediate coronary atherosclerotic lesions. 
The assessment of visuo-spatial neglect after acute stroke. Forty four consecutive patients with acute hemispheric stroke and forty seven elderly controls with no neurological disease were assessed for visuo-spatial neglect, using a modified neglect test battery. Neglect was found to be equally common in patients with right hemisphere and left hemisphere stroke three days after stroke (72% versus 62%). It was more severe in those with a right hemisphere stroke and resolved more frequently in those with a left hemisphere stroke. The battery was validated against an occupational therapist's assessment of neglect on self-care tasks. The inter-observer reliability was good and it was possible to monitor changes over time with the battery. 
Muscle hypertrophy response to resistance training in older women. We conducted a 12-wk resistance training program in elderly women [mean age 69 +/- 1.0 (SE) yr] to determine whether increases in muscle strength are associated with changes in cross-sectional fiber area of the vastus lateralis muscle. Twenty-seven healthy women were randomly assigned to either a control or exercise group. The program was satisfactorily completed and adequate biopsy material obtained from 6 controls and 13 exercisers. After initial testing of baseline maximal strength, exercisers began a training regimen consisting of seven exercises that stressed primary muscle groups of the lower extremities. No active intervention was prescribed for the controls. Increases in muscle strength of the exercising subjects were significant compared with baseline values (28-115%) in all muscle groups. No significant strength changes were observed in the controls. Cross-sectional area of type II muscle fibers significantly increased in the exercisers (20.1 +/- 6.8%, P = 0.02) compared with baseline. In contrast, no significant change in type II fiber area was observed in the controls. No significant changes in type I fiber area were found in either group. We conclude that a program of resistance exercise can be safely carried out by elderly women, such a program significantly increases muscle strength, and such gains are due, at least in part, to muscle hypertrophy. 
Intraoral reconstruction with a microvascular peritoneal flap. The microvascular peritoneal flap offers a new reconstructive option for closure of intraoral defects. The flap is easy to raise, and donor-site morbidity is low. Unlike fascial flaps, in which the raw surface may take weeks to "mucosalize," the peritoneal surface heals primarily. Finally, the rectus muscle effectively covers all forms of mandibular reconstruction, and the reliable skin paddle makes possible the closure of substantial cutaneous defects. 
Cerebral vasospasm in elderly patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Cerebral vasospasm in elderly patients who were operated on the acute stage after subarachnoid hemorrhage was studied under strict criteria. The 138 patients were classified into three age groups: 59 years or younger (group A: 73 cases), 60 to 69 years (group B: 37 cases), and 70 years or older (group C: 28 cases). Severity of both the subarachnoid hemorrhages on computed tomography scan and the angiographic vasospasms was graded. The angiographic vasospasms were analyzed at the internal carotid artery, M1 segments of the middle cerebral artery, and A2 segments of the anterior cerebral. In all the relationships among the subarachnoid hemorrhage grades, the Hounsfield numbers, and the operative approaches to the angiographic vasospasm grade, there was a tendency for the angiographic vasospasm grades to be lower with increasing age in both the internal carotid artery and the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery. This tendency was more apparent in the larger vessels, that is, the internal carotid arteries. Close correlations of the angiographic vasospasm grades to the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and to low-density area on computed tomography scan were found in both the M1 and A2 territories in the three groups. However, there were no significant differences among the three groups in the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and low-density area on computed tomography scan. Regarding the surgical outcome, the older the patients, the higher were the mortality rates: 8% in group A, 11% in group B, and 25% in group C. 
Blockade of endogenous anterior hypothalamic atrial natriuretic peptide with monoclonal antibody lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. We have previously shown that the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) content of the anterior hypothalamic region of NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) is higher than that of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. ANP has been shown to inhibit neuronal norepinephrine release and to reduce the excitability of hypothalamic neurons. This study tested the hypothesis that blockade of endogenous ANP in the anterior hypothalamus by local microinjection of a monoclonal antibody to ANP (MAb KY-ANP-II) lowers blood pressure in SHR-S. Purified MAb KY-ANP-II (0.055 and 0.55 micrograms) or control mouse IgG in 200 nl saline was microinjected into the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) of conscious SHR-S and control WKY rats. As a further control, Mab KY-ANP-II (0.55 microgram) was microinjected into the posterior hypothalamic area (PHA) of SHR-S. Anterior hypothalamic microinjection of MAb KY-ANP-II caused significant dose-related decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in SHR-S but not in WKY rats. Control injections of equal volumes of IgG had no effect on MAP or HR. Microinjection of Mab KY-ANP-II into PHA produced no significant alteration in MAP or HR in SHR-S. These data provide the first demonstration that endogenous ANP in a region of brain known to influence cardiovascular function mediates BP and HR control in the rat. These findings suggest that the increased endogenous ANP in the anterior hypothalamus of SHR-S may be involved in the central regulation of BP in the model. 
Blood loss in total knee arthroplasty. Over a two-year period, 112 consecutive primary total knee arthroplasties (TKA) were performed according to a standard protocol and were evaluated to determine the effects of intraoperative tourniquet deflation, suction drainage, and immediate continuous passive motion (CPM) on blood loss and the need for blood transfusions. It has been reported that these measures lead to increased morbidity following TKA. The tourniquet was deflated before closure, hemostasis was obtained, and two suction drains were placed for 24 to 48 hours. CPM was started immediately, and continued for a mean of seven days. Serial hematocrits (Hct) were obtained. Mean age of the 64 males and 48 females was 65 years. The diagnosis was osteoarthritis in 86% and rheumatoid arthritis in 14%. Seventy-three percent of the prostheses were cemented and 27% were uncemented. The mean tourniquet time was 104 minutes and the mean length of surgery was 140 minutes. Blood loss measured at surgery averaged 222 ml. Total calculated blood loss averaged 794 ml, but was higher for patients with a cemented versus uncemented prosthesis (p less than .05), and males versus females (p less than .005). It was not related to diagnosis, tourniquet time, or length of surgery. Of the 38% of patients requiring a transfusion (mean, 2.2 units), there was not a significantly greater drop in Hct (from 36.6 to 26.5; change, 10.1) when compared to patients not receiving a transfusion (from 43.1 to 32.5; change, 10.6). Therefore, the need for transfusion was related to preoperative Hct and not the intraoperative or postoperative blood loss. 
Successful surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. Review and clinical update Atrial fibrillation is the most common of all sustained cardiac arrhythmias, yet it has no effective medical or surgical therapy. During the past decade, multipoint computerized electrophysiological mapping systems were used to map both experimental and human atrial fibrillation. On the basis of these studies, a new surgical procedure was developed for atrial fibrillation. Between September 25, 1987, and July 1, 1991, this procedure was applied in 22 patients with paroxysmal atrial flutter (n = 2), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (n = 11), or chronic atrial fibrillation (n = 9) of 2 to 21 years' duration. All patients were refractory to all antiarrhythmic medications, and each patient failed to receive the desired therapeutic benefits of an average of five drugs administered preoperatively. There were no operative deaths and all perioperative morbidity resolved. All 22 patients have been successfully treated for atrial fibrillation with surgery alone. Three patients developed one late isolated episode of atrial flutter at 5, 6, and 15 months postoperatively, and each of these patient's symptoms is now controlled by a single antiarrhythmic drug. Preservation of atrial transport function has been documented in all patients postoperatively, and all have experienced marked clinical improvement. 
Cyst of the ligamentum flavum: report of six cases. Six cases of cyst of the ligamentum flavum with compression of a lumbar nerve root are reported. All patients exhibited recurrent back pain and sciatica. Investigation included computed tomography, myelography, or both. The correct diagnosis was reached before operation in only half the patients. High-resolution computed tomography performed in the four last patients outlined the cystic lesion with its low-density center. Surgical excision was performed in all patients. Microscopic examination showed a dense fibrous cyst arising from the ligamentum flavum. The lumen contained myxoid or necrotic material, but no epithelial lining. Cysts of the ligamentum flavum must be considered in the differential diagnosis of causes of sciatica. A firm radiological diagnosis may, at present, still require myelography combined with high-resolution computed tomography. Differentiation from synovial or ganglion cysts of the spine is discussed. 
Vestibular compensation after labyrinthectomy and vestibular neurectomy in cats. Labyrinthectomy and vestibular neurectomy are two ablative procedures used for definitive control of disabling vertigo. It is not known if vestibular compensation after labyrinthectomy and vestibular neurectomy differs. We have addressed this question by examining the pattern of recovery of the vestibular ocular reflex in cats after either labyrinthectomy or vestibular neurectomy. Temporal bone histologic examination confirmed the surgical lesion. Our results demonstrate a reduction of the long time constant of the vestibular ocular reflex in both groups of animals. Although gain of the vestibular ocular reflex recovered substantially, it never returned to control levels in either group. In general, animals that had undergone vestibular neurectomy demonstrated greater vestibular ocular reflex asymmetries than did labyrinthectomized animals. The recovery pattern of the vestibular ocular reflex indicates vestibular compensation is more rapid after labyrinthectomy than after vestibular neurectomy. We believe this result is related to survival of the vestibular nerve after labyrinthectomy, but not after vestibular neurectomy, suggesting that the vestibular nerve can contribute to the adaptive response after labyrinthectomy. 
The outcome of prostatectomy on chronic retention of urine. A total of 68 men with bladder outflow obstruction and chronic retention (residual urine greater than 300 ml.) underwent investigation before and after prostatectomy with medium fill cystometry and natural fill long-term bladder pressure monitoring. Postoperatively, upper tract dilatation (present in 28 men preoperatively) resolved in all but 2 men and serum creatinine levels improved significantly. Irritative and obstructive symptom scores improved postoperatively (p less than 0.00006), although 17% of the men still had significant symptoms. Residual urine volumes decreased and flow rates improved (p less than 0.00006) but 32% of the men still had a residual urine of greater than 200 ml. Urodynamic parameters improved during medium fill cystometry and long-term monitoring. The main risk factors for upper tract dilatation are a pressure increase during bladder filling on conventional cystometry and the frequency of phasic detrusor activity during long-term monitoring, and they decreased postoperatively. 
Fibrinopeptide A excretion in urine: a marker of the cumulative thrombin activity in stable versus unstable angina patients. Plasma levels and 24-hour urine excretion of fibrinopeptide A were measured in a consecutive series of 179 patients with angina pectoris. Sixty-four patients had stable angina and 115 patients had unstable angina. Urine was collected over 24 hours the day before coronary arteriography, and blood samples were taken at the end of urine collection. When the values of fibrinopeptide A in plasma and in the 24-hour urine specimens were compared, no significant correlation was found in patients with either stable (rs = 0.16, difference not significant) and unstable (rs = 0.07, difference not significant) angina. The concentrations of fibrinopeptide A in the plasma did not differ significantly when patients with stable angina (range 0.1 to 82.6, median 7.4 ng/mL) were compared with patients with unstable angina (range 0.2 to 61.7, median 14 ng/mL, p = 0.055), whereas fibrinopeptide A 24-hour urinary excretion was significantly higher in patients with unstable angina (range 0.3 to 38.1, median 11.8 micrograms/24 hr) than in patients with stable angina (range 0.4 to 38.1, median 3.8 micrograms/24 hr, p less than 0.001). Twenty-four-hour urine excretion of fibrinopeptide A in patients with unstable angina and angiographically documented intracoronary thrombi were higher than the corresponding values in patients with unstable angina without such angiographic characteristic (p less than 0.001). The largest increase in plasma and urine concentration of fibrinopeptide A was observed in patients whose first episode of angina at rest occurred within the previous 48 hours. We conclude that the cumulative thrombin activity, assessed by 24-hour urinary excretion of fibrinopeptide A, is a more useful index, compared with single fibrinopeptide A measurement in plasma, for discriminating between patients with stable and with unstable angina pectoris. 
Evidence for a central but not a peripheral analgesic effect of clomipramine in rats. The effect of clomipramine (CMI), a tricyclic antidepressant, was studied on an acute inflammatory pain model in an attempt to understand its potential antinociceptive activity, the involvement of a central and/or peripheral component and its influence on the inflammatory process. When administered (i.v.) before the inflammatory agent, carrageenan (CAR), CMI (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) completely prevented the development of the hyperalgesia for 70-120 min according to the doses. This antinociceptive effect was suppressed by naloxone (100 micrograms/kg i.v.) for 65 min. Neither higher doses (1, 2 and 20 mg/kg, i.v.) nor CMI injected into the inflamed paw (15 min before CAR) modified pain thresholds. Moreover, CMI (0.5 and 2 mg/kg, i.v.) administered 15 min before CAR markedly increased the volume of the CAR-induced oedema. These results (1) demonstrate an opioid-dependent antinociceptive effect of CMI on this model, the doses used being lower than those active in thermal or electrical tests, and (2) tend to exclude a peripheral mechanism and an NSAID-like anti-inflammatory activity suggested by previous in vitro studies. 
Perfusion redistribution after alveolar flooding: vasoconstriction vs. vascular compression. We compared the effects of left caudal lobe (LCL) alveolar hypoxia on regional pulmonary blood flow (PBF) with the effects due to alveolar edema induced by plasma instilled directly into the LCL airways of 16 dogs. Regional measurements were made with positron emission tomography. After hypoxic ventilation of the LCL (n = 11), the LCL-to-right caudal lobe (L/R) PBF ratio fell from 0.94 +/- 0.21 during 100% oxygen ventilation of the LCL to 0.46 +/- 0.21 (P less than 0.05). After instillation of either isooncotic (n = 5) or hypooncotic plasma (n = 3) into the LCL, the L/R PBF ratio was similar to that during LCL hypoxia (0.50 +/- 0.27 and 0.64 +/- 0.10, respectively, P less than 0.05 compared with 100% oxygen ventilation of the LCL before plasma instillation). The changes in regional PBF due to LCL hypoxia and plasma instillation could be completely prevented (n = 8) by the prior administration of a single dose of endotoxin (15 micrograms/kg iv). In contrast to previous work, these results indicate that perfusion redistribution occurs regardless of the oncotic state of alveolar edema. More importantly, any change that does occur in regional PBF can be completely prevented by blocking regional vasoconstriction, indicating that mechanical compression cannot be the major factor determining the regional response of PBF to alveolar flooding. 
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty utilizing prolonged balloon inflations: initial results and six-month follow-up. Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) using prolonged balloon inflation has obviated emergency coronary bypass surgery in some patients with acute occlusions at the time of PTCA. However, the use of prolonged balloon inflations has not been shown to improve long-term restenosis rates. As an alternative to the passive autoperfusion catheter, we evaluated a hemoperfusion system in which blood was obtained from the side arm of an arterial sheath and infused through the central lumen of standard balloon catheters via a modified Medrad IV pump during balloon inflation. PTCA was performed in 71 male patients (median age 57 yr). The median balloon inflation time was 4.8 minutes and the median rate of blood perfusion was 30 ml/min. PTCA was successful (lumen increase by 20 percentage points) in 83% of patients (59/71) with diameter stenosis decreasing from a median 82% to 30%. Emergency coronary bypass was required in four patients (5%). Angiographic data for six-month followup was available on 37 patients. The restenosis rate (loss of 50% of gain) was 46% (17/37). The conclusion is that prolonged balloon inflation angioplasty has a role in complicated PTCA but offers no advantage in improving long-term restenosis rates in elective PTCA. 
The relation of dizziness to functional decline. OBJECTIVE: to assess the effect of dizziness on the probability that an older person will die or become functionally disabled within 2 years. Dizziness is a common symptom for which the prognosis is uncertain. This report compares the prognoses for dizzy and not-dizzy older people in order to assist clinicians who diagnose and treat these patients. DESIGN: a prospective study of a representative sample of elderly (70+) non-institutionalized Americans. Elderly subjects (n = 3,798) in the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) were asked questions about the presence of dizziness, medical conditions, and functional disability in 1984. The cohort was reinterviewed about functional disability in 1986. OUTCOME MEASURE: transition from functional ability to disability after 2 years. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed that dizziness predicts functional decline but not mortality. Multivariate models revealed that age, race, sensory impairment, vascular disease, and other morbidity are independent predictors of becoming disabled. Controlling for these potential confounders, dizziness does not predict an increased probability of becoming disabled. CONCLUSION: Elderly people who are dizzy should be evaluated for the presence of these related conditions. 
Relation between myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor and left ventricular function in patients with left ventricular volume overload due to chronic mitral regurgitation with or without aortic regurgitation. The relation between myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor and left ventricular (LV) function was studied in 10 patients, aged 41 to 61 years (average 51), with LV volume overload mainly due to chronic mitral regurgitation. Beta-adrenergic receptors were examined using crude membrane in LV papillary muscle obtained at mitral valve replacement. Cardiac function was evaluated at preoperative cardiac catheterization with the interval to surgery of 1 to 33 months (average 7). Beta-adrenergic receptor density in 7 patients with New York Heart Association class II or III congestive heart failure was higher than that in 3 patients with class IV heart failure (59 +/- 19 vs 37 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05). Beta-adrenergic receptor density showed a positive correlation with end-systolic stress/end-systolic volume index ratio, the index for contractile function (p less than 0.005). Other parameters such as cardiac index, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and LV ejection fraction had no significant correlation to beta-adrenergic receptor. The results demonstrated that increases in symptom and LV dysfunction, particularly of the contractile state, was associated with decreased myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density from possible down-regulation in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation with or without aortic regurgitation. 
Use of a rapid, efficient inoculation method to induce papillomas by cottontail rabbit papillomavirus DNA shows that the E7 gene is required. A simple inoculation method to induce papillomas efficiently with cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) DNA is described. Using a jet injector, recombinant CRPV DNA is easily delivered to 100 or more sites per rabbit and induces typical epithelial papillomas in approximately 50% of those sites. Papillomas begin to form by 3 weeks and continue to develop for up to 7 weeks, a pattern similar to that reported following infection with intact virus. This system readily lends itself to investigation of viral gene function by delivering mutant viral genomes into an immunologically intact host. Two mutations in the E7 open reading frame were introduced into the complete CRPV genome and analyzed by this method. One was a frameshift mutation encoding just nine amino-terminal amino acids of the E7 protein; the other was an in-frame insertion mutation at position 9. Both E7 mutations were in a region of homology to the 300-kDa protein binding domain of adenovirus E1A protein. Neither mutant construct was able to induce papillomas, thereby demonstrating that the E7 gene participates in this biologic function. Exploitation of this approach, which demonstrates that a papillomavirus E7 gene is involved in the induction of papillomas in vivo, should permit detailed studies into molecular mechanisms involved in papilloma induction, malignant conversion, and host immune response. The high efficiency of papilloma induction with recombinant CRPV DNA suggests that the jet injector can also be used to study the biologic effects of other genetic elements in rabbits or in other species. 
Human hepatocyte growth factor in blood of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Basic aspects. Human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) was purified from the plasma of six patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to hepatitis B in two and non-A, non-B hepatitis in four. The purified hHGF from each patient contained two major protein bands having molecular weights of 79,000 and 86,000 and several minor bands having molecular weights between 76,000 and 92,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed under nonreduced conditions. After reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, three major bands having molecular weights of 58,000, 34,500, and 31,500 were evident. In addition, a band having a molecular weight of 21,000 was detected. hHGF activity was destroyed by its reduction. The hHGF purified from patients demonstrated a dose response in terms of an increase in DNA synthesis using cultured hepatocytes. The hHGF concentration in the plasma of the patients with grade III-IV hepatic coma was calculated to be in the range of 1.8-3.0 nM. Finally the heavy chain of hHGF was not recognized by an anti-human albumin antibody, indicating that hHGF is not biliprotein, an albumin-bilirubin complex, that has been reported to be a putative liver growth factor. 
Complement consumption in a patient with necrobiotic xanthogranuloma and paraproteinemia. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma and paraproteinemia have been reported to be associated with acquired deficiency of the early components of the classic pathway of complement. We describe a patient in whom activation of complement was suggested by a high level of C3d, an accelerated catabolism of C1q, and a rapid consumption of C4 after an intravenous infusion of fresh-frozen plasma. This infusion was followed by an episode of pulmonary edema. Patients with complement deficiency or depletion should be monitored closely while receiving plasma, to avoid this potential complication. 
Resectoscopic myomectomy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and efficacy of resectoscopic myomectomy for control of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and/or reproductive wastage. DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive patient follow-up. SETTING: Private practice, outpatient, hospital. PATIENTS: All patients (92) having resectoscopic myomectomy between September 1, 1986 and December 31, 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Resectoscopic myomectomy with or without concomitant procedures such as endometrial ablation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and reproductive outcome after surgery. RESULTS: Elimination of dysmenorrhea in 24 of 28, absence of menorrhagia in 65 of 80, and pregnancy in 10 of 13 with two abortions in a total of 11 gestations. One patient was admitted and treated with one unit of autologous blood and mechanical tamponade with an intrauterine balloon. Three cases of uterine perforation had no sequelae. One patient had mild endometritis responding to outpatient antibiotics. Two cases of leiomyosarcoma were diagnosed histologically and accounted for two of the three hysterectomies noted during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Resectoscopic myomectomy is a safe, effective, and relatively simple outpatient surgical procedure. 
Idarubicin: a second-generation anthracycline. Because of its in vitro activity in leukemic cell lines and Phase I studies of acute leukemia, Phase II and III clinical trials with idarubicin hydrochloride were conducted in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. In the Phase III comparative trials between the combinations of idarubicin and cytarabine and daunorubicin hydrochloride and cytarabine, the idarubicin/cytarabine combination resulted in significantly greater complete remission rates and longer overall survival in two of three studies conducted in the US. As a result, the Food and Drug Administration approved intravenous idarubicin with a Class 1A rating in September 1990 for use in combination with other antileukemic drugs (e.g., cytarabine) for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia in adults. The recommended dose of idarubicin is 12 mg/m2 daily for three days by slow intravenous injection in combination with cytarabine. Although idarubicin causes myelosuppression similar to that described with daunorubicin, the incidence of cardiotoxicity in animal models is lower. Idarubicin also has the advantage of oral administration, but the oral formulation of the drug remains investigational. The use of idarubicin in pediatric patients also remains to be established. 
Fat-saturation MR imaging of the upper abdomen. The fat-saturation (fatsat) MR technique decreases the signal intensity of fat, thereby enhancing the definition of upper abdominal organs and reducing artifacts while maintaining the T1 and T2 information available on spin-echo sequences. To evaluate the potential of fatsat in examining the abdomen, we conducted a prospective study involving 30 subjects, including four normal volunteers, 18 patients investigated for liver disease, and eight patients studied for miscellaneous abdominal disease. Short TR, 300-600/15-20 (TR/TE), and long TR, 2000-2500/20-30, 70-80, spin-echo images with and without fatsat were compared. The images were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative assessment was made with receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the confidence level of observers to detect the presence of disease, comparing fatsat with standard spin-echo sequences. ROC analysis showed greater interpreter confidence and accuracy for fatsat sequences than for standard spin-echo sequences. The measured signal-difference-to-noise (SD/N) ratio comparing upper abdominal organs with surrounding tissue revealed the highest values for short TR/TE regular spin echo, followed by short TR/TE fatsat. The highest SD/N ratio for hepatic masses was with long TR/TE fatsat followed by short TR/TE fatsat. The results of this study suggest that the fatsat technique may improve abdominal MR imaging. 
Pediatric cardiac rehabilitation. Sixteen patients participated in a Pediatric/Young Adult Cardiac Rehabilitation Program that included exercise training, education about cardiovascular diseases, dietary counseling, and counseling on stress management. Seven patients completed the program, and complete data were available on six. The subjects demonstrated significant changes in their hemodynamics and exercise tolerance after completing the program. Resting blood pressure decreased by 7%, from 119 +/- 12 to 111 +/- 10 mm Hg; peak oxygen consumption increased by 20%, from 31.9 +/- 4.3 mL/kg of body weight per minute to 38.4 +/- 6.0 mL/kg of body weight per minute; and exercise treadmill time increased by 21%, from 8.5 +/- 1.4 to 10.3 +/- 1.0 minutes. No complications occurred during exercise training or testing. Supervised exercise training at moderate intensity is safe and produces significant and beneficial changes in hemodynamics and exercise time in children with cardiac disease. 
Hyperalgesia induced in the rat by the amino-terminal octapeptide of nerve growth factor. Nerve growth factor (NGF) in the mouse submandibular gland undergoes cleavage of its amino-terminal octapeptide when salivation is induced by epinephrine. The significance of this event is uncertain; cleaved NGF demonstrates bioactivity and no function has been attributed to the octapeptide produced (NGF-OP; Ser-Ser-Thr-His-Pro-Val-Phe-His). Enzyme inhibition studies indicating structural relatedness of NGF-OP and bradykinin (BK) prompted us to determine whether NGF-OP would elicit BK-like actions. We found that like BK, NGF-OP induced a decrease in mechanical nociceptive threshold (i.e., produced hyperalgesia) in the hairy skin of the rat. This effect was dose-dependent and sequence-specific; like BK it was attenuated by sympathectomy and indomethacin pretreatment. However, NGF-OP actions appeared to be distinct from those for BK in that tissue injury was required for NGF-OP to induce hyperalgesia. Furthermore, we found no evidence that NGF-OP bound to or activated BK receptors. Our data indicate that NGF-OP is a distinct mediator of hyperalgesia. We suggest that NGF-OP alters pain threshold in the injured target regions of NGF-responsive neurons. 
Chinese medicinal herbs reverse macrophage suppression induced by urological tumors. Tumors are known to produce factors suppressing macrophage function. In this study we demonstrated in vitro suppression of macrophage chemiluminescent oxidative burst associated with viable cells and cell-free extracts of two urological neoplasms--murine renal cell carcinoma (Renca) and murine bladder tumor (MBT). Suppression was reversed by extracts of two Chinese medicinal herbs, Astragalus membranaceus (AM) and Ligustrum lucidum (LL). Murine macrophage cell line J774 was incubated with either the viable tumor cells or the cell-free tumor extract for 18 hours at 37C and 5% CO2. Chemiluminescent oxidative burst as an indicator of macrophage function was triggered by adding zymosan A suspension containing luminol and assayed in an automated luminometer. Photon emission over time was counted and the results were expressed as integrated photon emission. Significant dose-related depression of oxidative burst occurred with either the viable tumor cells or the cell-free tumor extracts. Depression was partially or completely reversed by the presence of 50-100 micrograms./ml. of either the AM or the LL extract. AM and LL have previously been shown to modulate immune response. Data from this study suggest that they may also exert their antitumor activity via abolition of tumor-associated macrophage suppression. 
Effects of DM-9384, a cyclic derivative of GABA, on amnesia and decreases in GABAA and muscarinic receptors induced by cycloheximide. The effects of N-(2,6-dimethyl-phenyl)-2-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)-acetamide [DM-9384], a cyclic derivative of GABA, were investigated in the cycloheximide (CXM)-induced amnesia animal model using the passive avoidance task. Pre- and post-training and pre-retention test administration of DM-9384 attenuated the CXM-induced amnesia as indicated by prolongation of step-down latency. Aniracetam, another cyclic derivative of GABA, also showed antiamnesic effects. Scopolamine, a muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist, and the GABA antagonists, picrotoxin and bicuculline, all antagonized the antiamnesic effects of DM-9384. CXM decreased the number of GABAA and muscarinic ACh receptor binding sites. DM-9384 not only inhibited this effect but actually increased the latter. These results suggest that DM-9384 attenuates CXM-induced amnesia by interacting with GA-BAergic and AChergic neuronal systems and enhancing protein synthesis in the brain. 
Extracellular matrix disruption and pain after eccentric muscle action. Pain, stiffness, and indicators of muscle damage occur at different times after eccentric muscle action. After a single bout of maximal resisted lengthening of the elbow flexors, elbow position, pain perception, and indicators of cellular damage were measured. Immediately postexercise, a significant decrease in resting muscle length was observed that continued to 48 h. At this time, an increase in perceived muscle soreness was noted (P less than 0.05), and a biopsy of the biceps brachii revealed mast cell degranulation, separations of the extracellular matrix from myofibers, and increased plasma constituents in the extracellular space. It is proposed that myofiber disruption allows intracellular proteins to escape and extracellular proteins and ions to enter, causing swelling, whereas the disrupted extracellular matrix initiates the inflammatory response, which includes the release of mast cell granules seen at 48 h postexercise. Thus the delayed sensation of pain (soreness) after repeated eccentric muscle actions probably results from inflammation in response to extracellular matrix disruption. 
Ascitic fluid pH and lactate: insensitive and nonspecific tests in detecting ascitic fluid infection. Ascitic fluid pH and lactate concentration have been proposed as useful tests for the detection of ascitic fluid infection. However, past studies involved small numbers of infected patients, and all did not use optimal culture techniques. This large study was performed using highly sensitive culture methods and sought (a) to compare the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of pH and lactate to that of the ascitic fluid neutrophil count and (b) to determine whether evaluation of ascitic fluid pH or lactate (or arterial-ascitic fluid pH or lactate gradient) would result in improved decision-making regarding empirical treatment of suspected ascitic fluid infection. Analysis of 206 ascitic fluid specimens obtained in 175 patients, including 101 infected specimens, revealed that ascitic fluid (or arterial-ascitic fluid) pH and lactate were less than 50% sensitive in detecting bacterial peritonitis and that these tests did not improve clinical decision-making about empirical treatment of suspected ascitic fluid infection. Although statistically significant differences in ascitic fluid pH were detected between infected samples and control samples, these differences did not appear to be clinically helpful. The ascitic fluid pH was 0% sensitive in detecting the presence of bacteria in the absence of neutrophils (i.e., no such specimens had a pH lower than 7.35). Ascitic fluid pH correlated well with neutrophil count and appears to be, at least in part, an indirect measure of the presence of neutrophils in ascitic fluid. Measurement of pH or lactate (or arterial-ascitic fluid gradients) is not helpful in the clinical management of infected ascitic fluid. 
Stapled ileoanal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis without a temporary diverting ileostomy. Between March 1989 and August 1990, we performed 21 stapled J pouch ileonal procedures (20 ulcerative colitis [UC], 1 familial polyposis [FP]) without an ileostomy in 19, of whom 13 were taking prednisone and eight underwent semi-emergent surgery for uncontrollable bleeding. During the same time, an additional four patients required a standard ileonal procedure. The results of anal manometry and clinical function were compared to 25 patients who had previously undergone mucosal stripping and a sutured J pouch ileoanal anastomoses with a temporary diverting ileostomy between October 1982 and August 1990. During this same time period, an additional 19 patients underwent an anti-peristaltic reversed J pouch and 18 an S pouch, for a total of 83 ileoanal procedures. The reversed J pouch had a lower stool frequency than a standard J pouch but had an unacceptable incidence of complications and problems with pouch emptying. The S pouch had a stool frequency similar to the standard J pouch but provided greater length in patients with a short mesentery. Stapled J pouch ileoanal patients had a better (p less than 0.02) maximum and sphincter resting pressure (46 +/- 11 versus 34 +/- 12 mmHg), fewer (p less than 0.05) night-time accidents (22% versus 68%), daytime (17% versus 55%) or night-time (28 versus 61%) spotting, or use of a protective pad at night (11% versus 42%) than nonstapled J pouch ileoanal patients. Stool frequency was similar in the two groups. All but one UC patient had residual disease at the anastomosis. Anal mucosa between the dentate line and stapled anastomosis was 1.8 +/- 1.3 cm (range, 0 to 3.5 cm). Complications in the nonstapled J pouch group included 4 pouches excised (2 for complications, 2 for excessive stool frequency), 1 pelvic abscess, 2 stenosis requiring dilation under anesthesia, 1 enterocutaneous fistula after ileostomy closure, 1 ileostomy site hernia, and 2 small bowel obstructions. Of the 65 patients who underwent ileostomy closure in the entire series, 8 (12%) developed a complication requiring surgical intervention. Complications in the stapled group included 1 anastomotic leak, 1 pouch leak, and 1 pelvic abscess. Patients were managed successfully with drainage (all 3) and diverting ileostomy (1). One patient developed stenosis requiring dilation under anesthesia. The stapled J pouch ileoanal anastomosis is a simpler, safer procedure with less tension than a standard handsewn J pouch but leaves a very small cuff of residual disease. It provides significantly better stool control and may obviate the need for an ileostomy with its complications. 
Diastolic perfusion time at ischemic threshold in patients with stress-induced ischemia BACKGROUND. To evaluate the relevance of diastolic perfusion time on the mechanisms underlying stress-induced ischemia, 16 patients with coronary artery disease and seven patients with syndrome X underwent five randomized stress tests (upright and supine exercise with and without therapy, transesophageal atrial pacing). METHODS AND RESULTS. Exercise duration Time to 0.1 mV ST segment depression, heart rate, rate-pressure product, and diastolic perfusion time were evaluated for each patient during stress tests. In both groups, variability coefficients of the above-mentioned parameters were not different at rest. At ischemic threshold (0.1 mV ST segment depression) in patients with coronary artery disease, the variability coefficient of exercise duration (40.1 +/- 22.2) was significantly higher (p less than 0.0001) than those of heart rate (12.8 +/- 2.9), rate-pressure product (14.8 +/- 3.3), and diastolic perfusion time (0.39 +/- 0.1). The variability coefficient of diastolic perfusion time was also significantly (p less than 0.0001) lower than those of heart rate and rate-pressure product. Similarly, the variability coefficient of diastolic perfusion time (0.44 +/- 0.1) in syndrome X patients was significantly lower (p less than 0.0001) than those of exercise duration (28.2 +/- 9.4), heart rate (12 +/- 1.4), and rate-pressure product (14.6 +/- 1.3). CONCLUSIONS. Fixed diastolic perfusion time at ischemic threshold, despite different kinds of stress tests and variability of heart rate and rate-pressure product, indicates the relevant role of diastolic perfusion time in determining myocardial ischemia. 
Use of recombinant human interferon gamma to enhance neutrophil chemotactic responses in Job syndrome of hyperimmunoglobulinemia E and recurrent infections. Recombinant human interferon gamma enhances neutrophil respiratory burst and bactericidal activity in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. Mononuclear leukocytes of patients with the hyperimmunoglobulinemia E syndrome (Job syndrome) produce low or undetectable levels of this lymphokine. For these reasons we have restudied neutrophil chemotaxis in a group of our patients with the syndrome and determined the effect of recombinant human interferon gamma on the responses. Each of the patients had neutrophil chemotactic responses ranging from 22% to 55% of simultaneous control values (p less than 0.001). After incubation with interferon gamma, a significant improvement in chemotactic responsiveness was observed in the neutrophils of each of the patients (mean 301% of baseline chemotaxis; p less than 0.008). These data suggest the need for a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of interferon gamma in a larger group of patients with the syndrome of hyperimmunoglobulinemia E and recurrent infections. 
Alveolar hydatid disease of the liver: a report on thirty-nine surgical cases in eastern Anatolia, Turkey. The charts of 39 consecutive patients who underwent surgery between 1979 and 1989 with a diagnosis of alveolar hydatid disease (AHD) of the liver were reviewed. The analysis of these cases from eastern Anatolia, which is the endemic region in Turkey, was undertaken to determine the current experience for AHD lesions. Of these patients, 33 (84.6%) had unresectable disease and the remaining six patients (15.4%) were treated by hepatic resection of the primary lesion. In the unresectable cases, laparotomy with biopsy was the most commonly used surgical procedure (56.4%), followed by tube drainage of the necrotic cavity (18.0%), marsupialization (5.1%), and cystojejunostomy (5.1%). Diagnostic studies and operative findings were useful in detecting the AHD lesions. Differential diagnosis was established mainly by histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen or resected tissue. Pulmonary metastases were seen in two cases, and mortality occurred due to brain metastases in two other cases. Mebendazole was administered postoperatively to 19 patients with indications for 1) advanced AHD, 2) adjuvant therapy to radical and palliative surgical procedures, and 3) recurrences of disease after hepatic resection. The patients were treated with daily doses of approximately 50 mg/kg for periods of one and six years (median 3.2 years). Encouraging results were obtained in 11 of nineteen patients. Five-year survival was seen in 8 of the patients with AHD in this series. There were 18 deaths (46.2%) in our 39 patients. Long-term follow-up was not possible in four cases, and 17 patients (43.6%) were still living. The causes of mortality were advanced AHD in 14 cases, brain metastases in two, and acute myocardial infarction in another two. 
Acute pancreatitis and systemic lupus erythematosus: necropsy of a case and review of the pancreatic vascular lesions. The role of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the development of acute pancreatitis is a matter of controversy since, in many cases, this complication has been attributed to the drugs administered. In this study, we present a patient diagnosed as having SLE who developed acute pancreatitis with no apparent cause aside from her basic disease, and in whose necropsy was observed vascular damage consisting of severe intimal proliferation. Pancreatic vascular lesions in previously reported patients with lupus are reviewed. 
No excess prior cancer in patients with uveal melanoma. To determine whether there were more prior cancers in uveal melanoma patients than in a geographically matched control group, the authors compared the history of prior cancer in 407 uveal melanoma patients who lived in the western United States with that of 870 control subjects. Control subjects were selected by random digit dial and frequency-matched for age at diagnosis of patient, race, and sex. Fifty-one (12.5%) patients and 86 (9.9%) control subjects reported skin cancers whereas 25 (6.1%) patients and 47 (5.4%) control subjects reported other cancers. No statistically significant elevated estimates of relative risk (RR) were found for uveal melanoma with history of skin cancer in either men (RR = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-2.3) or women (RR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.58-2.0), or with history of other prior cancer in either sex (men, RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.42-2.2; women, RR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.55-2.1). Data from this study do not support an association between prior cancer and increased risk of uveal melanoma. 
Rehabilitating elderly cardiac patients. The aging cardiovascular system undergoes many anatomic and physiologic changes. Increased vascular resistance, myocardial "stiffness," abnormalities of rhythmicity of the sinoatrial node, irregular cardiac rhythms, and alterations in heart rate and blood pressure responses are all seen more frequently in older patients. These changes are likely to impair these patients' ability to make the rapid adjustments necessary to maintain cardiac output during exercise and activity. When cardiovascular disease processes are superimposed on the "normal" concomitants of aging, greater alterations in hemodynamic response to exercise activity are noted than usually occur in younger cardiac patients. Exercise testing of older cardiac patients is safe and is usually needed to prescribe an appropriate intensity of exercise activity. The choice of the exercise protocol, the timing of the exercise test in relation to taking prescribed cardiac medication, the choice of exercise equipment, and special considerations for devices such as pacemakers and automatic implantable cardiodefibrillators must be considered before the exercise test is done. Many of these factors and the presence of either silent or overt cardiac symptoms or untoward hemodynamic events will also affect the exercise prescription. Elderly patients usually show substantial functional improvement when participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program and comply well with prescribed exercise. Early educational intervention may be crucial to reducing disability in these patients. 
Botulinum toxin treatment of tremors. We report the results of an open trial of botulinum toxin (Botox) in the treatment of 51 patients with disabling tremors, classified as dystonic (14), essential (12), combination of dystonic and essential (22), parkinsonian (1), peripherally induced (1), and midbrain (1). The average age of the patients was 55.8 years, and duration of symptoms was 13.9 years. During a total of 160 treatment visits, an average of 242 +/- 75 units of Botox was injected per visit in cervical muscles of 42 patients with head tremor and 95 +/- 38 in forearm muscles of 10 patients with hand tremor; one patient was injected in both. The average peak effect for all patients was rated as 3.0 (0 to 4 scale). Thirty-five (67%) patients improved (peak effect greater than or equal to 1). The average latency from injection to response was 6.8 days, and the average duration of maximum improvement was 10.5 weeks. Local complications, lasting an average of 20.6 days, were noted in 17 (40%) patients injected for head tremor, consisting chiefly of dysphagia in 12 (29%), transient neck weakness in four (10%), and local pain in two (5%). Six (60%) patients with hand tremor had transient focal weakness. EMG recordings showed decreased amplitude of EMG bursts after Botox treatment. The results of this pilot study indicate that Botox injections can be used to control tremor in patients in whom other forms of therapy have failed. 
Glycerol injection into the trigeminal ganglion provokes a selective increase in human cerebral blood flow. Fourteen patients suffering from idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (refractory to medication) were treated by injection of glycerol into the trigeminal ganglion. The changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) after glycerol injection were quantified by intravenous 133Xe emission tomography. There was a significant 11% (P less than 0.01) increase in ipsilateral CBF and an 8% (P less than 0.05) increase in contralateral CBF 1 h after glycerol injection. The interhemispheric difference was significant (P less than 0.05). The increase was significantly greater in the ipsilateral internal carotid territory, in the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery territories (superficial (P less than 0.05), deep territories (P less than 0.001]. We suggest that these changes are due to the release of substance P and/or calcitonin gene-related peptide, from terminals of the trigeminal-vascular system during glycerol injection. 
Intraoperative localization of colorectal cancers using radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies. Radiation detectors may allow the intraoperative localization of small cancer deposits following administration of radiolabelled tumour-associated antibodies. This technique was evaluated in 16 patients with colorectal tumours (14 cancers, one adenoma, one lipoma) with the 111In-labelled monoclonal antibody (MAb) ICR2 which recognizes the tumour-associated epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). At operation counting was carried out (3 x 20 s per site) using a hand-held radiation probe over the primary lesions and any palpable lymph nodes in the mesocolon. The tumour to normal colon (T/NC) ratio of counts recorded at operation was more than 1.5:1 in eight of the 14 patients with cancer (mean(s.d.), 1.54(0.41):1) and 0.91:1 and 1.06:1 respectively in the two patients with benign tumours. Node to normal colon ratios were higher in lymph nodes containing metastases. The uptake of radiolabelled antibody (T/NC ratio) was higher in EMA-expressing cancers than in those not expressing the target antigen (mean(s.d.), 2.45(0.65):1 versus 1.40(0.20):1, P = 0.019). An abdominal tumour model was also developed. Radioactively filled containers of 0.5-10 ml representing tumour deposits were suspended in a tank of 111In solution representing the background activity found in normal tissues. The ratio of radioactivity in the 'tumour' to that of background varied from 2:1 to 8:1. The 'tumour' was considered to be detectable if the mean counts recorded over the 'tumour' exceeded the mean of counts recorded over background by three standard deviations. At a ratio of 2:1 only 'tumours' greater than 5 ml could be detected with a sodium iodide probe and those over 10 ml could be detected with a cadmium telluride (CdTe) probe. At a ratio of 8:1, 'tumours' of 0.5 ml could be detected with either probe. At all ratios and counting periods the NaI probe was more sensitive than the CdTe. 
Measurement of serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in a patient with congenital agranulocytosis (Kostmann's syndrome). A 12-month-old boy with Kostmann's syndrome was admitted with cavitary pulmonary disease. He had also had bacterial conjunctivitis, periorbital cellulitis, pneumonitis, and otitis media since the age of 10 days. His umbilical cord had not fallen off until he was 3 weeks old. Neutropenia was diagnosed at 4 weeks of age. Antineutrophil antibody studies were negative. A bone marrow aspirate showed granulocytic hypoplasia and a maturation arrest at the promyelocyte stage. Hematopoietic cell culture showed normal numbers of colony-forming units-granulocyte macrophage. Serum granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor level, was 0.24 ng/mL (normal, greater than 0.05 ng/mL). Serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor levels, measured by enzyme immunoassay, were undetectable. The patient was successfully treated with filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), with an increase in the absolute neutrophil count to 10.0 x 10(9)/L. Thus, our case of Kostmann's syndrome appears to represent a defect in regulation or production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. 
Experience with a gastrointestinal marker (51CrCl3) in a combined study of ileal function using 75SeHCAT and 58CoB12 measured by whole body counting. Introduction of a radioactive gastrointestinal marker (51CrCl3) into a combined study (75SeHCAT + 58CoB12) of ileal function by whole body counting has been undertaken. The technique was assessed in 23 subjects (15 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, six on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, and two normal subjects). Mean (SD) 51CrCl3 retention was only 4.1 (6.0)% on day 4, and was similar on day 7 in subjects given a second dose of 51CrCl3 on day 4. Only one subject had more than 20% of 51CrCl3 retention after four days. A 51CrCl3 correction method adequately corrected for colonic hold up of 58CoB12, when compared with final equilibrium values of 58CoB12 retention. Use of the non-absorbed 58CoB12 fraction as a gastrointestinal marker gave good agreement with the 51CrCl3 method in correcting 75SeHCAT values. In all subjects studied, corrections for colonic retention of 75SeHCAT on day 4, were small (less than 7% of dose) and did not affect the assessment of any subject. In conclusion, an additional gastrointestinal marker such as 51CrCl3 is unnecessary in our combined study since that role can be effected, when indicated by the non-absorbed 58CoB12 fraction. 
Cholesterol uptake by human glioma cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis of low-density lipoprotein. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is a carrier of the cholesterol found in human plasma. Cells utilize cholesterol for membrane synthesis by taking up LDL via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the present study, interactions of LDL with human malignant glioma cell lines (U-251 MG and KMG-5) were investigated biochemically and morphologically. The LDL, labeled with the fluorescent dyes 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), was internalized by both cell processes and cell bodies. Reductive methylation of DiI-labeled LDL, which abolishes the ability of the cell to bind to the LDL receptor, prevented the internalization of the cholesterol moiety of LDL. Cellular binding of 125I-LDL to U-251 MG cells at 4 degrees C revealed the presence of a specific saturable-associated receptor (dissociation constant (Kd) approximately 38 micrograms/ml). Endocytic uptake of 125I-LDL or 3H-cholesterol oleate-labeled LDL (3H-LDL) at 37 degrees C demonstrated the cell-associated 125I-LDL and 3H-LDL increase. The intracellular degradation of protein moiety increased linearly with time. Reductive methylation of 3H-LDL led to a remarkable decrease in the cell-associated cholesterol moiety of LDL. The difference in uptake of the cholesterol moiety of LDL between U-251MG cells and KMG-5 cells showed that the U-251MG cells, which proliferate more actively than KMG-5 cells, take up more of the cholesterol moiety of LDL than do the KMG-5 cells. Thus, LDL cholesterol seems to be endocytosed predominantly via the LDL receptor present on the plasma membrane of malignant glioma cells. In addition, for growth, these cells may require large amounts of the cholesterol moiety of LDL. 
The changing pattern of infective endocarditis in childhood. Forty-eight cases of infective endocarditis (IE) that occurred in 42 patients with congenital heart disease were reviewed from 1970 through 1990 and were compared with a 20-year review of 108 cases diagnosed between 1953 and 1972. The review demonstrates that the natural history of IE in children has changed over the last 2 decades, with half of the cases occurring after surgery for congenital heart disease. In the postoperative group, 46% of patients had undergone valve replacement and 7 of these (29%) had a right ventricular to pulmonary artery valved conduit as the site for IE, suggesting significant additional risk in this setting. Among patients with nonsurgically treated congenital heart disease and IE, mitral valve prolapse has emerged as an important underlying heart lesion occurring in 29% of patients. The bacterial spectrum has shifted, with a significant increase in the incidence of uncommon causative organisms. Mortality has continued to decline with survivorship of 90% in this series. 
Hip disarticulation: factors affecting outcome. Hip disarticulation, especially in patients with peripheral vascular disease, has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This report describes patient characteristics that influence the clinical outcome of hip disarticulation. The medical records of all patients undergoing hip disarticulation from 1966 to 1989 were reviewed for surgical indication, perioperative wound complications, and postoperative deaths. Fifty-three patients underwent hip disarticulation for limb ischemia (10), infection (12), infection and ischemia (14), or tumor (17). The overall incidence of wound complications was 60%, and no significant differences were found among the groups. Prior above-knee amputation and urgent/emergent operations were significantly associated with increased wound complications (p less than 0.05). The overall mortality rate was 21%, ranging from 0% (tumor) to 50% (ischemia) and differed significantly among the groups (p less than 0.02). Mortality was significantly associated with urgent/emergent operations (p less than 0.01). Age, diabetes mellitus, and previous inflow procedures did not influence mortality rates. The presence of limb ischemia influenced mortality rates to a greater extent than did infection, and a history of cardiac disease was statistically predictive of death. Wound complications frequently accompanied hip disarticulation, regardless of operative indication, and were significantly increased by urgent/emergent operations and prior above-knee amputation. Hip disarticulation can be performed with low mortality rates in selected patients. Both limb ischemia and infection substantially increase operative mortality rates. 
Treatment of hypertensive urgencies with oral nifedipine, nicardipine, and captopril. Sixty-five patients with uncomplicated hypertensive urgencies were treated in the emergency and cardiology departments with 20 mg nifedipine, 20 mg nicardipine, or 25 mg captopril in a randomized study. The study population consisted of 65 patients ranging in age from forty-one to seventy-one. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed for six hours after intake of the antihypertensive agents. Within sixty minutes nifedipine reduced blood pressure by an average of 74.7 mmHg for the systolic and 35.4 mmHg for the diastolic. Average heart rate increased significantly by 11.6 beats/min at within thirty minutes. Nicardipine and captopril produced equivalent falls in systolic (-81.6 and -79.4 mmHg) and diastolic (-37.3 and -33 mmHg) blood pressure respectively, but did not increase heart rate significantly. The antihypertensive effect of each drug was maintained until six hours after medication. In conclusion, nifedipine, nicardipine, and captopril show similar efficacy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies. The authors believe that these drugs can be used as first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies safely and effectively. 
Linkage analysis in spinal muscular atrophy, by six closely flanking markers on chromosome 5. The proximal spinal muscular atrophies (SMA) represent the second most common autosomal recessive disorder, after cystic fibrosis. The gene responsible for chronic SMA has recently been mapped to chromosome 5q by using genetic linkage studies. Among six markers mapping to this region, five were shown to be linked with the SMA locus in 39 chronic SMA families each containing at least two affected individuals. Multilocus analysis by the method of location score was used to establish the best estimate of the SMA gene location. Our data suggest that the most likely location for SMA is between loci D5S6 and D5S39. The genetic distances between these two markers are estimated to be 6.4 cM in males and 11.9 cM in females. Since meiosis were informative with D5S39 and D5S6 in 92% and 87% of SMA families, respectively, it is hoped that the present study will contribute to the calculation of genetic risk in SMA families. 
Neonatal diaphragmatic paralysis caused by chest drains. A boy delivered at 32 weeks' gestation developed bilateral pneumothoraces that required multiple chest drains. He was dependent on the ventilator for 52 days because of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. Electrophysiological studies confirmed phrenic nerve damage. He eventually made a full recovery. It is likely that this damage was caused by the insertion of the chest drains. 
Clinical follow-up and progression of carotid atherosclerosis determined by duplex scanning in patients suffering from TIA. We investigated the clinical outcomes and the progression of the internal carotid arterial lesions of a group of patients presenting with hemispheric TIAs. The cumulative frequency of TIAs during a mean follow-up period of 40 +/- 14 months was 14%, and no relationship was found between new TIAs and the presence of known cardiovascular risk factors or plaque characteristics as determined by duplex scanning. With the exception of one patient who died of stroke, none of the patients developed a permanent neurologic deficit. The cumulative death rate was 6.5%; myocardial infarction was the most common cause (3 out of 7). Anatomic progression of plaques was determined by duplex scanning in 22% of the internal carotid arteries. No relationship between progression of these plaques and the development of new TIAs was evident. We conclude that, in this group of patients, TIAs do not inevitably lead to stroke and that TIAs are not predictable based on risk factors or plaques characteristics. 
Knowledge of diagnosis and reproductive history among survivors of childhood plumbism. As part of a study of the long-term consequences of childhood plumbism, 35 survivors of lead poisoning in the period 1930 through 1944 were interviewed along with 22 controls matched for age, sex, and town of residence. Subjects were asked to recall all pregnancies they engendered (men) or carried (women), outcome, and intellectual development of resulting children. Matched female plumbism subjects reported a higher proportion of spontaneous abortion or stillbirths among pregnancies (relative risk = 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-4.0) and a higher proportion of learning disabilities among school-age children (relative risk = 3.0, 95% CI = 0.9-10.2) in comparison with their controls. There was no evidence of clustering of learning disabilities within families or confounding by parental educational level. These results suggest that women with a history of childhood lead poisoning may be at risk for having spontaneous abortions or stillbirths and having children who manifest significant learning disabilities. 
Heparin treatment in sinus venous thrombosis. Treatment of sinus venous thrombosis (SVT) is controversial. Although heparin has been used for this condition, many investigators have opposed its use because of the frequent occurrence of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and SVT. Therefore we have evaluated anticoagulation with adjusted-dose intravenous heparin for treatment of aseptic SVT in a randomised, blinded (patient and observer), placebo-controlled study in 20 patients (10 heparin, 10 placebo). The clinical course of the two groups, as judged by a newly designed SVT-severity scale, started to differ in favour of the heparin group after 3 days of treatment (p less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test) and the difference remained significant (p less than 0.01) after 8 days of treatment. After 3 months, 8 of the heparin-treated patients had a complete clinical recovery and 2 had slight residual neurological deficits. In the placebo group, only 1 patient had a complete recovery, 6 patients had neurological deficits, and 3 patients died (p less than 0.01, modified Fisher's exact test). An additional retrospective study on the relation between heparin treatment and ICH in SVT patients was based on 102 patients, 43 of whom had an ICH. 27 of these patients were treated with dose-adjusted, intravenous heparin after the ICH. Of these 27 patients, 4 died (mortality 15%), and 14 patients completely recovered. Of the 13 patients that did not receive heparin after ICH, 9 died (mortality 69%) and only 3 patients completely recovered. We conclude that anticoagulation with dose-adjusted intravenous heparin is an effective treatment in patients with SVT and that ICH is not a contraindication to heparin treatment in these patients. 
Computer- and robot-assisted resection of thalamic astrocytomas in children. Six children ranging in age from 2 to 10 years who harbored deep benign astrocytomas were operated upon using a computer- and robot-assisted system. A radical excision was achieved in all cases with no significant morbidity nor any mortality. The system consists of an interactive, three-dimensional display of computed tomographic image contours and digitized cerebral angiograms taken using the Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic frame. The surgical retractor is held and manipulated using a PUMA 200 robot. The position and orientation of the surgical retractor is displayed on the three-dimensional display. Preoperative planning and simulation are important features of this system. Movement of the brain after removal of the tumor and cerebrospinal fluid is substantial, so the tumor removal is based on visually defined margins. Enhanced computer graphics and robotic devices are important adjuncts to neurosurgical procedures and will find increasing use in the future. 
Reversal of a dense, persistent, holohemispheric neurological deficit after an endarterectomy of the carotid artery: case report. The role and timing of a carotid endarterectomy in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke-in-evolution remain controversial. Although computed tomographic (CT) scans typically show no abnormalities in the acute stage, it is generally agreed that a dense neurological deficit (hemiplegia) and/or multiple modality neurological disturbance (involving motor, sensory, gaze, and visual field impairment) represent contraindications to surgical intervention. We present a case of an acute right holohemispheric neurological deficit including dense hemiplegia, hemisensory loss, gaze disturbance, hemineglect, and impaired level of consciousness. This persisted for 4 days while serial CT scans showed no evidence of infarction. Angiography revealed pre-occlusive stenosis of the right internal carotid artery with sluggish antegrade flow. The anterior collaterals of the circle of Willis were impaired, and the right middle cerebral artery territory filled via the posterior communicating artery. Despite the dense neurological deficit persisting for 4 days, a carotid endarterectomy was performed. Gradual neurological improvement was noted within hours of the operation, and all neurological deficits resolved within the subsequent 3 days. This case is consistent with prolonged holohemispheric hemodynamic compromise below the threshold of neurological dysfunction, but above the threshold of tissue infarction ("idling neurons"). Features assisting in the recognition of this unusual scenario and the indications and risks of revascularization in this setting are discussed. 
Cocaine-associated chest pain. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical and ECG features of cocaine abusers evaluated in the emergency department and admitted to the medical coronary care unit with chest pain consistent with myocardial ischemia. DESIGN: A four-month retrospective review of all cocaine abusers who presented to the ED with chest pain and a diagnosis of possible myocardial infarction. SETTING: Urban county hospital. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight adult cocaine abusers admitted with chest pain. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients included 34 men and 14 women with a mean age of 29 +/- 7.3 years. The average duration of cocaine abuse in 28 patients for whom it was reported was 5 +/- 4.8 years. Chest pain occurred within one hour of cocaine abuse in 13 admissions (27%), more than one hour after abuse in 13 admissions (27%), and it was not recorded in 23 admissions (47%). Initial ECGs were evaluated in all patients and revealed significant repolarization abnormalities consisting of abnormal ST segment elevations in 18 (37%) and T-wave inversions in 20 (41%) that often persisted on subsequent ECGs. Three patients sustained acute myocardial infarctions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm a small but significant incidence of myocardial infarction in cocaine abusers presenting to the ED with chest pain. The chronicity of cocaine abuse, the persistence of ECG abnormalities, and the variable temporal relationship of chest pain to cocaine abuse suggest possible chronic myocardial changes as etiologies of ischemia. 
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of proximal subclavian artery stenosis after left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery bypass surgery. A patient is described who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, through a brachial approach, of a high grade stenosis at the proximal portion of the left subclavian artery 1.5 years after coronary artery bypass grafting including left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery anastomosis. Symptoms of class IV angina, vertebrobasilar insufficiency and occupational arm claudication that developed after bypass surgery were promptly relieved after balloon dilation. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian artery can be performed safely and provides an alternative to carotid-subclavian or axillary-axillary bypass surgery for treatment of internal mammary artery graft malfunction. 
Plasma levels of an endogenous Na(+)-K+ pump inhibitor in relation to haemodynamic data in cardiopathic patients. 1. Despite the fact that numerous studies provide evidence for the existence of an endogenous inhibitor of the cell membrane Na(+)-K+ pump in plasma, little is known about the relationships between this factor and the main haemodynamic parameters. 2. In order to shed some light on this, we attempted to correlate haemodynamic parameters, measured during heart catheterization in a group of 22 cardiopathic subjects, with plasma digitalis-like activity levels, determined by two different procedures. 3. The ability of plasma to inhibit a human renal Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase showed an inverse correlation with cardiac index and a direct correlation with peripheral resistance. Plasma cross-reactivity with digoxin antibodies correlated directly with left atrial pressure. 4. These results furnish confirmation of a number of theoretical assumptions which attribute to the digitalis-like factor the ability to modify the contractility of the cardiovascular system. 
Nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill: product of aspiration or translocation? OBJECTIVE: To examine the possibility that nosocomial pneumonias might be caused by the translocation of enteric bacteria and their toxins. DESIGN: Prospectively collected previous database was examined by logistic regression analysis. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty-two ICU patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The best stand-alone predictors for nosocomial pneumonia were bleeding from stress ulceration (p less than .001), the severity of illness present (p less than .001), and intramucosal acidosis in the stomach (p = .023), a metabolic indication of mucosal ischemia. Mechanical ventilation (p = .038) and the administration of antacids/cimetidine (p = .054) were also of stand-alone predictive value, but did not significantly improve the best predictive model for nosocomial pneumonia derived from the severity of illness present and the intramucosal pH in the stomach. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ischemic mucosal injury and its associated translocation of enteric bacteria and toxins might be more important in the pathogenesis of nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill than the aspiration of contaminated nasopharyngeal secretions. 
Female DUI offenders: a comparison to male counterparts and an examination of the effects of intervention on women's recidivism rates. Female DUI offenders who participated in a controlled, random assignment DUI intervention study, the Mississippi DUI Probation Follow-Up Project, were compared to their male counterparts on demographic, drinker status and recidivism variables. In comparison to men, women in the project were less likely to be married, more likely to be between 30 and 50 years of age, less likely to have less than a 9th grade education, less likely to be screened as a high-problem-risk drinker, less likely to have prior DUI and public drunkenness arrests and less likely to recidivate. The effects of short-term rehabilitation, 1 year's probation and administration of the Life Activities Inventory-Current Status Questionnaire (LAI-CSQ) on the long-term recidivism rates of women were examined. The analysis for screened low-problem-risk women was inconclusive due to lack of statistical power. However, the repeated administration of the LAI-CSQ was detrimental for screened high-problem-risk women and tended to be detrimental for women with fewer than 12 years of education. Implications for intervening with female DUIs are discussed. 
Risk of peritonitis and fatal septicaemia and the need to defunction the low anastomosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the need to defunction the low anastomosis after anterior resection of the rectum with total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. Two hundred consecutive patients (125 defunctioned, 75 non-defunctioned) undergoing low anterior resection for carcinoma were included in the study. Peritonitis requiring emergency laparotomy occurred in 8 per cent of the patients who did not have a defunctioning stoma compared with less than 1 per cent of those patients who had a defunctioning stoma (P less than 0.01). There was no mortality related to closure of the stoma but seven patients developed a faecal fistula and ten developed an incisional hernia. Despite current trends to avoid the defunctioning stoma, these results suggest that after total mesorectal excision the faecal stream should be temporarily diverted away from the anastomosis that is 6 cm or less from the anal verge to protect against potentially life-threatening anastomotic leakage. 
Laser laparoscopic vagotomy and pyloromyotomy. We performed bilateral truncal vagotomy and gastric drainage procedure using standard laparoscopic instruments in five mongrel dogs. The procedure consisted of a transthoracic thoracoscopic bilateral truncal vagotomy and transperitoneal laparoscopic pyloromyotomy. A contact Nd:YAG laser fiber was used. There was no mortality, minimal morbidity, and post-operative gastric emptying was satisfactory. Pathologic studies indicated vagotomy was complete. We believe that this may be the initial step in the development of a simple, safe, and effective endoscopic procedure for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. 
Reoperations for late complications following abdominal aortic operation. Fifty patients were identified who, following abdominal aortic operation, developed late complications affecting the vascular graft or endarterectomy and who underwent their first reoperation between 1979 and 1989. Thrombosis was the commonest complication affecting 28 (56 per cent) patients, followed by false aneurysm in 11 (22 per cent), enteric fistula in nine (18 per cent) and graft infection in two (4 per cent). The 30-day mortality rate for reoperation was 8 per cent; longer follow-up revealed mortality rates of 22, 50 and 63 per cent at 1, 3 and 5 years respectively. Thirty-four complications required reoperation within 5 years of the original surgery. Reoperation was needed for 35 patients whose original pathology was occlusive disease and for 15 whose original pathology was aneurysm. The nature of the complication was related to initial pathology; thrombosis was far commoner in those with occlusive disease, and enteric fistula and false aneurysm were commoner in those with aneurysmal disease. 
Delayed cardiac rupture due to blunt chest trauma. A 7-year-old boy fell from a 2.5-m height and suffered contusion of the thorax with hematoma in the soft tissues of the lateral chest wall. The rib cage itself remained intact. After 3 days, there was only local pressure sensitivity of the left hemithorax. On day 8 after the trauma, the child, who up to then had seemed to be in good health, suddenly died during lessons at school. Autopsy revealed a full-thickness rupture of the left ventricle with resultant cardiac tamponade. The macroscopic and histopathologic findings are presented and discussed. 
Frequency of adverse systemic reactions after fluorescein angiography. Results of a prospective study. Intravenous fluorescein angiography is a commonly performed and extraordinarily valuable diagnostic procedure. The frequency of adverse reactions after angiography has varied considerably in previous reports. In a prospective study of 2789 angiographic procedures in 2025 patients, the authors found that the percentage of adverse reactions depended strongly on the patient's angiographic history. Overall, adverse reactions followed 4.8% of the angiographic procedures. These reactions included nausea (2.9%), vomiting (1.2%), flushing/itching/hives (0.5%), and other reactions (dyspnea, syncope, excessive sneezing) (0.2%). No cases of anaphylaxis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, or seizures occurred. The percentage of reactions was 1.8% for patients who had had previous angiography without ever having had an adverse reaction. In contrast, the percentage of reactions was 48.6% for patients who had had an adverse reaction to angiography previously. 
Cerebrospinal fluid interleukins, immunoglobulins, and fibronectin in neuroborreliosis. Intrathecal synthesis of IgM and IgG, oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands, and the levels of fibronectin, soluble interleukin 2 receptor, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were investigated with the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 46 paired cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples from 32 patients with meningopolyradiculoneuritis due to Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme borreliosis stage 2). Cerebrospinal fluid and serum interleukin 6, although not specific for neuroborreliosis, were good indicators of disease activity, while the serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor level was only mildly elevated. Tumor necrosis factor alpha was never detected in cerebrospinal fluid or serum specimens, and cerebrospinal fluid IgM, IgM index, and cerebrospinal fluid IgM/cerebrospinal fluid IgG ratios were significantly higher than in all other neuroimmunologic disorders evaluated and may be valuable diagnostic indicators for neuroborreliosis. The estimation of intrathecally synthesized IgG and IgM fractions for the differential diagnosis of neuroimmunologic disorders did not add to IgG and IgM index calculations. 
Hippocampal degeneration differentiates diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) from Alzheimer's disease: light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry of CA2-3 neurites specific to DLBD. Immunocytochemistry with antibodies to ubiquitin is currently the most sensitive method for detecting cortical Lewy bodies, which are a sine qua non for the diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), an increasingly recognized form of primary degenerative dementia. In the systematic application of ubiquitin immunocytochemistry to sections of hippocampus from control subjects and patients with a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, we noted the frequent occurrence of ubiquitin-immunoreactive neurites in the CA2-3 region in DLBD. The nature of these neurites was investigated with immunocytochemistry in DLBD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), normal elderly subjects, and Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the number of neurites varied from case to case, they were virtually always detected in DLBD but not in normal, AD, or PD brains. Double immunolabeling studies with anti-ubiquitin demonstrated a small fraction of double-stained neurites with antibodies to neurofilament or Alz-50, but no double staining with an antibody to Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles. These results are different from those for neurites in AD, which are rarely seen in CA2-3 and which are immunoreactive with all these antibodies. Neuritic degeneration in the CA2-3 region of the hippocampus appears to be a specific histopathologic feature of DLBD. 
Pregnancy after myocardial infarction: are we playing safe? The safety of pregnancy after myocardial infarction remains a significant dilemma for both the obstetrician and the cardiologist. Only 20 cases of pregnancy after myocardial infarction have been reported. To clarify this problem, we add our experience of four such cases in which conception occurred 9 months to 9 years after myocardial infarction with no previous consultation. Each woman had an uneventful pregnancy with no cardiac or obstetric complications related to the myocardial infarction. All patients were under the strict supervision of an obstetrician and a cardiologist during pregnancy in our conjoined antepartum-cardiologic clinic. The mode of delivery in all patients was related to the obstetric indications. Our experience and the accumulated experience in the literature demonstrate good prognosis for patients who conceive after myocardial infarction. 
The effect of the pneumatic antishock garment (PASG) on hemodynamics, hemorrhage, and survival in penetrating thoracic aortic injury. To determine if the increased blood pressure associated with application of a pneumatic antishock garment (PASG) affects outcome in thoracic hemorrhage, we assessed hemodynamics, blood loss, and survival in three groups of eight anaesthetized piglets with a 2.5-mm laceration of the descending thoracic aorta. Baseline measurements were made before aortic hemorrhage. During one hour of aortic hemorrhage or until death of the animal, the PASG was not inflated in Group I while the PASG in the other two groups was inflated to maintain carotid artery pressure at 15 torr below baseline (Group II) and at baseline (Group III), respectively. Survival was 100% in Group I, 50% in Group II, and 0% in Group III. Hemorrhage at 22.5 +/- 4.0 mL/min stopped after 18-24 minutes in Group I; the survivors in Group II bled at a rate of 32.5 +/- 3.0 mL/min compared with 43.6 +/- 4.0 mL/min over 26-35 minutes in the Group II nonsurvivors. Group III pigs bled at 107.5 +/- 8.0 mL/min over the 10-18 minutes of survival. The intended blood pressure could not be maintained beyond 30 minutes. Bleeding stopped in Group I when the blood pressure fell to 58.2 +/- 4.5 torr from a baseline of 119.0 +/- 10.0 torr. The blood pressure fell to 48.0 +/- 5.0 torr in the four Group-II survivors. After a transient maintenance of baseline blood pressure in Group III, a precipitous drop in blood pressure with death in 10-18 minutes occurred in all these animals. In this porcine model of thoracic aortic injury, PASG inflation increases hemorrhage and mortality. 
Soft-tissue sarcoma: MR imaging vs sonography for detection of local recurrence after surgery. To determine the value of MR and sonography in detecting local recurrences of soft-tissue sarcomas after surgery, 26 MR and sonographic studies performed in 21 patients were reviewed retrospectively. Recurrences were confirmed histologically in 12 (46%) of 26 studies. The MR images and sonograms were obtained within 1 month of each other. The findings were classified as recurrence, no recurrence, or indeterminate. Sonography was instrumental in guiding fine-needle aspiration biopsy of impalpable lesions. In two cases, the findings on sonography were indeterminate. In both of these cases, the sonograms had been obtained soon after surgery (at 2 and 4 months). The sensitivity and specificity in the detection of local recurrences were 83% and 93%, respectively, for MR and 100% and 79%, respectively, for sonography. These differences were not statistically significant. We conclude that MR and sonography appear to be equally useful in the detection of local recurrences of soft-tissue sarcomas, sonography can be used for routine follow-up and in guiding needle biopsies, sonography may be more difficult to interpret than MR during the early postoperative period, and MR should be used if sonography is inconclusive. 
Circulating and tissue endothelin immunoreactivity in advanced atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND. Atherosclerosis is characterized by endothelial injury and the proliferation of arterial smooth-muscle cells. The latter may be a result of the release of growth factors from the vessel wall; such growth factors may include an endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor for peptide with mitogenic properties. We tested the hypothesis that plasma endothelin concentrations are elevated in persons with symptomatic atherosclerosis, independently of age. METHODS. We measured plasma endothelin levels in 100 normal subjects and in 40 patients with atherosclerosis predominantly of the following types: aortic and peripheral vascular disease (14 patients), renovascular disease (9 patients) coronary artery disease (9 patients), and carotid disease (8 patients). We also performed immunohistochemical staining for endothelin in the walls of atherosclerotic vessels. RESULTS. In the normal subjects, the mean (+/- SD) plasma endothelin concentration was 1.4 +/- 0.2 pmol per liter, with no correlation between age and plasma endothelin concentration (r = 0.13, P = 0.2). In the patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis, the mean plasma endothelin concentration was 3.2 +/- 1.2 pmol per liter (P less than 0.001), and there was a significant correlation between plasma endothelin and the number of sites of disease involvement (r = 0.89, P less than 0.001). In the immunohistochemical studies, endothelin-1-like immunoreactivity was observed in vascular smooth muscle as well as in endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS. Endothelin may be a marker for arterial vascular disease. Whether it participates in the atherogenic process or is merely released from damaged endothelial cells is unclear. 
Acute cutaneous vasculitis associated with prolonged intravenous ritodrine hydrochloride therapy. A patient with twin gestation was hospitalized because of preterm labor and treated with intravenous ritodrine hydrochloride (Yutopar, Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Westborough, Mass.). After greater than 4 weeks of therapy, the patient had a petechial rash and prolonged bleeding time, which were diagnosed and confirmed by skin biopsy at cesarean section as vasculitis. This is the first documented case of vasculitis associated with ritodrine use. 
Defining the proper role for self-administered sublingual nitroglycerin. A survey of physicians and patients. Within a half-year period, we encountered six cases of patients harmed by the adverse effects of self-administered nitroglycerin--syncope, delayed definitive medical care, and the worsening of nonischemic symptoms. We therefore surveyed 112 patients after a remote myocardial infarction, and 121 cardiologists and internists, regarding the use of sublingual nitroglycerin. Of the physicians, 84 percent routinely prescribed nitroglycerin to patients after a myocardial infarction, and 79 percent of the patients had the tablets available (83 percent of these, at all times). Most patients used the tablets less than once per month, and 37 percent of the patients who always carried nitroglycerin had not used it at all during the preceding year. Although 89 percent of the patients claimed to know when to use the drug, 57 percent had used it or would use it for symptoms such as dizziness, rapid heartbeat, or presyncope. All patients having nitroglycerin claimed it relieved their symptoms, even if the relief was only partial, the time elapsed until relief could not be specified, and the symptoms were of a type unlikely to be relieved by the drug. We suggest that the practice of routinely prescribing nitroglycerin to patients after a myocardial infarction should be reassessed. 
A 'stress' test for memory dysfunction. Electrophysiologic manifestations of early Alzheimer's disease. Long-latency event-related potentials (P300) were assessed in patients with early probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), age-matched controls, and young adults during a task that imposed various degrees of demand on memory. Although patients with AD did not differ from age-matched controls when one item had to be remembered, their P300 potential was dramatically reduced in amplitude or absent with increasing memory load. Aged controls did not differ from young adults on this measure. P300 latency, however, did not differentiate patients with AD. Thus, electrophysiological abnormalities detected in the context of mnemonic demand may provide a sensitive marker of the early stages of probable AD. 
In vitro comparison of different gall stone dissolution solvents. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) of gall bladder stones leaves residual fragments that need to be dissolved by chemical solvents. In this study we compared the in vitro dissolving capacity of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), mono-octanoin, limonene, and limonene/mono-octanoin (70%/30%). From nine sets of five human gall stones obtained at cholecystectomy, four stones were used for dissolution and the fifth was used for chemical analysis of cholesterol, calcium, and bilirubin contents. Eight sets were cholesterol stones with a mean (SD) cholesterol content of 89.9 (5.6)%. These stones dissolved completely in either solvent, often leaving sand-like debris, with the exception of one stone. MTBE dissolved cholesterol gall stones 100 times faster than mono-octanoin and 10 times faster than limonene or the limonene/mono-octanoin mixture (p less than 0.001). The combination of limonene and mono-octanoin was as effective as limonene alone. Of the four solvents, MTBE is the best one to evaluate for dissolution of residual fragments after ESWL treatment of gall bladder stones. 
Changes in the serum levels of CK-MB, LDH, LDH1, SGOT and myoglobin due to cardiac surgery. Elevation of serum levels of enzymes due to myocardial necrosis is considered to be a specific finding for myocardial infarction. This study was designed to determine the changes in the levels of LDH, SGOT enzymes, LDH1, CK-MB isoenzymes and myoglobin in patients who have had coronary bypass grafting and who have had atriotomy for surgical correction without any evidence of myocardial infarction diagnosed by clinical, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic findings. It was found that CK-MB, LDH, LDH1 and myoglobin showed significant elevations which mimicked a perioperative myocardial infarction. SGOT also increased, but remained within the normal range. CK-MB, LDH and LDH1 increased more in the coronary bypass grafted patients whereas myoglobin increased in the patients who had atriotomies. It was concluded that in order to demonstrate a perioperative myocardial infarction it is necessary to determine at least two of these enzymes for a long period and to correlate these results with the clinical, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic findings. 
Non-infective verrucous endocarditis in a patient with 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome. A 27-year-old women with 'primary' antiphospholipid syndrome, who developed a haemodynamically significant non-infective verrucous endocarditis is reported. Her mother suffered from antiphospholipid syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. A pathogenetic role of antiphospholipid antibodies in heart valve lesions is suggested. 
The prevention of the maternal manifestations of pre-eclampsia by intensive antihypertensive treatment. The purpose of the study was to determine if reduction of pregnancy hypertension to normal prevented the clinical maternal manifestations of pre-eclampsia. Thirty-six women with hypertension, but without proteinuria, were allotted at random to a test group of 17 who received intensive treatment, and a control group of 19 who were managed according to routine methods by hospital staff unconnected with the study. The development of proteinuria was chosen as an indicator of pre-eclampsia. Proteinuria developed significantly more often in the control group (in six of the 19 women) than in the test group (in one of the 17 women). 
The myth of the aortic annulus: the anatomy of the subaortic outflow tract. Surgical repair of the small aortic root is limited in part by the very structure of the outflow tract from the left ventricle. The root is not constructed on the basis of a ringlike annulus supporting the leaflets of the aortic valve. The only truly circular structure within the outflow tract is the junction of the aortic wall with the underlying ventricular structures, themselves partly muscular and partly fibrous. This circular ventriculoarterial junction is crossed by the semilunar attachments of the leaflets of the aortic valve, producing an interlinking arrangement between the expanded aortic sinuses and three triangles of fibrous tissue placed beneath the apexes of the commissures between the valve leaflets. The triangles form extensions of the left ventricle that are related, in part, to the pericardial cavity surrounding the heart. The arrangements of the attachment of the leaflets in malformed valves with two (or only one) effective leaflets are highly abnormal, although these valves are usually produced on the template of three aortic sinuses. The valve with two leaflets rarely gives problems during childhood. In valves producing "critical stenosis", there is usually only one effective leaflet, a condition due to incomplete liberation of two of the anticipated three commissures. Detailed study shows that, in these malformed hearts, the attachment of the leaflets is much more annular than in normal valves, with inadequate formation of the fibrous triangles. 
Treatment of acute systemic toxicity after the rapid intravenous injection of ropivacaine and bupivacaine in the conscious dog. Two groups of six beagle dogs received rapid intravenous (IV) injections of ropivacaine or bupivacaine on two occasions in a blinded random fashion. Initially, a dose sufficient to cause convulsions (CD) was given followed by twice the CD (2 x CD), which was administered 48 h later. The CD of bupivacaine (4.3 mg/kg) and ropivacaine (4.9 mg/kg) caused significant (P less than 0.05) increases in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. There was no difference between drug groups. Seizures were abolished by 10 mg/kg of intravenous thiamylal. Endotracheal intubation and controlled respiration with O2-enriched air with no other treatment resulted in rapid and complete recovery in all dogs. All dogs receiving 2 x CD of bupivacaine (8.6 mg/kg) or ropivacaine (9.8 mg/kg) were initially treated with thiamylal and mechanical ventilation. Two dogs in the bupivacaine group developed hypotension, respiratory arrest, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, which were resistant to closed chest cardiac massage, treatment with epinephrine, bretylium, and atropine, and direct current cardioversion. The four remaining dogs in the infusion group were successfully resuscitated. All of the animals in the ropivacaine-treated group survived the administration of the 2 x CD dose. Mild hypotension developed in one dog and was treated with intravenous epinephrine (0.75 mg). This resulted in nodal tachycardia, which was abolished after treatment with bretylium. Another dog had two 1-s bursts of premature ventricular contractions requiring no treatment. The rapid treatment of convulsions and cardiovascular toxicity resulted in a decreased number of deaths in both groups when compared with dogs from a previously published study in which no therapy was instituted. Thus, early aggressive treatment of central nervous system and cardiovascular system toxicity is capable of reducing the incidence of mortality associated with the rapid intravenous administration of excessive doses of local anesthetics. 
Abdominal wall tenderness: a useful sign in chronic abdominal pain. The outcome in 72 patients with obscure abdominal pain and a positive Carnett's (abdominal wall tenderness) test, seen in one firm's surgical outpatient clinic between 1975 and 1983, was sought by a combination of hospital note retrieval and general practitioner questionnaire. Full follow-up data to date or death were available for 58 (81 per cent) patients and partial follow-up for 14 patients. The study showed that the patients generated a good deal of investigation and a number of surgical procedures but that seldom were their symptoms attributable to serious pathology. Familiarity with the test, taken in the context of a proper history and examination, has been found helpful in assessing such patients and saves the inconvenience, expense and occasional hazard of investigation, and even surgery. 
Long-term results after lateral cranial base surgery. The surgical management of patients with slow-growing benign temporal bone neoplasms has been criticized because of its significant morbidity and mortality compared with results after radiation therapy, but long-term control by irradiation remains unproved. Long-term surgical results have not been studied previously. One hundred twenty-nine skull base operations were performed in 126 patients at the Otology Group, Nashville, Tenn., from January 1970 through May 1987. Fifty-eight patients responded to questionnaires focusing on recovery from loss of cranial nerves. All patients regained some degree of facial function (class V or better), no alimentary tubes or tracheotomies were in use, and no patients had debilitating aspiration. Long-term compensation from the cranial nerve deficits of lateral skull base surgery can be expected in most patients and should not be used as an argument for irradiation in patients with a long life expectancy at time of diagnosis. 
Pulsed dye laser lithotripsy of bile duct stones. Efficacy and safety of pulsed dye laser lithotripsy was tested in 25 consecutive patients in whom bile duct stones could not be extracted after endoscopic sphincterotomy. The patients had one to six (mean, 1.8) bile duct stones (diameter, 10-35 mm; mean, 18 mm) located in the common bile duct (18 cases), the intrahepatic bile ducts (6 cases), or in a long cystic duct stump (1 case). Different approaches were tested depending on the presence of a T tube and on the localization of the bile duct stones. When a T tube was present (7 cases), the lithotripsy was performed under direct vision using a choledochoscope inserted through the T-tube tract. In 18 patients without a T tube in place, the lithotripsy was performed under fluoroscopy using a retrograde approach in case of common bile duct stones (14 cases) or under choledochoscopy using a percutaneous transhepatic approach in case of intrahepatic bile duct stones (4 cases). Fragmentation of all the bile duct stones and a complete bile duct clearance were obtained in all 11 cases with procedures performed under direct vision as compared with only 5 of 14 cases with procedures under fluoroscopic control. Moreover, 6 of the 9 failures using the latter approach were offered another session using a choledochoscope inserted through a percutaneous transhepatic tract and were also successfully treated. No complication related to the laser beam was noted. It is concluded that pulsed dye laser lithotripsy of bile duct stones (that are unable to be removed by standard endoscopic techniques) is safe and efficacious provided that it is performed under direct vision. Technical refinements are needed before this procedure can be reliably performed under fluoroscopy. 
Complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy. A prospective series with emphasis on the increased risk associated with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and nondilated bile ducts. Mostly retrospective series with limited use of sphincter of Oddi manometry have indicated that early complications are more common when endoscopic sphincterotomy is performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction than for common duct stones. The current study was undertaken to prospectively evaluate the frequency and type of complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction compared with endoscopic sphincterotomy performed for other conditions. Four hundred twenty-three patients underwent sphincterotomy for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (166), common duct stone(s) (163), tumor (60), and miscellaneous reasons (34). Patients were observed in the hospital for at least 24 hours after the procedure, and 30-day follow-up data were obtained. The overall complication rate was 6.9%, but complications were more frequent when sphincterotomy was performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction than for all other indications (10.8% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.009). Precut sphincterotomy was more frequently required in the sphincter of Oddi dysfunction group (21.1% vs. 11.7%, P = 0.009) but was no more likely to result in a complication (6.2%) than standard sphincterotomy. The risk of a complication was considerable for a small-diameter common bile duct (less than or equal to 5 mm), particularly when sphincterotomy was performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (37.5%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 1.7%, but the procedure-related mortality rate was believed to be 0.2%. It is concluded that endoscopic sphincterotomy for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is more hazardous than for other conditions, particularly when a small common bile duct is present. 
Utilization of bone scans in conjunction with prostate-specific antigen levels in the surveillance for recurrence of adenocarcinoma after radical prostatectomy. Follow-up evaluation of patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy routinely consists of serial bone scintigraphy and, more recently, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. The utility of serial bone scans in combination with PSA levels is retrospectively reviewed in 118 men treated by radical prostatectomy for clinical Stage A or B disease who, at the time of surgery, had no evidence of metastatic disease. Of the 118 patients, 75.4% had no abnormality on either test (mean follow-up 32.4 mo), 9.3% demonstrated a detectable or rising PSA level with negative bone scan (mean follow-up 35 mo), and 8.5% exhibited a detectable and or rising PSA level and positive bone scan (mean follow-up 30.7 mo). Follow-up bone scans were read as either positive or indeterminate with undetectable PSA levels in 6.8% of patients (mean follow-up 27.3 mo). Critical review of the equivocal studies suggests that postoperative PSA levels more truly represent the clinical situation than bone scans. Following radical prostatectomy, routine bone scintigraphy provides little additional information when PSA levels are negative. If PSA becomes detectable or the patient develops symptoms, bone scintigraphy should then be performed. 
Intrahypothalamic clonidine infusion prevents NaCl-sensitive hypertension. We have previously shown that dietary NaCl supplementation increases blood pressure and sympathetic nervous system activity in association with decreased norepinephrine release and increased alpha 2-adrenergic receptor number in the anterior hypothalamic area of salt-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) but not in salt-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-R) or Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Further, acute microinjection of clonidine into the anterior hypothalamic area produced depressor responses that were augmented by high salt feeding in SHR-S but not in SHR-R or WKY rats. The current study tested the hypothesis that chronic infusion of clonidine into the anterior hypothalamic area prevents salt-sensitive hypertension in SHR-S. Beginning at age 7 weeks, immediately before initiation of 1% or 8% salt diets, clonidine (2 ng/min) or saline vehicle was infused into the anterior hypothalamic area or femoral vein of male SHR-S via osmotic minipump for 20 days. In SHR-S fed an 8% salt diet, chronic microinfusion of clonidine into the anterior hypothalamic area offset the hypertensive effect of the dietary salt supplementation and reduced the enhancing effects of dietary salt on left ventricular weight and plasma norepinephrine levels. In contrast, chronic microinfusion of clonidine into the anterior hypothalamic area did not significantly affect any of these measures in 1% salt-fed SHR-S. Intravenous infusion of clonidine at the rate used for the anterior hypothalamic area infusion did not alter any of these measures in 8% salt-fed SHR-S. 
Integration of conservative surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for the treatment of early-stage, node-positive breast cancer: sequencing, timing, and outcome. The optimal means of combining breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with early-stage, node-positive breast cancer is not known. We reviewed the results in 295 patients treated at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy and affiliated institutions from 1976 to 1985. All patients had positive axillary nodes on dissection, had no gross residual disease in the breast or axilla after surgery, and received breast irradiation (with or without nodal irradiation) and three or more cycles of a cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF)-based or doxorubicin-containing regimen. Median follow-up in patients without any failure was 78 months. Breast failure rates were assessed in relation to the sequencing of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The different sequences were not randomly assigned, and the characteristics of the sequence groups differed. The actuarial 5-year breast failure rate was 4% in 99 patients receiving radiotherapy before chemotherapy; 8% in 54 patients sequentially receiving some chemotherapy, then radiotherapy without concurrent chemotherapy, then further chemotherapy; and 6% in 116 patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, the failure rate was 41% in 26 patients who received all chemotherapy before radiotherapy. The crude incidences of local failure within 4 years of treatment in these groups were 3%, 2%, 4%, and 15%, respectively (P = .065 for all four groups not being the same). The actuarial 5-year local failure rate was 5% for 252 patients irradiated within 16 weeks after surgery compared with 35% for 34 patients irradiated more than 16 weeks after surgery. The 4-year crude incidences were 4% and 12% for the two groups, respectively (P = .06). These results suggest that delaying the initiation of radiotherapy may result in an increased likelihood of local failure. Formal randomized controlled trials will be needed to confirm these results and to improve the integration of these treatment modalities. 
Disk drusen and angioid streaks in pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Visual field loss secondary to optic disk drusen became evident before the development of angioid streaks in a patient with pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The incidence of optic disk drusen in cases of pseudoxanthoma elasticum is 20 to 50 times greater than that in the healthy population. We postulate that the abnormal aggregation of macromolecules with a high affinity for calcium (resulting in abnormalities in elastin in cases of pseudoxanthoma elasticum) also develops at the cribriform plate, disrupting axonal flow and leading to disk drusen formation. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is associated with marked cardiovascular and gastrointestinal morbidity. Moreover, macular hemorrhage and precipitation of angioid streaks have frequently been noted after trauma. Prompt diagnosis of pseudoxanthoma elasticum will allow necessary prophylaxis and must be considered in patients with optic disk drusen. 
Prehospital hypertonic saline/dextran infusion for post-traumatic hypotension. The U.S.A. Multicenter Trial. The safety and efficacy of 7.5% sodium chloride in 6% dextran 70 (HSD) in posttraumatic hypotension was evaluated in Houston, Denver, and Milwaukee. Multicentered, blinded, prospective randomized studies were developed comparing 250 mL of HSD versus 250 mL of normal crystalloid solution administered before routine prehospital and emergency center resuscitation. During a 13-month period, 422 patients were enrolled, 211 of whom subsequently underwent operative procedures. Three hundred fifty-nine patients met criteria for efficacy analysis, 51% of whom were in the HSD group. Seventy-two per cent of all patients were victims of penetrating trauma. The mean injury severity score (19), Trauma Score plus Injury Severity Score (TRISS) probability of survival, revised trauma scores (5.9), age, ambulance times, preinfusion blood pressure, and etiology distribution were identical between groups. The total amount of fluid administered, white blood cell count, arterial blood gases, potassium, or bicarbonate also were identical between groups. The HSD group had an improved blood pressure (p = 0.024). Hematocrit, sodium chloride, and osmolality levels were significantly elevated in the Emergency Center. Although no difference in overall survival was demonstrated, the HSD group requiring surgery did have a better survival (p = 0.02), with some variance among centers. The HSD group had fewer complications that the standard treatment group (7 versus 24). A greater incidence of adult respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, and coagulopathy occurred in the standard treatment group. No anaphylactoid nor Dextran-related coagulopathies occurred in the HSD group. Although this trial demonstrated trends supportive of HSD in hypotensive hemorrhagic shock patients requiring surgery, a larger sample size will be required to establish which subgroups of trauma patients might maximally benefit from the prehospital use of a small volume of hyperosmolar solution. This study demonstrates the safety of administering 250 mL 7.5% HDS to this group of patients. 
Management of intraoperative rupture of aneurysm without hypotension. A retrospective analysis was performed on all aneurysms operated on by one of us (SLG) from July 1980 to October 1988 to determine the factors that govern outcome from the intraoperative rupture of aneurysms. A total of 276 consecutive surgical procedures for 317 intracranial aneurysms produced 41 perioperative or intraoperative ruptures for analysis. Five cases were pre-exposure ruptures, 3 of which occurred during anesthetic induction. Four of these patients died, and 1 made a good recovery. Of the remaining 36 cases, outcome was analyzed in terms of the adjuncts used to deal with the intraoperative rupture. There was no statistically significant difference in outcome between those cases in which tamponade was used to control hemorrhage versus temporary clipping; however, those cases in which hypotension was used did less well than those in which it was not used. From October 1986 to October 1988, 108 operations for 132 aneurysms were performed without the use of induced hypotension. There were 16 intraoperative ruptures (14.8%). All 16 of these patients made a good recovery. In the group before 1986, of which there were 20 intraoperative ruptures (of 168 operations, 11.9%), 11 of those 20 patients suffered a permanent deficit or died. We conclude that hypotension may not be a necessary adjunct to the management of intraoperative rupture of aneurysms. 
High frequency of asymptomatic visual field defects in subjects with transient ischaemic attacks or minor strokes. The hypothesis that asymptomatic visual field defects can be found in patients with carotid transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) or minor strokes was tested. Twenty-two consecutive male patients with TIA and 18 patients with minor strokes from the carotid artery territory were examined by perimetry, cerebral computerised tomography and regional cerebral blood flow. Asymptomatic visual field defects were found in many TIA and minor stroke patients, 29% (5/17) and 57% (8/14), respectively (NS). Eighty-five per cent (11/13) of the scotomas were solely or predominantly located in the upper part of the visual field (P = 0.008 for absolute defects and P = 0.03 for relative defects). We conclude that both carotid territory TIA and minor stroke patients have a high frequency of asymptomatic visual field defects, predominantly located in the upper part of the visual field. 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease. When antacids aren't enough. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a very common condition that is usually manifested by heartburn or regurgitation. Reflux esophagitis, caused by mucosal exposure to the backflow of caustic gastric contents, is primarily a result of lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction. Diagnostic workup varies but commonly includes esophagoscopy, 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, and radiography of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Treatment, which progresses from simple life-style changes and antacids to histamine2 receptor antagonists to omeprazole (Prilosec) or surgery, is tailored to individual needs and is generally successful. 
Protruding atheromas in the thoracic aorta and systemic embolization. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether protruding atheromas in the thoracic aorta are a risk factor for systemic embolization. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: A referral hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 122 patients with a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral emboli and an equal number of age- and sex-matched control patients. MEASUREMENTS: Evaluation using transesophageal echocardiography was done in case patients to detect protruding atheromas in the thoracic aorta and in control patients for cardiac indications other than emboli. MAIN RESULTS: Matched logistic regression showed that the presence of protruding atheromas was strongly related to the occurrence of embolic symptoms (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% Cl, 1.6 to 6.5; P less than 0.001). Furthermore, atheromas with mobile components were present only in case patients. When known risk factors for stroke (hypertension and diabetes) were added to the model, the presence of protruding atheromas remained an independent risk factor for embolic symptoms (odds ratio, 3.8). Hypertension was also independently associated with embolic symptoms (odds ratio, 2.7), but diabetes was not (odds ratio, 1.0). CONCLUSION: Protruding atheromas in the thoracic aorta can be detected by transesophageal echocardiography and should be considered as a cause of strokes, transient ischemic attacks, and peripheral emboli. 
The antinociceptive effects of anterior pretectal stimulation in tests using thermal, mechanical and chemical noxious stimuli. Four behavioural tests have been used to study the antinociceptive effects of electrical stimulation of the anterior pretectal nucleus (APtN) in the rat. The antinociceptive effects of stimulating this nucleus, which lies dorsally in the posterior diencephalon, have recently been studied extensively but always using briefly applied heat stimuli. It is reported here that APtN stimulation effectively inhibited responses to briefly applied noxious pressure and longer-lasting noxious chemical (formalin) stimuli. Although the tail-flick reflex to noxious heat was very potently depressed by APtN stimulation, responses to noxious heat in the hot-plate test were not. Three doses of morphine were also studied with each test and it was concluded that 15 sec of 35 microA r.m.s. current into the APtN was as effective as 3-5 mg/kg morphine s.c. in the rat. 
Constipation--some provocative thoughts [editorial] Constipation is a collective term with different definitions and manifestations. In the present communication, I hope to shed light on the pathogenesis, investigation, and treatment of these manifestations. The levator ani is the principal muscle of defecation; together with anorectal reflex actions, it conducts the act of defecation. Strainodynia is the term I give to excessive and exhaustive straining at defecation. Band strainodynia has normal stool character but elevated rectal neck pressure due to the presence of a fibrous band in the rectal neck. Diet strainodynia presents with lower stool weight and frequency than normal; the internal anal sphincter is fibrous. The stools in levator strainodynia have been repeatedly obstructed at defecation due to levator dysfunction. Idiopathic oligofecorrhea or infrequent defecation was studied in 146 patients. Three stages could be identified: the deep and the everted intersphincteric groove and the cone anus. Fecoflowmetry is introduced as a new method for investigating anorectal disorders. It measures the defecated volume per time unit, and provides quantitative as well as qualitative data concerning the act of defecation. Changes in the fecal flow parameters or curve configuration from normal point to a defecation disorder. 
Regional cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in patients with chronic liver disease. Subtle impairments of cognitive function may be an important cause of occupational and psychosocial morbidity in patients with chronic liver disease. Correlation of structural brain abnormalities with cognitive deficits has yielded inconsistent results. 10 patients with cirrhotic liver disease were compared with 10 age, education, and intelligence matched control subjects. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant overall cognitive impairments in cirrhotic patients compared with controls (p = 0.02). Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPET or SPECT) and showed increased uptake of radiotracer in the right and left posterior parts of the basal ganglia and right occipital lobe, together with reduced uptake in the right anterior cingulate region. The degree of cognitive impairment was directly correlated with functional abnormalities in the basal ganglia and limbic cortex (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that impaired cognitive status may be associated with abnormalities of regional brain function in patients with chronic liver disease. Since these deficits are clinically inapparent, our findings have important implications for identification and management of patients with chronic liver disease. 
Thiamine deficiency in patients with congestive heart failure receiving long-term furosemide therapy: a pilot study. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that long-term furosemide therapy in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with clinically significant thiamine deficiency via urinary loss. DESIGN: (1) Biochemical evaluation of thiamine status in hospitalized patients with CHF treated with long-term furosemide and in age-matched control patients. (2) Uncontrolled trial of the effect of intravenous thiamine on cardiac performance in a subset of six patients with CHF. SETTING: General medical ward of a teaching community hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients with chronic CHF receiving furosemide, and 16 age-matched control patients without heart failure and not taking diuretics. Daily furosemide doses were 80 to 240 mg, and duration of furosemide therapy was 3 to 14 months. Patients with identifiable causes of inadequate thiamine intake, absorption, or utilization or increased metabolic requirements were excluded. INTERVENTION: A 7-day course of intravenous thiamine, 100 mg twice daily, in six consenting patients with CHF. RESULTS: A high thiamine pyrophosphate effect (TPPE), indicating thiamine deficiency, was found in 21 of 23 furosemide-treated patients and in two of 16 controls (p less than 0.001). The mean (+/- SE) TPPE (normal: 0% to 15%) in furosemide-treated and control patients was 27.7 +/- 2.5% and 7.1 +/- 1.6%, respectively (p less than 0.001). Despite the high TPPE, the mean (+/- SE) urinary thiamine excretion in the furosemide-treated patients (n = 18) was inappropriately high (defined as greater than 130 micrograms/g creatinine), 410 +/- 95 micrograms/g creatinine, even in comparison with that in the controls (n = 14): 236 +/- 69 micrograms/g creatinine. In six patients treated with intravenous thiamine, the elevated TPPE decreased to normal, from a mean (+/- SE) of 27.0 +/- 3.8% to 4.5 +/- 1.3% (p less than 0.001), indicating normal thiamine utilization capacity. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased in four of five of these patients studied by echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that long-term furosemide therapy may be associated with clinically significant thiamine deficiency due to urinary loss and contribute to impaired cardiac performance in patients with CHF. This deficit may be prevented or corrected by appropriate thiamine supplements. 
Deregulation of a homeobox gene, HOX11, by the t(10;14) in T cell leukemia. Molecular cloning of the t(10;14)(q24;q11) recurrent breakpoint of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has demonstrated a transcript for the candidate gene TCL3. Characterization of this gene from chromosome segment 10q24 revealed it to be a new homeobox, HOX11. The HOX11 homeodomain is most similar to that of the murine gene Hlx and possesses a markedly glycine-rich variable region and an acidic carboxyl terminus. HOX11, while expressed in liver, was not detected in normal thymus or T cells. This lineage-restricted homeobox gene is deregulated upon translocation into the T cell receptor locus where it may act as an oncogene. 
Five-year vascular audit from a district hospital. Vascular patients under the care of one surgeon over a 5-year period have been reviewed, from computer-based discharge records, with regard to in-hospital measures of outcome to determine whether or not surgery was being performed to an acceptable standard. Out of 466 procedures, 30 per cent of patients had at least one complication, 14 per cent had further surgery and 9 per cent died. Outcome was examined within the following treatment groups: aorto/iliac aneurysm, aortofemoral bypass, femoroproximal popliteal bypass, femorodistal popliteal bypass, femorocrural bypass, embolectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Patients having below-knee bypass surgery were found to have an unacceptably high rate of complications, reoperations and amputations. An overall rate of reoperation for postoperative bleeding of 5 per cent was also considered to be high. With these exceptions, it was concluded that the surgery was being performed to an acceptable standard, but that comparative audit of this type remained difficult while there was a deficiency of national statistics against which the work of individual surgeons could be judged. 
Enhanced malignant transformation induced by expression of a distinct protein domain of ribonucleotide reductase large subunit from herpes simplex virus type 2. The 1.3-kilobase (kb) Pst I DNA fragment C (Pst I-C) of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) morphological transforming region III (mtrIII; map unit 0.562-0.570) encodes part of the N-terminal half of the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RR1; amino acid residues 71-502) and induces the neoplastic transformation of immortalized cell lines. To assess directly the role of these RR1 protein sequences in cell transformation, the Pst I-C fragment was cloned in an expression vector (p91023) containing an adenovirus-simian virus 40 promoter-enhancer to generate recombinant plasmid p9-C. Expression of a protein domain (approximately 65 kDa) was observed in p9-C-transfected COS-7 and Rat2 cells but not in those transfected with plasmid pHC-14 (Pst I-C in a promoterless vector). In Rat2 cells, p9-C induced highly transformed foci at an elevated frequency compared with that of pHC-14. Introduction of translation termination (TAG) condons within the RR1 coding sequence and within all three reading frames inactivated RR1 protein expression from p9-C and reduced its transforming activity to the level seen with the standard pHC-14 construct. Wild-type p9-C specified a protein kinase capable of autophosphorylation. Computer-assisted analysis further revealed significant similarity between regions of mtrIII-specific RR1 and amino acid patterns conserved within the proinsulin precursor family and DNA transposition proteins. These results identify a distinct domain of the HSV-2 RR1 protein involved in the induction of enhanced malignant transformation. In addition, the data indicate that the mtrIII DNA itself can induce basal-level transformation in the absence of protein expression. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of plasminogen activator expression in human colorectal carcinomas: correlation with CEA distribution and tumor cell kinetics. Fifty cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma were immunohistochemically examined for the relationship between distribution of plasminogen activators (PAs) and the degree of differentiation of cancer cells as reflected by carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expression as well as tumor cell kinetics. The A chain of urokinase-type PA (u-PA-A) was mainly observed in the apical portions of highly differentiated cancer cells. Increased expression and change in localization to the cytoplasm were found with progressive dedifferentiation. The numbers of DNA polymerase alpha (pol. alpha) positive cancer cells also increased in line with u-PA-A expression. The B chain of u-PA (u-PA-B), and the A and B chains of tissue-type PA (t-PA-A and -B) did not show similar alteration. The present findings suggest that the distribution of u-PA-A in colorectal carcinoma tissues, the degree of tumor differentiation, and the proliferation kinetics of cancer cells are closely related. 
Increased incidence of solid malignant tumors after bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anemia. From May 1980 to December 1989, 107 consecutive patients with non-constitutional severe aplastic anemia underwent bone marrow transplantation at our institution using cyclophosphamide and thoraco-abdominal irradiation as conditioning regimen. During the same period, 40 patients with Fanconi anemia were also grafted after a similar conditioning, giving a total series of 147 patients. With a mean follow-up of 64 months, four male patients developed a solid malignant tumor, a number that leads to an 8-year cumulative incidence rate of 22% (eg, relative risk to general population = 41, P less than .001). These results should be considered as a warning to clinicians who follow these successfully grafted long-term patients. 
Intraventricular blood flow during isovolumetric relaxation and diastole in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Forty patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were investigated by Doppler echocardiography for intraventricular blood flow abnormalities. None had a bundle branch block. The patients were recruited on the basis of the presence of at least one of four different types of abnormal left ventricular blood flow movements during systole, isovolumetric relaxation, and diastole (time after mitral valve opening). The abnormal blood flow patterns were composed of the following: (1) systolic left ventricular outflow and midventricular obstruction in 20 of 40 and in 6 of 40 patients, respectively; (2) retrograde isovolumetric relaxation flow (IVRFretro; mean velocity, 0.7 +/- 0.3 m/sec), that is, flow toward the apex of the left ventricle, in 28 of 40 patients; (3) antegrade isovolumetric relaxation flow (IVRFante; mean velocity, 1.6 +/- 1.0 m/sec), that is, flow toward the left ventricular outflow tract, in 3 of 40 patients; and (4) diastolic antegrade flow (DFante; mean velocity, 0.9 +/- 0.3 m/sec), that is, flow opposite to mitral inflow, in 10 of 40 patients. There were significantly fewer patients with asymmetric septal hypertrophy (group 1) than with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (group 2) showing DFante (1/29 versus 9/11, p less than 0.01). IVRFretro and DFante revealed higher velocities in patients with marked left ventricular asymmetric hypertrophy than in those with mild hypertrophy. Thus, in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and especially in patients with marked asymmetric hypertrophy, there are different types of abnormal intraventricular blood flow movements during isovolumetric relaxation and disatole. This phenomenon is probably caused by asynchronous relaxation of the asymmetrically distributed, hypertrophied myocardium. DFante is more often observed in the apical cardiomyopathy than other forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy probably attributable to apically localized left ventricular cavity obliteration. 
Polycystic ovarian syndrome: safety and effectiveness of stepwise and low-dose administration of purified follicle-stimulating hormone. OBJECTIVE: An attempt to induce ovulation with a single dominant follicle in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients. DESIGN: Comparing ultrasound and estradiol (E2) measurements during treatment with a low-dose protocol (using purified follicle-stimulating hormone, starting with 75 IU/d and increasing every 7 days by 37.5 IU/d) with those obtained following treatment with a conventional protocol using the same drug. SETTING: Specialist Reproductive Endocrine Unit. PATIENTS PARTICIPANTS: Eight PCOS patients of whom six had failed to respond adequately to the conventional protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Rate of cancellation of cycles, number of leading follicles, and serum E2 concentration at the time of ovulation. RESULTS: Treatment with the low-dose protocol resulted in a significant reduction in the number of leading follicles (P less than 0.04), serum E2 concentrations (P less than 0.0002), and a higher rate of ovulation. As a result, five patients conceived compared with none in the conventional protocol. CONCLUSION: Using the low-dose protocol permitted induction of ovulation safely and successfully in a selected group of PCOS patients who were previously difficult to treat with the conventional ovulation induction protocol. 
Therapeutic advances in the prevention of hepatitis B: yeast-derived recombinant hepatitis B vaccines. Viral hepatitis is second to gonorrhea as the most commonly reported infectious disease in the US. Hepatitis B accounts for the majority of viral hepatitis cases. Fortunately, the disease is self-limiting and frequently resolves completely with minimal complications; however, a significant number of individuals may experience long-term sequelae. Research utilizing genetic engineering has led to the development of yeast-derived recombinant DNA (YDR) hepatitis vaccines--a significant advancement in the control and prevention of hepatitis B. The recombinant process allows production of unlimited quantities of vaccine at considerably lower cost and without the potential threat of blood-borne illness. Clinical trials in various high-risk populations have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of YDR vaccines. However, questions regarding optimal regimen and the need for periodic revaccination remain unanswered. Persons at risk should be adequately vaccinated against hepatitis B. 
Application of Doppler color flow imaging to determine valve area in mitral stenosis. This study was undertaken to examine whether Doppler color flow imaging could accurately estimate the valve area in mitral stenosis. Doppler color flow assessments were performed in both an in vitro model and in 30 patients with mitral stenosis undergoing cardiac catheterization. In the experimental Doppler study using a circuit model, color jet width correlated well with actual orifice diameter (r = 0.99). In the clinical Doppler study, the mitral valve orifice was assumed to be elliptic and the mitral valve area was calculated from the following equation: (pi/4) (a x b), where a = color jet width at the mitral valve orifice in the apical long-axis view (short diameter) and b = the width in the 90 degrees rotated view (long diameter). Mitral valve area was also determined by two-dimensional echocardiography and the pressure half-time method, and the results for all three noninvasive methods were compared with those obtained at cardiac catheterization. By Doppler color flow imaging, mitral valve area could be determined in all patients and there was a significant correlation between the Doppler jet and catheterization estimates of mitral valve area (r = 0.93). Valve area determined by two-dimensional echocardiography correlated well with catheterization measurements in 26 patients (r = 0.84). However, the area could not be determined in 4 (13%) of the 30 patients because of technical problems. Although there was a fair correlation between the valve area determined by the pressure half-time method and catheterization (r = 0.79), this method tended to overestimate valve area in patients with aortic regurgitation. 
Hemangiopericytoma of the spleen. A splenic tumor is reported with the light microscopic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features of a hemangiopericytoma. The findings in this case are compared with the only previously reported splenic hemangiopericytoma. Differences in the clinical presentation and the gross appearance of the two cases are described, and similarities in the microscopic features are discussed. 
Changing rates of stroke in the province of Quebec, Canada: 1981-1988. Using more than 37,000 hospital discharges attributed to hemorrhagic or occlusive stroke in the province of Quebec, Canada, we analyzed trends in stroke incidence during the period 1981-1988. There were large and statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increases in the rates of hemorrhagic stroke over this period. Dramatic increases occurred among men in the rates of both intracerebral (International Classification of Diseases--Ninth Revision [ICD9] code 431) and intracranial (ICD9 code 432) hemorrhagic strokes (40-204% depending on age). In contrast, the rates of occlusion of the precerebral arteries (ICD9 code 433) declined in younger men and women but increased substantially (107%) in older men. Rates of occlusion of the cerebral arteries (ICD9 code 434) declined in men over the age of 50 years and in women aged 50-79 years. Despite the decline in the rate of occlusion of the cerebral arteries, the rate of hemorrhagic stroke appears to have increased. Changes in the hospitalization rates for hemorrhagic stroke were not accompanied by consistent decreases in the case-fatality rate. This finding tends to support the hypothesis of an actual increase in the hospitalization rate fo hemorrhagic stroke rather than an artifactually elevated rate due to enhanced diagnosis by computed tomography. 
Prevention of coronary heart disease in black adults. Development of strategies to prevent CHD in blacks is impeded by the virtual absence of clinical trials demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of interventions in blacks. The wholesale generalization that interventions effective (or ineffective) in whites are similarly effective in blacks may risk the employment of worthless or even dangerous interventions in blacks. Using available epidemiologic data, a number of risk factors may be more important in blacks than whites by virtue of higher prevalence, increased relative risk, or both. These may include hypertension, lipoprotein (a), smoking, diabetes, and obesity. Thus, health agencies might emphasize these risk factors when developing preventive programs targeted at black populations. Prevention programs may best seek to prevent the onset of risk factors found highly prevalent in black communities, rather than the costly and side-effect-prone interventions to treat risk factors once established. Thus, there is a role for community-based as well as a high-risk approaches. The community-based approaches should seek to work with organizations such as churches, which traditionally play strong roles in the black community. Physicians treating black patients should be aware of the potentially different roles played by risk factors, and treat aggressively those individuals identified to be at high risk. Risk factor management should be emphasized, rather than reduced, in patients with already established CHD. CHD has been clearly shown to be preventable; both blacks and whites should benefit from specific interventions aimed toward this worthy goal. 
High blood pressure due to alcohol. A rapidly reversible effect. The hypothesis that the action of alcohol on blood pressure is rapidly reversible and that its effect is therefore mainly due to very recent alcohol consumption was examined in this study. Five hundred and seventy-seven subjects were screened in an occupational survey. Alcohol consumption, documented with a 1-week retrospective diary was divided into two categories: "recent" and "previous" intake. Recent intake was defined as the amount consumed on days 1, 2, and 3 immediately preceding blood pressure measurement. Previous intake was defined as the amount consumed on days 4, 5, and 6 preceding blood pressure measurement. High recent alcohol intake significantly raised systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both men and women. Previous alcohol intake, however, did not appear to influence blood pressure. We conclude that the effect of alcohol on blood pressure appears to be predominantly due to alcohol consumed in the few days immediately preceding blood pressure measurement, with alcohol consumption before those few days exerting little effect on blood pressure. 
Progesterone receptor in hepatocellular carcinoma. Correlation with androgen and estrogen receptors. Progesterone receptors (PgR), estrogen receptors (ER), and androgen receptors (AR) were assayed consecutively for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that was surgically removed from 19 men and three women. The methods of receptor assay were the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for PgR and the dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) technique for ER and AR. The patients ranged in age from 32 to 77 years (average, 60.3 years). No patients had received any specific anti-cancer therapy before tissue collection. All patients but one had underlying liver disease: cirrhosis in 13 and chronic hepatitis in eight. The positive rate of each receptor was 18% for PgR, 48% for ER, and 82% for AR. The titer was highest for AR, intermediate for ER, and lowest for PgR. The titers of PgR in four PgR-positive patients ranged from only 1.1 to 3.0 fmol/mg of protein. There was no relationship between PgR, ER, and AR in terms of positivity and titer. Also, other clinical and histopathologic data did not influence the positivity or concentration of these three sex hormone receptors. It can be concluded that no or little PgR exists in the cytosol of untreated HCC. 
Relation of left ventricular volume and function over one year after acute myocardial infarction to infarct size determined by technetium-99m sestamibi. Twenty patients with a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (15 anterior, 5 inferior) who received successful reperfusion therapy underwent tomographic imaging with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi and radionuclide ventriculography at discharge, 6 weeks, and 1 year after AMI. Patency of the infarct-related artery after reperfusion (thrombolysis, 8 patients; coronary angioplasty, 12 patients) was confirmed by angiogrpahy in all patients. Tc-99m sestamibi perfusion defect at discharge (a measure of infarct size) was quantitated using previous methods and expressed as a percentage of the left ventricle (28 +/- 19%, range 0 to 59%). This perfusion defect size correlated closely with ejection fraction at discharge (r = -0.87), 6 weeks (r = -0.81) and at 1 year (r = -0.78, all p less than 0.0001). Perfusion defect size at discharge also correlated closely with end-systolic volume index at discharge (r = 0.71, p less than 0.0005), 6 weeks (r = 0.63, p less than 0.005) and at 1 year (r = 0.76, p less than 0.0001). Perfusion defect size at discharge did not correlate significantly with end-diastolic volume index at discharge or at 6 weeks, but did correlate at 1 year (r = 0.66, p less than 0.005). There was no significant group change in end-systolic or end-diastolic volume indexes from discharge to 1 year later, although 7 patients had definite individual changes in end-diastolic volume index (3 increased and 4 decreased). There was no relation between defect size and late changes in end-systolic volume index, but there was a weak correlation between defect size and late changes in end-diastolic volume index (r = 0.42, p = 0.07). 
Relationship of epidermal growth factor receptor detectability with the A, B, H blood group antigens. Emphasis on normal and neoplastic urothelium. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a glycoprotein that carries on its extracellular domains oligosaccharide chains, some of which are similar to blood group determinants. The author examined the expression of the EGFR using immunohistochemistry and three anti-EGFR antibodies with different fine specificities. These were applied to frozen sections from 120 tissue biopsies, including normal and neoplastic urothelium. The expression of blood group A, B, H determinants was also evaluated in the same tissues. Significant differences were noted, depending on the fine specificity of the anti-EGFR antibody, cellular differentiation, and the tissue donor's blood group. The most interesting finding was a reciprocal relationship between the reaction patterns obtained using antibodies with carbohydrate specificity and those with peptide specificity. These patterns were characteristic of cellular differentiation and suggested that the EGFR peptide determinants are detected in excess in immature and malignant cells that, however, appear deficient in oligosaccharide determinants. The combination of 'loss' of blood group antigen and an apparent overexpression of EGFR peptide determinants is indicative of invasive growth in transitional cell carcinomas. 
Acantholytic dyskeratotic epidermal naevus in a patient with guttate psoriasis on PUVA therapy. A 79-year-old male with psoriasis developed a zosteriform acantholytic dyskeratotic epidermal naevus during PUVA therapy. The eruption was successfully treated with etretinate 0.75 mg/kg/day and a subsequent course of PUVA with the affected area covered prevented a recurrence of the naevus. 
Susceptibility to and severity of rheumatoid arthritis in multicase families. Fifteen sibships, each having two or more siblings affected by classical or definite RA were studied. They comprised 31 patients with RA (all in remission) and 21 normal siblings. The total severity index of RA was assessed by clinical and radiological indices. For all the patients the following investigations were carried out: (1) HLA antigens determination for nine antigens at A locus and 15 at B locus and 6 at DR locus; (2) rheumatoid factor. We found: (1) RA disease is genetically controlled and the responsible genes are linked to the HLA system; (2) association between seropositivity and DR4 and DR4/B27 genotypes; (3) significant effect of the genotype DR4/B27 on the age of onset; (4) association between the increase in disease severity both clinical and radiological and DR4/X and DR4/B27 phenotypes. Thus the genetic control is probably composed of two types of genes: disease susceptibility genes and disease severity genes linked to DR4/X and DR4/B27 phenotypes. 
Elevation of plasma concentrations of haloperidol after the addition of fluoxetine. Fluoxetine (20 mg/day) was added for 7-10 days to stable doses of haloperidol given to eight psychotic patients. Mean plasma concentrations of haloperidol were elevated by 20% (p less than 0.05), but extrapyramidal side effects did not increase appreciably, indicating a relatively minor interaction between these agents. 
A comparison of treatment outcomes for black patients and white patients with metastatic breast cancer. The Piedmont Oncology Association experience. Prior studies have shown that black patients with breast cancer have poorer survival times compared with white patients even when adjusted for stage. Seventy-four black patients treated on six Piedmont Oncology Association (POA) protocols were compared with 74 randomly selected white patients treated with the same protocols to determine if race had any independent effect on response, time to progression, or survival time. Patients were evenly matched for pretreatment characteristics with the exception that white patients had a significantly higher percentage of bone metastases and significantly less skin involvement. Response rates and median time to progression were similar for black patients and white patients at 31% and 25%, and 9.3 and 9.1 months, respectively. Black patients had poorer survival times even when adjusting for covariables; median survival time was 14.3 months for black patients and 20.3 months for white patients (P less than 0.05). The reason for this survival difference in Stage IV patients is unclear, but is unlikely to be related to treatment. Additional research in this area will be necessary to resolve this issue. 
Lymphatic abnormalities in Alagille's syndrome. Chylous pleural effusions developed in a patient with Alagille's syndrome who had dysplasia of the lymphatic system. Lymphatic abnormalities are not a recognised feature of Alagille's syndrome. 
Juvenile progressive systemic sclerosis: report of five cases. Five cases of juvenile progressive systemic sclerosis (SSc) are reported (4 girls and 1 boy). The age of onset of the disease ranged from 4 to 13 years. The clinical features included Raynaud's phenomenon present in 4 of 5 cases; hyperpigmentation, skin tightening and contractures of the large joints were noted in all 5 cases. One patient initially diagnosed as having eosinophilic fasciitis developed SSc 3 months later. Another patient was diagnosed initially as having juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. There was one case of pulmonary fibrosis and another of mild restrictive lung disease. Two cases of esophageal and intestinal hypomotility were reported. Scleroderma nephropathy was absent in all 5 cases. 
Injury current and gradients of diastolic stimulation threshold, TQ potential, and extracellular potassium concentration during acute regional ischemia in the isolated perfused pig heart. During acute regional myocardial ischemia, a "current of injury" flows between the ischemic and the normal tissue. Its direction and magnitude change during the cardiac cycle. During diastole, the injury current flows intracellularly from the ischemic cells toward the normal cells and tends to depolarize the latter. The gain insight into the possible role of the injury current in arrhythmogenesis, we simultaneously determined diastolic stimulation threshold, [K+]o and TQ potential at multiple sites closely spaced across the cyanotic border in Langendorff-perfused pig hearts during the first 10 minutes after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The position of the electrodes relative to the border was validated by their response to 1) regional ischemia and 2) selective perfusion with a high-K+ perfusate of the left anterior descending coronary artery. A temporary decrease of diastolic stimulation threshold preceded a rapid increase in the central ischemic zone; a lasting reduction (by +/- 20%) without a concomitant increase of [K+]o was observed at seven sites (of 39 sites tested), five of which were less than 2 mm outside the electrophysiological border. Moreover, up to 4 mm inside the electrophysiological border, a similar lasting decrease of diastolic stimulation threshold was accompanied by a moderate increase of [K+]o. We conclude that 1) the injury current causes increased excitability in normal tissue close to the "ischemic" border and 2) increased excitability related to a moderately increased [K+]o may persist up to 10 minutes of ischemia at the ischemic side of the border. Both factors may facilitate the induction of life-threatening arrhythmias in acute myocardial ischemia. 
Colorectal cancer: current trends in initial clinical manifestations. Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a common cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in the United States. There continues to be controversy regarding the effectiveness and feasibility of various screening programs for CRC. To determine how cases of CRC are currently detected, we reviewed a series of 246 consecutive patients with well-documented pathologic staging and clinical presentation. Patients with low stage CRC (0 or A) had smaller tumors, were less likely to be anemic at presentation, and were more likely to have tumors located in the left side of the colon than patients with tumors at stage B or higher. Thirty-two of the 246 tumors were detected in asymptomatic patients through screening. These tumors were more likely to be of a lower stage than those in patients with active gastrointestinal symptoms. In our experience active screening programs detect a relatively small number of CRCs. A majority (66%) of CRCs are still detected from symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal tract. 
Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis involving the paranasal sinuses. Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis is a destructive, locally invasive process, with a propensity for local recurrence after inadequate excision. Although it does not metastasize, uncontrolled growth can eventually lead to death. The role for radiation and chemotherapy is controversial and these modalities are best reserved for advanced unresectable or recurrent lesions. The treatment of choice is en bloc surgical resection with wide margins. 
Cytoprotection and stress ulceration. The stomach possesses many mechanisms for protection against stress ulceration. The gastric microcirculation, prostaglandins, mucus secretion, epithelial cell renewal, and muscle tone are factors involved in gastric cytoprotection. Therapy is partially directed at augmenting these natural physiologic defense mechanisms to prevent and promote healing of stress ulceration. Drugs such as sucralfate, carbenoxalone, colloidal bismuth, and prostaglandins are used. Stress ulceration is an important cause of upper gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage in postoperative and critically ill patients in the intensive care unit setting. Preventive therapy includes neutralization of gastric acid by antacids, suppression of gastric acid secretion by H2-receptor blockers, administration of cytoprotective agents, and correction of the underlying stress state. Active bleeding requires accurate diagnosis by gastroscopy. Additional therapy may be necessary, including intra-arterial administration of vasopressin and occasionally surgery. Dieulafoy's lesion is an unusual stress-related cause for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The area of mucosal injury is minute but underneath lies a large submucosal gastric artery. It can cause massive bleeding and is often missed at initial gastroscopy. The pathogenesis of Dieulafoy's lesion is complex and the mainstay of therapy has been surgical. Ligation of the vessel, wedge resection, or proximal gastric resection is performed. Therapeutic endoscopy with endoscopic cauterization or injection has changed the approach to this lesion. 
Conjugate eye deviation: side, site, and size of the hemispheric lesion. Conjugate eye deviation (CED) is a well-known sign that occurs rather frequently in stroke patients. To study the lateralizing and localizing value of this sign, we investigated prospectively 78 consecutive patients presenting with CED due to a hemispheric lesion. CED occurred more frequently after right-sided hemispheral damage (64%). The lesions in the right hemisphere were located predominantly in the subcortical (fronto-) parietal region and the internal capsule; the lesions in the left hemisphere were larger, covering the entire fronto-temporo-parietal area. In the majority of patients there was no direct involvement of the frontal eye fields on either side. The results indicate that a lesion at different sites within the circuit between the inferior parietal lobule and frontal eye fields, and their projections to the superior colliculus or paramedian pontine reticular formation, can be responsible for CED. The right-left asymmetry is probably related to cerebral asymmetry for directed spatial attention. 
Rest and exercise radionuclide angiography for diagnosis in chronic ischemic heart disease. Rest and exercise radionuclide angiography is frequently employed for the diagnosis of chest pain syndromes. Its value and limitations in this regard have been well studied, but proper utilization of the technique requires an understanding of five critical concepts: 1) Radionuclide angiography is superior to treadmill exercise testing and probably equivalent to thallium scintigraphy, although the published series did not use current methods. 2) The true specificity of radionuclide angiography is about 80%, intermediate between the early optimistic estimates and the later pessimistic ones. 3) The peak exercise ejection fraction is the preferred test parameter for diagnosis, although exercise hemodynamics, symptoms, and electrocardiographic changes should also be considered. 4) Although radionuclide angiography is clearly helpful for noninvasive diagnosis, significant numbers of patients will continue to fall in an uncertain category. 5) The proper application of the technique requires recognition of its limitations and careful attention to technical details. When properly applied, this modality can make an important contribution to clinical decision making. 
A randomized trial of ticarcillin and clavulanate versus gentamicin and clindamycin in patients with complicated appendicitis. Secondary bacterial peritonitis is usually a polymicrobial infection of facultative gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Treatment consists of operation and broad-spectrum antibiotic administration. The antibiotic treatment of choice in these infections has been the combination of gentamicin and clindamycin. However, this combination can have toxic side effects and necessitates frequent monitoring of serum levels. Beta-lactam antibiotics provide broad-spectrum coverage and low toxicity, but can be inactivated by species of bacteria producing beta-lactamase enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and has been shown to extend the efficacy of ticarcillin to bacteria producing these enzymes. This combination was compared with gentamicin and clindamycin in 99 consecutive patients with complicated appendicitis. Eradication of identified pathogens was greater in the ticarcillin and clavulanate group (98 per cent) than in the gentamicin and clindamycin group (92 per cent), even for the subgroup of organisms producing beta-lactamases (97 versus 90 per cent eradication). Complications and clinical response were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. Ticarcillin and clavulanic acid is a safe and effective alternative to gentamicin and clindamycin in the treatment of secondary bacterial peritonitis and offers advantages in dosing simplicity and freedom from ototoxic and nephrotoxic effects. 
Acute hemodynamic effects of terazosin in hypertensive and normotensive patients. Terazosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, was administered intravenously to 10 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization to determine its short-term hemodynamic effects. Hemodynamic measurements were performed before and 30 minutes after three doses of the drug: 1, 1, and 3 mg. One milligram of terazosin reduced the blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, mean) from a mean of 152.0/86.3, 110.7 mm Hg by -24.3/-9.4, -15.3 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). In the five patients who received 5 mg of the drug, blood pressure declined in a dose-dependent manner by -21.8/-3.8, -11.6 mm Hg after 1 mg, and by -35.8/-14.8, -22.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after all 5 mg of the drug. The changes in blood pressure paralleled the terazosin-induced decrease in systemic resistance. Similar changes were recorded for pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance. The greatest hemodynamic response was noted with the first drug dose; succeeding doses had a progressively diminished incremental effect. Cardiac output, heart rate, and maximum left ventricular dp/dt demonstrated little change, whereas left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased after all three doses, reaching significance after 2 mg (-3.4 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05), and left ventricular ejection fraction tended to increase (+5.6% +/- 2.4%, p less than 0.05 after 1 mg) and showed a dose dependence analogous to that of systemic resistance. Although not generally reaching statistical significance, indexes of aortic stiffness and compliance displayed a favorable effect. These data are consistent with terazosin's specific alpha 1-antagonism. Left ventricular performance is improved by afterload reduction, since terazosin demonstrated no direct effect on cardiac contractility. 
Use of combined exogenous gonadotropins and pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone in patients with polycystic ovarian disease [published erratum appears in Fertil Steril 1991 Jun;55(6):1213] We previously tested a combined regimen based on the administration of gonadotropin in the early follicular phase followed by pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) until complete follicular maturation in patients suffering from polycystic ovarian disease. Despite good clinical results, a high rate of premature luteinization was observed with this approach. We therefore evaluated in this study whether starting pulsatile GnRH therapy before gonadotropin administration might reduce premature luteinization. Eight women underwent induction of ovulation with both combined therapy and pure exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone alone using a crossover scheme. No premature luteinization and a single follicular growth were recorded with the modified combined regimen. Clinical results (8/8 versus 3/7 ovulatory cycles; 3/8 versus 1/7 pregnancies) favor the combined approach over gonadotropin alone. 
Preeclampsia as the great impostor. In contrast with a generation ago when preeclampsia was misdiagnosed as medical or surgical disease unrelated to pregnancy, today's diagnostic errors are those that consider surgical and medical problems as either pregnancy-induced hypertension or as the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome. Eleven case histories are presented of significant medical or surgical problems that were initially diagnosed as hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome or pregnancy-induced hypertension. The incorrect diagnosis of medical-surgical cases during pregnancy often meant that appropriate therapy was delayed and that the rate of iatrogenic prematurity was increased. 
Fulminant hepatic failure due to acute hepatitis B and delta co-infection: probable bloodborne transmission associated with a spring-loaded fingerstick device. Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) due to acute hepatitis B and delta co-infection occurred in a 74-yr-old female, who eventually died. There was no clear-cut epidemiology other than probable bloodborne transmission from a contaminated spring-loaded fingerstick device used for glucose determination, in an outpatient facility. This unusual mode of transmission reiterates the importance of using sterile cleansing and disposal procedures anytime there is a possibility of contamination with blood. 
Medullary catecholaminergic neurons in the normal human brain and in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is thought to cause degeneration of melanin-pigmented catecholaminergic neurons throughout the brainstem, but little quantitative information is available on the fate of catecholaminergic neurons associated with the dorsal vagal complex or medullary reticular formation. We therefore examined these neurons in the normal human medulla and in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, using both a melanin stain and immunohistochemical methods with an antiserum against tyrosine hydroxylase. The greatest numbers of catecholaminergic neurons in the ventrolateral reticular formation (A1/C1 group) were located in the far rostral medulla, whereas the largest populations of catecholaminergic cells in the dorsal vagal complex (A2/C2 group) were found at the level of the area postrema. No loss of cells was observed in the A1/C1 group in the parkinsonian brains. In contrast, the A2/C2 group showed moderate loss of neurons, most marked at the level of the area postrema. This difference was entirely due to the loss of neurons in the medial component of the A2 group, a population that normally is only lightly pigmented, while the heavily pigmented neurons in the ventral and intermediate components of the A2 complex were unaffected. Parkinson's disease causes degeneration only of selected populations of medullary catecholaminergic neurons, without apparent relationship to the extent of melanin pigmentation. 
Prevalence of renal artery stenosis in diabetes mellitus--an autopsy study. The prevalence of renal artery stenosis in diabetic patients is unknown, since no noninvasive and valid screening procedures are available. We have therefore evaluated 5194 consecutive autopsy protocols from patients who died between 1980 and 1988. In addition, all available clinical records for patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS) and a random sample were evaluated. It was found that 73% of patients with RAS were hypertensive, and 53% had diabetes, all but one being Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent). Renal artery stenosis was present in 225 (4.3%) of all patients [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.8-4.9], and was not reported in the patients' clinical records in 93% of cases. RAS was present in 8.3% of all diabetic patients (95% CI, 6.8-9.8%), the odds ratio being 3.5 (95% CI, 2.6-4.6). The frequency of renal artery stenosis in diabetic patients with hypertension was 10.1%. Bilateral renal artery stenosis was found in 43% of patients with RAS and diabetes, and in 30% of non-diabetic patients with RAS (P = 0.059). Our results indicate that renal artery stenosis often goes undetected before autopsy. The presence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus increases the risk of renal artery stenosis. The risk of bilateral renal artery stenosis is greater in diabetic patients. These results may be of significance with regard to the diagnostic evaluation and choice of antihypertensive treatment in hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients. 
Granulomatous angiitis of the spinal cord associated with Hodgkin's disease. A 28-year-old man had a 5-month history of focal and generalized neurologic symptoms culminating in a thoracic myelopathy. Evaluation revealed granulomatous angiitis of the spinal cord in association with occult nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. In previous reports, manifestations indicative of intracranial involvement have dominated the clinical presentation of granulomatous angiitis associated with Hodgkin's disease. Successful therapy for Hodgkin's disease may result in marked improvement of associated granulomatous angiitis, whereas the lack or failure of therapy results in a uniformly fatal outcome. Definitive antemortem diagnosis of granulomatous angiitis requires a biopsy of involved tissue. The cause of granulomatous angiitis, as well as the nature of its association with Hodgkin's disease, remains unexplained. 
Modifications of the nasal cycle in patients with hypothalamic disorders: Kallmann's syndrome. The nasal cycle is a phenomenon characterized by cyclic changes in the airflow resistance of each nasal fossa from congestion or constriction of the nasal erectile tissue. This phenomenon is caused by alterations in the influence exerted by the autonomic nervous system and is believed to be regulated by a hypothalamic center. In order to verify this hypothesis on the hypothalamic regulation of the nasal cycle, the authors studied a group of subjects with Kallmann's syndrome. This disorder is characterized by coexisting hypothalamic hypogonadism and hyposmia or anosmia due to hypothalamic and olfactory center hypoplasia. An anomalous nasal cycle was found in all the subjects with Kallmann's syndrome. This disorder might be related to hypothalamus atrophy. 
Zinc deficiency. A public health problem? Zinc deficiency occurs in individuals and populations whose diets are low in sources of readily bioavailable zinc such as red meat, and high in unrefined cereals that are rich in phytate and dietary fibers. Dietary zinc deficiency was described nearly three decades ago among the poor of the Middle East. It is now known to occur in children and adolescents from widely diverse areas including Egypt, Iran, Turkey, China, Yugoslavia, Canada, and the United States; and among pregnant women from Iran, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States. Major manifestations include retarded growth and development and an increased incidence of pregnancy complications. Other manifestations may include suppressed immunity, poor healing, dermatitis, and impairments in neuropsychological functions. Precise information as to the numbers of people affected by dietary zinc deficiency is not available. Even so the nature of diets associated with zinc deficiency suggests that mild deficiency is common in some populations. 
Effects of laser-generated tissue debris on aggregation of human platelets. This study examined the effects of laser-generated tissue debris from thrombus, atheroma, and normal aorta on platelet aggregation. Debris supernatant and suspension from lased thrombus induced dose-related aggregation, maximal at 48 +/- 12% and 65 +/- 2%, respectively. Debris suspension from normal aorta induced maximal aggregation of 35 +/- 12%, but the debris from atheromatous aorta surprisingly had no effect on platelet aggregation. The debris particle count was in the range of 10(10) to 10(12) per liter. Aspirin, 0.2 and 2.0 mmol/L, only weakly inhibited the debris-induced aggregation, and heparin up to 10 U/ml was ineffective. However, iloprost reduced aggregation to 40 +/- 11% of control at 0.3 ng/ml, and totally abolished it at 3 ng/ml. Soluble and particulate laser-generated debris from vascular tissue and thrombus may cause platelet aggregation in vitro. This may have implications for laser coronary angioplasty. 
Relation between ST segment shifts during ischemia and thrombin activity in patients with unstable angina. This study was designed to determine in patients with unstable angina whether specific electrocardiographic abnormalities associated with ischemia, the presence of coronary lesions consistent with thrombosis on angiography or the presence of recurrent ischemia reflects increases in thrombin activity as manifested by increased plasma concentrations of fibrinopeptide A. The concentration of fibrinopeptide A in plasma was increased to 6.7 +/- 3.1 nM for the group as a whole (n = 29). Increases were greater in the 17 patients who exhibited reversible ST segment shifts (10.2 +/- 5.2 nM) than in the 12 patients exhibiting reversible T wave abnormalities alone (1.6 +/- 0.2 nM) (p less than 0.01). Nine of the 17 patients with reversible ST segment shifts who underwent coronary angiography had lesions with morphologic characteristics consistent with atherosclerotic plaque complicated by thrombosis compared with only 2 of 9 patients with T wave changes only (p less than 0.05). Plasma concentrations of fibrinopeptide A were markedly elevated in 7 of the 11 patients in whom complex lesions were noted on angiographic examination. Thus, the occurrence of reversible ST segment shifts identifies a group of patients with unstable angina in whom ongoing thrombosis is likely and who may be particularly likely to benefit from antithrombotic therapy. 
Use of intrathecally administered morphine in the treatment of postoperative pain after lumbar spinal surgery: a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Improved control of postoperative pain is now known to reduce the incidence of morbidity. Although spinally administered narcotics have found a clear role in chest and abdominal surgery, their role in lumbar spinal surgery is debated. We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intrathecally administered morphine sulfate after lumbar spinal surgery in 56 patients. Patients received 0, 0.125, 0.25, or 0.5 mg of intrathecally administered morphine during extradural lumbar spinal operations, and the effects on postoperative analog pain scores, narcotic consumption, complications, and length of hospitalization were assessed. As compared with systemic narcotic administration, intrathecally administered morphine provided superior analgesia in a dose-dependent fashion without an increase in narcotic side effects. Consumption of parenteral narcotics on the first postoperative day and over the total hospitalization period decreased in correlation with increasing doses of intrathecally administered morphine. Mean length of hospitalization was significantly decreased, as compared with the control group, in patients receiving 0.25 or 0.5 mg of intrathecally administered morphine. When proper precautions are observed, intrathecally administered morphine can improve the postoperative care of patients undergoing lumbar spinal surgery. 
Common complaints with cardiac implications in children. Chest pain, palpitations, and dizziness are not infrequent complaints in the office of a primary care physician. Historical events and physical findings can lead to a more accurate determination of cardiac causes of these symptoms. Electrocardiogram and chest radiographs are two additional tests most often helpful in determining cardiac causes of symptoms. 
The influence of CLS 2210 on the course of myocardial infarction: a pilot study in man. To assess the effect of CLS 2210 (a new formulation of calcium dobesilate) on the evolution of acute myocardial infarction, 100 patients presenting their first infarct were distributed, according to their sequential admissions to the hospital, into CLS 2210-treated group (50 patients) or a comparison group (50 patients not receiving CLS 2210). The two groups were similar in age, sex, predisposing factors, and site of infarction. Intravenous infusion of CLS 2210 was begun within six hours of onset of chest pain and continued for seventy-two hours. Thereafter, it was given, as oral capsules, in a dose of 1,000 mg every eight hours throughout the hospitalization. Before and during the trial, blood samples were drawn for the measurements of serum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK), and twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained serially in each patient. All objective data were analyzed on a coded basis without reference to the treatment. In the comparison group, thirty-six to forty-eight hours was required for CK to fall to 50% of the baseline value, whereas in the CLS 2210-treated group it reached 50% of the baseline in eighteen to twenty-four hours. For each infarction site, a statistically significant fall was reached earlier in the CLS 2210 group. CK, the ECG index, and the sum of the ST segments showed earlier and more rapid improvement in the CLS 2210 group than in the comparison group. The consumption of narcotic analgesic agents and nitroglycerin was substantially less in the CLS 2210 group than in the comparison group. 
Liver tumors in cirrhosis: experimental study with SPIO-enhanced MR imaging. The influence of cirrhosis on superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the liver was studied in 31 rats. Experimental models included carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis and liver engrafting of rhabdomyosarcoma S4T cells. Hepatic uptake of SPIO measured with relaxometry decreased dramatically with histologic grade, while splenic uptake increased; the same results were achieved by calculating K values. Imaging of 13 tumorous cirrhotic rats confirmed these results by showing a muted decrease in liver signal intensity on spin-echo images after injection of SPIO. Nevertheless, all intrahepatic tumors could be visualized, as confirmed by postmortem examination. On gradient-echo images, postinjection contrast between the tumor and the liver was not affected by cirrhosis. Thus, despite strong impairment of hepatic uptake in cirrhosis, the diagnostic efficacy of MR imaging with SPIO did not seem to be significantly affected. 
Oxygen free radicals and congestive heart failure. Plasma lipid peroxides (malondialdehyde) and thiols were measured in 45 patients with congestive heart failure and 45 controls. Malondialdehyde concentrations were significantly higher in the patients with congestive heart failure (median 9.0 nmol/ml interquartile range (IQR) 7.9-10.2) than in the controls (median 7.7 nmol/ml (IQR 6.9-9.2)). Plasma thiols were significantly lower in congestive heart failure (median 420 mumol/l (IQR 379-480)) than in the controls (median 463 mumol/l (IQR 445-525)). There was a significant but weak negative correlation between malondialdehyde and left ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.35) and a positive correlation between plasma thiols and left ventricular ejection fraction (r = 0.39). This study provides clinical support for experimental data indicating that free radicals may be important in heart failure. It also suggests that the degree of free radical production may be linked to the severity of the disease. 
The effects of activin on follicle-stimulating hormone secretion and biosynthesis in human glycoprotein hormone-producing pituitary adenomas. The effects of activin on pituitary FSH biosynthesis have been previously characterized using primary rat pituitary cultures; however, little is known of the effects of activin on FSH biosynthesis and secretion in human pituitary tissue. Production of intact glycoprotein hormones and free subunits is increasingly recognized in pituitary tumors; however, the regulation of gonadotropins in such tumors has not been addressed. We have investigated the effects of human recombinant activin on glycoprotein hormone biosynthesis and secretion in primary cultures of 12 human glycoprotein hormone-producing pituitary adenomas and compared this with the effects of activin in normal rat anterior pituitary cells. In 33% of the human pituitary tumors studied, significant (P less than 0.05) increases in FSH beta secretion occurred in response to incubation with 20 ng/mL activin for 24 h (19-287% stimulation), without changes in the production of intact FSH. A Northern analysis performed on cells derived from one tumor indicated that FSH beta mRNA levels increased 350% after activin treatments; however, FSH secretion did not parallel the mRNA changes. None of the human glycoprotein hormone-producing tumors significantly increased FSH secretion in response to activin. To validate the biological activity of recombinant human activin-A and to confirm time and dose conditions for the human tumor cultures, we also examined its ability to stimulate FSH production in rat pituitary cultures. Activin (20 ng/mL) added to the culture medium significantly increased FSH secretion and steady state levels of FSH beta mRNA after 24 h. These data indicate that some glycoprotein hormone-producing pituitary tumors treated with purified activin have discordant responses of intact gonadotropins and free subunit responses. In contrast to responses in normal rat gonadotrophs, FSH beta biosynthetic pathways may be uncoupled from intact FSH secretion in a subset of glycoprotein hormone-producing pituitary adenomas. 
Factors influencing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease in childhood. We have reviewed the outcome of all patients undergoing their first intestinal resection for Crohn's disease at this hospital between 1970 and 1987. Recurrence rates, defined by recurrent intestinal symptoms and radiological confirmation of mucosal disease, were calculated using survival analysis. Age, sex, anatomical location of disease, indication for surgery, preoperative duration of symptomatic disease, use of preoperative bowel rest, and pathological features of the resected bowel were analysed individually and jointly as potential risk factors influencing postoperative recurrence of disease. Eighty two patients (age, mean (SD) 14.8 (2.5) years) underwent intestinal resection and were followed postoperatively for a minimum of one year (mean 5.3 (3.3) years). Anatomical location of disease, indication for surgery, and preoperative duration of symptomatic disease were the only factors that significantly influenced the duration of the recurrence free interval. Patients with diffuse ileocolonic inflammation experienced earlier recurrence (50% at one year) than children with predominantly small bowel disease (50% recurrence at five years, p less than 0.0001). Failure of medical therapy independent of disease location as the sole indication for surgery was associated with an earlier relapse than when surgery was performed for a specific intestinal complication such as abscess or obstruction (p less than 0.003). Patients undergoing resection within one year of onset of symptoms experienced delayed recrudescence of active disease (30% recurrence by eight years) compared with patients whose preoperative duration of symptomatic disease was longer (50% recurrence by four years when preoperative duration of disease was one to four years and 50% by three years when disease had been present greater than four years preoperatively, p = 0.03). 
Testing for Helicobacter pylori in the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with almost all cases of peptic ulcer. Using Bayes' formula, we evaluated whether testing for H. pylori in a patient with proven ulcer might help in the work-up of a Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZE). A negative test for H. pylori in a patient with duodenal ulcer would raise a pretest probability for ZE of 10-20% to a posttest range of 61-78%. The information provided by a negative test result with respect to ZE is greater in younger than in older ulcer patients. It is also greater in duodenal than gastric ulcer. We conclude that testing for H. pylori in ulcer patients, in whom ZE constitutes a possible differential diagnosis, adds substantially to the decision making at relatively low cost and little additional risk to the patient. 
Rectal potential differences in irritable bowel syndrome and in inflammatory bowel diseases in man. We have studied rectal potential difference (pd) in 200 subjects: 30 healthy volunteers or control patients, 46 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and painless diarrhoea (group I), 60 IBS patients without diarrhoea (group II) and 64 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with (group III, n = 41) or without (group IV, n = 23) rectal involvement. Pd measurement used a rectal perfused probe and a subcutaneous needle both connected, via agar-KCl bridges, to calomel electrodes and a millivoltmeter. Statistical analysis used Student's t-test for paired and unpaired data and Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate. Mean rectal pd values were, respectively -43.5 +/- 8.7 mV in control group, -32.9 +/- 10.2 mV in IBS-group I patients (P less than 0.001), -41.3 +/- 12 mV in IBS-group II patients (NS), -21.4 +/- 14.1 mV in IBD patients with rectal involvement (P less than 0.001), and -45.1 +/- 14.3 mV in IBD-group IV patients (NS). A histological examination was performed in 36 IBS patients; mean rectal pd was significantly decreased in patients showing abnormal patterns (n = 27, pd = -31.8 +/- 9 mV) compared to patients with normal mucosa (n = 9, pd = -41.1 +/- 6.5 mV; P less than 0.01). These results show that: (1) potential difference is significantly decreased in patients with ulcerative and rectal involvement; (2) in patients with Crohn's disease, normal rectal pd values do not assess the appearance of colonic mucosa above; (3) patients with IBS and diarrhoea also present a significant diminution in mean rectal pd. Although the mechanisms involved remain unclear, rectal pd measurement appears to be an objective test for intestinal mucosae weakness in functional or inflammatory diseases of the large intestine and rectum. 
Colonoscopic surveillance after polypectomy: considerations of cost effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of the current recommendation that persons who have had an adenomatous colon polyp removed have periodic colonoscopic surveillance at fixed and regular intervals. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using data from the medical literature in a simulation model to estimate the costs of and the risk for perforation associated with periodic colonoscopic surveillance for a 50-year-old man followed for 30 years. MAIN RESULTS: A program of colonoscopy every 3 years would incur cumulatively a 1.4% risk for colon perforation, a 0.11% risk for perforation-related death, and direct physician costs of $2071 for colonoscopy (discounted at 5%). If a 50-year-old man's cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer is 2.5% after the removal of a single small adenoma and if effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance every 3 years is 100%, then one death from cancer could be prevented by doing 283 colonoscopies, incurring 0.6 perforations, 0.04 perforation-related deaths, and direct physician costs of $82,000. If surveillance were 50% effective and the cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer were 1.25%--a plausible scenario--1131 colonoscopies would be required to prevent one death from cancer, incurring 2.3 perforations, 0.17 perforation-related deaths, and physician costs of $331,000. CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of colonoscopic surveillance is very sensitive to estimates of the cumulative remaining risk for death from cancer after polypectomy as well as to surveillance efficacy. For persons whose remaining risk for death from cancer may be low, such as persons with a single small adenoma, recommendations for colonoscopic surveillance at fixed and regular intervals may be excessively costly. 
Dehydration syndromes. Oral rehydration and fluid replacement. Dehydration caused by diarrhea remains a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Dehydration is a common clinical presentation seen by most physicians. Clinical diagnosis depends on the recognition of signs and symptoms as well as change in weight. Laboratory studies are helpful in categorizing the dehydration as isotonic, hyponatremic, or hypernatremic, which is necessary to plan appropriate therapy. In many situations, oral rehydration therapy is possible and desirable. Intravenous rehydration remains the standard of care for children with severe dehydration and shock. 
Evaluation of the painful shoulder. A prospective comparison of magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomographic arthrography, ultrasonography, and operative findings. Twenty-one patients who had had pain in the shoulder for more than three months were evaluated with ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging followed by computerized tomographic arthrography. The results of the imaging studies were then compared with the operative findings. Magnetic resonance imaging was found to be the most useful modality for establishment of the etiology of pain in the shoulder due to disease of the rotator cuff, instability associated with abnormality of the glenoid labrum, subacromial impingement, stenosis of the coracoacromial arch, and osteoarthrosis of either the glenohumeral or the acromioclavicular joint. The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging was found to depend on both the operator and the technique and was decreased in extremely obese patients, due to difficulties in positioning, and in patients who had had a previous operation. Magnetic resonance imaging was more accurate than either computerized tomographic arthrography or ultrasonography in identifying partial-thickness tears (intrasubstance changes in the rotator cuff). Magnetic resonance imaging provided the same level of accuracy as computerized tomographic arthrography in the detection of abnormalities of the glenoid labrum. 
Single center experience of the effect of delayed function on outcome in retransplant recipients of cadaveric renal allografts. The incidence of DRF in the regraft study group was most commonly seen in patients with a historic high level of HLA sensitization. Primary NF was an immune mediated event seen in 63% of third regrafts. Delayed use of CyA with ALG induction coverage provides good graft survival with either double or triple maintenance therapy. Stricter patient selection for third transplants and aggressive clinical monitoring of the regrafted patient has provided a 1-year actuarial graft survival result of 88% at our transplant center. 
Uterine incarceration during the third trimester: a rare complication of pregnancy. Uterine incarceration that manifests during the third trimester or at term is a serious and rare complication of pregnancy. The pregnant patient may complain of low-abdominal pain, low-back pain, urinary retention, and constipation, or the patient may be asymptomatic until labor begins. The diagnosis is difficult, and physical findings can be misleading. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful if the anteriorly displaced cervix is clearly depicted. If incarceration of the retroverted uterus persists until term, a cesarean section is necessary. Recurrent uterine incarceration has been reported; therefore, the patient should be monitored closely during subsequent pregnancies. Herein we describe three cases of uterine incarceration during the third trimester and review the literature with respect to incidence, differential diagnosis, management, and complications of this condition. 
Pathologic review of consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens. Nerve sparing versus nonnerve sparing. Retrospective pathologic analysis was conducted of specimens from 88 radical retropubic prostatectomy operations performed between 1982 and 1987 inclusive. The median age of patients was sixty years (range, 46 to 73 years). Of the 88 radical prostatectomies performed, 51 were nerve-sparing (40 bilateral) and 37 were nonnerve-sparing (11 unilateral) procedures. Preoperative clinical staging was similar in both groups. Thirty-five of 37 patients (95%) in nonnerve-staging group and 51 of 51 patients (100%) in nerve-sparing group had clinical Stage B2 disease or less. Pathologic staging in both groups was also similar. In 26 of 37 patients (70%) in nonnerve-sparing group and in 35 of 51 patients (69%) in nerve-sparing group, disease remained localized to the prostate. Both groups were analyzed retrospectively to determine whether or not the incidences of microinvasion of capsule and of extraprostatic disease differed. Review of the apical and lateral margins of the specimens revealed no statistically significant difference in either the degree of microinvasion of capsule or the incidence of extraprostatic disease between the groups. 
Cessation of driving and unsafe motor vehicle operation by dementia patients. We surveyed 522 consecutive patients from a dementia clinic to assess duration of driving after disease onset and instances of unsafe motor vehicle operation in the preceding 6 months. Among the 333 patients licensed to drive at the onset of dementia, the median duration of driving after onset was 28.6 months. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease drove significantly longer than those with other dementia syndromes. Of the 93 patients still driving at the time of the survey, approximately one third were reported to have had at least one form of unsafe motor vehicle operation in the past 6 months, including 21 patients with motor vehicle accidents. Motor vehicle accidents were associated with use of prescription medications with sedative properties and with lower subjective ratings of the patient's driving ability by the informant. 
Inguinal herniorrhaphy. Reduced morbidity by service standardization. To ascertain if service specialization and procedure standardization would improve the complication rate of inguinal herniorrhaphy, the results of all inguinal herniorrhaphies performed during a 3-year period by board-certified general surgeons who also performed a variety of other procedures common to the field of general surgery, assisted by general surgical residents (group B, 390 patients), were compared in the same institution with the results of inguinal herniorrhaphy when performed during 3 years under protocol by a Hernia Service directed by a senior faculty member assisted by junior surgical residents (group C, 442 patients). Group B patients had essentially no follow-up until they reappeared for care at the Hernia Service, whereas patients in group C achieved an 82% 7-year follow-up. The infection and recurrence rates of group C patients (0.45% and 0.9%, respectively) were significantly better than those of group B patients (5.9% and 4.6%, respectively). These results suggest that in our institution, the concentration of patients with hernias in a hernia service, manned by a specialized surgeon, produced better short- and long-term results than those obtained by general surgeons not dedicated to the field of hernia repair. Further studies will be necessary to confirm these findings. 
Primary cutaneous adenoid cystic carcinoma: a case report and review of the literature. A case of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the ear in a 67-year-old man is presented along with a review of the literature. Adenoid cystic carcinoma most commonly arises in the salivary glands. Primary cutaneous adenoid cystic carcinoma occurs principally in the scalp and chest. Perineural invasion is seen in at least half the cases and is associated with an increased recurrence rate. Treatment consists of wide local resection with tumor-free margins. Just over half the patients will develop recurrence, with long tumor-free intervals necessitating long-term follow-up. Distant metastases are rarely seen. Radiation therapy is not curative and should be reserved for palliation. 
Hepatosplenic candidiasis: successful treatment with fluconazole. PURPOSE: To determine if fluconazole is effective treatment for hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients (ages 3 to 44) with acute leukemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who did not respond to prior antifungal therapy were treated with fluconazole. RESULTS: All six patients had fever and three had nausea and vomiting; computed tomographic (CT) scan showed lucencies in the liver in six, lucencies in the spleen in five, and lucencies in the kidneys in three. Prior therapy with 1.6 to 4 g of amphotericin B in the five adults and 526 mg of amphotericin B in the child (with the addition of flucytosine in four) failed to improve clinical symptoms or lucencies in the liver, spleen, and kidneys seen on CT scan. Fluconazole was given at a dose of 200 to 400 mg daily (70 to 100 mg in the child) for 2 to 14 months. All patients had resolution of fever and other symptoms in 2 to 8 weeks. Improvement of the lesions noted on CT scan was seen in 4 to 8 weeks in all patients. Total resolution of lesions noted on CT scan occurred by 4 weeks in two patients, but took 4 to 5 months for three patients and 13 months for one patient. Three patients had relapse of their acute leukemia and two died, presumably cured of their candidiasis. Two patients underwent successful bone marrow transplantation without relapse of their candidiasis. CONCLUSION: Fluconazole appears to be useful in the treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis that has not resolved with amphotericin B and flucytosine therapy. 
Usefulness of noninvasive diagnostic tools for diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in patients with a normal chest radiograph. The value of bedside examination and noninvasive tests in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) among patients with a normal chest radiograph was investigated. Normal chest radiographs were present in 20 of 260 patients (8%) with acute PE and in 113 of 642 (18%) with suspected acute PE, in whom the diagnosis was excluded. A partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood less than or equal to 70 mm Hg in a dyspneic patient with a normal chest radiograph was more often seen among patients with PE (9 of 17, 53%) than among patients in whom PE was excluded (18 of 93, 19%; p less than 0.01). However, no combinations of blood gases, signs and symptoms were strictly diagnostic. High probability ventilation/perfusion scans among patients with a normal chest radiograph were indicative of PE in only 6 of 9 patients (67%). Among patients with low-probability ventilation/perfusion scans, 8 of 47 (17%) had PE. This study showed that the combination of dyspnea and hypoxia in a patient with a normal chest radiograph is a useful clue to the diagnosis of PE. Although intuition suggested that ventilation/perfusion scans would yield better results in patients with a normal chest radiograph, the ability to diagnose PE by ventilation/perfusion scans in this subset of patients was not enhanced, except by a reduction of the percentage of patients with intermediate probability scans. 
Pulmonary hemorrhage and necrotizing glomerulonephritis without glomerular immune deposits: report of two cases. Two children with a syndrome of pulmonary hemorrhage and necrotizing, nonimmune glomerulonephritis are reported. A boy and girl, both of East Indian descent, developed recurrent lung infiltrates from the age of 3 months and 2 years, respectively. Both subsequently presented with pulmonary hemorrhage, fever, arthritis, hematuria, and nephrotic range proteinuria at 1.5 and 6 years of age, respectively. Renal biopsy in each case showed acute, severe, focal and segmental, necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis without immune deposits. Subsequent renal biopsies revealed severe glomerular and tubulointerstitial scarring. No vasculitis or granulomas were seen on renal, skin, or lung biopsies. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were not detected in sera taken 1.5 years in the boy and 3.5 years in the girl after the onset of renal disease. The boy was treated with prednisone, azathioprine, and plasmapheresis, but developed progressive renal impairment and commenced dialysis within 4 years. Subsequent to renal transplantation, he developed an immunoblastic lymphoma and died. The girl was treated initially with prednisone and later with cyclophosphamide. After 4 years, she had a normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). While necrotizing nonimmune glomerulonephritis associated with pulmonary hemorrhage is rare, and cases are characteristically difficult to classify because of many overlapping features, it is possible that these children had a unique illness. 
Detection of deletions and cryptic translocations in Miller-Dieker syndrome by in situ hybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using two cosmid probes (41A and P13) from the Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) critical region in 17p13.3 was performed in a blinded comparison of three MDS patients with submicroscopic deletions and in four normal relatives used as controls. The controls showed both chromosome 17 homologues labeled in 85%-95% of cells, while each patient showed only one homologue labeled in 75%-80% of cells. Two MDS patients with cryptic translocations were also studied. In one case, a patient and her mother had the same der(17) (p+), but the reciprocal product of the translocation could not be identified in the mother by G-banding (i.e., it was a "half-cryptic" translocation). FISH revealed a 3q;17p translocation. The other case involved a patient with apparently normal karyotype. Because a large molecular deletion was found, a translocation involving two G-negative telomeres (i.e., a "full-cryptic" translocation) was postulated. FISH studies on her father and normal brother showed an 8q;17p translocation. These studies demonstrate that in situ hybridization is an efficient method for deletion detection in Miller-Dieker syndrome. More important, parental studies by FISH on patients demonstrating molecular deletions and a normal karyotype may identify cryptic translocation events, which cannot be detected by other molecular genetic strategies. Similar in situ strategies for deletion detection can be developed for other microdeletion syndromes, such as Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome or DiGeorge syndrome. 
Complication of a penile prosthesis reservoir: venous compression masquerading as a deep venous thrombosis. We report a case of vascular compromise secondary to the reservoir of an inflatable penile prosthesis. The problem masqueraded as deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity of a patient 3 years after a spinal cord injury. 
Antibiotic prophylaxis and tourniquet inflation in total knee arthroplasty. Twenty-four patients receiving total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were randomized into one of three groups based on tourniquet inflation one, two, or five minutes after administration 1 g cefazolin. Simultaneous serum, soft-tissue, and bone samples were obtained at regular intervals during surgery. All soft-tissue and bone samples were corrected for cefazolin content. The percentage of cefazolin penetration into soft tissue and bone was calculated using the area under the concentration time curve. Adequate cefazolin concentrations for soft tissue and bone were defined as greater than or equal to 4 x minimum inhibitory concentration90 (MIC90 = 1 microgram/ml) of cefazolin to Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Patients were similar in age, actual body weight, creatinine clearance, and length of tourniquet inflation. The median percentage of cefazolin penetration into soft tissue and bone for the five-, two-, and one-minute groups was 14.5% and 4.6%, 6.7% and 3.0%, and 5.9% and 4.6%, respectively; the percentage of penetration into soft tissue between the five- and one-minute groups was statistically significant. A higher percentage of patients achieved the desired cefazolin concentration (greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/g) if a five-minute interval was selected. The five-minute group achieved the highest mean ratios of concentration to MIC compared with the two- and one-minute groups, although the differences were not statistically significant. The standard 1 g of cefazolin with a five-minute interval between administration and tourniquet inflation resulted in adequate mean soft-tissue and bone concentrations for prophylaxis during TKA with a tourniquet time less than two hours. Additional doses are not warranted after tourniquet release. 
A time-dependent study of passive esophageal wall properties and collagen content in rabbits with esophageal varices. The passive biomechanical wall properties of the esophagus were studied in rabbits with esophageal varices and controls using a four-electrode impedance technique. Stepwise pressure inflation and deflation was done for analysis of esophageal cross-sectional area, compliance, and hysteresis monthly during six months. At sacrifice, the esophageal collagen content was determined. A small but statistically insignificant increase in compliance was observed during the six-month observation period in both groups. No differences were observed between the groups (P greater than 0.3). No change in hysteresis was observed in either group. The group with esophageal varices had significantly higher collagen content in the distal esophagus when compared to controls (P less than 0.05). No difference was demonstrated in the proximal part. No correlation was demonstrated between the collagen content and esophageal compliance. The study demonstrated that the method allows measurement of luminal cross-sectional area and tissue elasticity. No relationship was found, however, between the collagen content and compliance of the rabbit esophagus. 
Validity of cerebrovascular mortality rates. Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) mortality rates are being increasingly used to establish a relationship with coronary heart disease risk factors. Cerebrovascular mortality rates suffer from the same general defects as coronary heart disease mortality rates but with greater diagnostic error in regard to subdivisions of CVD or stroke. These vital statistics, whether national or regional, are too inaccurate for scientific use and cannot be regarded as representing true mortality rates for any country. Moreover, clinical CVD is an inappropriate surrogate for severity of atherosclerosis, providing inexact data and allowing indeterminate overlap in epidemiologic studies. 
Blood conservation techniques and platelet function in cardiac surgery. Postoperative alterations in platelet function induced by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are of importance. The effect on platelet aggregation of three different techniques for reducing blood consumption was studied in 30 patients undergoing elective aortocoronary bypass grafting from the beginning of anesthesia until the 1st postoperative day. The patients were randomly divided into three groups, in which 1) a cell separator was used during and after CPB; 2) a hemofiltration device was used; and 3) high-dose aprotinin was used in order to reduce the need of homologous blood. A fourth group undergoing neurosurgery procedures served as a control. Platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (concentration 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, and 2.0 microM), collagen (4 microliters/ml), and epinephrine (25 microM) was determined by the turbidimetric method. Platelet aggregation was not significantly changed in the control group, indicating that the operation itself did not impair platelet function. At the end of the operation (after retransfusion of the salvaged pump blood), the maximum aggregation and maximum gradient of aggregation induced by all three inductors were most reduced (significantly) in the cell-separator patients. On the 1st postoperative day, platelet aggregation in the hemofiltration patients and the patients treated with aprotinin had normalized. Aggregation of patients pretreated with high-dose aprotinin was not different from that of the hemofiltration patients throughout the investigation. Blood loss was significantly highest in the cell-separator group (770 +/- 400 ml on the 1st postoperative day) but was not different between the hemofiltration (390 +/- 230 ml) and the aprotinin-treated patients (260 +/- 160 ml). 
A prosthesis augmentation device for the prevention of recurrent hip dislocation. A preliminary report. At present, revision is the only standard option for cases of recurrent hip prosthesis dislocation. A device is described that contains the head of the femoral component, preventing dislocation, while only slightly restricting external rotation of the affected leg. The device can be inserted through a small incision, minimizing operation time. This device differs from others, e.g., the reversed acetabular cup, by being predrilled (with drill guide supplied), modular in design, and tailored to the dimensions of the cup site. 
Transvaginal sonographic characterization of ovarian disease: evaluation of a new scoring system to predict ovarian malignancy. With the advent of high-frequency transvaginal ultrasonography, new opportunities are presented to better define ovarian lesions. The goal of this study was to develop a scoring system using transvaginal sonographic characterization of pelvic/ovarian lesions. Our purpose was to maximize the discrimination between benign and malignant entities. Transvaginal sonographic pelvic images of 143 patients were correlated with surgical findings or histopathology. Of 281 ovaries, 108 had benign lesions (30 endometriomas, 24 teratomas, 21 simple cysts, and 33 other abnormalities) and 20 had malignancies. The scoring system devised was useful in distinguishing benign from malignant masses, with a specificity of 83%, sensitivity of 100%, and positive and negative predictive values of 37 and 100%, respectively. Further experience and refinements of this method of scoring should maximize the benefit of high-resolution transvaginal sonography of ovarian lesions. 
Conformational structure of a monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody to the monoclonal anti-adenocarcinoma-associated carbohydrate antibody YH206. The mAb AI206 (IgG1) is an anti-Id antibody of mAb YH206 (IgM) to adenocarcinoma-associated carbohydrate Ag and inhibits the reaction of mAb YH206 to YH206 Ag at low concentrations. By Western blot analysis, mAb AI206 only reacted with unreduced mAb YH206, whereas it did not react with reduced mAb YH206. Furthermore, mAb AI206 reacted with IgM subunit (180 kDa), F(ab')2 (110 kDa), and F(ab) (50 kDa) of pepsin-treated unreduced mAb YH206. Thus, mAb AI206 recognized the structure of F(ab) of mAb YH206. The mAb YH206 reacted with unreduced mAb AI206, F(ab')2 (110 kDa), and F(ab) (50 kDa) of pepsin-treated unreduced mAb AI206. It is presumed that mAb YH206 and mAb AI206 recognize each other in an unreduced condition but not a reduced condition. The recognition of such a conformational Id on F(ab) is important. Because mAb YH206 recognized the carbohydrate on YH206 Ag as well as the peptide on mAb AI206, the conformation on F(ab) of mAb AI206 may mimic the carbohydrate structure on YH206 Ag. In fact, YH206 antibody activity was induced in syngeneic mouse serum immunized with mAb AI206. These observations suggest that the internal image of YH206 carbohydrate Ag is preserved within the conformational Id on F(ab) of mAb AI206. 
Growth-inhibitory effect of combination chemotherapy for human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Sensitivities to anti-tumor drugs, mitomycin C (MMC), aclarubicin hydrochloride (ACR), doxorubicin hydrochloride (ADR), cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5FU), were examined using PK-1, -8, -9, -12, -14, and -16 cell lines derived from human pancreatic cancer. These cell lines showed different sensitivities to each of the above anti-tumor drugs. The concentrations required for 50% growth-inhibition (IC50) after 2 hours of exposure were 0.096 to 0.35 micrograms/ml for MMC, 0.0074 to 0.0076 micrograms/ml for ACR, 0.033 to 0.23 micrograms/ml for ADR, 0.35 to 1.9 micrograms/ml for cisplatin, and 21 to 42 micrograms/ml for 5FU, IC50 of each anti-tumor drug decreased significantly after 48 hours of exposure. The combination of any two out of MMC, ACR, and 5FU showed synergistic inhibition of the growth of PK-1 and PK-8 cell lines. These results show that MMC, ACR, ADR, cisplatin, and 5FU have sufficient anti-tumor effect against six human pancreatic cancer cell lines even at clinically achievable concentrations and exposure times, and chemotherapy for pancreatic cancers requires naturally effective drug delivery into cancer tissues. 
Cerebrospinal fluid atrial natriuretic factor in intracranial disease. We tested the hypothesis that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is an indicator of brain injury in patients with intracranial disease. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was measured in 72 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from 28 patients with intraventricular drains and in nine samples from outpatient controls undergoing diagnostic lumbar puncture. Levels were correlated with diagnosis; systemic fluid administration; concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma; intracranial pressure; sodium, glucose, and protein concentrations, osmolality, and cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid; sodium concentration in the serum; and hemodynamics. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was highest in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with intracerebral hematoma, followed by those with obstructive hydrocephalus and subarachnoid hemorrhage (19 +/- 2, 13 +/- 3, and 8 +/- 2 pg/ml, respectively); atrial natriuretic factor concentration was less than 4 pg/ml in the controls. Patients treated with fluid restriction had significantly higher atrial natriuretic factor levels than those receiving maintenance or high-volume fluids (16 +/- 3, 8 +/- 2, 10 +/- 1 pg/ml, respectively). The concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma was significantly elevated in patients with intracerebral hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage (155 +/- 38 and 92 +/- 20 pg/ml, respectively) and did not correlate with fluid administration or the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid. Neither cerebrospinal fluid nor plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor correlated with intracranial pressure; cerebrospinal fluid sodium, glucose, or protein concentrations, osmolality, or cell count; serum sodium concentration; or hemodynamics. We conclude that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is a nonspecific indicator of brain injury. 
Incidence of venous thromboembolism verified by necropsy over 30 years. OBJECTIVE--To determine the incidence of venous thromboembolism in all necropsy reports over 30 years. DESIGN--Study of all necropsies in one hospital in 1987 and longitudinal analysis of results of necropsy in 1957, 1964, 1975, and 1987. SETTING--Departments of general surgery, infectious diseases, internal medicine, oncology, and orthopaedics in a Swedish general hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Number of cases of venous thromboembolism. RESULTS--About a third of all necropsies showed venous thromboembolism. In 1987, 260 of 347 necropsies showing venous thromboembolism found pulmonary embolism, of which 93 were classified as fatal, 90 as contributory, and 77 as incidental. Only 21 contributory or fatal postoperative pulmonary emboli were seen. In only 106 of 260 patients with pulmonary embolism did routine necropsy not show the source of embolism. Calf veins were not routinely examined. Deep venous thrombosis was seen in 239 patients in 1987. The incidence of venous thromboembolism in the four years studied was remarkably stable except in the department of orthopaedics, where the proportion fell from 60.7% in 1975 to 32.2% in 1987 (p less than 0.05), although there were only a few patients. CONCLUSIONS--The overall incidence of venous thromboembolism has not changed over 30 years. During this period the proportion of the population aged over 65 has doubled, and this may have masked the beneficial effects of prophylaxis and early mobilisation. Prevalences corrected for age are needed. 
Bypass surgery for chronic stable angina: predictors of survival benefit and strategy for patient selection. The variable mortality risk associated with chronic stable angina calls for careful selection of patients for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) if the aim of management is to prolong life. The randomized and observational studies done in the last 20 years have identified the variables relevant to patient selection and thus have provided a rational basis for such clinical decisions. These studies showed that the sicker the patient, as gauged by relevant measures of coronary disease and cardiovascular morbidity, the more likely it is that CABG will prolong life. A CABG-related improvement in survival is therefore more likely to occur the worse the left ventricular function; the greater the number of diseased vessels; the more proximal the location of coronary lesions (more muscle is threatened by such lesions); the greater the severity of the lesions as determined by angiography; the more severe the angina; the more easily provocable the ischemia or the more extreme the measures of ischemia; and, within limits, the older the patient. Greater survival gain after CABG also occurs in patients with peripheral vascular disease, in patients with baseline electrocardiographic ST-segment and T-wave changes, and probably in women. Thus, patients are likely to live longer after CABG if they have left main disease; three-vessel disease with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 50%), class III or IV angina, provocable ischemia, or disease in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery; two-vessel disease with proximal left anterior descending artery involvement; and two-vessel disease with class III or IV angina as well as either severe left ventricular dysfunction alone or moderate left ventricular dysfunction together with at least one proximal lesion. When the decision of whether to do CABG is less clear-cut, the presence of peripheral vascular disease, female sex, baseline electrocardiographic ST-segment and T-wave changes, or older age (over 60 but under 80 years) should weigh in favor of doing CABG. In general, patients with single-vessel disease do not seem to derive survival benefit from CABG. 
A case of chronic mountain sickness diagnosed by routine pulmonary function tests. In summary, this is a patient who presented with respiratory acidosis and cor pulmonale. The major diagnostic challenge was in differentiating primary cardiopulmonary disease from a central abnormality of ventilatory drive. The arterial blood gases showed a normal A-a gradient suggesting hypoventilation as the etiology of his hypoxemia. Pulmonary function testing showed air trapping, but a relatively normal FEV1/FVC and airways resistance. The literature suggests that most altitude natives have depressed hypoxemic and hypercapnic drives with a distinct subset demonstrating a profoundly depressed drive to ventilation. This latter group has been labeled as having chronic mountain sickness or Monge's disease. As one might expect, ventilatory control during sleep is also abnormal in these patients with CMS. Our patient indeed showed typical frequent severe desaturations with hypopnea. The diagnosis of CMS in our patient was made with routine arterial blood gases and standard pulmonary function tests. Additional tests of ventilatory responsiveness to oxygen and carbon dioxide could have been performed, but are not necessary to make the diagnosis. 
Factors common to successful therapy for the obese patient. The majority of patients treated for obesity regain lost weight after treatment. We speculate on what might be done to improve long-term success rates by examining the factors associated with success or relapse. An emphasis on exercise and prescribing more gradual changes in diet and exercise appears to be associated with better outcomes. There may be a need to conceptualize obesity as a food dependency disorder not amenable to self-control strategies. External social control through peer support groups may be indicated to help patients through temptations. 
Fulminant hepatic failure after repeated exposure to isoflurane anesthesia: a case report. A previously healthy but obese 26-yr-old woman was diagnosed as having hepatic dysfunction 17 days after the third of three consecutive exposures to isoflurane anesthesia for paranasal sinus surgery. Serum laboratory findings included elevated aminotransferases and bilirubin. Radiographical evaluations showed no evidence of extrahepatic disease. Serological studies were negative for acute viral infections, and serum copper was normal. The patient's condition deteriorated over the ensuing 17 days, with hyperreflexia, hypoglycemia and a rapid fall in serum aminotransferases with a concomitant rise in bilirubin level and prothrombin time despite maximal medical support. The liver volume as shown by computed tomography fell from 1,290 cm3 to 680 cm3 over 6 days. The patient underwent successful orthotopic liver transplantation 25 days after onset of symptoms. Histopathological examination of the resected liver showed submassive and massive necrosis, with a few foci of microvesicular steatosis and ultrastructural evidence of mitochondrial abnormalities. Although we found insufficient evidence to prove that this case was caused by isoflurane anesthesia, the clinical course and histopathological findings are similar to those in hepatic injury caused by halothane anesthesia. Therefore we report this as a possible case of fulminant hepatic failure resulting from isoflurane anesthesia. 
Anterior decompression in cervical spine trauma: does the timing of surgery affect the outcome? To clarify the ideal timing of anterior decompression and stabilization for all patients with cervical spine trauma as well as its efficacy for patients with complete deficits, we reviewed the records of 103 consecutive patients with cervical spine trauma (50 incomplete deficits, Group A; 53 complete deficits, Group B) who underwent this procedure during a 5-year period at the Shock Trauma Center. We subdivided each group according to time of surgery: early and delayed (less than 24 and greater than 24 hours past injury, respectively). In Group A, 10 patients underwent early surgery and 40 patients underwent delayed surgery (range, 2 to 77 days past injury; mean, 13 days). One patient (2.5%) in the delayed group died. The following data refer to the early and delayed subgroups, respectively: average acute hospitalization, 20 and 22 days; patient motor score improvement (at discharge), 37.2 and 45.0%; functional grade improvement (at discharge), 5 (50.0%) and 9 (22.5%) patients. At 1-year follow-up, every patient who had had a deficit had progressed to a higher functional grade. In Group B, 35 patients underwent early surgery and 18 underwent delayed surgery (range, 2 to 45 days past injury; mean, 13 days). One patient (2.9%) in the early group died. The following data refer to the early and delayed subgroups, respectively: average acute hospitalization, 38.7 and 45.2 days (P less than 0.05); respiratory care (number of daily suction procedures), 6.0 and 9.86 (P less than 0.05); patient motor score improvement (at discharge), 3.9 and 4.5%; functional grade improvement (at discharge), 4 (11.4%) and 1 (5.6%) patients. 
Increased circulating concentration of the N-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor prohormone in persons with pheochromocytomas. To investigate the possible relationship of hypertension and the N-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) prohormone which contains two peptides [i.e. pro ANF-(1-30) and pro-ANF-(31-67)] with blood pressure-lowering effects, we examined the circulating levels of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone in three patients with pheochromocytomas before surgery, during an increase in their blood pressure with surgical manipulation of their tumors, and after surgery when their blood pressures returned to normal. The circulating levels of the whole N-terminus [amino acids 1-98; pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) from the midportion of the N-terminus of the ANF prohormone were increased 2-fold in patients with both extraadrenal and intraadrenal pheochromocytomas. In both the intraadrenal and extraadrenal patients N-terminus [pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) circulating levels increased further during surgical manipulation and returned to normal after surgical removal of their respective tumors. Each of these pheochromocytomas was found to have pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67)-binding sites that were functional, since they could enhance the guanylate cyclase-cGMP system 2-fold in these pheochromocytomas. The entire 126 amino acids of the prohormone were present within each of the pheochromocytomas, since both the whole N-terminus and C-terminus (i.e. ANF) of the prohormone were present. Examination of the pheochromocytomas by electron microscopy revealed electron-dense granules similar to those in the heart, which have been associated with the synthesis and storage of the ANF prohormone. We conclude that 1) the whole N-terminus [pro-ANF-(1-98)] and pro-ANF-(31-67) of the ANF prohormone circulate at higher concentrations in persons with pheochromocytomas and return to normal with removal of the tumors; 2) pheochromocytomas contain specific binding sites for pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67); 3) these binding sites are functional, since pro-ANF-(1-30) and -(31-67) could enhance the enzyme guanylate cyclase within these tumors; and 4) the entire 126 amino acids of the ANF prohormone are present within these tumors, which have electron-dense granules associated with polypeptide hormone synthesis, suggesting that the ANF prohormone is being synthesized within the pheochromocytomas. 
A case-control study of the effects of birth by caesarean section on intrapartum and neonatal mortality among twins weighing 1500-2499 g. The aim of this nationally-based, matched case-control study was to assess the impact of birth by caesarean section on intrapartum, and neonatal mortality among twins weighing 1500-2499 g, born in Sweden between 1973 and 1983. By using data held at the National Medical Birth Registry, Stockholm, 91 such pregnancies (study cases) where one or both twins died were identified. For each case, two controls (in all 182 pregnancies) were allotted at random from the rest of the twin pregnancies, with similar birthweight (+/- 100 g) and year of delivery (+/- 1 year). The number of twins that died was reduced from 73 during the first four years to 22 between 1977 and 1980, and to 6 during the last 3 years of the study period. Almost a quarter (23.1%) had a lethal malformation. The caesarean section rate increased during the study period, but did not differ between cases and controls (chi 2 = 1.0; P greater than 0.05). The analysis could not confirm a significant difference between cases and controls regarding the number of infants born vaginally in non-vertex presentation (chi 2 = 0.1; P greater than 0.05). The results of this study appear to indicate that birth by caesarean section was not a major factor related to the improved fetal outcome. 
The prognostic significance of glial fibrillary acidic protein staining in medulloblastoma. Histologic and immunohistochemical properties of 53 medulloblastomas were analyzed with regard to clinical features and survival rate. No correlation was found between survival rate and histologic features of the tumor, such as desmoplastic reaction, number of mitoses, hemorrhages, necrosis, endothelial proliferation, glomerular arrangement, calcifications, rosettes, or oligodendroglial cells. However 82% of the patients with positive glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining in numerous tumor cells survived more than 5 years; only 30% survived that long if their tumor cells were GFAP negative (P = 0.0093). This significant difference was not related to the mode of therapeutic protocol used. The authors suggest that GFAP staining may be a useful prognostic tool in medulloblastoma. 
Lacunae: a urographic finding in chronic obstructive uropathy. Lacunae, small spaces in the renal sinus that communicate with the caliceal fornices, have been mentioned rarely in the radiologic literature. These lesions have been reported to opacify during excretory urography in patients with current or previous urinary obstruction. Lacunae have been presumed to form in response to urine extravasation through the fornices, but there has never been gross anatomic or histologic proof of their existence. In two patients with obstructive uropathy, urographic-pathologic correlation confirmed the existence and nature of lacunae. On excretory urography, the appearance is likely to be confused with papillary necrosis. 
Monitoring functional patency of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Duplex scanning and Doppler-derived blood pressure measurements were used to serially monitor lower limb hemodynamics in 73 patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Ninety percutaneous transluminal angioplasty sites judged technically satisfactory by arteriography were evaluated. Significant hemodynamic improvement was seen in 81 (90%) of the 90 limbs, although both hemodynamic and clinical improvement were achieved in only 77 (86%) limbs. Duplex scanning within 1 week of successful angioplasty identified moderate (20% to 49% diameter reduction) or severe (greater than 50% diameter reduction) residual stenosis in 49 (63%) of 77 balloon-dilated arterial segments. The presence of a greater than 50% diameter reduction residual stenosis predicted further restenosis and late clinical failure (11% success rate at 1 year). When the degree of residual stenosis at the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty site was less than 50% diameter reduction by duplex scanning, the procedure was durable (80% success rate at 2 years), even in patients with critical ischemia, poor runoff, or diabetes mellitus. 
Anterior mediastinal masses: utility of transthoracic needle biopsy. The results of 143 transthoracic needle biopsies (TNBs) in 126 patients with anterior mediastinal masses were compared with the final diagnosis, which was proved with pathologic study (n = 95) or clinicoradiologic methods (n = 31). In the 26 patients with lymphoma, the sensitivity of TNB was 42%; the specificity, 96%. In the 15 patients with Hodgkin disease, the sensitivity was 20%. In the 28 patients with thymoma, the sensitivity was 71%; the specificity, 94%. In the 11 patients with germ cell tumors, the sensitivity was 91%; specificity, 98%. The sensitivity in the 33 patients with metastatic disease was 70%; specificity, 100%. The cytologic specimens were examined with light microscopy and the Papanicolaou method only, a limitation that explains the difficulty in differentiating lymphoma from thymoma and that can now be overcome with immunohistochemical study. TNB of anterior mediastinal masses is useful in metastatic disease and germ cell tumors. Lymphoma and thymoma are less reliably diagnosed unless immunohistochemical cytologic methods are applied. 
Entrapment of the popliteal artery. Although entrapment of the popliteal artery is uncommon, it is an important cause of arterial insufficiency in younger patients. Accurate diagnosis depends on a high index of suspicion combined with dynamic noninvasive testing and "stress angiography." Although angiographic demonstration of medial deviation of the artery is diagnostic, absence of this finding does not exclude the diagnosis of entrapment of the popliteal artery. Positional angiography may be necessary in these instances. Surgical exploration should be performed by a posterior approach, since this facilitates identification of the precise anatomic variant while allowing easy arterial repair, if necessary. The condition of the popliteal popliteal artery must dictate the extent of the surgical procedure. If the popliteal artery is normal, then relief of the constricting lesion alone will suffice. If the artery appears diseased or is thrombosed, then myotomy and arterial reconstruction must be performed. This is best accomplished by bypass grafting using autogenous vein or artery. If thromboendarterectomy is used, the clinician can expect a higher percentage of acute postoperative thromboses. 
Can esmolol manage surgically-induced tachycardia? Bolus esmolol treatment of intra-operative tachycardia due to surgical stimulation. A double-blind, randomised study was conducted to examine the efficacy of a single bolus dose of esmolol in treating surgically-induced tachycardia. Anaesthetic technique was identical in all patients, and consisted of premedication with midazolam and glycopyrronium, induction with thiopentone followed by suxamethonium, tracheal intubation, and maintenance with isoflurane 0.6% (end-tidal) and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Forty-eight patients developed a heart rate of greater than 95 beats/minute or 20% more than pre-induction values at an average time of 34 minutes after tracheal intubation and received placebo (15 patients), esmolol 50 mg (16 patients), or esmolol 100 mg (17 patients). Controlled intervention was instituted if heart rate or blood pressure was not adequate. Both 50 and 100 mg of esmolol resulted in lower heart rates compared to placebo (p less than 0.05), with no difference between the two esmolol groups (p greater than 0.05). Patients who received placebo had more episodes of medical intervention than those given esmolol (p less than 0.05). No adverse effects occurred in any patient. 
Tamoxifen in premenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer: a review. The antiestrogen tamoxifen is the most widely used hormonal therapy for breast cancer. The drug exerts its antiproliferative effects primarily through estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated mechanisms, although other cellular actions may augment tumor inhibition. Clinically, tamoxifen has been less well studied in premenopausal than in postmenopausal patients. The drug has complex endocrine effects that are dependent on the treatment duration and dose, menopausal status, and target organ. In postmenopausal women receiving tamoxifen, serum estrogen levels remain low, and the normally elevated gonadotropin levels decrease. In contrast, serum estrogen levels are strikingly elevated in many premenopausal women, and gonadotropin concentrations are either unchanged or slightly increased. Large systematic trials in metastatic breast cancer have established tamoxifen as the recommended hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with ER-positive tumors. Tamoxifen is also an active agent for premenopausal metastatic disease, and response rates are comparable to those reported for oophorectomy. Clinical experience with tamoxifen in this younger age group, however, is more limited. Few premenopausal women (less than 400) have been included in phase II and phase III trials. Two randomized trials (total of 160 patients) comparing oophorectomy with tamoxifen do not definitively establish therapeutic equivalence, and a survival advantage for either treatment cannot be excluded. Many questions remain concerning the appropriate role for tamoxifen in premenopausal patients. Still, tamoxifen has an attractive toxicity profile, and it offers a favorable therapeutic alternative for premenopausal women with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer who wish to avoid surgical or radiation castration. 
Transient loss of consciousness: the value of the history for distinguishing seizure from syncope. We studied 94 consecutive patients (age 15 or over) to investigate which aspects of the history and clinical findings help to distinguish seizures from syncope and related conditions. Clonic movements or automatism observed by an eyewitness classified an event as a seizure. The seizure group consisted of 41 patients and the syncope group of 53 patients. The likelihood ratio was used to calculate the predictive power of single findings and logistic regression to analyse combinations of findings. The best discriminatory finding was orientation immediately after the event according to the eyewitness and the age of the patient in the absence of an eyewitness report (P less than 0.001). We found a seizure five times more likely than syncope if the patient was disoriented after the event and three times more likely if the patient was less than 45 years of age. Nausea or sweating before the event were useful to exclude a seizure. Incontinence and trauma were not discriminative findings. 
Fc receptor function and circulating immune complexes in gluten sensitive enteropathy--possible significance of serum IgA. The capacity to clear IgG containing immune complexes from the circulation was studied in patients with coeliac disease (n = 13), dermatitis herpetiformis (n = 8), and coeliac disease with concomitant serum IgA deficiency (n = 4). A small group of patients with active ulcerative colitis (n = 4) was included as a bowel disease control group. Clearance was estimated by measuring the disappearance rate of a bolus dose of intravenously injected IgG coated autologous erythrocytes. The mean T1/2 of clearance was prolonged in both coeliac disease (86 (24) minutes) and dermatitis herpetiformis (111 (35) minutes), compared with healthy subjects (20 (5) minutes) and coeliac patients with concomitant serum IgA deficiency (T1/2 = 17 (6) minutes). Patients with ulcerative colitis had a prolonged clearance, with a T1/2 of 195 (63) minutes. Values of circulating immune complexes were measured by four assays; C1q binding and C3, IgG, and IgA containing immune complexes. C1q binding immune complexes were detected only in IgA deficient gluten sensitive enteropathy. Patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis had higher values of C3, IgG, and IgA containing immune complexes than control subjects and serum IgA deficient patients with coeliac disease. The clearance rate was inversely correlated to the amount of immune complexes for the subgroups of gluten sensitive enteropathy. 
Glandular excision in total glandular mastectomy and modified radical mastectomy: a comparison. Total glandular mastectomy and modified radical mastectomy were compared for the amount of breast tissue remaining after surgery. Multiple biopsies were taken from the anterior chest walls of women following total glandular mastectomy (N = 27) and modified radical mastectomy (N = 28) to try to detect any residual glandular tissue. Regardless of procedure performed, breast tissue was identified histologically in 5 percent of all biopsy specimens (159 and 161, respectively). One of every five operative fields was shown to have glandular elements in at least one of the biopsy sites; the positive biopsies did not form a discernible pattern. The residual breast tissue in each of these patients averaged less than 1 gm. On the basis of this study, modified radical mastectomy and total glandular mastectomy appear to be equally effective in removing most of the breast. 
Fingerstick glucose determination in shock. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of fingerstick glucose measurements in severely hypotensive patients. DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized comparison study. SETTING: Emergency department in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-five severely hypotensive patients (systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 80 mm Hg) and 39 normotensive patients. MEASUREMENTS: Simultaneous fingerstick reagent strip glucose, venous reagent strip glucose, and laboratory glucose values were compared. Data were analyzed using error-grid analysis. RESULTS: In hypotensive patients, the mean fingerstick glucose values were significantly lower than the values obtained either by venous reagent strip or laboratory glucose measurements. Fingerstick glucose values in the hypotensive group were 67.5% of laboratory glucose values, and were significantly lower than the values obtained in the normotensive group (91.8%, P less than 0.001). Only 36% of the hypotensive patients had fingerstick glucose values within the acceptable range of 20% of the laboratory glucose value. Thirty-two percent of hypotensive patients were incorrectly diagnosed as hypoglycemic (glucose less than 3.89 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]); 2 of these patients were actually hyperglycemic (glucose greater than 11.10 mmol/L [200 mg/dL]). Venous reagent strip measurements accurately reflected laboratory glucose values in both hypotensive and normotensive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fingerstick glucose testing does not accurately represent venous glucose levels in severely hypotensive patients. If fingerstick glucose testing is relied on for these patients, errors in clinical management may be made. Venous reagent strip glucose testing correlates well with laboratory glucose measurements and should be the preferred method for rapid assessment of glucose level in critically ill patients with severe hypotension. 
Does atrial appendectomy aggravate secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide? The present study was designed to clarify how atrial appendectomy affects hemodynamics and secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide in the failing heart. Eleven mongrel dogs were prepared for the experimental model of high-output heart failure by creation of arteriovenous fistulas between femoral arteries and veins. Two months after the first operation, effects of bilateral atrial appendectomies on basal and pacing-induced secretions of atrial natriuretic polypeptide were investigated in five dogs with simultaneous measurement of various hemodynamic indices. In the remaining six dogs, used as a control group, pacing-induced secretion of atrial natriuretic polypeptide was examined in the same way as in the appendectomy group. After excision of the atrial appendages, neither systolic blood pressure nor either atrial pressure changed, but plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide level was decreased (292 +/- 54 to 188 +/- 47 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and cardiac output fell (3.7 +/- 0.9 to 3.0 +/- 0.8 L/min, p less than 0.01). During pacing-induced tachycardia, the peak level of plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide was lower in the appendectomy group than in the control groups (593 +/- 213 versus 1170 +/- 324 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), despite similar left atrial pressures in the two groups. The excised appendages contained approximately 30% of the total amount of atrial natriuretic polypeptide. These results demonstrate that atrial appendectomy decreases secretory function of atrial natriuretic polypeptide and reduces cardiac output in dogs with experimental high-output heart failure. 
Extended aortic valvuloplasty: a new approach for the management of congenital valvar aortic stenosis. A new technique for the treatment of congenital valvar aortic stenosis is described. It consists of augmenting the aortic cusp by extending the commissurotomy incision into the aortic wall around the leaflet insertion, mobilizing the valve cusp attachment at the commissures, and freeing the aortic insertion of the rudimentary commissure. The results of standard valvotomy performed on 48 patients (group 1) were compared with those of the new extended valvuloplasty carried out on 16 patients (group 2). The two groups were comparable in age at operation (2.7 +/- 2.1 years for group 1 versus 2.1 +/- 1.7 years for group 2; p = not significant) and in preoperative pressure gradient (58 +/- 25 mm Hg for group 1 versus 61 +/- 36 mm Hg for group 2; p = not significant). There was no operative mortality in either group. Follow-up is available on all patients, with a mean of 4.3 +/- 2.6 years for group 1 versus 1.7 +/- 0.5 years for group 2 (p = 0.05). There was one late death in group 1. Postoperative gradient was 47 +/- 13 mm Hg in group 1 versus 19 +/- 13 mm Hg in group 2 (p = 0.05). Moderate or severe regurgitation was present in 18 patients (38%) in group 1 and 2 patients (13%) in group 2 (p = not significant). Reoperation was needed in 8 patients (17%) in group 1 versus 2 patients (13%) in group 2 (p = not significant). The described valvuloplasty procedure addresses the unique pathological features of valvar aortic stenosis and provides better relief of the obstruction than the presently available techniques. Longer follow-up is needed to determine the late results of this approach. 
Cocaine and indomethacin: fetal anuria, neonatal edema, and gastrointestinal bleeding. A case is reported in which exposure to cocaine and indomethacin was associated with development of fetal anuria, anasarca, and neonatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Cocaine and indomethacin may act synergistically to adversely affect renal, cardiovascular, and platelet function. It may be prudent to obtain a drug history and urine screen for cocaine before instituting indomethacin therapy for preterm labor or polyhydramnios. 
Pathologic and hemodynamic sequelae of unilobar biliary obstruction and associated liver atrophy. A patient is presented with unilobar biliary obstruction associated with marked liver atrophy and compensatory hypertrophy. Characteristically she was not jaundiced and had no portal hypertension. Quantitative measurements of the degree of hepatocyte hyperplasia showed that over 50% of cells in the hypertrophied lobe were hyperplastic. Surprisingly, a similar percentage of cells in the atrophied lobe were also hyperplastic. No difference was found in the size of hepatocytes between the two lobes or among the hepatocyte subpopulations in the atrophied lobe. The findings in this case suggest (1) lobar atrophy induces a hyperplastic response in more than one half of the cells of the contralateral lobe; (2) the development of atrophy consequent on biliary obstruction is likely the result of destruction of whole cells rather than cytoplasmic loss; (3) the development of a hyperplastic response within the atrophied lobe is a new finding and is consistent with the hormonal theory of hepatic regeneration; and (4) striking compensatory hypertrophy of the liver is associated with normal portal venous pressure. 
A randomized, controlled study of behavioral intervention for chemotherapy distress in children with cancer. Fifty-four pediatric cancer patients were studied to determine the relative efficacy of two forms of behavioral intervention for reducing chemotherapy-related distress. Following baseline assessment, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either hypnosis, non-hypnotic distraction/relaxation, or attention placebo (control) during the subsequent identical chemotherapy course. Observational and interview measures of anticipatory and postchemotherapy nausea, vomiting, distress, and functional disruption served as outcome data. Results indicated that treatment condition was the single best predictor of change from baseline to intervention, with children in the hypnosis group reporting the greatest reduction of both anticipatory and postchemotherapy symptoms. The cognitive distraction/relaxation intervention appeared to have a maintenance effect in which symptoms did not get much worse or much better, while children in the control group had symptoms that consistently became worse over time. Emetic potential of the chemotherapy and the prophylactic use of antiemetics each appeared to contribute to the overall severity of symptoms. While the efficacy of hypnosis in the management of chemotherapy distress is supported, the complexities of interacting biologic and psychologic factors are highlighted. 
Prospective, randomized controlled trial of interferon-alpha in children with chronic hepatitis B. Thirty-six children with chronic hepatitis B were entered into a randomized controlled trial of recombinant human interferon-alpha. All patients had hepatitis B virus DNA and increased levels of aminotransferases in serum for at least 1 yr. Twelve children received 10 MU of interferon-alpha 2b/m2 body surface area three times a week (group I); 12 children received 5 MU/m2 under the same conditions (group II); and 12 children served as controls (group III). During 6 mo of therapy, 12 of 24 (50%) treated patients (7 from group I, 58%, and 5 from group II, 42%) and 2 of 12 (17%) controls lost hepatitis B virus DNA from serum and subsequently remained negative. Comparison of the rate of response in group I vs. controls showed a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05). Eleven of 12 (92%) treated patients who cleared hepatitis B virus DNA from serum lost HBeAg, seroconverted to anti-HBe and had improvement in liver histological findings with loss of hepatitis B virus DNA from liver. In 10, serum ALT levels became normal. Interferon-alpha was well tolerated and all children finished therapy. These findings indicate that a 6-mo course of interferon-alpha is effective in inducing a serological, biochemical and histological remission of disease in approximately 50% of children with chronic hepatitis B. 
High-attenuation mediastinal masses on unenhanced CT. On unenhanced CT scans, a variety of mediastinal masses contain areas with attenuation values higher than the attenuation value of the chest wall musculature. The increased attenuation may be diffuse or focal and may be a result of calcium deposition, high iodine content, or areas of acute hemorrhage. This report illustrates the gamut of high-attenuation mediastinal masses seen on unenhanced CT. Masses that are of high attenuation only on IV contrast-enhanced images (e.g., aberrant vessels) are not included. 
Is reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension beneficial? The left ventricle increases its mass and wall thickness in hypertension as a result of the progressive increase in hemodynamic overload offered by increasing arterial blood pressure and total peripheral resistance. However, evidence is increasing that nonhemodynamic factors may also be important in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This LVH resulting from hypertensive disease conveys an independent risk of premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The specific mechanisms accounting for this increased risk are not known with assurance, although several mechanisms are under active study; they include more prominently ventricular dysrhythmias and myocardial ischemia. It is possible to diminish the increased left ventricular mass with pharmacological agents, although currently it is not known whether this reversal also diminishes the risk associated with LVH. Therefore, at the present time the best means for preventing the risk of LVH is to prevent its development in the first place, and this seems to be preventable through control of arterial blood pressure at the earliest stages of hypertension. Risk may also be diminished in patients with existing LVH who are receiving digitalis or diuretics or who have chronic fluid- and electrolyte-disturbing diseases. Under these circumstances, the careful use and selection of antihypertensive therapy and control of electrolyte balance no doubt will prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality. 
Gastric cancer after gastric bypass for obesity. Case report. We describe a patient in whom gastric cancer developed after gastric bypass for morbid obesity. In addition, we review the literature to emphasize the technical problems involved in diagnosing disease in the excluded portion of the stomach. 
Ophthalmoplegia with headache. Be aware of diabetes. Cranial neuropathy affecting the eyes is a possible symptom of type II diabetes. In this article, Dr Dickerman describes a case in which diabetes was diagnosed in a 63-year-old woman who presented with unilateral headache and eye pain. 
Endoscopic sphincterotomy complications and their management: an attempt at consensus. Despite its relative safety (in comparison with surgery), and undoubted role in many clinical circumstances, biliary sphincterotomy is the most dangerous procedure routinely performed by endoscopists. Complications occur in about 10% of patients; 2 to 3% have a prolonged hospital stay, with a risk of dying. This document is an attempt to provide guidelines for prevention and management of complications, based on a workshop of selected experts, and a comprehensive review of the literature. We emphasize particularly the importance of specialist training, disinfection, drainage, and collaboration with surgical colleagues. 
Psychological stress and susceptibility to the common cold BACKGROUND. It is not known whether psychological stress suppresses host resistance to infection. To investigate this issue, we prospectively studied the relation between psychological stress and the frequency of documented clinical colds among subjects intentionally exposed to respiratory viruses. METHODS. After completing questionnaires assessing degrees of psychological stress, 394 healthy subjects were given nasal drops containing one of five respiratory viruses (rhinovirus type 2, 9, or 14, respiratory syncytial virus, or coronavirus type 229E), and an additional 26 were given saline nasal drops. The subjects were then quarantined and monitored for the development of evidence of infection and symptoms. Clinical colds were defined as clinical symptoms in the presence of an infection verified by the isolation of virus or by an increase in the virus-specific antibody titer. RESULTS. The rates of both respiratory infection (P less than 0.005) and clinical colds (P less than 0.02) increased in a dose-response manner with increases in the degree of psychological stress. Infection rates ranged from approximately 74 percent to approximately 90 percent, according to levels of psychological stress, and the incidence of clinical colds ranged from approximately 27 percent to 47 percent. These effects were not altered when we controlled for age, sex, education, allergic status, weight, the season, the number of subjects housed together, the infectious status of subjects sharing the same housing, and virus-specific antibody status at base line (before challenge). Moreover, the associations observed were similar for all five challenge viruses. Several potential stress-illness mediators, including smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, diet, quality of sleep, white-cell counts, and total immunoglobulin levels, did not explain the association between stress and illness. Similarly, controls for personality variables (self-esteem, personal control, and introversion-extraversion) failed to alter our findings. CONCLUSIONS. Psychological stress was associated in a dose-response manner with an increased risk of acute infectious respiratory illness, and this risk was attributable to increased rates of infection rather than to an increased frequency of symptoms after infection. 
Chronic pain and substance abuse: a pilot study of opioid maintenance. Recent reports suggest that opioid maintenance may be appropriate for treatment-resistant patients with chronic nonmalignant pain syndromes. However, a history of substance abuse is thought to be a contraindication for such treatment. We present a pilot study of a methadone maintenance-type treatment for patients with both chronic pain and substance abuse, evaluating the ability to attract and hold patients, the methodology for assessing change, and the potential problems and pitfalls. Weekly random urinalysis, weekly psychotherapy, and quarterly self-report tests of pain, mood, and function were used to evaluate change. Three out of 4 patients remained in treatment for 19-21 months, stopped needle use, and/or markedly decreased substance abuse, and appear to have improved functionally. Surprisingly, all 3 patients had significant psychopathology requiring treatment with psychotropic medication. This treatment may warrant further research. 
Ciprofloxacin: drug of choice in the treatment of malignant external otitis (MEO). Ciprofloxacin, a fluorinated quinolone with high efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was used in the treatment of 10 consecutive patients with malignant external otitis. All patients had skull base osteomyelitis documented by nuclear and computed tomography (CT) scans. Dosages of 1.5 g of ciprofloxacin daily were used for a mean average of 10 weeks. All patients were considered cured with a minimum follow-up of 18 months after completion of therapy. A new classification of malignant external otitis (MEO) is presented. 
Role of early fluid resuscitation in pediatric septic shock. OBJECTIVE. To examine the association of the volume of fluid administered at 1 and 6 hours after presentation, with survival and the occurrence of the adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and persistent hypovolemia during the resuscitation of children with septic shock. SETTING AND PATIENTS. All pediatric patients with septic shock presenting to the emergency department over a 6-year period and having a pulmonary artery catheter inserted by 6 hours after presentation were identified. METHODS. Patients were analyzed together and in three groups based on fluid volume in the first hour: group 1, less than 20 mL/kg; group 2, 20 to 40 mL/kg; and group 3, more than 40 mL/kg. Adult respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed by the presence of alveolar infiltrates, hypoxemia, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or less. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema was diagnosed similarly, except the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was greater than 15 mm Hg. Hypovolemia was diagnosed by the presence of oliguria, hypotension, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 8 mm Hg or less 6 hours after presentation. RESULTS. We identified 34 patients (median age, 13.5 months). At 1 and 6 hours, respectively, group 1 (n = 14) received 11 +/- 6 and 71 +/- 29 mL/kg (mean +/- SD) of fluid; group 2 received 32 +/- 5 and 108 +/- 54 mL/kg of fluid; and group 3 received 69 +/- 19 and 117 +/- 29 mL/kg of fluid. Survival in group 3 (eight of nine patients) was significantly better than in group 1 (six of 14 patients) or group 2 (four of 11 patients). Adult respiratory distress syndrome developed in 11 patients (32%) and cardiogenic pulmonary edema developed in five patients (15%). Having adult respiratory distress syndrome was associated with increased mortality, but adult respiratory distress syndrome was not increased in any group. Similarly, cardiogenic pulmonary edema was not associated with the fluid volume received or with decreased survival. Hypovolemia occurred in six patients in group 1 and two patients in group 2; all eight subsequently died. CONCLUSION. Rapid fluid resuscitation in excess of 40 mL/kg in the first hour following emergency department presentation was associated with improved survival, decreased occurrence of persistent hypovolemia, and no increase in the risk of cardiogenic pulmonary edema or adult respiratory distress syndrome in this group of pediatric patients with septic shock. 
Vigabatrin and psychosis. We report a series of 14 cases of psychosis occurring in patients with severe intractable epilepsy, following the prescription of vigabatrin, a new antiepileptic drug. Nine patients had no previous history of psychosis. In eight patients the psychosis occurred following a change in the habitual pattern of seizure activity; in four it developed after a period of seizure freedom followed by a cluster of seizures, and in the other four patients an alternating psychosis was observed. In five patients there was no clear relationship to seizure pattern. Another patient developed psychosis after taking an overdose of between eight and 12 g of vigabatrin. A further three patients, who developed psychosis following vigabatrin withdrawal, were not included in this series. The mean dose at onset of the psychosis (excluding the patient who took an overdose) was 2580 mg, and the period from initiation of therapy to the onset of psychosis varied from five days to 32 weeks (and occurred 24 hours after the overdose of vigabatrin). In all cases the psychosis resolved, but necessitated the withdrawal of vigabatrin, except in the single patient who took the overdose. The mechanism of this behaviour change is unclear, but in some instances may reflect vigabatrin's powerful anti-epileptic action. This is clearly not the case for all patients. Vigabatrin should be started with caution in patients with severe epilepsy, particularly in the presence of a previous history of psychosis, and such patients should be carefully monitored. 
Concomitant benefit of preoperative irradiation in preventing pancreas fistula formation after pancreatoduodenectomy. Preoperative irradiation improves both the resectability and curability of carcinoma of the pancreas head area and should improve patient survival. We retrospectively investigated the value of preoperative irradiation in preventing pancreatic fistula formation. Of 76 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticojejunostomy by mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis with a stent catheter after pancreatoduodenectomy, 22 had received preoperative irradiation. The irradiation field included the anastomotic site. In two patients, accidental dislocation of the stent catheter was the apparent cause of fistula formation, but the other 21 patients in the irradiated group developed no fistula. In contrast, nine (17%) of 53 patients in the nonirradiated group developed fistulas. In the irradiated group, preoperative selenomethionine Se 75 scintigraphy revealed a cold area corresponding to the pancreas body, which was included in the irradiation field. Thus, a putative decrease in exocrine function at the pancreatic anastomotic site could explain why fistula formation was prevented by preoperative irradiation. 
Clinical application of a patient-controlled apparatus for ventricular administration of morphine in intractable pain: report of 28 cases. The authors developed a patient-controlled apparatus (L-224) for ventricular administration of pain-relieving medication and utilized it in the treatment of 28 patients with intractable pain. The initial dose of morphine hydrochloride was 1 mg, which afforded pain relief for an average of 170 hours. At an average dose of 1.8 mg, the average time of pain relief obtained was 137 hours. Therefore, they conclude that L-224 is a satisfactory apparatus for the ventricular administration of pain medication; it is patient controlled, safe, and reliable in clinical application. 
Peripheral adaptations in congestive heart failure: a review. In congestive heart failure, peripheral adaptive mechanisms play a significant and largely underestimated role. In acute heart failure, sympathetic-mediated peripheral vasoconstriction together with chronotropic and inotropic actions serves to maintain perfusion pressure and blood supply to the vital organs. In chronic heart failure, activation of the renin-angiotensin system increases peripheral vascular resistance and arterial tone and decreases arterial compliance and vasodilator capacity. Endothelium-mediated, flow-dependent vasodilation is reduced as a consequence of reduced blood flow. Deconditioning renders the blood vessels incapable of dilating in response to increased flow. Simultaneously, reduced blood flow and inactivity are induced by deconditioning, with functional and structural consequences within the skeletal muscle. Exercise performance is limited by reduced overall blood flow, reduced conductance of the feeding arteries, elevated tone of the resistance vessels, reduced vasodilator capacity, impaired dissipation of heat from the working muscle, and functional and structural changes of the skeletal muscle due to underperfusion and inactivity. The adaptive mechanisms operate at different time scales. Under therapeutic intervention, their reversibility also follows different time constants. Restoration of the vasodilator capacity of the large arteries and of the abnormalities of skeletal muscle in heart failure requires time. Vasodilation with reduced pre- and/or afterload will retard progression of the superimposed ventricular dilation and hypertrophy, and therefore retard the progress of the disease. However, restoration of the peripheral blood flow and of organ function will require time. Restoration of the vascular compliance and of the full amplitude of adaptive flow-dependent vasodilation in the large arteries requires weeks or months. Similarly, restoration of functionally and morphologically altered skeletal muscle can be expected to be reversible over a longer time period. 
Cell-surface ganglioside GD2 in the immunohistochemical detection and differential diagnosis of neuroblastoma. The expression of the disialoganglioside GD2 was analyzed in 67 solid tumors and normal tissues from children by using the GD2-specific murine monoclonal antibody 3A7 and the indirect immunoperoxidase method. GD2 was expressed in all of 28 neuroblastomas and was most abundant in stroma-poor tumors. In differentiating stroma-rich neuroblastomas, neuroblastic clusters, neurofibrils, and most ganglion-like cells were positive, whereas Schwann's-cell stroma did not express GD2. In ganglioneuromas, only a few ganglion-like cells showed GD2, whereas all other structures were negative. Scattered foci of ganglioside GD2 also were found in some non-neuronal tumors, such as rhabdomyosarcomas and osteosarcomas, but not in lymphomas, Askin tumors, or most Wilms' tumors. The monoclonal antibody 3A7 is a useful aid in the immunohistochemical diagnosis of neuroblastoma. In addition, the intense cell surface staining of neuroblastoma cells by this reagent makes it potentially useful for detecting residual neuroblastoma in bone marrow samples and lymph node biopsies. 
Objective antitumor activity of acivicin in patients with recurrent CNS malignancies: a Southwest Oncology Group trial. Acivicin (AT-125) is a glutamine antagonist with dose-limiting, schedule-dependent CNS toxicity and predictable CSF penetration after intravenous administration. Because of these properties, a trial in CNS malignancies was initiated. Thirty-two patients with recurrent or residual malignant astrocytomas were treated with AT-125. The majority of patients had glioblastoma multiforme (24) and had received prior nitrosoureas (21). The median age was 50 years, and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) performance status was 2. The major determinant of response was based upon radiologic criteria using computed tomographic (CT) scanning and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The tumor mass was measured in two perpendicular planes, which yielded the largest cross-sectional area. Standard solid tumor criteria for response were used. All responding patients also had a stable or tapered dose of corticosteroids with stable or improved performance status and neurologic examination. There were four objective responses (12%): one complete remission (3 1/2+ years) and three partial remissions (57, 86, and 322 days). Two patients had improvement in disease that did not meet requirements for a partial remission. Toxicity was mild and primarily consisted of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy. Two patients were removed from study due to neurotoxicity (depression and hallucinations). The strict response criteria used in this trial were not those that have been used in testing other active agents such as carmustine (BCNU). We conclude that AT-125 has objective antitumor activity in malignant astrocytomas and warrants further study. 
Lovastatin inhibits gallstone formation in the cholesterol-fed prairie dog. The efficacy of lovastatin, an inhibitor of hepatic cholesterol synthesis in the prevention of cholesterol gallstone formation, was evaluated in the prairie dog model. Two groups of animals were maintained on either nonlithogenic or 1.2% cholesterol-enriched chow for 21 days. Seven of the animals in each group received lovastatin, and the remaining six received only distilled water. All of the cholesterol-fed/water-treated animals had crystals and 83% had gallstones, but none of the cholesterol-fed/lovastatin-treated animals had gallstones and only three had microscopic crystals. These data indicate that lovastatin inhibits cholesterol gallstone formation in a diet-induced model of gallstone disease. 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(4;11) translocation after osteogenic sarcoma. The authors report a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(4;11) (q21;q23) occurring 9 months after treatment of osteogenic sarcoma. Cell surface marker and molecular analyses suggest early B lineage involvement. This is the first report, to the knowledge of the authors, of t(4;11) ALL arising after an osteogenic sarcoma. The observations of the authors support the possibility of a causal relationship between exposure to carcinogens and the occurrence of leukemia with t(4;11). 
Experimental hyperthermia: protective effect of oxygen carrying fluorocarbon and crystalloids intraperitoneally. The treatment of hyperthermia produced by passive warming was studied in anesthetized rats weighing 250-300 grams. In the first set of seven experiments, the authors found that venous blood oxygen fell as core temperature rose. Intraperitoneal injection of 20 ml of the oxygen carrying fluorocarbon (perfluorotributylamine, FC-43) emulsion in three of the animals shifted the curve to the right improving venous oxygen content (p less than 0.1). In the second series of experiments, a catheter was placed in the carotid artery. This catheter was attached to a pressure transducer for continuous recording of blood pressure and heart rate. Periodic blood samples were removed for measurement of blood gases, pH, and lactate. Four of the animals received 20 ml of isotonic saline, three received 20 ml of FC-43 emulsion both given intraperitoneally, and four served as controls. In the control group, there was an increase in systolic blood pressure and heart rate which peaked at a colon temperature of 42 degrees C, followed by cardiovascular collapse and death around 43 degrees C. Arterial PO2 (corrected for temperature) remained relatively constant up to 42 degrees C, and then fell. The arterial PCO2 rose sharply when the core temperature exceeded 43 degrees C. Arterial lactate content began to increase at 42 degrees C and above 43 degrees C was 2.5 fold elevated. Isotonic saline provided circulatory support but did not change the hypoxia or mixed acidosis from CO2 and lactate above 43 degrees C. FC-43 emulsion decreased hypoxia and improved circulatory performance but was associated with a mild respiratory alkalosis as arterial PCO2 fell. 
Planned delayed nephrectomy after ethanol embolization of renal carcinoma. Planned delayed nephrectomy after preoperative ethanol infarction was done in 6 patients with renal carcinoma. Three patients had intracaval extension of tumor, 2 had renal vein but no vena caval extension and 1 had no renal vein or vena caval involvement. Nephrectomy was delayed 22 to 44 days after embolization. In the patients with inferior vena caval extension shrinkage of tumor thrombus after embolization allowed for easier surgical resection. Furthermore, delay of nephrectomy after preoperative infarction was of value in improving the clinical status of high risk patients. 
Surgical management of essential blepharospasm. We have reviewed the surgical management of essential blepharospasm over the last 15 years, comparing the results from facial nerve avulsion with those from orbicularis muscle stripping. After facial nerve avulsion 50% of patients remained free of troublesome spasm for 15 months after surgery, but only 25% remained so for more than two years. Following orbicularis oculi myectomy 50% of patients were free of troublesome spasms for 30 months after surgery and 55% of patients had relief from spasm for more than two years. Secondary effects of the two procedures are compared and are found to be fewer after orbicularis myectomy. There were no major complications after either form of surgery. Botulinum toxin is the treatment of first choice for this condition. If this becomes ineffective or inconvenient, surgical treatment is warranted and should not be deferred for fear of severe side effects of treatment, since these are rare. Protractor myectomy gives longer relief from blepharospasm than facial nerve avulsion and has fewer complications. However, it is technically difficult, time consuming, and has greater peroperative morbidity. Facial nerve avulsion may therefore still have a role in selected patients. 
Recent trends in acute care hospital utilization in Ontario for diseases of the circulatory system. OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in the use of acute care hospital services for diseases of the circulatory system in Ontario. DESIGN: Observational study. DATA EXTRACTION: Information on diagnoses, procedures and demographic characteristics was obtained from routinely collected computerized abstracts of separations from all acute care hospitals in Ontario during 1979-80, 1983-84 and 1988-89. The data were combined with population estimates to calculate overall separation rates and rates specific for age, diagnosis and procedure. Resource intensity weights were used to estimate changes in resource use. MAIN RESULTS: The overall separation rate increased by 3% and the resource-intensity-weighted separation rate by 12% from 1979-80 to 1988-89. The overall medical separation rate increased by 2%, whereas the surgical rate increased by 12%. The surgical separation rate increased among patients 55 to 79 years of age but decreased in all the other adult age groups. The separation rates for coronary artery bypass surgery and cardiac valve surgery increased rapidly among patients 65 years of age or older. The medical separation rate decreased for patients of all ages except those less than 5 years and those 80 years or more. The medical separation rates decreased by less than 1% for diagnoses related to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and increased dramatically for coronary artery revascularization. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing elderly population has not resulted in large increases in acute care hospital utilization for diseases of the circulatory system. The impact of an aging population has been balanced by decreased utilization rates in the younger groups. The intensity of hospital care has risen primarily because of increases in surgical rates, especially in the elderly population. The large decrease in the rate of death from IHD over the past two decades has not been associated with similar decreases in acute care hospital utilization for this disorder. 
Surgical management of diffuse subaortic stenosis: an integrated approach. An integrated approach to the surgical management of diffuse subaortic stenosis has been designed to provide adequate relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction whatever the anatomical features encountered at operation. This approach was used in 22 patients with tunnel subaortic stenosis (19 patients) or diffuse hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (3 patients). The obstructive tissue was resected through an aortoseptal approach. In 18 patients, associated hypoplasia of the aortic orifice necessitated aortic valve replacement using the Konno procedure; in 4 patients with a normal-sized aortic orifice, the native aortic valve was preserved. There were two early deaths and one late death (all after a Konno operation). Long-term adequate relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was achieved in all survivors. Operation for diffuse subaortic stenosis should be performed with two main goals: (1) to obtain complete relief of the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction by the appropriate procedure and (2) to preserve the native aortic valve whenever possible, particularly in young patients. 
Enteral hyperalimentation with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion improved severe diarrhea in poorly controlled diabetic patient. Little is known about effective treatment for severe diarrhea in the insulin-dependent diabetic patient. A 41-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of hyperglycemia and dysuria. She had stopped insulin self-injection therapy for 2 years and diarrhea had become worse, resulting in malnutrition. Following enteral alimentation by elemental diet (ED) with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), frequency of diarrhea remarkably decreased and general nutritional condition was improved. At the first step, the patient was given 600 kcal/d ED through the tube sustained in the jejunum. Total calorie intake for 24 hours was gradually increased to the level of 2400 kcal/d and this therapy continued for 5 months. During this period, blood glucose level was kept in almost normal range (between 100 and 200 mg/dL) through the continuous insulin infusion of regular insulin (1.0-1.5 U/h). Thereafter, general conditions were improved and frequency of diarrhea gradually decreased. When this treatment was stopped, watery diarrhea, steatorrhea, and hypoalbuminemia completely disappeared and she gained 12 kg of body weight. Furthermore, spontaneous urination appeared following this treatment. This case suggests that the enteral hyperalimentation combined with strict control of blood glucose, using the CSII, may be an effective therapy for such severe diarrhea with malnutrition in diabetes. 
Percutaneous coronary angioscopy in patients with restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioscopy with a flexible steerable microangioscope was performed in five patients undergoing repeat angioplasty. Recurrent lesions were assessed by angioscopy before and after the angioplasty procedure. The most common surface morphology observed in these restenosis lesions was that of white unpigmented lesions consistent with the proliferation of fibrous tissue. Also noted during angioscopy was the presence or absence of thrombus or dissection in association with the lesions either before or after angioplasty. Filmy wisps of tissue, presumably intimal flaps, were commonly visualized after angioplasty. There were no complications related to angioscopy or angioplasty in these patients. The surface morphology of restenosis lesions appears to be different from that of primary atherosclerotic lesions. The lesions in these five patients with restenosis were generally white and fibrotic in appearance, as opposed to the pigmented yellow to yellow-brown lesions commonly seen in undilated atherosclerotic lesions. It was also noted that the presence of intracoronary thrombus was strongly associated with the clinical syndrome of unstable angina. These findings support the hypothesis that restenosis lesions are the result of a reparative process consisting of smooth muscle cell proliferation and fibrosis. 
Cervical cancer screening: who is not screened and why? BACKGROUND: The decline in death rates from cervical cancer in the United States has been widely attributed to the use of Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for early detection of cervical cancer. METHODS: Pap smear screening rates, beliefs about appropriate screening intervals and factors affecting screening were examined using 1987 National Health Interview Survey data. RESULTS: Results indicate that through age 69, Blacks are screened at similar or higher rates than Whites. Hispanics, particularly those speaking only or mostly Spanish, are least likely to have received a Pap smear within the last three years. Of women who had never heard of or never had a Pap smear, nearly 80 percent reported contact with a medical practitioner in the past two years, while more than 90 percent reported a contact in the past five years. Overall, the most frequently reported reason for not having a recent Pap smear was procrastinating or not believing it was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, in developing screening programs, Hispanics, particularly Spanish speakers, must be targeted. In addition, educational programs should target unscreened women who forego the test due to underestimating its importance, procrastination, or because their medical care provider did not suggest the procedure. Women must be intensively educated that Pap smears should be scheduled routinely to detect asymptomatic cervical cancer. 
Alcoholic liver disease in heterozygotes of mutant and normal aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes. To clarify the pathogenetic role of acetaldehyde in the development of alcoholic liver disease, genotyping of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes was performed and the clinical features of the alcoholic liver disease patients with different genotypes were compared. Genotyping of aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 was performed in 47 patients with alcoholic liver disease using the polymerase chain reaction and slot-blot hybridization. Of the 47 patients with alcoholic liver disease, 40 were homozygous for the normal aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 gene and the remaining seven cases were heterozygous for the normal and mutant aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes. No homozygote was found for the mutant aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes. Daily alcohol intake was less than 100 gm in all heterozygotes without relation to the type of alcoholic liver disease. On the other hand, all but four patients homozygotic for the normal aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 gene drank more than 100 gm alcohol/day. The mean daily alcohol intake in the heterozygotes was significantly lower than that in the normal homozygotes. The incidence of alcoholic fibrosis tended to be lower in the heterozygotes than in the normal homozygotes (14.2% vs. 52.5%). On the other hand, the incidence of alcoholic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis tended to be higher in the heterozygotes than in the normal homozygotes. These results indicate that alcoholic liver disease develops even with moderate amounts of alcohol intake in heterozygotes of the aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes, in which acetaldehyde metabolism in the liver is impaired and liver damage in the heterozygotes is more severe than that in the normal homozygotes, suggesting that habitual drinkers who are heterozygotes of the aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 genes may be at high risk for alcoholic liver disease. 
Comparative immunohistochemical staining for desmin and muscle-specific actin. A study of 576 cases. Muscle-specific actin (MSA) and desmin are considered to be sensitive and specific markers for muscle differentiation. The authors compared staining patterns for these markers in 576 samples of normal, reactive, and neoplastic tissues. The standard avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique was performed with the use of two commercial antibodies against MSA (HHF35; Enzo Biochemical, Inc., New York, NY) and desmin (DER11; DAKO Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA), respectively, on consecutive paraffin-embedded tissue sections from these cases. Both MSA and desmin were found in all 80 normal muscle samples. Although MSA appeared diffusely in all vascular smooth muscle samples, desmin was demonstrated focally in vascular smooth muscle cells in 100 of 196 samples. MSA but not desmin always was found in myoepithelial cells (25 samples), pericytes (286 samples), and decidual cells (7 samples). Among 76 cases of myofibroblast-containing lesions, 14 and 54 were found to have desmin and MSA, respectively. MSA and desmin were found in 4 of 4 cardiac rhabdomyomas, 34 of 34 rhabdomyosarcomas, and 5 of 6 leiomyomas. Among 22 leiomyosarcomas, 7 displayed either MSA or desmin and 7 showed both markers. In general, more tumor cells showed staining for MSA than desmin, but the reverse was true in some cases. Tissue fixed in Zenker's solution seemed to show a significant decrease in MSA immunoreactivity, but no significant change for desmin staining was observed. None of the 154 normal tissues and 22 benign nonmyogenic tumors expressed MSA or desmin. Among 133 malignant nonmyogenic tumors, positive staining for both desmin and MSA was found in 3 of 8 cases of glioblastoma multiforme, 1 of 10 malignant schwannomas, and 1 of 14 malignant fibrous histiocytomas; staining for only MSA was found in 3 of 14 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 1 of 10 malignant schwannomas, 6 of 6 fibromatoses, 1 of 1 mammary myofibroblastoma, and 1 of 7 malignant mesotheliomas; and staining for desmin only was seen in 1 of 7 malignant mesotheliomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Dementia. Age-dependent incidence, prevalence, and mortality in the old old. Age has been reported as a strong risk factor for dementia. Supporting data have been derived mainly from prevalence studies, which had varied criteria and sample compositions that precluded direct comparisons, especially among those aged 85 years and older. Data regarding rates of dementia are presented based on 85 incident cases in the Bronx (NY) Aging Study, a prospective study of 488 initially nondemented, old old persons (mean age on entry, 79 years). Overall, the incidence rate over 8 years of follow-up for all-cause dementia was 3.4 per 100 per year (43% Alzheimer's disease, 30% mixed Alzheimer's and vascular, and 27% other). Incidence rose significantly, irrespective of gender, as subjects were followed up through three age intervals--ages 75 to 79 years (1.3/100 per year), 80 to 84 years (3.5), and 85 years and older (6.0). The comparable age-associated prevalence rates of dementia were 3.7%, 12.2%, and 23.9%, respectively, with an overall period prevalence of 22.8%. Additionally, there was a threefold greater mortality associated with dementia. In conclusion, despite the shortened life expectancy of demented persons, dementia is a highly prevalent condition among those aged 85 years and older. Public policy attention is warranted, since this group is the fastest growing population subgroup. 
123I-iodoamphetamine SPECT brain imaging in alternating hemiplegia. Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is an unusual disorder characterized by early onset (occurring before 18 months of age); repeated attacks of hemiplegia involving both sides of the body; other paroxysmal phenomena, such as tonic stiffening, dystonic posturing, choreoathetoid movements, ocular motor abnormalities, and autonomic disturbances, in association with bouts of hemiplegia or occurring independently; and evidence of mental or neurologic deficits. A girl was examined because of left hemiplegia at the age of 16 months. The patient had begun exhibiting episodes of alternating hemiplegia at approximately 4 months of age. They consisted of tonic stiffening and dystonia of the right or left extremities, lasting from 30 min to several hours and followed by residual hemiparesis. They were invariably accompanied by ocular motor abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and angiography all were normal. Single proton emission computed tomography brain images during an acute episode of right hemiplegia demonstrated hypoperfusion of the left cerebral hemisphere. Following improvement of the hemiplegia, the patient was re-evaluated. The uptake of the radiotracer in the left hemisphere was increased. The scan did not demonstrate significant asymmetry in cerebral perfusion. 
Unimpinged and impinged anterior cruciate ligament grafts: MR signal intensity measurements. Regionalized magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensities were quantitatively measured in impinged and unimpinged anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) grafts. Images were obtained with a 1.5-T imager, and signal intensity was measured in the proximal, middle, and distal thirds of the graft. In 15 unimpinged ACL grafts, the signal intensity remained low and did not vary during the 1st year of graft implantation (45 images). In contrast, 17 impinged ACL grafts showed an increase in signal intensity in the distal two-thirds of the graft that persisted 1-3 years after implantation (P less than .001). Unimpinged grafts were placed in tibial tunnels posterior and parallel to the slope of the intercondylar roof. Reconstructions with anterior tibial tunnels resulted in graft impingement that caused increases in graft signal intensity. This increase demonstrates a clear association between surgical technique and the subsequent MR appearance of the graft. 
Multiple drug therapy in the treatment of essential hypertension. Treatment for high blood pressure is aimed to prevent the excess morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension by reducing the blood pressure to acceptable levels and by improving the cardiovascular risk status. Antihypertensive medications can be selected that not only reduce blood pressure but also have beneficial effects in concomitant illness and neutral or positive effects on other cardiovascular risk factors. Multiple drug therapy offers not only the possibility of greater therapeutic efficacy than that achieved with single agents but also the possibility of reduced incidence of side effects through complementary actions. The antihypertensive regimen should be simple and acceptable to the patient to promote compliance. Nurses, along with physicians, have an integral role in the long-term management of hypertensive patients through education, counsel, and follow-up for blood pressure control and health promotion. 
Screening dyspepsia by serology to Helicobacter pylori. Owing to limited endoscopy resources, various screening strategies for endoscopy have been proposed. Helicobacter pylori can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity by serology, and therefore we assessed the effects on diagnostic accuracy and endoscopic workload of a policy of screening clinic patients with dyspepsia before endoscopy by a strategy based on age, Helicobacter pylori serology, and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 1153 patients were studied, of whom 842 were of known histological H pylori status (histology group) and 293 had serum assessed prospectively by in-house and commercial ELISAs for detection of IgG antibodies to H pylori. Overall, the screening strategy would have reduced endoscopy workload by 23.3% (95% confidence interval 20.9-25.8%) and would have had a sensitivity for detection of peptic ulcer of 97.4% (94.5-99.1%). No peptic ulcer or malignant disease was missed in the patients studied prospectively, but 6 of 192 peptic ulcers in the histology group would have been missed. A policy of screening young dyspeptic patients for H pylori by serology is more sensitive than symptom-based screening strategies, and may have an important role in reducing endoscopy workload. 
Failure of dithiothreitol and pronase to reveal a false-positive cryptococcal antigen determination in cerebrospinal fluid. A patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and a serum rheumatoid factor (RF) of 1:1,280 had a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) latex agglutination test (LAT) for cryptococcal antigen, in culture-negative, India-ink-negative CSF. Pretreatment of the sample of CSF with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) ablated the antigen titer and established the presence of a false-positive LAT, whereas CSF pretreated with dithiothreitol (DTT) and pronase continued to yield a false-positive result. The differing ability of pronase, DTT, and 2-ME to eliminate interfering substances from CSF has not been previously described. Moreover, because RF is unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier, the authors postulated that malignant disease was responsible for the patient's false-positive LAT in CSF. Hence, the authors report the case to emphasize that false-positive LAT results in CSF are unlikely to be produced by RF and to underscore the benefit of using enzymatic and sulfhydryl-reducing agents when the validity of the initial test results are in doubt. Such a procedure will optimize the chances of accurately identifying false-positive LAT results in CSF. 
Effects of altered PaO2 and PaCO2 on left ventricular function and coronary hemodynamics in sheep. The effects of acute changes in arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen tension, produced by altering the inspired gas mixtures while maintaining constant-volume intermittent positive pressure ventilation, on global function, regional left ventricular function, and coronary hemodynamics were studied in eight sheep during halothane anesthesia. Hypercapnia (Paco2, 73.5 +/- 2.3 mm Hg, mean +/- SD) increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output but decreased systolic shortening in the base of the left ventricle. Hypocapnia (PaO2, 24 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) decreased cardiac output and coronary flow below levels seen with hypercapnia but not below levels seen with normocapnia. Systolic shortening decreased in both apical and basal regions, and left ventricular relaxation was impaired as evidenced by a reduction of the nadir of LV dP/dt. Hypoxemia (PaO2, 39 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) elicited a hyperdynamic response of the circulation, increased coronary blood flow, and exhausted the coronary flow reserve. Neither changes in PaCO2 nor changes in PaO2 caused postsystolic shortening, although hypercapnia caused nonuniformity of contraction in the left ventricle. Thus, marked alterations in oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions do not cause left ventricular dysfunction, even though moderate hypoxia reduces the coronary flow reserve. 
Estimation of morbid risk and age at onset with missing information. Investigators of genetic illnesses are currently employing life-table techniques to estimate the lifetime risk of disease and the age-at-onset distribution. This methodology assumes that onset ages are known for affected individuals and that censoring ages are known for unaffected individuals. We extend these methods to incorporate affected individuals with unknown onset ages and unaffected persons with unknown censoring ages and illustrate how conventional life-table methods can produce seriously biased estimates, particularly of lifetime risk. The methodology is not restricted to genetic illnesses and can be applied to more complex illnesses with unknown etiology. We present an example for Huntington disease, which is generally assumed to be a Mendelian autosomal dominant disease, yielding estimates of lifetime risk of .503 +/- .70 and mean onset age of 47.7 +/- 3.1 years for offspring with a single affected parent. When conventional life-table techniques are employed, these estimates are .238 +/- .032 and 43.2 +/- 2.2. 
A human Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus casei sp strain GG) promotes recovery from acute diarrhea in children. To determine the effect of a human Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus casei sp strain GG, Gefilac) on recovery from acute diarrhea (82% rotavirus), 71 well-nourished children between 4 and 45 months of age were studied. After oral rehydration, the patients randomly received either Lactobacillus GG-fermented milk product, 125 g (10(10-11) colony-forming units) twice daily (group 1); Lactobacillus GG freeze-dried powder, one dose (10(10-11) colony-forming units) twice daily (group 2); or a placebo, a pasteurized yogurt (group 3) 125 g twice daily; each diet was given for 5 days, in addition to normal full diet otherwise free of fermented dairy products. The mean (SD) duration of diarrhea after commencing the therapy was significantly shorter in group 1 (1.4 [0.8] days) and in group 2 (1.4 [0.8] days) than in group 3 (2.4 [1.1] days); F = 8.70, P less than 0.001. After rehydration, each dietary group maintained a positive weight trend. The urinary lactulose-mannitol recovery ratios (means [95% confidence intervals]) on admission were 0.09 (0.03, 0.24) in group 1, 0.12 (0.07, 0.22) in group 2, and 0.08 (0.04, 0.18) in group 3; no significant alterations in intestinal permeability were observed at retesting after 2 days of realimentation. The result indicates that early nutritional repletion after rehydration causes no mucosal disruption and is beneficial for recovery from diarrhea. It is further suggested that Lactobacillus GG in the form of fermented milk or freeze-dried powder is effective in shortening the course of acute diarrhea. 
The influence of osteophytes and aortic calcification on spinal mineral density in postmenopausal women. The assessment of vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) in the anterio-posterior projection has become widely used in the management and prevention of osteoporosis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the presence of spinal osteophytes has a major impact on measured BMD in men, thus casting doubt on the value of these BMD measurements. We have assessed the impact of osteophytic and aortic calcification on spinal and femoral BMD measurements in 130 normal postmenopausal women, aged 45-71 yr. Lateral lumbar spine radiographs were obtained in all subjects and graded separately (0-3) for osteophytes and aortic calcification. Both forms of calcification increased with age, and BMD of all sites was correlated positively with body weight and negatively with age. The correlation coefficients between BMD and calcification scores were nonsignificant. Multiple regression analysis, including weight, age, and calcification scores, demonstrated a small but significant effect of osteophyte score on lumbar BMD (partial r2 = 0.04; P = 0.012) and a similar trend for Ward's triangle and the trochanteric region (partial r2 = 0.02; P less than 0.06). The aortic calcification score remained nonsignificant. It is concluded that the influence of spinal osteophytes on lumbar BMD in postmenopausal women is substantially less than that in men and is, therefore, unlikely to interfere with BMD estimation in most subjects. The relationship between proximal femoral BMD and osteophyte score suggests a real relationship between skeletal density and degenerative joint disease, as has been demonstrated by others. 
Organ-specific cardiac antibodies: serological markers for systemic hypertension in autoimmune polyendocrinopathy. Circulating organ-specific autoantibodies are serological markers of destruction or impairment of the relevant endocrine tissue cells and may be associated with abnormal hormone levels with or without clinical evidence of overt disease. We sought organ-specific cardiac antibodies in patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy because of increasing evidence that the heart has endocrine characteristics (secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP] and other peptide hormones). Serum samples from 166 patients with polyendocrinopathy, 80 with autoimmunity confined to one gland, and 200 healthy blood donors were tested for these antibodies by means of immunofluorescence on human heart. Skeletal muscle was used to identify cross-reacting antibodies. Organ-specific cardiac antibodies were detected in significantly more of the patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (28 [17%]) than of those with autoimmunity confined to one gland (1 [1%]) or of normal subjects (7 [3.5%]; p = 0.0001). Among the patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, the prevalence of systemic hypertension was higher in those with cardiac autoantibodies than in those without (5/28 [18%] vs 2/80 [3%]; p = 0.01); the same was true for a family history of hypertension (11 [42%] vs 5 [7%]; p = 0.0001). There were no significant differences in mean basal or stimulated ANP concentrations between patients with or without antibodies or between patients and controls. 5 of the 22 antibody-positive patients had ANP concentrations outside the normal range, but these disturbances were not associated with systemic hypertension or a family history of the disorder. Patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy can have organ-specific cardiac antibodies, which may represent novel serological markers for an autoimmune form of systemic hypertension in the absence of overt cardiac disease. 
Circadian blood pressure pattern in patients with treated hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensives is an important determinant of prognosis. In the present study 45 patients with treated essential hypertension were divided into two groups: 23 patients had normal left ventricular dimension and 22 patients had echocardiographic signs of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). All patients were adequately treated during daytime, but ambulatory blood pressure monitoring showed a distinct abnormal pattern in the LVH group characterized by a lack of blood pressure reduction during the night; 16 of 22 patients with LVH had no blood pressure decline during the night, whereas 17 of 23 patients without hypertrophy showed this reduction (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, patients with hypertension and LVH often reveal a lack of blood pressure decline during the night, which may be the reason for the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (and thus should be managed by a different circadian blood pressure therapy) or which may be the consequence of progressive structural changes in the resistance vessels, along with the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. It is suggested that patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy should have ambulatory twenty-four hour blood pressure monitoring. 
A transformation-incompetent, nuclear antigen 2-deleted Epstein-Barr virus associated with replicative infection. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) obtained directly from the oropharynx was used to detect viral DNA deleted for the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2)-encoding gene that is essential for lymphocyte transformation. By polymerase chain reaction analysis, the deletion was found in virus from 5 of 33 healthy adult donors and 11 of 12 patients with concurrent human immunodeficiency virus infection. Lymphoblastoid cell lines that produce standard transforming EBV also harbored EBNA2-deleted virus in cells permissive of EBV replication. In vitro infectivity studies indicated that the DNA is packaged and transmissible, with biologic properties similar to those of a laboratory mutant, P3HR-1, which also lacks the EBNA2 gene. These findings, obtained from productively infected cell systems, provide evidence for the existence in nature of a transformation-incompetent EBV variant that may facilitate EBV persistence and the emergence of reactivation diseases. 
Dilated cardiomyopathy with mitral regurgitation: decreased survival despite a low frequency of left ventricular thrombus. Ninety-one patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were studied by two-dimensional, pulsed, and color Doppler echocardiography (1) to detect and quantify mitral regurgitation (MR), (2) to record apical flow velocities in systole and diastole, and (3) to detect the presence of left ventricular thrombi. MR was detected in 57% of the patients and thrombi were present in 40%, but the occurrence of both MR and thrombus was rare (8%). Apical flow velocity was significantly higher throughout the cardiac cycle in the group with MR (diastole 15 +/- 7 vs 9 +/- 7 cm/sec; systole 29 +/- 12 vs 16 +/- 13 cm/sec; p less than 0.001 for both), accounting for the rarity of thrombi in this group. Follow-up data on 89% of the patients showed markedly decreased survival in the group with MR (22% vs 60% at 32 +/- 6 months, p less than 0.005), and this was evident even in patients with mild MR. Thus although MR is a noninvasively obtainable marker of a large subgroup of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy "protected" from left ventricular thrombus formation, it is a sensitive marker of decreased survival. 
Increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor number in chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Production of the antiviral cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha is increased in chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and clinical studies of tumor necrosis factor-alpha have indicated a proviral effect at higher doses. To determine whether this might be related to abnormal cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor expression, binding characteristics of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor on peripheral blood mononuclear cells in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers were studied using radioiodinated recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The specific binding curves generated were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard to determine cell surface receptor numbers and dissociation constants. A single class of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor was demonstrated on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mononuclear subsets. The median number (range) of cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from controls (n = 11), chronic hepatitis B virus patients seropositive for hepatitis B virus DNA (n = 8) and seronegative for hepatitis B virus DNA (n = 8) were 2,329 (range = 1,538 to 3,133), 3,375 (range = 2,300 to 6,718) (p less than 0.01) and 3,113 (range = 2,229 to 5,246) (p less than 0.05) sites/cell, respectively. They all had similar dissociation constants of 8.4 x 10(-10) mol/L (range = 4.1 to 16.9), respectively. Further dissection of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that this increase in cell surface receptor number was confined to the monocyte fraction (p less than 0.01). Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in five patients with increased monocyte cell surface tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor numbers were also elevated. 
Enterococcal endocarditis: a comparison of prosthetic and native valve disease. Between 1973 and 1987, 36 patients with 41 episodes of enterococcal endocarditis were seen at our institution. There were 22 episodes of native valve endocarditis (NVE) and 19 episodes of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). The overall mortality before completion of therapy was 15% (18% due to NVE and 11% due to PVE). Among patients with NVE, involvement of the aortic valve was significantly associated with death or complicated illness (defined as the need for valve replacement before completion of antibiotic therapy or relapse of endocarditis after completion of therapy). Among patients who survived episodes of PVE, 69% were cured without surgical intervention. Gentamicin was administered in combination with a penicillin or vancomycin in the majority of episodes (mean duration of therapy with aminoglycosides: 5 weeks). Renal dysfunction occurred in 44% of patients who received gentamicin and occurred more frequently in patients with elevated serum creatinine levels before treatment. Our results suggest that enterococcal PVE can often be successfully treated with antibiotics alone, and they confirm the efficacy of gentamicin when it is administered in combination with cell wall-active agents for the treatment of endocarditis due to enterococci that lack high-level resistance to this agent. 
Gastric emptying in human disease states. The application of new radioisotope methods in external in vivo scanning has increased our knowledge of how disease and treatment can effect gastric emptying (GE). Solids leave the stomach more slowly than liquids, and conditions causing gastroparesis affect solids before liquids. Gastric mucosal abnormalities and their treatment can affect GE. Diseases of the gastric musculature, including the inflammatory and endocrine myopathies, muscular dystrophies, and infiltrative disorders, can result in significant gastroparesis. Acute and chronic neuropathy may both affect gastric emptying. The latter neuropathies are now the subject of intense investigation with new prokinetic drugs. Finally, abnormal GE may be a major clinical feature of certain severe psychiatric disorders. 
Prognosis after initial recurrence of cutaneous melanoma. We reviewed 231 patients who developed recurrent disease 1 to 218 months after surgical therapy for clinical stage I cutaneous melanoma. Metastatic lesions amenable to surgery, including visceral recurrences, were resected. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy/immunotherapy or regional hyperthermic perfusion was added in patients with unresected disease. Local irradiation was employed for nonresectable brain or other isolated symptomatic metastases. The overall 5-year survival rate after initial recurrence was 36%. In patients with soft tissue or nodal recurrence, the 5-year survival rates were 49% and 38%, respectively; six (11%) of 53 patients whose initial recurrence was in a visceral organ achieved prolonged remission. Primary lesion anatomic site, thickness, pathologic type, and interval from initial therapy to recurrence were unrelated to survival. Significant prognostic factors included the site of initial metastasis, stage of primary disease, and the successful complete eradication of gross disease by surgical excision or intensive chemotherapy. 
Paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma: results of therapy in 18 cases. The management of paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma has evolved more slowly than that for testicular germ cell tumors, mainly due to its lower incidence and the lack of standardized treatment protocols. With gradual refinements in staging and therapy the prognosis has improved. Between 1960 and 1988, 18 patients 2 to 18 years old were treated at the Children's Hospital. Management consisted of inguinal orchiectomy, staging evaluation and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy according to the stage of the disease. In 11 patients (61%) the disease was confined to the scrotum, while 7 presented with spread to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, including 3 children with more distant metastases. Histological study revealed predominantly embryonal characteristics except for 1 alveolar cell type. Chemotherapy consisted of actinomycin D in 2 patients, vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide in 2, pulse vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide in 10, and doxorubicin plus vincristine, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide in 4. A total of 17 patients remain free of disease (median followup 4 years) with 1 death. The actuarial survival without relapse and over-all survival rate are 89 and 94%, respectively. We conclude that paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma represents a favorable subgroup of rhabdomyosarcoma. 
Neurotoxicity of intraventricularly administered alpha-interferon for leptomeningeal disease. Nine patients with leptomeningeal disease are reported who were treated with intraventricular alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN). In seven of these patients, a progressive vegetative state developed during treatment. The patients became unresponsive to verbal commands but opened their eyes with auditory or tactile stimulation. It took an average of 3 weeks for these patients to become verbally responsive after treatment was discontinued. Electroencephalographic findings showed evidence of irritative involvement of the deep midline nuclei in 80% of patients. Periventricular white matter changes developed during treatment in three of six patients who underwent computed tomographic scans. All patients with this severe neurotoxicity received whole-brain irradiation before treatment. Possible mechanisms for the development of this neurotoxic syndrome are discussed. The neurotoxicity of alpha-IFN and brain irradiation may be additive, suggesting a cautious approach when using this combination for treatment. 
Acoustic-distortion products: separation of sensory from neural dysfunction in sensorineural hearing loss in human beings and rabbits. Because distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) provide a noninvasive measure of outer hair-cell (OHC) activity, they should provide a unique and sensitive indicator of the effects of agents that damage hearing. Using DPOAE methods, the present study was designed to assess the relative contributions of the cochlea's outer hair cells to some common sensorineural diseases, including Meniere's disease, acoustic neuroma, and noise-induced, hereditary, and sudden idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss. Parallel evaluations of DPOAEs were performed under essentially identical conditions in rabbit models of several of the human disorders, including noise-induced hearing loss, endolymphatic hydrops, and cochlear neurectomy. Animal studies were performed to assess the proficiency of DPOAEs to track a developing sensorineural deficit as well as to compare patterns of DPOAE dysfunction between clinical and experimental forms of peripheral hearing loss. Detailed measures of DPOAEs were collected in the stimulus-frequency and intensity domains as "audiograms" and response/growth or input/output functions, respectively. The outcome of analyses of both human beings and animals supported the notion that DPOAE testing is sensitive to sensory-cell disease. Thus, in combination with conventional audiometry, DPOAE measures permit a distinction between the relative contribution sensory and neural components of the cochlea make to hearing deficits. 
Usefulness of high-frequency analysis of signal-averaged surface electrocardiograms in acute myocardial infarction before and after coronary thrombolysis for assessing coronary reperfusion. The incidence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram before and after coronary thrombolysis was studied in 54 patients with an acute myocardial infarction of less than or equal to 5 hours' duration and with an angiographically documented total occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery on admission. A significant (p = 0.038) 50% relative reduction in the incidence of late potentials was observed in the group of 35 patients who underwent reperfusion: from 16 of 35 (46%) before to 8 of 35 (23%) at 120 minutes after the start of thrombolytic treatment. No significant reduction was seen in the 19 patients in whom thrombolysis was unsuccessful: from 8 of 19 (42%) before to 7 of 19 (37%) afterward. Despite successful recanalization, late potentials persisted or newly developed after thrombolytic therapy in 8 of 54 patients (15%). It is concluded that successful thrombolysis reduces the incidence of late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram but that the sensitivity and specificity of this finding are not high enough to allow reliable monitoring of coronary reperfusion at the bedside. 
Localized cytosolic domains of the erythropoietin receptor regulate growth signaling and down-modulate responsiveness to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Erythrocyte development in mammals depends in part upon the interaction of the glycopeptide hormone erythropoietin (EPO) with cell surface receptors on committed erythroid progenitor cells. Both this factor and an EPO receptor polypeptide previously have been cloned, yet little is presently understood concerning molecular mechanisms of receptor activation and signal transduction. To identify cytosolic receptor domains necessary for signaling, we have compared the activities of a series of deletionally mutated EPO receptor constructs by their expression in interleukin 3-dependent, myeloid FDC-P1 cells. EPO-induced growth was transduced efficiently in these cells by the full-length receptor (507 amino acids), and no measurable loss in activity resulted from the deletion of up to 111 carboxyl-terminal residues. In contrast, the deletion of 44 additional residues led to a dramatic loss (86.3% +/- 7.8%; mean +/- SD) in the ability of this receptor to mediate EPO-induced growth, thus indicating that residues between Gly-352 and Met-396 constitute a functionally critical cytosolic subdomain. Interestingly, the expression of full-length EPO receptors in FDC-P1 cells also led to a selective inhibition of normal proliferative responsiveness to the alternative hematopoietic factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Moreover, this inhibition was progressively reversed in forms of the EPO receptor in which distal cytosolic residues were sequentially deleted. These results suggest that EPO receptors normally may trans-modulate components in the pathway of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced proliferation and that this down-modulation, as exerted by intact EPO receptors, may play a role in promoting erythroid commitment during myeloid blood cell development. 
Parenteral drug products containing aluminum as an ingredient or a contaminant: response to Food and Drug Administration notice of intent and request for information. ASCN/A.S.P.E.N. Working Group on Standards for Aluminum Content of Parenteral Nutrition Solutions. Aluminum remains a significant contaminant of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions and may be elevated in bone, urine, and plasma of infants receiving TPN. Aluminum accumulation in tissues of uremic patients and adult TPN patients has been associated with low-turnover bone disease. Furthermore, aluminum has also been linked with encephalopathy and anemia in uremic patients and with hepatic cholestasis in experimental animals. Because of the toxic effects of aluminum, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently published a notice of intent to set an upper limit of 25 micrograms/L for aluminum in large-volume parenterals and to require manufacturers of small-volume parenterals, such as calcium and phosphate salts, to measure aluminum content and note this content on the package label. The ASCN/A.S.P.E.N. Working Group on Standards for Aluminum Content of Parenteral Nutrition Solutions supports these intentions and further urges the FDA to require that cumulative aluminum intake in terms of safe, unsafe, and toxic quantities of aluminum per kilogram be made known to physicians and pharmacists preparing the TPN solutions, to ensure that manufacturers use appropriate control procedures in aluminum measurements, and to employ a standard unit of aluminum measurement. 
Repair and replacement of deep vein valves in the treatment of venous insufficiency. Venous insufficiency is a widespread condition, the prevalence of venous ulceration being 0.5-1.0 per cent in Western populations. A principal abnormality causing venous insufficiency is deep venous reflux, usually resulting from post-thrombotic valve destruction. Patients undergoing treatment for venous insufficiency should have all venous abnormalities investigated, defined and corrected where possible. Although treatment for superficial and communicating vein incompetence is available, correction of deep vein reflux has been neglected until recently. Deep vein valve physiology, the selection of patients for deep vein valve surgery and methods of valve repair and replacement are reviewed. 
Gastric villous adenoma: radiologic features. The high incidence of malignant transformation of gastric villous adenoma requires prompt diagnosis of this rare tumor. We have reported the case of such a tumor in a 29-year-old man. The radiologic appearance of a gastric soft tissue mass with a reticular pattern is highly diagnostic. 
A case of granulomatous hepatitis after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration. A 61-year-old man received intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as treatment for superficial bladder carcinoma. High spiking relapsing fevers began 39 days after the initial treatment. A liver biopsy revealed noncaseating granuloma. Deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization of the bone marrow was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Pressure exerted to instill the BCG may have favored dissemination. 
A comparison between heparin and low-dose aspirin as adjunctive therapy with tissue plasminogen activator for acute myocardial infarction. Heparin-Aspirin Reperfusion Trial (HART) Investigators BACKGROUND. We report the results of the Heparin-Aspirin Reperfusion Trial, a collaborative study comparing early intravenous heparin with oral aspirin as adjunctive treatment when recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is used for coronary thrombolysis during acute myocardial infarction. METHODS. Two hundred five patients were randomly assigned to receive either immediate and then continuous intravenous heparin (starting with a 5000-unit bolus; n = 106) or immediate and then daily oral aspirin (80 mg; n = 99) together with rt-PA (100 mg intravenously over a six-hour period) initiated within six hours of the onset of symptoms. We evaluated the patency of the infarct-related artery by angiography 7 to 24 hours after beginning rt-PA infusion, the frequency of reocclusion of the artery by repeat angiography on day 7, and ischemic or hemorrhagic complications during the hospital stay. RESULTS. At the time of the first angiogram, 82 percent of the infarct-related arteries in the patients assigned to heparin were patent, as compared with only 52 percent in the aspirin group (P less than 0.0001). Of the initially patent vessels, 88 percent remained patent after seven days in the heparin group, as compared with 95 percent in the aspirin group (P not significant). The numbers of hemorrhagic events (18 in the heparin and 15 in the aspirin group) and recurrent ischemic events (8 in the heparin and 2 in the aspirin group) were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. Coronary patency rates associated with rt-PA are higher with early concomitant systemic heparin treatment than with concomitant low-dose oral aspirin. This observation has important implications for clinical practice and should be considered in the design and interpretation of clinical trials involving coronary thrombolytic therapy. 
Reproductive and menstrual factors and risk of peritoneal and ovarian endometriosis. OBJECTIVE: Between 1987 and 1989 data were collected to evaluate risk factors for pelvic endometriosis. DESIGN: A case-control study was conducted on 241 cases with laparoscopically or laparotomically confirmed peritoneal or ovarian endometriosis consecutively admitted to three teaching hospitals in Northern Italy. The control group consisted of 437 women admitted to hospitals for acute conditions covering similar catchment areas. RESULTS: Compared with nulliparous women, the risk of endometriosis decreased with increasing number of births: the point estimates were 0.4 and 0.3, respectively, for those with one and two or more births (X2(1) trend = 50.3, P less than 0.001). No relation emerged with age at first birth and spontaneous miscarriages. Relative to women whose menarche occurred at age 11 or younger, the risk of endometriosis was slightly lower in those who experienced later menarche, but the trend in risk was not significant. Women with irregular menstrual cycles showed a lower frequency of the disease (relative risk, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.5). The role of various factors was largely similar for different disease locations (ovary, peritoneum, and both) and indication for diagnostic surgery (sterility, pelvic pain, and other reasons). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that parity and irregular/long menses lower the risk of endometriosis. These findings were similar in different subgroups of disease location and indication for surgery, giving strong evidence of the consistency of the general results. 
Will Rogers and the results of radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer. Disease-free survival rates for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated by radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy are 75% to 80% in stage B disease, 60% in stage C disease, and approximately 50% in stage D disease. Vascular invasion is an important prognostic factor in meticulously staged patients. Powerful selection factors, including more accurate clinical and pathologic staging and improved surgery, as well as unspecified selection factors, may contribute to the improved results. In order to evaluate the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy, a randomized, controlled study is necessary. 
Glutathione peroxidase deficiency and childhood seizures. 4 children with intractable seizures, repeated infections, and intolerance to anticonvulsants had evidence of glutathione peroxidase deficiency. 2 had low intracellular enzyme activity but normal blood selenium and high plasma glutathione peroxidase concentrations. The other 2 had low intracellular glutathione peroxidase activity with low circulating glutathione peroxidase and selenium concentrations. The clinical state of the children improved after discontinuation of anticonvulsant medication and selenium substitution. 
Prevention of stress-induced erosive gastritis by parenteral administration of arachidonic acid. Stress-induced mucosal ulcerations are associated with a decreased synthesis of mucosal prostaglandin (PG) E2. This phenomenon is poorly understood. To investigate whether it is due to a decreased availability of the necessary substrates to the mucosa, four groups of 10 Holtzman rats were studied: group 1 received normal saline by intraperitoneal (ip) injection; group 2 also received ip normal saline, then were submitted to stress, by the cold restraint method; group 3 received a solution of arachidonic acid (AA) ip; and group 4 also received ip AA, then were submitted to stress. After sacrifice, the number of gastric ulcerations were counted and specimens of nonulcerated mucosa were assayed for PGE2 by high-performance liquid chromatography; the mean numbers of ulcers were 0, 5.8, 0.8, and 3 and the mean levels of PGE2 were 55, 41, 125, and 62 pg/mg of wet tissue for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It is concluded that parenteral administration of AA reduces but does not completely eliminate stress-induced gastric ulcerations and that the stressed animals synthesized half as much PGE2 as the nonstressed ones after ip administration of equal amounts of AA, suggesting that stress reduces the availability of AA to the gastric mucosa, possibly by vascular spasm. 
A technique to accurately construct a contact dressing. We describe a technique to rapidly and accurately construct the contact layer of a composite dressing. This technique is simple to perform and is suitable for any open wound. It is especially useful for moderately sized wounds created during extirpation of tumors by Mohs micrographic surgery. 
The outcome of decompressive laminectomy for degenerative lumbar stenosis. The outcome of laminectomy for the relief of symptoms resulting from degenerative lumbar stenosis is not well established. Eighty-eight consecutive patients who had had a laminectomy for degenerative lumbar stenosis between 1983 and 1986 were studied. Eight of the patients had had a concomitant arthrodesis. The follow-up evaluation included a review of charts and standardized questionnaires that were completed by the patients. One year postoperatively, five patients (6 per cent) had had a second operation and five still had severe pain. By the time of the latest follow-up, in 1989, fifteen (17 per cent) of the original eighty-eight patients had had a repeat operation because of instability or stenosis; twenty-one (30 per cent) of the seventy patients who were evaluated by questionnaire in 1989 had severe pain. The factors found to be associated with a poor long-term outcome, defined as severe pain or the need for a repeat operation, or both, included co-existing illnesses (such as osteoarthrosis, cardiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or chronic pulmonary disease) (p = 0.004), the duration of follow-up (p = 0.01), and an initial laminectomy involving a single interspace (p = 0.04). We concluded that the long-term outcome of decompressive laminectomy is less favorable than has been previously reported, and that co-morbidity and a single-interspace laminectomy are risk factors for a poor outcome. 
Cortical evoked potentials by stimulation of the vesicourethral junction: clinical value and neurophysiological considerations. In 21 healthy volunteers and 42 patients with either neurogenic bladder dysfunction (24), partial peripheral denervation of the bladder (12) or nonneurogenic bladder dysfunction (6) scalp-derived evoked potentials after stimulation of the vesicourethral junction (cortical evoked potentials) were recorded. In addition, evoked potentials from the posterior tibial nerve (tibial somatosensory evoked potentials) and from the pudendal nerve (pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials) were evaluated. The results obtained in normal subjects were reproducible and comparable to those reported in previous studies. Cortical evoked potentials of vesicourethral junction consisted of a prominent negativity with a mean latency of 95 msec. Tibial and pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials were similar and showed a typical W-shaped complex. In normal subjects stimulation of the vesicourethral junction was described as a stimulus-synchronous pulsation combined with a continuous burning feeling and sometimes with a desire to void. In 4 normal subjects no cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction could be obtained because of a decreased pain threshold. In regard to clinical value, the results demonstrate that in patients with lesions of the central nervous system (in the group with cauda equina and conus medullaris lesions, and in the group with suprasacral spinal cord lesions) the results of cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction and pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials widely correlate due to similar afferent nervous pathways within the central nervous system. However, in patients with partial peripheral denervation of the bladder with suspected additional secondary local detrusor damage the results of cortical evoked potentials obtained by stimulation of the vesicourethral junction differ mostly from the results of somatosensory evoked potentials obtained by stimulation of the pudendal nerve. The pattern obtained (increased sensory and pain threshold, normal cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction with normal latencies and normal or increased amplitude) is indicative of local detrusor damage. In 21 patients the ability to detect cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction was combined with the sensation of stimulus-synchronous pulsation, whereas in the other 21 patients the absence of this sensation during stimulation was combined with the absence of cortical evoked potentials. On the other hand, no correlation was found between the ability of obtaining cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction and the stimulus-induced sensation of pain and/or desire to void.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Abnormal small bowel permeability and duodenitis in recurrent abdominal pain. Thirty nine children with recurrent abdominal pain aged between 5.5 and 12 years, underwent endoscopic duodenal biopsy to find out if there were any duodenal inflammatory changes, and if there was a relationship between duodenal inflammation and intestinal permeability to 51Cr-EDTA. Duodenal inflammation was graded by the duodenitis scale of Whitehead et al (grade 0, 1, 2, and 3). In 13 out of 39 patients (33%) definite signs of inflammation were found (grade 2 and 3). Intestinal permeability to 51Cr-EDTA in patients with duodenitis (grade 1, 2, and 3) was significantly higher (4.42 (1.73)%) than in patients with normal (grade 0) duodenal biopsy appearances (3.3 (0.9)%). A significant association was found between duodenal inflammation and abnormal intestinal permeability. Our results give further evidence that there is an intestinal origin of these patients' complaints. 
Surgical treatment of limbic epilepsy associated with extrahippocampal lesions: the problem of dual pathology. The authors present their review of 178 patients who underwent en bloc temporal lobectomies as surgical treatment for intractable epilepsy. Hippocampal cell density was quantitatively analyzed and the histology of the anterior temporal lobe was reviewed. Fifty-four patients (30.3%) had evidence of extrahippocampal lesions in addition to neuronal cell loss within the hippocampus (the dual pathology group). The pattern of cell loss was analyzed in the remaining 124 cases (69.7%) with no extrahippocampal pathology, and compared with that of the dual pathology group and a control group of four nonepileptic patients. Hippocampal cell loss was found in almost all epileptic patients compared to the control group. Severe cell loss greater than 30% of control values was found in 88.7% of patients without extrahippocampal lesions, but in only 51.8% of patients with dual pathology. The difference between these two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). In the dual pathology group, lesions of different pathology had a significant relationship with the degree of hippocampal cell loss: all 12 patients with glioma had mild cell loss, whereas all 13 patients with heterotopia were associated with severe cell loss. Severity of hippocampal cell loss was also analyzed in relation to seizure history: a prior severe head injury was associated with severe cell loss. Other factors such as seizure duration, secondary generalization, or family history of seizures were not associated with hippocampal damage. Dual pathology may produce a combination of neocortical and temporolimbic epilepsies that warrants a precise definition of the true epileptogenic area prior to surgical treatment. 
Regional chemotherapy using continuous intravesical infusion doxorubicin for the treatment of muscle invasive transitional cell bladder carcinoma in a rat model. Previously established animal models of invasive transitional cell bladder carcinoma and continuous infusion intravesical drug delivery were combined to evaluate the urothelial toxicity and antineoplastic efficacy of continuous intravesical infusion doxorubicin (DOX). Dose-response toxicity experiments studied histologic changes in the rat urinary bladder following urothelial exposure to three different urinary levels of DOX, as a function of the duration of drug infusion. Systemic and local drug absorption, as measured by DOX levels in serum, bladder, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and liver, was measured at intervals during drug administration. In vitro chemosensitivity assays were used to determine tumor sensitivity to DOX. Treatment studies evaluated the impact of 14-day continuous infusion DOX beginning seven days following tumor implantation. No histologically discernable changes in the normal urothelium were noted in bladders of animals receiving continuous intravesicle DOX at mean urinary concentrations of 0.05 micrograms./ml. (n = 5), 0.56 micrograms./ml. (n = 10), and 5.69 micrograms./ml. (n = 10) for periods of up to 14 days. Serum drug concentrations demonstrated a non-significant upward trend following the start of therapy. Significant increases in tissue DOX levels were noted in the bladder and retroperitoneal lymph nodes on chemotherapy days 7 and 14. Mean tissue DOX concentrations in both the bladder and lymph nodes were greater than the IC50 observed in the in vitro sensitivity assay. DOX-treated tumor-bearing animals (n = 17) had a mean tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) of 0.65 gm. +/- 0.52 gm. compared to an average tumor volume of 1.20 gm. +/- 0.66 gm. in the control group (n = 18) (p = 0.0112). Continuous infusion intraluminal chemotherapy demonstrated a clear cytoreductive effect with minimal local toxicity in this model. Drug tissue levels were observed in regional lymphatic drainage fields as well as the bladder wall. Further study to evaluate this approach as a bladder-sparing alternative to muscle invasive disease is warranted. 
Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on pressure-induced left ventricular hypertrophy in rats. The influence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on the development of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy due to stenosis of the aortic arch was studied in female Sprague-Dawley rats. The aortic arch was banded to an outer diameter of 1.0 mm. After 14 days, LV and right ventricular functional parameters and transstenotic pressure gradient were measured in anesthetized rats. In addition, regional heart weights were determined, and myocytes of three different heart regions were isolated and subjected to morphometric analysis. To inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme, ramipril was administered orally by gavage in a single daily dose of 1 mg/kg. Rats with aortic stenosis showed a marked increase in LV systolic pressure, mean prestenotic aortic pressure, and LV stroke work compared with sham-operated rats and demonstrated a systolic transstenotic pressure gradient of 82 mm Hg. This increase in LV hemodynamic load was paralleled by the development of LV hypertrophy as determined by a 37% increase in LV weight and by a 20% increase in cell volume of isolated LV myocytes. Concomitant ramipril treatment did not significantly affect LV functional parameters. The transstenotic pressure gradient was the same as in untreated rats with aortic stenosis. Likewise, the weight gain of the LV as well as the development of cellular hypertrophy of the LV were not influenced. Thus, in this model, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition did not reduce the development of LV hypertrophy independent of the hemodynamic load. 
Use of bioerodible polymers impregnated with mitomycin in glaucoma filtration surgery in rabbits. A prospective, randomized, double-masked, and placebo-controlled study was performed to evaluate the effects of a localized and sustained release of mitomycin on the success of glaucoma filtration surgery in rabbits. A bioerodible polymer was used as the drug carrier. Full-thickness filtration surgeries were performed and data from 22 rabbits were collected. One eye received a polymer impregnated with mitomycin (0.02 mg or 0.06 mg), while the fellow eye received a drug-free polymer. Intraocular pressure, bleb survival, and postoperative complications were investigated. Intraocular pressures remained lower for a longer period of time (P less than 0.004) and filtration blebs lasted longer (P less than 0.05) in experimental eyes than in control eyes. Conjunctivitis and sectorial corneal haze occurred more frequently in eyes treated with the higher dosage mitomycin compared with control eyes. The use of mitomycin-C in a polymer delivery system appeared to promote the success of glaucoma filtration surgery in rabbits. With the lower dosage of mitomycin, clinically significant ocular toxicity was not noted. 
Influence of type of prosthesis on late results after combined mitral-aortic valve replacement. The influence of type of prosthesis on the late outcome of patients with combined mitral-aortic valve replacement was analyzed by comparing, at a 14-year follow-up, patients receiving two biological prostheses (group 1; n = 135), two mechanical prostheses (group 2; n = 221), or a mechanical prosthesis in the aortic position and a bioprosthesis in the mitral position (group 3; n = 97). No difference was found among the three groups in terms of actuarial survival and incidence of and freedom from valve-related deaths, thromboemboli, and hemorrhages. Patients with biological prostheses had a significantly greater incidence of structural valve deterioration, reoperations, and overall complications when compared with patients with only mechanical prostheses. The results of an extended follow-up of patients with combined mitral-aortic valve replacement indicate that mechanical prostheses perform better in the long-term owing to their superior durability when compared with biological valves. The use of bioprostheses should be confined to old patients with limited life expectancy because of their cardiac disease, provided that anticoagulants are not used. Combination of mechanical and biological prostheses in the same patient should be avoided because the advantages of each type of prosthesis are lost. 
Chick nutritional encephalomalacia and prostanoid formation. Nutritional encephalomalacia (NE) was induced in young chicks using a diet low in vitamin E and containing 8% ethyl esters derived from safflower oil fatty acids (S-E group). The same diet with added alpha-tocopheryl acetate (S+E) failed to produce the pathology, and chicks receiving aerated linseed oil--high in alpha-linolenic acid and low in alpha-tocopherol (L-E)--did not develop symptoms. Formation of metabolites from labeled arachidonic acid (AA) by thrombocytes was similar in the S+E and S-E groups, yielding thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and hydroxy fatty acids as the major products. Collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation and TXB2 production were not significantly different in the S-E and S+E groups, but aggregation values and TXB2 synthesis were significantly less in the L-E group than in the ataxic S-E chicks. Prostaglandin E2 production by aortal rings was significantly influenced by the diet; S-E yielded the highest value and L-E the lowest. These results show that alpha-linolenic acid causes alterations in the AA metabolism and thrombocyte function in young chicks. 
Carinal resection for bronchogenic carcinoma. Techniques are available for carinal resection and reconstruction for bronchogenic carcinoma involving the carina. Successful outcome depends on careful patient selection, thorough preoperative evaluation, careful anesthetic management, strict attention to surgical technique, and compulsive postoperative care. Since 1973 we have performed 37 carinal resections for bronchogenic carcinoma: 21 right carinal pneumonectomies, 7 carinal resections, 7 carina plus lobe resections, and 2 carina plus pneumonectomy stump resections. Five patients had diseased N2 nodes and 13 patients had diseased N1 nodes. Complications included pulmonary (8), vocal cord paresis (3), atrial fibrillation (9), anastomotic stenosis (4), and anastomotic separation (3). There were 3 early postoperative deaths (8%). All were related to adult respiratory distress syndrome and were unresponsive to aggressive treatment. There were 4 late postoperative deaths between 2 and 4 months (10.9%). All late postoperative deaths were related to anastomotic complications (stenosis [1] and separation [3]). There are 5 absolute 5-year survivors and an actuarial 5-year survival rate of 19%. 
Endothelial dysfunction in response to psychosocial stress in monkeys. The current study was designed to evaluate the effects of a disrupted social environment on the endothelial integrity of various vascular segments in male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Each of 20 single-caged adult monkeys was fed a diet comparable to a person's ingestion of 240 mg cholesterol/day for a 10-week baseline period and then was introduced as a stranger into a four-member social group for 3 days. Half of the monkeys received a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (metoprolol) via subcutaneous implant 2 days before and during group housing. The social manipulation produced persistent sympathetic arousal as evidenced by significantly elevated heart rates among untreated monkeys (p less than 0.01) but not among their metoprolol-treated counterparts, whose heart rate declined (p less than 0.05). After the social manipulation, all monkeys were necropsied and evaluated for endothelial incorporation of immunoglobulin G (as an indicator of cell death), endothelial cell replication, the presence of adherent leukocytes, and arterial low density lipoprotein permeability and concentration. At branching sites in the thoracic aorta, immunoglobulin G incorporation and endothelial cell replication were significantly greater in untreated monkeys than in metoprolol-treated monkeys (p less than 0.01 for both analyses); no differences existed at nonbranch sites. Endothelial cell replication in the coronary arteries (where immunoglobulin G incorporation was not examined) was also greater among untreated than among metoprolol-treated monkeys. No significant differences were observed between treatment groups in arterial low density lipoprotein permeability or leukocyte adherence; estimates of arterial low density lipoprotein concentrations were higher among untreated than among metoprolol-treated monkeys, but only in the abdominal portion of the aorta. These results indicate that social disruption is associated with both sympathetic nervous system arousal and indexes of endothelial dysfunction, effects that may be prevented by treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. 
Clinical and electrophysiological aspects of acute paralytic disease of children and young adults in northern China. Acute peripheral nervous system diseases leading to paralysis in children are rare in Europe and the USA, whereas epidemics of a Guillain-Barre-like syndrome occur annually among children in rural parts of northern China. To clarify the features of this disorder 36 patients, aged 15 months to 37 years (median 7) with this syndrome were investigated; 91% were from rural areas. In 47%, a prodromal illness was reported in the preceding 4 weeks. Leg weakness and resistance to neck flexion were the earliest symptoms. The weakness ascended rapidly and symmetrically to affect the arms and respiratory muscles, with maximum weakness occurring a mean of 6 days after onset of weakness. Bulbar weakness occurred in 61% of patients, but only 1 had extraocular paresis. Respiratory assistance was needed by 31% of patients. Tendon reflexes were lost as weakness developed. 42% of patients had raised concentrations of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the mean cell count was 3 cells/microliters (range 0-12/microliters). Electrodiagnostic studies in 22 patients showed severe reductions in motor evoked amplitudes from distal stimulation. Sensory action potentials were normal. Electromyography revealed denervation potentials in limb muscles. The distinctive epidemiological, clinical, and neurophysiological characteristics of this illness suggest that the disorder is different from both Guillain-Barre syndrome and poliomyelitis. The neurophysiological findings support the hypothesis that the disorder is a reversible distal motor nerve terminal or anterior horn cell lesion. 
Hemodynamic responses to endotracheal extubation after coronary artery bypass grafting. After coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, patients may remain at risk for myocardial ischemia and infarction and ventricular dysrhythmias. The hemodynamic responses to endotracheal extubation and the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine pretreatment were studied after CABG surgery and overnight mechanical ventilation. Twenty-five patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 13) patients who had tracheal extubation after pretreatment with a placebo; group 2 patients who received lidocaine (1 mg/kg IV) before tracheal extubation. Hemodynamic data, electrocardiographic tracings, and arterial blood gases were obtained before tracheal extubation, during suctioning, and 1, 5, and 20 min after tracheal extubation. Group 1 patients displayed significant increases in heart rate, arterial blood pressure, rate-pressure product, right atrial pressure, and cardiac index during suctioning and within 1 min of tracheal extubation, returning to preextubation level by 5 min. There were no significant changes in pulmonary and systemic resistance indices. Hemodynamic changes in group 2 patients were similar to those in group 1. Both in the absence and presence of lidocaine, tracheal extubation caused hemodynamic responses that were small in magnitude and brief in duration. These responses were not associated with electrocardiographic or enzymatic evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction, or with ventricular dysrhythmias. Compared with the well-documented hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation, we found that extubation of the trachea after CABG surgery was associated with less pronounced responses. This may be related to avoidance of laryngoscopy and possibly accommodation to the endo-tracheal tube. These modest hemodynamic responses of extubation of the trachea after CABG surgery were not modified by intravenous lidocaine. 
Mycosis fungoides: cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [published erratum appears in Am Fam Physician 1991 Jun;43(6):1954] Most patients with mycosis fungoides are between 40 and 60 years of age. The disease has three clinical stages: (1) the premycotic, or patch, stage, consisting of macular, scaling, faint pink to red pruritic patches, usually on unexposed surfaces; (2) the mycotic, or plaque, stage, consisting of reddish, purple-brown plaques, often annular in shape and symmetric in distribution, and (3) the tumor stage, consisting of red-brown to violaceous, dome-shaped, firm tumors with a predilection for the face and body folds. The Sezary syndrome is a leukemic variant. Treatment depends on the extent of disease and includes topical or systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy and psoralen plus long-wave ultraviolet light therapy. 
Role of extended aortoplasty related to the definition of coarctation of the aorta. One hundred thirty-nine patients underwent operation for coarctation of the aorta. Age ranged from 1 day to 21 years and weight, from 1.5 to 70.4 kg. Numerous methods of repair were used. The operative mortality was low (1.3%), and 17 patients (11.3%) died late. Recoarctation occurred in 13 patients (9.4%). We attempted to correlate mortality and recoarctation with the surgical procedure. A review of the literature revealed no classifications of coarctation that applied to the anatomical and pathological variations we found at the time of operation. Therefore, we devised a surgical classification to separate the various entities in the spectrum of coarctation: type I = primary coarctation; type II = coarctation with isthmus hypoplasia; and type III = coarctation with tubular hypoplasia involving the isthmus and segment between the left carotid and left subclavian arteries. Each of these types has subtypes: A = with ventricular septal defect and B = with other major cardiac defects. We believe that rather than labeling one procedure as "the procedure of choice," providing this classification will allow the surgeon to use a method of repair that is suited to the anatomical variation. 
A follow-up study of occupational skin disease in Western Australia. From a total of 993 previously reported cases of occupational skin disease (OSD), 954 (96%) were contacted and 711 (75%) examined. The review time (i.e., period from original diagnosis of OSD until review) varied from a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of over 8 years. Over 60% of cases were reviewed more than 2 years after the original diagnosis was made. More than 50% were still suffering from OSD or consequences related thereto. Clearance was less likely in those who remained in their original, or similar, occupational environment. However, of those who changed their job due to OSD, many suffered aggravation of the dermatitis from factors in the new work environment. Over 10% of cases had evolved into a persistent postoccupational dermatitis without obvious cause. This condition is responsible for considerable impairment and is of medicolegal importance due to confusion as to its relationship to the original occupational factors. 
Balloon dilatation of esophageal strictures in children. Traditionally, the treatment of esophageal strictures in children has been done with mercury bougies in a prograde fashion or with Tucker dilators passed along a guide wire in a retrograde manner. An alternative approach has used a balloon dilatation catheter passed over a guide wire previously placed under fluoroscopic guidance. Over the past 5 years, this technique has been used in 43 procedures for both discrete and diffuse strictures. The interventions were performed in a total of 15 patients ranging in age from 8 months to 21 years. In all cases, there was improvement of the preceding symptoms following dilatation. This report details the experience with this technique at Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, emphasizing the indications, contraindications, and potential complications associated with balloon dilatation of esophageal strictures in children. 
Remission and recurrence after withdrawal of therapy for ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) is a chronic, progressive, autoimmune disease that scars mucus membranes and may lead to blindness. The authors studied the long-term effects of OCP in 104 consecutive patients (average follow-up, 4 years) to determine whether complete remission could be achieved after a course of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. Prolonged periods of remission while not undergoing therapy were maintained in approximately one third of patients with OCP. Follow-up must be continued for life, as relapse occurred in 22% of those who were in remission and not undergoing therapy. Those who relapsed regained disease control readily upon reinstitution of therapy and did not deteriorate to more advanced cicatrization. Sex, age, initial degree of inflammation, and the incidence of extraocular involvement did not have a prognostic significance on outcome. Mechanisms that underlie the differing responses to therapy are not yet known. 
Morphometric evidence for bone resorption and replacement in prostate cancer. A series of 78 patients with metastatic bone disease from prostate cancer underwent iliac crest biopsy, enabling histomorphometric quantification of eroded bone surface and bone volume in both tumour-free and metastatic bone tissue. Eroded surfaces in tumour-free specimens were high in patients with active compared to stable disease but bone volume was maintained in both groups, whilst in bone surrounding micrometastases (n = 8) eroded surfaces were further increased and bone volume reduced. Eroded surfaces within metastases were greater still but were associated with increased bone volume due to replacement of the existing trabecular tissue with abnormal woven bone, giving an overall appearance of sclerosis. These results show that the effect of prostate cancer on bone tissue is complex, involving differential disturbance of bone formation and resorption within metastases, in bone surrounding tumour invasion and in the tumour-free skeleton. 
Surface osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma arising on the periosteal aspect of bone comprises a biologically heterogeneous group of neoplasms. The group as a whole may be referred to by a single descriptive term that emphasizes their common site of origin and underscores their malignant osteogenic potential: surface osteosarcoma. Its biologic heterogeneity may be approached via a number of avenues. Detailed description of individual tumors and grading are frequently employed. However, implementation of a classification system based upon reproducible clinical, roentgenographic, macroscopic, and histologic parameters is advantageous. The suggested classification system serves to clearly define parosteal and periosteal osteosarcoma, as well as recognize unusual variants. Most important, it defines therapeutic strategy. The classification system identifies low-grade, biologically indolent forms (i.e., parosteal osteosarcoma and periosteal osteosarcoma) that are best treated by surgery alone. At the same time, it recognizes high-grade forms with significant potential for life-threatening behavior (i.e., 'dedifferentiated' parosteal osteosarcoma and high-grade surface osteosarcoma) that are best managed by multimodality therapy incorporating chemotherapy and surgery. 
Suture entrapment and secondary ureteral obstruction. During the 6-year period ending in 1988, suture entrapment and secondary postoperative ureteral obstruction occurred in 18 (0.33%) of the 5379 patients who underwent major pelvic operations for benign conditions. Sixteen cases occurred after vaginal surgery and two after abdominal hysterectomy. Placement of the McCall suture or sutures for elevation of a bladder neck caused ureteral entrapment most frequently. Early diagnosis was facilitated by comparison of preoperative and postoperative serum creatinine levels. The mean change in serum creatinine level in patients with unilateral obstruction was an increase of 0.8 mg/dl. Treatment by either antegrade placement of ureteral stents or abdominal exploration with deligation or ureteroneocystotomy was successful in all cases. Retrograde placement of ureteral stents was unsuccessful. 
An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 colitis associated with consumption of precooked meat patties. An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 hemorrhagic colitis at a Minnesota junior high school in October 1988 comprised 32 cases among 1562 students (attack rate, 2.0%). Four children were hospitalized; none developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Case children were more likely than controls to have eaten heat-processed meat patties (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-20.1; P less than .001) in the school cafeteria on a specific day. The minimum estimated attack rate among students who ate these patties was 8%. The patties should have been sufficiently cooked by the manufacturer to destroy enteric pathogens before they were frozen and distributed. E. coli were cultured from frozen patties that were manufactured at the same plant on the same dates as the implicated patties, but serotype O157:H7 was not isolated. Heat-processed meat patties may serve as vehicles for E. coli O157:H7 infection, and currently there are no federal or state regulatory standards to ensure the safety of these products. 
Dacryocystorhinostomy in osteopetrosis. Osteopetrosis is a rare congenital disorder of bone metabolism characterized by generalized sclerotic bone resulting from osteoclast dysfunction. There are several ocular manifestations, one of which is nasolacrimal duct obstruction from osteosclerosis of the nasolacrimal foramen. The surgeon must anticipate and prepare for the difficulties of working with marbleized, ultra-dense bone, alternating technique accordingly. In nasolacrimal duct obstruction, surgical management produces seemingly stable long-term results. However, if ossification recurs at the operative site, reoperation may become necessary for either optic nerve decompression or dacryocystorhinostomy. 
Timing of breast cancer excision during the menstrual cycle influences duration of disease-free survival OBJECTIVE: To study disease-free survival at 10 years in relation to timing of breast tumor excision during the menstrual cycle. DESIGN: A prospective study of consecutively treated patients with primary breast cancer. SETTING: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York. PATIENTS: Two hundred and eighty-three premenopausal patients treated by mastectomy and axillary dissection. MAIN RESULTS: When the tumor was excised during the follicular phase, approximated by setting the putative day of ovulation on day 14 after the onset of last menses, a higher recurrence risk (43%) was observed compared with excision later in the menstrual cycle (29%, P = 0.02). The rate peaked among patients treated between days 7 and 14 and was lowest between days 20 and 30. Multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model to control for tumor size, nodal status, estrogen receptor status, adjuvant chemotherapy, and family history indicated that the hazard rate of breast cancer recurrence after excision during the follicular phase was 1.53 (95% Cl, 1.02 to 2.29). Stratification by nodal status indicated that the effect of phase was statistically significant only among patients with positive nodes (hazard ratio, 2.10; Cl, 1.19 to 3.70). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that the risk for recurrence may be affected by the hormonal milieu of the menstrual cycle; these findings must be confirmed, however, by a prospective study in which cycle phase at time of tumor excision is biochemically documented. 
Reversible sustained increase of gastrin and gastric acid secretion in a subgroup of duodenal ulcer patients on long-term treatment with H2 antagonists We assessed the effect of long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion on basal and meal-stimulated serum gastrin and gastric acid secretion in 37 patients on long-term maintenance treatment with H2 antagonists for severe relapsing and/or complicated duodenal ulcer disease. After a mean of 142 weeks (range, 28-324 weeks) of continuous treatment, gastric acid secretion, basal plasma gastrin, and gastrin response to a test meal were evaluated. All tests were performed a week after drug discontinuation to exclude rapidly reversible hypergastrinemia. Gastrin levels were above the normal range in seven patients (18.9%). After H2 antagonist were stopped for 6 weeks, basal gastrin returned to normal levels in all cases [from a median of 180 (range, 130-350) pg/ml to 58 (25-90) pg/ml] and peak meal-stimulated gastrin significantly decreased from a median of 500 pg/ml to 245 pg/ml (p = 0.02). In patients with hypergastrinemia, the discontinuation of H2 antagonists for 6 weeks led to a significant decrease of gastric acid secretion. Patients who developed hypergastrinemia spent more weeks on full-dose treatment and had more recurrences during therapy. The results of the present investigation demonstrate that a long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion can induce, in a small percentage of patients, a reversible sustained hypergastrinemia and a consequent increase of acid secretion, which conceivably could lead to more frequent relapses of duodenal ulcer disease. 
Renal plasmacytoma: Mayo Clinic experience and review of the literature. Extramedullary plasmacytoma arising in the kidney is rare. Only 8 cases have been reported. Recently, we noted the ninth case, the second case seen at the Mayo Clinic. Clinically, the tumor mimics a renal cell carcinoma or a transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis. 
The relationship of chemotherapeutic and endocrine intervention on natural killer cell activity in human breast cancer. Peripheral blood natural killer (NK) activity against K562 target tumor cells was monitored in patients with breast cancer receiving no treatment, combination chemotherapy, and/or endocrine therapy. NK activity in untreated Stage I patients with no evidence of disease (ned) was significantly higher than in healthy controls. NK activity was shown to decline in individuals with cytotoxic drug therapy (P equals 0.036). There also were reduction in lymphocyte recoveries concomitant with chemotherapeutic intervention (P less than 0.001). Lymphocyte counts were incorporated in a calculation of absolute NK activity that more accurately reflected the significant reduction in NK activity that occurred in patients with localized and systemic disease on chemotherapy. Different chemotherapeutic agents were found to selectively affect NK activity. Stage II patients on phenylalanine mustard (P)/5-fluorouracil (F) (PF) and cyclophosphamide (C)/methotrexate (M)/5-fluorouracil (F) (CMF) protocols showed significant reductions in overall NK activity relative to healthy controls and Stage I patients with ned. Patients on P/doxorubicin (A)/F/tamoxifen (Tx) (PAFT) protocols showed reduced NK activity relative to Stage I patients. Patients on the short-dose C/A (CA) protocol showed normal levels of overall NK activity. High-risk Stage I patients on methotrexate (M)/F (MF)with sequential leucovorin rescue and patients with metastatic disease on endocrine therapy, i.e., Tx or megestrol acetate (Meg) showed overall NK activities in the range of healthy controls. Patients with systemic disease on CMF, CMF/vincristine/prednisone (CMFVP), vinblastine/A/thiotepa/fluoxymesterone (VATH), mitomycin/mitoxantrone (MtMx), and A regimens showed overall levels of absolute NK that were significantly less than either healthy controls or metastatic patients undergoing endocrine therapy. NK cytolytic data, monitored at multiple effector to target ratios, were subjected to exponential regression analysis. The elevation of NK cell responses in Stage I patients with ned and the decline of NK cell responses with cytotoxic chemotherapy were due to alterations in the maximal plateau levels of NK cell cytotoxicity represented by the A (asymptote) values. The k values obtained on regression analysis and indices of the relative killing capacities of individual NK cells remained unaltered in all populations. These results suggest that the cytolytic lymphocyte NK pool, elevated in Stage I patients with cancer, selectively declines as a result of cytotoxic therapy. 
Examination of the early conceptus. The pathologist encounters the early, first-trimester conceptus as a product of spontaneous or surgical abortion or as a specimen from ectopic, usually tubal, gestation. In the vast majority of cases of spontaneous abortion, the embryo/fetus has been dead for 1 week to several weeks and is most often lost in the process of uterine emptying; the placenta, accordingly, stands as the main "witness" of the abortive process. The fact of embryonic/fetal death is established and dated through an interpretation of gross and microscopic changes in the villous stroma, including its vessels and the embryonic erythrocytes therein. Elective abortions performed for social reasons occasionally yield abnormal findings that suggest gestations otherwise destined to eventual spontaneous abortion. Other therapeutic abortions are indicated by abnormal sonographic or cytogenetic findings that may be correlated with the morphologic features of the evacuated conceptus. Cytogenetic abnormalities correlate to a high degree with embryonic growth disorganization and with early death, usually before the fetal stage (30 mm) is reached. Adequate sampling of the placenta, its membranes, and of the embryo/fetus is recommended. For cytogenetic studies, clean, viable specimens must be obtained; these are most often required in cases of habitual abortion. 
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty utilizing prolonged balloon inflations: initial results and six-month follow-up. Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) using prolonged balloon inflation has obviated emergency coronary bypass surgery in some patients with acute occlusions at the time of PTCA. However, the use of prolonged balloon inflations has not been shown to improve long-term restenosis rates. As an alternative to the passive autoperfusion catheter, we evaluated a hemoperfusion system in which blood was obtained from the side arm of an arterial sheath and infused through the central lumen of standard balloon catheters via a modified Medrad IV pump during balloon inflation. PTCA was performed in 71 male patients (median age 57 yr). The median balloon inflation time was 4.8 minutes and the median rate of blood perfusion was 30 ml/min. PTCA was successful (lumen increase by 20 percentage points) in 83% of patients (59/71) with diameter stenosis decreasing from a median 82% to 30%. Emergency coronary bypass was required in four patients (5%). Angiographic data for six-month followup was available on 37 patients. The restenosis rate (loss of 50% of gain) was 46% (17/37). The conclusion is that prolonged balloon inflation angioplasty has a role in complicated PTCA but offers no advantage in improving long-term restenosis rates in elective PTCA. 
Epithelial downgrowth following the removal of iris inclusion cysts. We present three patients in whom epithelial downgrowth occurred following the excision of iris inclusion cysts. The sheet-like downgrowth was aggressively treated and successfully eradicated in two of the three patients. Early identification and prompt therapy are essential. 
Estimation of Doppler gradients at rest and during exercise in patients with recoarctation of the aorta. In patients with suspected recoarctation of the aorta the estimation of the pressure difference between the arms and legs is an important part of the examination. Because this difference is often augmented when the circulation is stressed by exercise, exercise tests are a useful part of the evaluation. Doppler echocardiography was used to estimate this pressure difference in 16 adult patients in whom simultaneous pressure and Doppler recordings were made both at rest and during exercise. There was a close correlation between the invasive peak instantaneous gradient and the Doppler gradient both at rest and during exercise. There was only a moderate correlation between the invasive peak to peak gradient and the Doppler gradient at rest and during exercise. Doppler echocardiography is recommended as an easy and accurate method of estimating the peak instantaneous gradient both at rest and during exercise in patients with suspected recoarctation. 
Biological significance of tissue plasminogen activator content in brain tumors. Fresh brain-tumor samples were obtained at operation and analyzed for their content of tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) using an activity assay (gel chromatography zymogram) and an enzyme-linked immunospecific assay. The specimens were taken from 23 glioblastomas, 35 metastatic tumors, 42 meningiomas, 16 low-grade gliomas, and seven acoustic neurinomas; seven specimens were from normal brain. A strong correlation was found between the results of the two assays (r = 0.77, p less than 0.0001). There was a threefold difference in the tPA content of the benign tumors as compared to malignant tumors (p = 0.0006), the latter having less tPA. Histologically benign meningiomas contained higher tPA than malignant meningiomas (p = 0.01); however, the difference between low-grade gliomas and high-grade gliomas was less evident. Overall regression analysis data have shown an inverse relationship between the tissue content in tPA and the presence and degree of tumor necrosis and peritumoral brain edema (p = 0.004 and p = 0.0004, respectively). This finding was most consistent in the glioblastoma group where the correlation coefficient values were r = 0.53 and r = -0.55, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the tissue tPA content and the age and sex, steroid use, or plasma tPA of the patients or the duration of symptoms. In summary, this is the first demonstration of tPA in a large series of human brain tumors and in normal brain. The differences observed have clear biological significance and, although the source of tPA in tumor tissue is still unknown, a relative reduction in tPA in tumor tissue may play an integral role in the development of tissue necrosis and tissue edema. The lack of tPA in tumor necrosis was not due to tissue destruction and cell death since urokinase was readily detectable in that tissue. 
Autologous transfusion: an alternative to transfusion with banked blood during surgery for cancer. Autologous blood transfusion in surgery for cancer has been avoided because of the metastatic potential of reinfused malignant cells. This study determined whether viable tumour cells remain in the red cell concentrate after separation and whether blood transfusion filters remove these tumour cells before reinfusion. Units of banked blood were inoculated with tumour cell lines: breast cancer SKBr3; colon cancer COLO 320; lymphoma Daudi; erythroleukaemia K562. After processing with the Cell Saver, aliquots of the red cell concentrate and waste saline wash were examined for tumour cells and cultured. Tumour cells from all four cell lines were identified in the red cell concentrate but not in the waste saline wash. All the cell lines except Daudi grew from the red cell concentrate. Experiments on two of the cell lines (SKBr3 and COLO 320) were performed in which the red cell concentrate was either unfiltered (control) or filtered with SQ40S blood transfusion filter or RC100 leucocyte depletion filter. Both cell lines were present in the control samples and after filtration with SQ40S filters, and cells from these samples grew normally in culture. No tumour cells were evident after filtration with the RC100 filters and no growth of either cell line was found after 1 week in culture. The Cell Saver in combination with RC100 filters may be suitable for use during the surgical treatment of malignant disease. 
"Near miss" death in obstructive sleep apnea: a critical care syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to alert critical care physicians to the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea with respiratory failure ("near miss" death) and to elucidate characteristics that might allow earlier recognition and treatment of such patients. DESIGN: We examined clinical and laboratory characteristics of eight patients with obstructive sleep apnea presenting to the ICU with respiratory failure. These characteristics were compared with those of eight stable apnea patients of similar severity but without a history of presentation with respiratory failure. SETTING: Medical ICU and pulmonary outpatient clinic at the Houston Veterans Administration Medical Center, a teaching hospital affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine. PATIENTS: Eight patients with obstructive sleep apnea who presented in, or developed, acute respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were matched to eight stable obstructive sleep apnea outpatients from the chest clinic. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The records of these 16 patients were reviewed and multiple characteristics that might predict these obstructive sleep apnea patients prone to respiratory failure and death (called the "near miss" death group; n = 8) were examined. The mean age of the near miss group was 57 yrs. All eight patients presented with respiratory acidosis (mean pH 7.22), hypercarbia (mean PaCO2 82 torr [10.9 kPa]), and hypoxemia (mean PaO2 45 torr [6.0 kPa]). Six of the eight patients had concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as determined by clinical characteristics and spirometry. Predisposing factors included facial trauma, lower respiratory tract infections or bronchospasm, and use of pain medication. All but one of the near miss subjects had awake hypercarbia (mean PaCO2 49 torr [6.5 kPa]) and hypoxemia (mean PaO2 58 torr [7.7 kPa]) during periods of clinical stability while only two controls had concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and none had hypercarbia. The prevalence of a history of wheezing and prior hospitalization for "respiratory problems" were greater in the near miss group. Once cured of apnea, no patient presented with recurrence of respiratory failure in follow-up ranging from 6 to 80 months, and cor pulmonale recurred in only one patient during subsequent onset of central apneas. CONCLUSION: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea who have concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or hypercarbia and hypoxemia are more prone to develop severe respiratory failure and probable death than those patients with apnea alone. The current study shows that recurrent respiratory failure and presumably mortality from this acute complication can be reversed with effective treatment of the obstructive apnea. 
Symptomatic diverticulum of the 4th ventricle. A case of symptomatic diverticulum of the 4th ventricle in a 57-year-old man is presented. This clinicopathological observation supports a relationship between ventricular diverticula and ependyma-lined paraventricular cysts. 
Morphologic and staining characteristics of a cyanobacterium-like organism associated with diarrhea. A spherical organism 9-10 microns in diameter, seen in three outbreaks of diarrhea in Southeast Asia and the United States during the past 2 years, bore characteristics of a cyanobacterium when observed in formalin-preserved stool specimens and by electron microscopy. Organisms in freshly passed stool specimens showed an internal morula of lipid-containing globules. In fresh water, the morula divided into two sausage-shaped structures resembling the sporocysts of an isosporid coccidian. After 7 months, the organisms had not developed the crescentic sporozoites seen in the Coccidia but had begun to multiply slowly in culture. It was impossible to stain the internal structures of the organisms because the outer cyst wall ruptured during desiccation, releasing the contents of the cysts. The organisms were readily identified by their intense blue autofluorescence under UV light, but they were also recognizable by bright-field microscopy and by a modified acid-fast stain. Almost all infected persons suffered intermittent diarrhea for 2-3 weeks and many emphasized a feeling of intense fatigue during the course of their illness. 
The initial electrocardiogram in patients seen by a mobile coronary care unit. The advent of thrombolytic therapy for patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction has highlighted the importance of the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) in decision making. Thus we analysed the initial ECGs of 94 consecutive cases with suspected myocardial infarction who were seen within six hours after the onset of chest pain by a mobile coronary care unit. The study included 91 patients (three patients admitted twice) (61 male), aged 27-83 years (mean 60.5). Median time from onset of chest pain to arrival of the mobile coronary care unit was 75 minutes (range 15-345), and mean mobile coronary care unit response time was 12.3 +/- 7 (SD) minutes (range 5-45). The majority of cases (65 of 94, 69.1 per cent) were seen within two hours of the onset of symptoms. A final diagnosis of myocardial infarction was made in 48 of 94 (51.1 per cent) cases; 38 had unstable angina and eight other diagnoses. Of the 48 with myocardial infarction the initial ECG showed ST segment elevation in 37, ST depression and or T wave inversion in six, Q waves only in three and left bundle branch block in two. No patient with an initially normal ECG had a myocardial infarction. Thrombolytic therapy was given out of hospital to 33 of 38 patients with ST segment elevation. In seven patients with ST elevation (median delay time to intensive care 60 minutes), rapid resolution of ST segment elevation occurred following thrombolytic therapy and there was no significant elevation of cardiac enzymes, suggesting that the infarct had been aborted. 
Fluoroscopically guided nasoenteric feeding tube placement: results of a 1-year study. Nasoenteric tube feeding is a widely used alternative to parenteral intravenous nutritional support or gastrostomy tube placement. Unmonitored tube passage may result in complications and delays the beginning of tube feedings. The authors studied the results of 882 fluoroscopically guided feeding tube placements in 448 patients in 1 year to determine rates of success and complications, as well as the long-term outcome of this population of patients. Seven hundred sixty-four attempts (86.6%) were successful in positioning the tube distal to the third portion of the duodenum. Four major complications (three fatal arrhythmias and one tracheobronchial injury) were encountered. Only seven patients (2%) experienced aspiration events that were due to positioning of the tube in the distal duodenum. Seventy-seven percent of patients required either one or two tubes; the average "tube life" was 7.8 days. Most repositionings were required because of patient noncompliance or inappropriate administration of solid medications. Fluoroscopically guided nasoenteric tube passage is safe, easily performed, and highly successful, and has resulted in widespread clinical acceptance in our institution. 
Blood flow reactivity to hypercapnia in strictly unilateral carotid disease: preliminary results. To show relationship between degree of carotid arterial stenosis and cerebral blood flow reactivity (RES%) to induced hypercapnia, fluorine-18-fluoromethane and positron emission tomography (PET) was used to study 18 patients with carotid distribution transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), all free of stroke, who had angiographic-proven unilateral arterial disease. Non-involved carotid arteries were either normal or had non-stenotic plaque. Either normal arteries or nonstenotic ulcerations in the symptomatic carotid arteries were present in five of 18 (28%), ipsilateral carotid stenosis from 50-99% was present in eight of 18 (44%), and ipsilateral internal carotid occlusion was present in five of 18 (28%) patients. In comparison with 14 normal controls, all patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow territories had significantly lower mean (SEM) RES% [5.0' (0.2) vs 4.0 (0.9), p less than 0.04]. Symptomatic anterior borderzone (ABZ) RES% was also significantly lower [4.6 (0.4) vs 3.3 (0.9), p less than 0.04], than controls. In patient subgroup comparisons, the 50-99% stenosis subgroup clearly had the lowest MCA RES% [3.4 (0.2)] as well as the lowest ABZ RES% [2.8 (0.4)] on their symptomatic sides. Age, expired pCO2, mean arterial blood pressure, serum glucose, serum haematocrit and number, type and estimated duration of TIAs were not significantly different between subgroups. Linear regression showed a significant relationship between RES% and both measured percentage-stenosis (p = 0.04) and residual luminal diameter (p = 0.05) in symptomatic MCA territories. This approached significance in symptomatic ABZ regions. This preliminary data set suggests that unilateral carotid stenosis can and does result in impaired CO2 reactivity following hypercapnia. 
Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in two patients with basilar artery occlusion. Two patients with angiographically proved basilar artery occlusion were treated with systemic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) according to protocol. The first patient was in a locked-in state and gradually deteriorated. On repeat angiography the basilar artery remained occluded. He died and necropsy revealed a pontine haemorrhagic infarction. The second patient, who was comatose and with decerebrate posturing, made a remarkable recovery. Angiography showed reperfusion. Therapy was initiated in the first patient after six hours and in the second after two hours. Treatment with rtPA is promising but probably not feasible for every patient. Success may depend on duration of occlusion and composition of occluding thrombus. 
Acalculous biliary pain: cholecystectomy alleviates symptoms in patients with abnormal cholescintigraphy. A 45-minute infusion of an octapeptide of cholecystokinin (Kinevac; Squibb Diagnostics, New Brunswick, NJ) was used to measure the gallbladder ejection fraction during cholescintigraphy in 40 normal volunteers. Cholecystokinin cholescintigraphy was shown to be a reproducible test. The maximum mean gallbladder ejection fraction occurred 15 minutes after cholecystokinin infusion and was 74.5% +/- 1.9% (mean +/- SEM). A gallbladder ejection fraction greater than 40% (mean -3SD) was arbitrarily defined to be normal. The gallbladder ejection fraction test was then used to identify patients with acalculous biliary symptoms who may respond to cholecystectomy. A total of 103 patients was tested; 21 had abnormal gallbladder ejection fractions and were randomized into two groups, cholecystectomy or no operation. These patients were followed up symptomatically at 3-month intervals for 13-54 months (mean, 34 months). Of the 11 patients who underwent cholecystectomy, 10 (91%) lost their symptoms and 1 improved. Of the 10 patients in the group that did not undergo surgery, all continued to be symptomatic, 2 of whom requested cholecystectomy after 13 and 24 months, respectively. Of the 13 gallbladders obtained from surgery, 12 showed evidence of chronic cholecystitis, muscle hypertrophy, and/or narrowed cystic duct. A normal gallbladder ejection fraction was recorded in 82 patients, and further treatment was left to the discretion of their referring clinician. On follow-up, 50 patients were asymptomatic and 10 were symptomatic without specific treatment of the biliary tract; 14 underwent cholecystectomy, 8 of whom were asymptomatic. Pathological abnormalities were recorded in 6 of the removed gallbladders. It is concluded that the gallbladder ejection fraction obtained after a 45-minute infusion of cholecystokinin during cholescintigraphy is a reproducible measure of gallbladder emptying, and that cholecystectomy alleviates the biliary-type pain of patients with a reduced gallbladder ejection fraction. 
Automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: is early implantation cost-effective? The evaluation of survivors of sudden cardiac death with serial electrophysiologic studies involves a lengthy and expensive hospitalization, especially when an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is ultimately necessary. The cost efficacy of this conventional approach was therefore compared with direct implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator after the first electrophysiologic study. Thirty-two survivors of sudden death who had inducible ventricular tachycardia during their initial electrophysiologic study underwent serial drug trials. At discharge 12 (37%) were taking an antiarrhythmic drug found to prevent induction of ventricular tachycardia and 20 underwent cardioverter-defibrillator implantation after serial drug trials proved ineffective. The average length of hospitalization for this group that had undergone serial drug testing was 20.2 +/- 9.3 days at an average cost of $48,900 +/- $31,600. Seven survivors of sudden death had no inducible ventricular tachycardia during their initial electrophysiologic study and underwent direct cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Their average length of hospitalization was 12.6 +/- 6.2 days at an average cost of $40,400 +/- $8,300. It is concluded that automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation as an early intervention is not more costly and indeed may be cost-effective compared with therapy guided by serial electrophysiologic testing. As antitachycardia devices become more versatile, long lived and easier to implant, earlier implantation is likely to compare even more favorably with drug therapy. 
Increased dietary branched-chain amino acids do not improve growth in developing rats with chronic biliary obstruction. We studied dietary branched-chain amino acid enrichment in cholestatic weanling rats. Growth was assessed with body weight, muscle weight and nitrogen balance. Systemic metabolic measurements that reflect liver function were evaluated, including plasma ammonia, albumin, amino acids, glucose, triglyceride and branched-chain ketoacids, as well as urinary carnitine excretion. Twenty-two rats underwent bile-duct ligation at 14 d of age. At weaning, 11 rats were fed a control diet and 11 an isoenergetic, isonitrogenous branched-chain amino acid-enriched diet for 3 wk, each with a sham-operated, pair-fed control. Body weights were similar in all four groups. Changes due to bile-duct ligation and not affected by the diet manipulation included lower plasma glucose, nitrogen balance and muscle weight, and higher triglyceride concentration, carnitine excretion and liver weight. Changes due to ligation that were normalized by dietary manipulation included plasma albumin, ammonia and total amino acid concentrations. The ratio of branched-chain to aromatic amino acids was decreased in ligated animals fed both diets; however, branched-chain amino acids were lower in the two groups fed more branched-chain amino acids. 
Disturbance in sodium regulating hormones in chronic obstructive uropathy. Serum atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone levels have been studied in patients with chronic bilateral ureteric obstruction resulting from high pressure chronic retention of urine (HPCR), both in the obstructed state and during the post-obstructed period. Increased ANP levels observed during chronic obstruction fell rapidly following urinary tract decompression by urethral catheterisation. Serum ANP resurged briefly within 24 h but stabilised thereafter at a lower level. PRA was initially suppressed but rose after catheterisation, the increase lagging behind the changes seen for ANP. Rising levels of AII and aldosterone followed this trend but, unlike PRA, levels were not completely suppressed in the obstructed state. The observed hormonal changes probably reflect homeostatic mechanisms directed to the maintenance of sodium and water balance during obstruction and to limitation of the diuresis following its relief. 
Repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. A statewide experience. The results of elective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms are excellent in many institutions. To our knowledge, however, no study has compared the results in a large geographic area in which patients were treated by a variety of surgeons and hospitals. We studied the results of repairing abdominal aortic aneurysms for all Medicare recipients during a single year in Kentucky. One hundred thirty-six operations were performed by 52 surgeons in 31 hospitals. Overall operative mortality was 18%; elective and emergency operative mortality rates were 6% and 49%, respectively. Advancing age did not affect outcome, but mortality due to ruptured aneurysms was higher in smaller hospitals than in larger hospitals. The low mortality for elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms in an elderly population by numerous surgeons in divergent hospitals is a strong indication for its liberal use compared with the high mortality and morbidity of emergency surgery. 
Empowering potential: a theory of wellness motivation. Data were collected from 29 individuals who were attempting to initiate and sustain programs of cardiac risk factor modification. Data were analyzed through the technique of constant comparative analysis. Empowering potential, the basic social process identified from the data, explained individual motivation to initiate and sustain cardiovascular health behavior. Empowering potential was a continuous process of individual growth and development which facilitated the emergence of new and positive health patterns. Within the process of empowering potential, individuals use a variety of strategies which guide the initiation and maintenance of health-related change. The process of empowering potential consists of three stages: appraising readiness, changing, and integrating change. Two categories occurred throughout the process of empowering potential: imaging and social support systems. These findings provide a better understanding of how motivated action is initiated and reinitiated over time.
