Confirming the theoretical structure of the McGill Pain Questionnaire in acute clinical pain. Based upon a tripartite theoretical model of pain, the Pain Rating Index (PRI) of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) continues to be one of the most frequently used instruments to measure clinical pain. Although a number of exploratory factor analytic studies have failed to consistently support the theoretical structure of the instrument, one previous confirmatory factor analytic study of chronic pain did statistically support the a priori model. Because it has been suggested that acute pain may not involve the same dimensions as chronic pain, this study provided a direct test of the theoretical structure of the MPQ through multi-sample confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using data provided by women experiencing pain during labor (n = 185) and women experiencing acute postoperative pain (n = 192). Results of the LISREL CFA analysis indicated that the a priori, 3-factor, oblique model originally proposed by Melzack provided the most parsimonious representation of the data across the 2 samples of acute pain. 
Prophylactic sclerotherapy in high-risk cirrhotics selected by endoscopic criteria. A multicenter randomized controlled trial. Controlled trials of sclerotherapy for the prevention of the first variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotics have given conflicting results. In the present study, 106 cirrhotics were randomized to sclerotherapy (55 patients) or control group (51 patients). Admission criteria were no history of previous variceal bleeding and the presence of high-risk varices, i.e., a variceal score less than or equal to 0 according to Beppu et al. Sclerotherapy sessions were performed at time zero, 7 days, 30 days, and then monthly until eradication. Follow-up endoscopies were performed at 6-month intervals thereafter. Control patients underwent repeat endoscopy at 6-month intervals. Bleeding episodes were treated by sclerotherapy in both groups, whenever possible. Mean follow-up was 24 months. Analysis of the results was performed by the intention-to-treat method. Variceal bleeding occurred in 19 sclerotherapy patients (34.5%) and in 17 controls (35.4%, P = NS). Overall mortality was 34.5% in sclerotherapy patients and 50% in controls (P = NS). Seven of the 19 sclerotherapy patients (36.8%) and 11 of the 17 controls (64.7%) who bled died of hemorrhage (P less than 0.05, log-linear model). It is concluded that prophylactic sclerotherapy does not reduce the incidence of first variceal bleeding in cirrhotics. However, there seems to be a trend toward a lower bleeding-related mortality in sclerotherapy patients than in controls. 
Electrophysiologic effects of isoproterenol in patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia treated with flecainide. The electrophysiologic effects of isoproterenol in patients treated with flecainide for atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia were studied to evaluate the mechanism of tachycardia inducibility after isoproterenol and the value of isoproterenol challenge as a predictor of spontaneous arrhythmia recurrence. Seventeen patients underwent electrophysiologic study before and after oral flecainide administration and after the addition of isoproterenol to flecainide. No patient had inducible sustained supraventricular tachycardia after flecainide alone. Two patients had inducible sustained and six had inducible nonsustained tachycardia after isoproterenol was added to flecainide. The patients were then followed up on the same flecainide dose they received at the time of the electrophysiologic study. Findings: 1) Flecainide treatment prolonged HV and VA intervals, and the addition of isoproterenol did not affect these variables. 2) Isoproterenol shortened anterograde and retrograde block cycle length and the refractory period of the accessory pathway and the AV node. It also decreased the tachycardia cycle length, an effect that was due solely to shortening of AV node conduction time. 3) Flecainide treatment prevented tachycardia induction by affecting retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway. Isoproterenol allowed for tachycardia induction and for more sustained episodes of tachycardia by reversing the effect of flecainide on retrograde accessory pathway conduction. 4) Tachycardia recurred during follow-up in all three patients in whom tachycardia of greater than or equal to 10 s duration was induced after isoproterenol but in no patient who had no or shorter episodes of induced tachycardia (and who did not have a change in medical regimen). Conclusions: 1) Isoproterenol reverses flecainide-induced prolongation of block cycle length and refractory periods of the accessory pathway and AV node. 2) Isoproterenol reverses flecainide-induced prevention of tachycardia induction through reversal of the effects of flecainide on the retrograde accessory pathway. 3) The addition of isoproterenol during flecainide restudy is valuable in predicting long-term drug efficacy. 
Screening for colon malignancy with colonoscopy. Screening of asymptomatic individuals for colon malignancy has been advocated for the past 20 yr in the hopes of reducing colon cancer mortality. Although sigmoidoscopy is an important element of current screening recommendations, the sensitivity of this test in asymptomatic subjects has never been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and location of polyps and cancers in an asymptomatic population by performing full colonoscopy. We wished to assess the sensitivity of screening flexible sigmoidoscopy to 60 cm by determining how many patients with adenomas or cancer had "index" adenomatous polyps in the distal 60 cm. One hundred five healthy male outpatients, over 50 yr old, with negative examinations for occult blood in stools and no prior history of colon pathology, had full colonoscopy. Careful examination of the distal 60 cm was performed, followed by a full colon examination to the cecum. Forty-three patients (41%) had adenomatous polyps, and only 19 of these patients had an index adenomatous polyp in the distal 60 cm. Therefore, the sensitivity of sigmoidoscopy was 44%. The prevalence of adenomas increased with age. Patients were assigned to one of three groups based on the findings in the distal 60 cm. Group 1 (n = 65) had no polyps in the distal 60 cm, but 18 of these patients (28%) had adenomatous polyps in the proximal colon. Among 21 patients with only hyperplastic polyps in the distal 60 cm (group 2), six patients (29%) had proximal adenomas. In group 3, eight of 19 patients (42%) with adenomas in the distal 60 cm also had proximal adenomatous polyps. We conclude that adenomatous polyps are common in asymptomatic men who have negative tests for fecal occult blood. Sigmoidoscopy to 60 cm had a sensitivity of only 44% in this patient population, suggesting that this is an insensitive test for the detection of patients with adenomatous polyps. 
Natural anticoagulants in systemic lupus erythematosus. Deficiency of protein S bound to C4bp associates with recent history of venous thromboses, antiphospholipid antibodies, and the antiphospholipid syndrome. The association of thrombosis with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) could be due to their interference with natural phospholipid dependent anticoagulant mechanisms. We studied antigenic protein C (APC), functional protein C (FPC), free protein S (FPS), protein S bound to C4 binding protein (C4bp-S), antithrombin III (ATIII), as well as IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in 38 patients with SLE with a history of thromboses and 70 patients with SLE without such history. We found a high frequency of deficiencies of natural anticoagulants in both groups of patients with SLE but, because of patient selection, we could not determine the actual prevalence of these defects. Patients having had a venous thrombosis in the previous year had low C4bp-S more frequently than patients with older or no thromboses. When we divided our patients with SLE into those who had a definite, probable, questionable or no antiphospholipid syndrome (aPS) we found the frequency of C4bp-S deficiency to be significantly higher in those with definite aPS than in those without aPS. Intermediate proportions were found in patients with probable and questionable aPS. The levels of C4bp-S decreased as the levels of aCL, particularly IgG, increased. Stepwise discriminant analysis of natural anticoagulants selected deficiencies of C4bp-S and FPC with increased ATIII as a set of variables with highest predictive power for classification of patients with and without aPS. Thus, deficiencies of natural anticoagulants may occur frequently in patients with SLE. 
Psychiatric aspects of headache. Psychological factors, such as psychological stressors, personality style, conditioning, and psychodynamic issues, play a role in the etiology of chronic migraine and muscle contraction headaches. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, personality disorders, conversion, and hypochondriasis, may accompany and complicate headache. Psychiatric diagnosis and treatment add a useful and important dimension to the medical care of the patient. This article presented a useful conceptual model for discriminating between different kinds of psychological influencing factors and guidelines for selecting the appropriate form of psychiatric treatment. 
Regulation of phospholipase D and primary granule secretion by P2-purinergic- and chemotactic peptide-receptor agonists is induced during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. We have compared the abilities of extracellular ATP (acting via P2-purinergic receptors) and formylated peptides (FMLP) to stimulate both phospholipase D (PLD)-based signal transduction and primary granule (azurophilic) secretion in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway. In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, neither ATP nor FMLP elicited significant PLD activation or increased secretion despite the previously documented ability of ATP to stimulate large increases in polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization. Conversely, within 1 d after induction of granulocytic differentiation by dibutyryl cAMP, both ATP and FMLP induced large increases in azurophilic secretion and corresponding increases in PLD activity. ATP-activated PLD activity was near-maximal within 1 d after dibutyryl cAMP treatment, while the FMLP-induced activity increased continuously over 4 d, with a maximal level twice that stimulated by ATP. Additional experiments characterized the activation of PLD by receptor-independent pathways at different stages of differentiation; these included studies of phorbol ester action in intact cells and GTP gamma S action in electropermeabilized cells. An apparent role for guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins in PLD regulation was also indicated by the significant reduction in FMLP- and ATP-stimulated PLD activity observed in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin. At all stages of differentiation, there was good correlation between the relative efficacies of ATP versus FMLP in stimulating both secretion and PLD activity. These data indicate: (a) that the receptor-regulated phospholipase D signaling pathway is induced during differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells; and (b) that differential activation of this signaling system by various Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptor agonists may underlie the differential regulation of secretion and other phagocyte functions by such agents. 
Helicobacter pylori-associated exaggerated gastrin release in duodenal ulcer patients. The effect of bombesin infusion and urea ingestion. Recent studies have shown that the exaggerated meal-stimulated gastrin release in patients with duodenal ulcer abates after eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection. Bombesin-stimulated gastrin release was compared in 11 H. pylori-infected patients with chronic duodenal ulcer and 8 uninfected healthy volunteers both before and after therapy to eradicate H. pylori. Bombesin infusion significantly increased the gastrin release both in control subjects and in patients with duodenal ulcer. Antimicrobial therapy (bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole) to eradicate the H. pylori infection was associated with a significant reduction in bombesin-stimulated gastrin release in patients with duodenal ulcer (from 116.9 +/- 19 pg/mL to 69.5 +/- 7 pg/mL following 50 pmol.kg-1.h-1 bombesin; and from 158 +/- 29 to 83.4 +/- 10 following 200 pmol.kg-1.h-1 bombesin: P = 0.01 for each). Antimicrobial therapy had no effect on gastrin release in uninfected volunteers, thus excluding a nonspecific effect of antimicrobial therapy on antral G-cell function. Serum gastrin was also not increased by feeding 500 mg of urea to 5 H. pylori-infected volunteers. This suggests that access of hydrogen ion to the pH-sensitive sites governing gastrin release by mucosal ammonia produced by H. pylori urease is not a critical factor. These data suggest that exaggerated gastrin release present in patients with duodenal ulcer disease is secondary to H. pylori infection. 
Interleukin-1 mRNA-expressing macrophages in human chronically inflamed gingival tissues. Interleukin-1 (IL-1)-producing cells in inflamed gingival tissues obtained from patients with periodontitis were examined by combined immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Macrophages, T cells, B cells, and endothelial cells were visualized in the lesions by the immunoperoxidase method using specific antibodies to each cell type. Subsequent in situ hybridization using 35S-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide probes complementary to human IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA showed IL-1 transcripts in macrophages predominantly but not in T cells or B cells. Neither fibroblasts nor keratinocytes contained the IL-1 message to any significant extent. Endothelial cells also were essentially negative for IL-1 messages. These findings indicate that IL-1 is produced principally by macrophages in inflamed gingival tissues of humans. 
Current management, local management, and survival statistics of high-grade osteosarcoma. Experience in Japan. To report the current management of high-grade osteosarcoma in Japan, the authors studied the results of 55 cases treated in the authors' institutions and data provided by Osaka University (59 cases), Chiba Oncology Group (97), and Sapporo National Hospital (70). Twenty-five of the 55 cases in the authors' series were treated by limb-salvage surgery, 27 by amputation, and the remainder by chemotherapy. In all 226 cases from the three institutes, 106 were treated by amputation and 120 by limb-salvage surgery. Two local recurrences (4%) were found in the authors' series, three in the Osaka series, and eight in the Chiba series. Five-year accumulative survival rates in this study showed some differences, depending upon the institution or upon the protocol employed: in the authors' series it was 60% overall and 68% for a stronger chemotherapy group; in the Osaka series, it was 50% in a mild chemotherapy group and 72% in an intensive chemotherapy group; and in the Sapporo series, it was 36% and 73%, respectively. This study showed that local control of IIB osteosarcoma was successfully achieved by preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and wide resection, and that an intensive chemotherapeutic combination of high-dose methotrexate, cisplatinum, and doxorubicin is promising. 
Nocardial meningitis: case reports and review. Twenty-eight episodes of nocardial central nervous system infection fulfilling criteria for meningitis were reviewed. In 21 cases Nocardia was cultured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Associated predisposing conditions were present in 75% of cases. The typical presentation was subacute to chronic meningitis characterized by fever (68%), stiff neck (64%), and headache (55%). CSF studies revealed neutrophilic pleocytosis (83% of cases, greater than 500 white blood cells/mm3), hypoglycorrhachia (64%, less than 40 mg of glucose/dL), and elevated protein level (61%, greater than 100 mg/dL). In 43% of cases there was an associated brain abscess. Patients with brain abscess had more frequent and severe aberrations in mental status as well as higher initial white blood cell counts in CSF. Mortality was 52% for the 23 cases diagnosed antemortem and 57% overall. Compared with patients who died, survivors were younger, had lower initial CSF glucose levels, and were less likely to have brain abscess. Diagnosis was often delayed, and nocardial infection was rarely suspected before positive culture reports or autopsy findings became available. 
The influence of severity of spinal cord ischemia in the etiology of delayed-onset paraplegia. To clarify the cause of delayed-onset paraplegia, the authors evaluated the neurologic outcome after temporary (10 to 30 minutes) spinal cord ischemia in the awake rabbit. Loss of motor function occurred in less than 2 minutes in all animals. Restoration of flow within 16 minutes always resulted in full return of function, whereas with occlusion times of greater than 27 minutes all animals remained paralyzed. After temporary occlusion of 20 to 21 minutes, however, 71% of animals returned to normal neurologic function but developed delayed-onset paraplegia 14 to 48 hours later. This appears to be a reliable method for the creation of a model of delayed-onset paraplegia in the awake animal, and will facilitate more detailed studies of the pathophysiology of ischemia-induced paraplegia. 
Massive hemorrhage from a ruptured enteric varices of an augmented bladder. Intestinal varices are uncommon and usually occur secondary to portal hypertension. We report a case of variceal rupture in the intestinal segment of an augmentation colocystoplasty. The patient presented in shock from exsanguinating hemorrhage per urethram, and diagnosis was established at laparotomy. Although the bleeding was controlled with excision of the involved intestinal segment, the patient died of multiple organ failure. The diagnosis and treatment of this rare but fatal condition are discussed. 
Fatal aortic rupture during balloon dilatation of recoarctation. In an eight year old boy with a patch aortoplasty, the aorta ruptured during balloon angioplasty for recoarctation. At necropsy a 1.5 cm long, full thickness tear and a separate, smaller, intimal tear were found. Histological examination showed thinning of the elastic laminae of the aorta. Angioplasty for recoarctation may be dangerous in patients with a patch aortoplasty. 
Investigations on the biochemical characteristics of chronically underperfused muscle. During operation, biopsies from the gastrocnemius muscle and, in some cases, from the sartorius muscle were taken from 32 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease and from 5 subjects with normal peripheral circulation. In patients with inadequate circulation only during exercise, when compared with the control group, increased activities of enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism (malate dehydrogenase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome C oxidase, creatine kinase), in amino acid metabolism (asparate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase), and in anaerobic glycoysis (lactate dehydrogenase) were found. In patients with circulatory disturbances that manifested themselves already at rest, enzyme activities were, with the exception of LDH, lower than those of patients with exclusively exercise-related insufficiency. By means of intraindividual comparisons with the corresponding enzyme activities in the sartorius muscle, the author was able to show that the changes found were not simply the result of differences in training conditions. The diminished concentrations of energy-rich phosphate are an expression of the anaerobic metabolic state in patients with inadequate circulation at rest. It is concluded that chronic ischemia of muscle leads to changes in the energy metabolism of the cell. In the presence of more nearly adequate circulation at rest, the portion of oxidative potential of the total energy metabolism increases. In contrast, if there is an inadequate circulation at rest, the mainly anaerobic glycolysis becomes quantitatively predominant. 
Acute pulmonary embolism in pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation. Acute pulmonary embolism with infarction can delay urgently needed heart transplantation and increase the postoperative pulmonary complications. Few data are available concerning pulmonary embolization in the pediatric patient with end-stage congestive heart failure. Sixty-two consecutive pediatric patients awaiting heart transplantation were monitored for evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. Acute pulmonary infarction was documented by ventilation-perfusion scan, pulmonary angiography or pathologic examination in six patients. The prevalence differed by diagnosis; 5 of 36 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 1 of 20 patients with congenital heart disease developed acute pulmonary embolism with infarction. No significant difference in age at the time of transplantation evaluation, duration of congestive heart failure, presence of cardiac arrhythmias or degree of cardiac dysfunction was seen between patients with and without pulmonary embolism. Two-dimensional echocardiography failed to detect the presence of an intracardiac thrombus in four of the six patients. Two patients who developed acute pulmonary infarction are alive after successful heart transplantation. The remaining four patients died within 6 weeks of initiation of anticoagulant therapy before transplantation could safely be performed. In summary, pediatric patients with end-stage congestive heart failure are at risk for acute pulmonary embolism. No specific clinical factor identified those patients who developed acute pulmonary infarction. Anticoagulant therapy is strongly recommended in the pediatric patient with poor ventricular function awaiting heart transplantation. 
Reliability of interviewer and subject assessments of nevus counts in a study of melanoma. Several types of data are presented concerning the reliability of counting or estimating the density of nevi (moles), a major risk factor for melanoma, using methods typically employed in epidemiologic studies. First, interviewer-derived counts of nevi on the arm produced estimates of inter-observer, inter-subject, temporal and random variability, and their interactions. Second, interviewer-derived arm counts and respondent self-reports of whole body nevus density were compared. Finally, we compared male and female cases and controls with respect to their reported rates of having a relative with a malignant mole. Overall, the intra-observer reliability ranged from 55 to 81%, and was better for observers with more experience. The correlation between the interviewer counts and respondents' self-reported estimates was 0.41. The data on malignant moles in relatives suggest higher reporting rates in male cases and lower reporting in male controls relative to their female counterparts, but there is little difference by sex in the reporting of one's own nevus density. 
The unstable ST segment early after thrombolysis for acute infarction and its usefulness as a marker of recurrent coronary occlusion. To investigate the incidence of early recurrent ST elevation after intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, 12-lead electrocardiograms were continuously monitored for 571 +/- 326 minutes in 31 patients presenting within 4 hours of symptom onset. The study group comprised 9 women and 22 men (mean age +/- standard deviation 53 +/- 12 years), with ST elevation (anterior in 15, inferior in 16) on the initial electrocardiogram, who were given either tissue plasminogen activator (22 patients) or streptokinase (9 patients). Angiography was performed in 30 of 31 patients at 7 to 10 days. Early (less than 3 hours) resolution of ST elevation occurred in 19 patients (61%) at a median of 94 minutes (interquartile range 57 to 113) after thrombolysis, whereas 12 (39%) had no or late (greater than 6 hours) resolution. Eleven of the 19 with early resolution (58%) had either transient (5 patients) or sustained (6 patients) recurrences of ST elevation. Recurrent ST elevation was equal to or more than the initial peak elevation in 9 of 11 patients, and greater than 75% of initial peak in 2. A total of 25 episodes of recurrent ST elevation were observed in the 11 patients (19 transient and 6 sustained episodes), of which 8 (32%) were silent. The proportion of silent episodes was similar for transient (35%) and sustained (33%) recurrences. All patients with sustained recurrent ST elevation had at least 1 preceding transient recurrence. The median duration of transient recurrent ST elevation was 43 minutes (28 to 63). 
On lowering lipids in the post-infarction patient. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) elevated serum cholesterol levels, like other classical risk factors, remain predictive of further coronary events. The excess risk attributable to raised cholesterol levels is considerable, and greater than that in subjects without CHD. A recent meta-analysis of all eight qualifying trials of secondary prevention of CHD by cholesterol lowering is reviewed. There were significant reductions in recurrent non-fatal and fatal CHD, with a downward trend in total mortality. Mechanisms underlying the relationship between cholesterol lowering and secondary prevention are reviewed. The implication of this analysis of trials for clinical practice is that hypercholesterolaemia should be sought and effectively treated in patients with CHD, unless contraindications are present. 
Increasing use of soyfoods and their potential role in cancer prevention. The United States produces approximately half of the world's soybeans. Although most of what is produced is used as animal feed, soy-protein products (eg, soy-protein flour, concentrates, and isolates) are used extensively by the food industry, primarily for their functional characteristics, such as emulsification. During the past decade, however, there has been a marked increase in the use of both traditional soyfoods, such as tofu and soymilk, and second-generation soyfoods, products which generally simulate familiar American dishes. Recently, attention has focused on the possible role of soybean consumption in reducing cancer risk. Soybeans contain, in relatively high concentrations, several compounds with demonstrated anticarcinogenic activity. Two of these compounds--protease inhibitors and phytic acid--have traditionally been viewed as antinutrients. The scientific community has begun to appreciate the potential importance of nonnutritive dietary compounds (phytochemicals) in foods such as soybeans. Dietitians need to become more aware of the phytochemical content of foods and the possible effect of phytochemicals on health and disease. 
The low-affinity p75 nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor mediates NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a potential mechanism for initial signaling in PC12 cells during differentiation in response to nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation has been found to be initiated by the trk protooncogene, which participates in the formation of high-affinity NGF binding sites. In contrast to transfection of wild-type low-affinity p75 NGF receptors, transfection of p75NGFR with mutations in the cytoplasmic domain resulted in an inability of NGF to elicit tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates, indicating that p75NGFR is involved in initiating phosphorylation events by NGF. Even though the p75NGFR receptor does not possess any inherent tyrosine kinase activity, these experiments demonstrate that the p75NGFR has a potential role in NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. 
Renal calculi in lower pole calices: what is the best method of treatment? Percutaneous nephrolithotomy and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) can be used in the treatment of lower pole caliceal calculi. In a retrospective analysis these 2 therapies were compared for treatment of solitary lower pole caliceal calculi to evaluate morbidity. During a 2-year period 23 patients treated with percutaneous nephrolithotomy and 24 who underwent ESWL with the Siemens Lithostar were analyzed in regard to the success rate, effectiveness quotient, complication rate, length of hospitalization and disability period. Followup consisted of ultrasound and/or a plain film of the kidneys, ureters and bladder 1 day and 1 to 3 months postoperatively. A nephrotomogram was included in the ESWL group. Complete removal of all stone fragments was achieved in 93.6% of the patients treated percutaneously without retreatment. In the ESWL group the success rate was 79.2% with a 41.6% retreatment rate. On the other hand, the ESWL group had a shorter hospitalization and an earlier return to normal physical activities. Among the patients who underwent a percutaneous operation 13% had complications compared to 4.1% in the ESWL group. The recurrence rate was higher in the former group (13% within a median of 18 months, compared to 8.3% within a median of 11 months in the ESWL group). The mean stone diameter was 1.42 cm. in the percutaneous group and 1.22 cm. in the ESWL group. Stone composition was similar in both groups. Since ESWL is an effective noninvasive procedure without the need for routine anesthesia and hospitalization, and with prompt return of the patient to a normal life it must be considered the method of choice for lower caliceal stones less than 2 cm. in diameter. However, percutaneous nephrolithotomy will continue to have a primary role in the management of larger stones. 
Biliary surgery after cardiac transplantation. Many patients have undergone successful cardiac transplantation. These patients are at risk of developing the same surgical diseases as the general population. The side effects of immunotherapy may mandate intervention at a different point in the natural history of these processes. From February 1984 through December 1989, 24 patients underwent an operative biliary tract procedure following cardiac transplantation. Seventeen patients underwent elective cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography. The mean hospital stay was 5.4 days, and there was no morbidity or mortality. Seven patients underwent urgent procedures; four of them developed severe complications and three died as a result of their biliary tract disease. Two patients in the urgent group had previously exhibited symptoms of biliary tract disease, and five were previously asymptomatic. There was no significant difference in time from transplantation to biliary procedure between the elective group (mean, 17 months; range, 3 weeks to 47 months) and the urgent group (mean, 18 months; range, 3 weeks to 44 months). Patients who undergo cardiac transplantation should be screened for cholelithiasis. The presence of symptoms should not be required before recommending operative intervention. 
Postoperative infusional continuous regional analgesia. A technique for relief of postoperative pain following major extremity surgery. A new technique using postoperative infusional continuous regional analgesia (PICRA) for postoperative pain relief was investigated in 23 surgical patients treated by amputation (12 patients) or by limb-salvage resection operations (11 patients). Bupivacaine was delivered into peripheral nerve sheaths via catheters placed therein at the time of surgery. Only patients in whom the nerves were easily accessible were treated. Catheters were placed in the axillary sheath, the lumbosacral trunk, and the femoral nerve sheaths of patients treated with shoulder girdle and pelvic procedures (resections and amputations), and within the sciatic nerve sheath of those treated with lower extremity procedures. The anesthetic agent was delivered at controllable rates. Regional analgesia was obtained in the operative site with minimal motor or sensory decrease. To assess the efficacy of this technique, the results of this study group were compared with those of a matched group of 11 patients treated with similar surgical procedures but who received epidural morphine. Eleven of the 23 patients on PICRA required no supplemental narcotic agents. The mean level of the narcotic agents required by the remaining 13 PICRA patients was approximately one third of that required by the matched group of 11 patients receiving epidural morphine. Overall, the patients on PICRA had an 80% reduction of narcotic requirements when compared to the historical controls. The technique is reliable and can be performed by the surgeon, requiring about a ten-minute increase in operating time. It has potentially wide application in orthopedics in procedures in which the major nerves are easily accessible (e.g., pelvic fractures and revision hip surgery) and for patients with intractable pain of the extremities. 
Lambda-like and V pre-B genes expression: an early B-lineage marker of human leukemias. V pre-B and lambda-like genes are selectively expressed in human pre-B cells and encode polypeptide chains that associate in a mu-pseudolight chain complex that may regulate some crucial steps of early B-cell differentiation. We have followed by polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis the expression of these "pre-B-specific" genes in correlation with the status (rearranged v germline) of Ig gene loci (H, kappa, lambda) in a panel of 32 leukemias pertaining mostly to the B lineage and including a number of ambiguously characterized samples. All cells that had rearranged the H locus only expressed V pre-B and lambda-like transcripts, in agreement with a pre-B status. In this group, some biphenotypic leukemias (mostly My/B) might, in fact, be already engaged in the B lineage. Rearrangement of V kappa or V lambda loci correlated with the disappearance of the pre-B gene products. In a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line that was induced to mature to the B-cell stage in culture upon kappa gene rearrangement, the mu-pseudolight chain complex was actually replaced by the classical mu-kappa molecule. Finally, V pre-B and lambda-like genes were found expressed in two leukemic cells that had retained all Ig loci in germline configuration. This finding raises the possibility of having an early pro-B progenitor in which V pre-B and lambda-like products associate with a H chain surrogate in a complex that would trigger an early event of B-cell differentiation such as the H locus rearrangements. 
Erythroderma, palmoplantar keratoderma and profound failure to thrive in an infant. The case is reported of a female infant, who at the age of 3 months developed severe erythroderma, marked hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles and subsequently extreme growth failure and intermittent diarrhoea. Her course was complicated by life-threatening infections but detailed investigation revealed no recognized underlying metabolic or immune abnormality. 
Role of interstitial therapy in the treatment of liver cancer. Conventional palliative management of inoperable focal hepatic tumours remains unsatisfactory. Interstitial techniques such as cryotherapy, alcohol injection, low power laser hyperthermia and interstitial radiotherapy offer alternative approaches. Cryotherapy is an effective and precise technique for inducing tumour necrosis. It can only be performed at laparotomy making it relatively invasive and retreatment impractical. Alcohol is cheap and can be injected percutaneously. However, inhomogeneous distribution produces imprecise and nonreproducible lesions. Low power laser hyperthermia produces precise and reproducible areas of necrosis that are roughly spherical in shape. At present, this technique is most effective for small tumours. Interstitial radiotherapy remains the least evaluated of all the interstitial techniques. Unlike cryotherapy and low power laser hyperthermia, the biological effect of ethanol injection and interstitial radiotherapy cannot be monitored in real time by ultrasound. With the exception of cryotherapy, all methods can be applied percutaneously with low morbidity and mortality. None of these techniques is established, but they may offer the prospect of cure in cases where all areas of tumour can be positively identified and fully treated. However, in most instances the intention is to control the growth of relatively small discrete volumes of tumour within the hepatic parenchyma. 
Middle ear fluid lysozyme source in experimental pneumococcal otitis media. Middle ear infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae is important in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic otitis media, and lysozyme in middle ear fluid (MEF) is an important inflammatory mediator in this disease. To determine the source of lysozyme during the early period of acute pneumococcal otitis media, chinchillas were irradiated to induce neutropenia, and their middle ears were inoculated with heat-killed, encapsulated pneumococci. The number of inflammatory cells and concentration of lysozyme were measured in MEF between 6 and 72 hours after inoculation. In pneumococcus-inoculated ears, the mean number of inflammatory cells but not lysozyme was significantly lower in MEF from irradiated animals than that from nonirradiated animals at 6 hours. Since lysozyme accumulated in MEF before the influx of inflammatory cells in irradiated animals, the initial release of this inflammatory mediator is most likely not from inflammatory cells; and mucosal epithelial cells, the only other known source of lysozyme in the middle ear environment, were the probable source induced by the direct stimulation of pneumococci. Inflammatory cells may contribute lysozyme later in the inflammatory response, since cellular and lysozyme concentrations in irradiated and nonirradiated animals were similar between 24 and 72 hours. These results suggest that future therapeutic interventions to limit middle ear inflammation in acute otitis media may need to recognize the direct action of pneumococcal cells or their envelope components on middle ear epithelium. 
Operative management of acoustic neuromas: the priority of neurologic function over complete resection. The objective of surgical management of acoustic tumors is to remove them entirely and preserve facial nerve function and hearing when possible. A dilemma arises when it is not possible to remove the entire tumor without incurring additional neurologic deficits. Twenty patients who underwent intentional incomplete surgical removal of an acoustic neuroma to avoid further neurologic deficit were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into a subtotal group (resection of less than 95% of tumor) and a near-total group (resection of 95% or more of tumor) and were followed yearly with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The subtotal group was planned and consisted of elderly patients (mean age, 68.5 years) with large tumors (mean, 3.1 cm). The near-total group consisted of younger patients (mean age, 45.8 years) and smaller tumors (mean, 2.3 cm). The mean length of followup for all patients was 5.0 years. Ninety percent of patients had House grade I or II facial function post-operatively. Radiologically detectable tumor regrowth occurred in only one patient, who was in the subtotal resection group. Near-total resection of acoustic tumor was not associated with radiologic evidence of regrowth of tumor for the period of observation. Within the limits of the follow-up period of this study, subtotal resection of acoustic neuroma in elderly patients was not associated with clinically significant recurrence in most patients and produced highly satisfactory rates of facial preservation with low surgical morbidity. 
The role of albumin in human physiology and pathophysiology, Part III: Albumin and disease states. The serum albumin level is one of several clinical parameters of the status of general health. There is a marked correlation between low albumin levels and the incidence of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that hypoalbuminemia is a common finding among hospitalized patients. This results from alterations in the catabolic or anabolic rates, losses of albumin, or redistribution between the various fluid compartments of the body. Somewhat less well defined than the role of albumin as a prognostic indicator is its role in compounding pathophysiology. Hypoalbuminemia is known to be associated with delayed wound healing. The hypoalbuminemic state interferes with the normal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract. Qualitative changes in the albumin molecule which occur in renal disease may damage the nephron. Low serum albumin levels may adversely affect the coagulation system. Further investigation into the role of albumin in pathophysiology is warranted. 
Differentiation between renal allograft rejection and cyclosporine toxicity: a clinicopathological study. The differentiation between cyclosporine nephrotoxicity (CyN) and acute rejection (AR) still remains a matter of intensive research. In a retrospective study over the last 2 years, we assessed the clinical and histopathological data of 43 episodes of renal dysfunction in 39 renal transplant recipients immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (CyA). Ten episodes (23.2%) were identified as AR and 10 (23.2%) as acute CyN; in six cases (13.9%), signs of both AR and CyN were found. Fever (80%), oliguria (50%), and edema (50%) were prominent features in AR, but not in CyN. Renal blood flow was higher in the nephrotoxicity group and for corresponding degree of renal dysfunction. Significant hyperuricemia (greater than 8 mg/dL) was a prominent finding in CyN (80%) and to a lesser extent in AR (20%). The helper to suppressor cell ratio in the peripheral blood remained stable or slightly decreased in all cases with CyN, but increased in 70% of the cases with AR. CyN was associated with significantly higher whole blood CyA levels (P less than 0.005) and there was a positive correlation between plasma creatinine and CyA levels during the nephrotoxicity episodes (P less than 0.02). Diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrate was observed in 90% of the biopsies with AR and only in 20% with CyN (P less than 0.005). Concerning the extent of the tubular lesions, no significant differences were observed between the two groups. In contrast, vascular lesions such as arterial endothelial proliferation (P less than 0.05), hyalinosis (P less than 0.05), and glomerular capillary thrombi (P less than 0.05) were more commonly seen in nephrotoxicity biopsies. 
The paradox of 'chronic unstable angina' secondary to an organizing intracoronary thrombus [published erratum appears in South Med J 1991 Sep;84(9):1074, 1160] We have described a case in which coronary vasospasm and the resultant endothelial shear stresses most likely caused plaque rupture and transient coronary occlusion at the site of a minor atherosclerotic narrowing. Remodeling then led to a long, complex stenotic lesion that included ruptured and dissected endothelium and organized thrombus. This led to severe anginal symptoms over a 3-month period, or the paradox of "chronic unstable angina." Angioplasty was difficult but eventually successful after pulsed high-pressure balloon inflations and intracoronary thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase. This case demonstrates that the clinical course of a patient with minor or insignificant coronary disease may be a dynamic process that cannot be entirely predicted even by recent invasive cardiac studies. 
Lhermitte-Duclos disease and Cowden disease: a single phakomatosis. Two unrelated patients with macrocephaly, seizures, and mild cerebellar signs had a dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum (Lhermitte-Duclos disease). Both also had autosomal dominant Cowden disease as evidenced by facial, oral, and acral papules. In the two families, 9 sibs demonstrated the mucocutaneous lesions, thyroid disease, breast tumors, and ovarian tumors compatible with the diagnosis of Cowden disease. Some of the sibs also showed various degrees of neurological signs such as macrocephaly, mental retardation, seizures, tremor, and dysdiadochokinesia. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of sibs of one family demonstrated megalencephaly and other mild abnormalities. The occurrence of these two rare disorders in single patients is more than a coincidence, and the clinical findings in the combined condition establishes it as a new phakomatosis. 
Endothelin effects on renal function and tubuloglomerular feedback. Analysis of our data in conjunction with other recent literature allows the following conclusions regarding the role of endothelin in the tubuloglomerular feedback control mechanism and in the pathogenesis of acute ischemic renal failure: (1) Endothelin reduces nephron filtration rate in the nephrons with interrupted signal perception at the macula densa, in accord with preglomerular arteriolar constriction. Yet, the increase in filtration fraction in the whole kidney clearance study suggests a preferential postglomerular arteriolar constriction. Taken together, endothelin, which is a very potent renal vasoconstrictor, seems to constrict both preglomerular and postglomerular arterioles with a predominant constriction of the latter at the doses employed. (2) The endothelin-induced natriuresis is due to a fall in tubular reabsorption, reflecting a direct tubular action, possibly related to an elevation in blood pressure. (3) At the doses of endothelin used and under the present experimental conditions, changes in the magnitude of tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) response or the feedback characteristic could not be detected. (4) No evidence was found for a participation of endothelin in the pathogenesis of acute postischemic renal failure, as evidenced by the absence of an improvement in glomerular filtration after treatment with endothelin antiserum. 
Idiopathic photoreceptor dysfunction causes unexplained visual acuity loss in later adulthood. Progressive visual loss, caused by initially unrecognized retinal photoreceptor dysfunction predominantly affecting cones, developed in six patients in late adulthood. Because of minimal ophthalmoscopic retinal abnormalities, the patients initially had been suspected of having optic neuropathy or psychogenic visual loss. The correct diagnosis was ultimately established by finding electroretinographic abnormalities and color discrimination losses out of proportion to visual acuity loss. In no case was a causative agent or a family history of photoreceptor disease identified. In many other respects, however, features of the patients' illness resemble those described previously under the headings of cone dysfunction syndrome, cone dystrophy, cone degeneration, and cone-rod dystrophy. 
Volvulus of the splenic flexure: radiographic features. Six cases of splenic flexure volvulus were studied over a 14-year period. The patients were aged 15-62 years. Five of the six patients were mentally retarded, lifelong residents of a long-term-care institution. Two patients had congenital absence of normal colonic attachments; the other four patients had elongated mesocolons, presumably from chronic constipation. All patients underwent abdominal radiography, followed by a barium enema study. In the appropriate clinical setting, radiographic diagnosis of a splenic flexure volvulus is suggested when the following are seen: (a) a markedly dilated, air-filled colon wtih an abrupt termination at the anatomic splenic flexure; (b) two widely separated air-fluid levels, one in the transverse colon and the other in the cecum; (c) an empty descending and sigmoid colon; and (d) a characteristic beak at the anatomic splenic flexure at a barium enema examination. 
Results of surgical therapy for biliary dyskinesia. One hundred eighty-seven patients who presented with symptoms consistent with biliary colic but had no ultrasonic evidence of cholelithiasis were observed in an effort to identify those with a functional gallbladder disorder that might benefit from surgical intervention. All patients underwent quantitative evaluation of gallbladder emptying using cholecystokinin biliary scanning, and ejection fractions less than 35% were considered abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients (69%) had abnormal ejection fractions, and 88 (68%) of these subsequently underwent cholecystectomy. Sixty of the surgical specimens revealed pathologic changes. Eighty-four percent of patients successfully contacted for follow-up experienced complete relief, and another 13% had partial relief of preoperative symptoms. Only two patients reported no change in symptom complex. Twenty-nine patients with abnormal ejection fractions elected not to undergo surgery. Fifty-nine percent of these patients continued to experience symptoms of biliary colic at a mean follow-up of 22 months. Of the 44 patients with normal ejection fractions, 35 (80%) reported resolution of symptoms during follow-up of medical treatment. Cholecystokinin biliary scanning can help identify patients with acalculous, functional gallbladder disease who may benefit from cholecystectomy. 
Impedance cardiography for repeated determination of stroke volume in elderly hypertensives: correlation with pulsed Doppler echocardiography. In this double-blind, crossover study the authors have validated stroke volume determination by impedance cardiography against the pulsed Doppler echocardiographic method in elderly hypertensives. They found a good correlation between the stroke volume values obtained by the two methods over a range of values from 30 to 130 mL. The coefficient of linear regression was about .95 at each visit. The mean of the differences was -0.73 mL with a standard deviation of 8.46. Given that individual differences are normally distributed, the values corresponding to 2 standard deviations of the mean define a range covering 95% of the observed differences. From the distribution of the data around the mean plot it appears that, in comparison with pulsed Doppler, impedance cardiography tends to slightly underestimate stroke volumes of greater than 90 mL and to overestimate values of less than 50 mL. The results of this study indicate that impedance cardiography may represent a reliable alternative to pulsed Doppler echocardiography for the noninvasive estimation of cardiac output at rest in elderly patients. 
Tricuspid annular motion. Triscupid annular motion is related to right ventricular systolic function in the same way mitral annulus motion is related to left ventricular function. Tricuspid annular excursion reflects the longitudinal motion of the right ventricle, and the systolic descent of the anulus correlates with systolic venous inflow to the right atrium. However, it has not been shown clearly how to reproducibly quantify this motion. Therefore we describe a method to measure triscuspid annular motion using two-dimensional oriented M-mode echocardiography from the apical view. We studied a group of 10 normal subjects (mean age, 28.7 years; range, 25 to 38 years) and a group of 29 patients (mean age, 57.2 years; range, 20 to 84 years) with disease of the left side of the heart but no evidence of involvement of the right side of the heart. In each subject, tricuspid and mitral annular motion were measured respectively at their lateral, septal or medial, anterior, and posterior margin points. The total tricuspid annular motion for normal subjects was, as follows: lateral, 24.9 +/- 3.5 mm; medial, 20.1 +/- 2.5 mm; anterior, 21.6 +/- 3.8 mm; and posterior, 22.3 +/- 2.3 mm. Interobserver and intraobserver variability was low, with a coefficient of variance for the different annular points ranging from 6.19% to 11.56% between observers and from 4.10% to 7.26% within observer. We conclude that it is possible to measure tricuspid annular motion with this method in a reproducible way and to use it as a diagnostic tool in evaluating function of the right side of the heart. 
Melanosis coli: a case report in a trauma patient and review of the literature. Melanosis Coli (MC) is a benign pigmentation disorder of the colon occasionally diagnosed at endoscopy. The authors report a case of M. coli in a patient with a gunshot to the abdomen, in whom the entity produced an interesting clinical picture, and a review of the literature on this condition. 
Asymptomatic myocardial ischemia during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and importance of prior Q-wave infarction and diabetes mellitus. Eighty-eight patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of 100 stenoses were studied for the presence of factors deemed significant in the etiology of silent myocardial ischemia. Thirty-two patients were asymptomatic during balloon dilations of 36 arteries, and 56 patients had angina during PTCA of 64 arteries. There were no differences in age, sex, prior anginal history, antianginal regimen, extent of coronary artery disease and number or duration of inflations between the 2 study groups. Previous infarction (33 vs 12%, p less than 0.02), Q waves in the target area (31 vs 7%, p less than 0.005) and diabetes mellitus (36 vs 17%, p less than 0.05) were present more often in the asymptomatic group. Sixty-four% of all asymptomatic patients had either diabetes or previous infarction in the target territory. Collateral circulation was more frequent in asymptomatic patients, probably reflecting the ability of collateral arteries to ameliorate ischemia. During 2-vessel PTCA, patients without angina during dilation of only 1 of the 2 treated arteries (discordant responders) had previous infarction in that artery's territory (5 of 5, 100%), whereas patients without previous infarction were either symptomatic or asymptomatic (concordant responders) during PTCA of both arteries. This study shows that asymptomatic ischemia occurs frequently during PTCA in patients with symptomatic coronary disease. Prior Q-wave infarction and diabetes mellitus are important, independent factors associated with painless ischemia. It is suggested that infarction produces a localized dysfunction of afferent cardiac pain fibers, whereas diabetes can cause a global cardiac sensory neuropathy. 
Expanded clinical evaluation of lovastatin (EXCEL) study results: IV. Additional perspectives on the tolerability of lovastatin. This randomized, double-blind, multicenter, diet-and-placebo-controlled study was designed to clarify the dose-response relationship of lovastatin therapy to lipid-modifying efficacy and drug-related adverse events. Exclusion criteria were minimized so that study patients were representative of the majority of patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia seen in medical practice. After 6 weeks on the American Heart Association Step 1 Diet, a total of 8,245 patients were randomly assigned to 48 weeks of treatment with diet and placebo or lovastatin at dosages of 20 or 40 mg once a day or 20 or 40 mg twice a day. All adverse events were monitored, with particular attention to evaluation of liver and muscle. Liver transaminase elevations suggestive of possible hepatotoxicity, defined as successive elevations in either aspartate transaminase or alanine aminotransferase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, occurred in equal numbers of placebo and lovastatin 20 mg/day treated patients (0.1%). The frequencies were higher in lovastatin 40 mg/day and 80 mg/day patient groups (0.9 and 1.5%, respectively). No patient was diagnosed as having clinically symptomatic hepatic dysfunction. Creatinine kinase (CK) elevations above the upper limit of normal occurred frequently in placebo- (29%), as well as lovastatin-treated patients (29-35%), and muscle symptoms were reported with similar frequency in all groups (7-9%). The combination of muscle symptoms with marked CK elevations (greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal) was seen in only five patients: one in a 40 mg/day dose group and four in the 80 mg/day dose group. No patient developed rhabdomyolysis. The incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events requiring discontinuation was 6% for the placebo group and from 7% (20 mg/day) to 9% (80 mg/day) for lovastatin treatment groups. No new types of adverse experiences related to lovastatin treatment were reported. Lovastatin, as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated LDL cholesterol, was generally very well tolerated. 
Cis-platinum chemotherapy for ocular basal cell carcinoma. We have used intravenous cis-platinum chemotherapy in the treatment of three patients with basal cell carcinoma of the lid extending into the orbit. Cis-platinum chemotherapy caused a reduction in tumour size and thereby delayed surgery in all cases. It allowed for local resection in one case, appeared to delay a patient's exenteration in a second case, and was used prior to radiotherapy in a third case. While not curative, cis-platinum may be useful as an adjuvant to decrease tumour mass prior to local excision and for patients who refuse or must delay exenteration. 
Percutaneous radiofrequency catheter ablation for supraventricular arrhythmias in children. Nineteen procedures were performed in 17 children, aged 10 months to 17 years, using catheter radiofrequency applications for the management of malignant or drug-resistant supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Diagnoses were junctional ectopic tachycardia in 1 patient, atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia in 4 and accessory pathway-mediated tachycardia in 12. Accessory pathway locations were left lateral (n = 4), posteroseptal (n = 3), left posterior (n = 2), right posterolateral (n = 1), right posterior paraseptal (n = 1), right intermediate septal (n = 1) and right anterior (n = 1). Ablation of accessory pathways was performed using 20 to 40 W of energy. The catheter was passed retrograde to the left ventricle in patients with a left-sided pathway and anterograde to the right atrium in those with a right-sided or posteroseptal pathway. In the 12 patients with an accessory pathway, radiofrequency applications were successful in 11 pathways and failed in 2. There were no recurrences of accessory pathway-mediated tachycardia. Atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia was treated by AV node modification using 15 W of energy applied until first degree AV block occurred. After radiofrequency catheter ablation, there was a prolonged AH interval, tachycardia was not inducible and tachycardia recurred in one patient. For the patient with junctional ectopic tachycardia, 15 to 18 W of energy was delivered at the site of the maximal His bundle electrogram until sinus rhythm and normal AV conduction appeared. After a recurrence, a second procedure abolished tachycardia and AV conduction. In summary, radiofrequency catheter ablation was initially successful in 17 of 19 procedures and ultimately curative in 14 (82%) of 17 patients with no serious complications. Radiofrequency catheter ablation appears to be a safe and effective method for the management of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in children. 
The heterogeneity of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). I. Characterization of peptide heterogeneity in 13 individual preparations of hCG. Peptide variations in the alpha-subunit (molecules starting at alpha 3 and alpha 4) and beta-subunit (missing linkages at beta 44-45 and beta 47-48) of hCG have been reported by several investigators. Studies, however, have been limited to standard hCG preparations (purified from large pools of urine) and other hCG samples from mixed urines. In this study we used chromatographic procedures to purify the total hCG content of 13 individual urines, 6 from patients with pregnancy and 7 from those with trophoblast disease (no hCG-containing fractions were excluded). Then, we examined for the first time the peptide variability among individual samples of hCG. We report 1) that individual hCG preparations have nicks (missing linkages) in the beta-subunit, primarily between residue 47-48 (11 of 13 samples) and, less commonly, at the linkage 44-45 or 46-47 (3 of 13 samples); 2) the extent of nicking varies greatly between individual preparations (range, 0-100% of molecules); 3) varying alpha-subunit N-terminal heterogeneity (N-terminus starting at alpha 3 or alpha 4) was also present (range, 0-28% of molecules), but was confined to preparations from individuals with trophoblast disease (6 of 7 samples from trophoblast disease urine, 0 of 6 from pregnancy urine); 4) hCG missing the beta-subunit C-terminal region was also detected (2 of 13 hCG preparations); and 5) 1 of 13 preparations was nicked on the hCG alpha-subunit, between residues 70 and 71. Thus, 12 of 13 individual hCG samples demonstrated at least 1 of 4 different forms of peptide heterogeneity. We conclude that individual hCG samples vary widely in the type and extent of peptide heterogeneity, an observation that is not appreciated when pools of hCG are studied. 
Role of cardiac ATP-regulated potassium channels in differential responses of endocardial and epicardial cells to ischemia. Epicardial cells are more susceptible to the electrophysiological effects of ischemia than are endocardial cells. To explore the ionic basis for the differential electrophysiological responses to ischemia at the two sites, we used patch-clamp techniques to study the effects of ATP depletion on action potential duration and the ability of ATP-regulated K+ channels in single cells isolated from feline left ventricular endocardial and epicardial surfaces. During ATP depletion by treatment with 1 mM cyanide (CN-), shortening of action potential durations was significantly greater in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. Thirty minutes after initiating exposure to 1 mM CN-, action potential duration at 90% repolarization was reduced to 0.70 +/- 0.12 of the control value for endocardial cells versus 0.39 +/- 0.18 for epicardial cells (p less than 0.01), and action potential duration at 20% repolarization was reduced to 0.72 +/- 0.13 for endocardial cells versus 0.12 +/- 0.09 for epicardial cells (p less than 0.01). In both endocardial and epicardial cells, the shortening of action potential by CN- treatment was partially reversed by 0.3 microM glibenclamide; the magnitude of reversal, however, was much greater in epicardial cells. After exposure to 1 mM CN-, the activity of ATP-regulated K+ channels in cell-attached membrane patches was significantly greater in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. To study the dose-response relation between ATP concentration and open-state probability of the channels, intracellular surfaces of inside-out membrane patches containing ATP-regulated K+ channels were exposed to various concentrations of ATP (10-1,000 microM). The concentration of ATP that produced half-maximal inhibition of the channel was 23.6 +/- 21.9 microM in endocardial cells and 97.6 +/- 48.1 microM in epicardial cells (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that ATP-regulated K+ channels are activated by a smaller reduction in intracellular ATP in epicardial cells than in endocardial cells. The differential ATP sensitivity of ATP-regulated K+ channels in endocardial and epicardial cells may be responsible for the differential shortening in action potentials during ischemia at the two sites. 
Carcinoma of the esophagus: CT vs MR imaging in determining resectability. MR imaging and CT were performed prospectively in 35 patients with esophageal carcinoma to determine the resectability of the primary tumors, because at our institution patients with resectable tumors have surgery regardless of the presence of distant metastases. Tumors with evidence of aortic or tracheobronchial invasion on MR or CT were considered to be unresectable. Tracheobronchial invasion was diagnosed when the tumor extended into the lumen of the airway, and aortic invasion was diagnosed when the triangular fat space between the esophagus, aorta, and spine adjacent to the primary tumor was obliterated. Two patients were excluded because of suboptimal MR images produced by motion artifacts. Pathologic proof was obtained from either surgery or autopsy in 31 patients. Of these, six patients (19%) had proved unresectable tumors (three aortic invasion and three tracheobronchial invasion). In all six cases, these features were correctly detected with both MR and CT. One patient had false-positive findings on MR and CT. An indeterminate diagnosis was obtained with MR in three patients and with CT in four patients. These incorrect or indeterminate results were all related to the diagnosis of aortic invasion. No patient had a false-negative result. When indeterminate diagnoses were considered false-positive, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for resectability were 100%, 84%, and 87%, respectively, for MR and 100%, 80%, and 84%, respectively, for CT. We conclude that MR and CT have nearly the same accuracy in predicting resectability of tumors in patients with esophageal carcinoma. 
Diverticulitis of the duodenum: clinical and radiological manifestations of seven cases. Seven patients with duodenal diverticulitis were evaluated by computed tomography (CT) and various other abdominal imaging techniques. The series included four men and three women who ranged in age from 47 to 84 yr (mean: 65 yr). They had presented with epigastric or periumbilical pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and loss of appetite and weight due to postprandial cramps or vomiting. In each instance, the abdominal CT examination proved crucial in the diagnosis of duodenal diverticulitis, with contained perforation or inflammatory changes involving the adjacent structures. Five patients underwent laparotomy while two others were treated conservatively with antibiotics and/or percutaneous drainage of peridiverticular abscess. The clinical and radiological features of this uncommon entity are herein described, along with a brief review of the medical literature regarding the current approach to its diagnosis and management. 
Cryotherapy for cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS): a phase II trial. To assess the response and toxicity of liquid nitrogen cryotherapy for cutaneous lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) associated with AIDS, we evaluated 20 subjects with biopsy-proven KS in a phase II clinical trial. Subjects had two to four cutaneous KS indicator lesions treated with liquid nitrogen cyrotherapy. Treatment was repeated at 3 week intervals, allowing adequate healing time. On average, subjects received three treatments per lesion with a mean follow-up time of 11 weeks (range of 6-25 weeks). One treatment consisted of two freeze-thaw cycles, with thaw times ranging from 11 to 60 s per cycle. A complete response was observed in 80% of treated KS lesions and lasted a minimum of 6 weeks following the completion of therapy. Greater than 50% cosmetic improvement of KS was observed. Histopathology of treated lesions correlated poorly with cosmetic improvement. Response was not predicted by tolerance to zidovudine therapy, CD4+ cell count, presence of B symptoms, or previous chemotherapy. Subjects without prior history of opportunistic infection (OI) were more likely to have a better response than those with a prior history of OI. Subjects tolerated cryotherapy well. Blistering occurred frequently, but local pain was limited and relieved by acetaminophen. Secondary infection did not occur. Based on this study, we recommend cryotherapy to subjects with cutaneous KS lesions. Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy is easily applied as a primary therapy, and may also have a role in the treatment of cutaneous KS lesions that respond slowly or show incomplete cosmetic improvement with systemic therapies. 
Clinical risk factors for Alzheimer's disease: a population-based case-control study. Using information on clinical risk factors provided through the medical record linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we conducted a population-based case-control study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). During the period 1960 to 1974, we identified 415 newly diagnosed cases of AD among residents of Rochester, Minnesota, and matched one community control to each case based on age, sex, and duration of community medical record. We estimated odds ratios using conditional logistic regression for several potential clinical risk factors of AD. Among more than 20 clinical risk factors that were evaluated, the only statistically significant findings were for episodic depression, personality disorder, and hypertension. 
Increasing incidence of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The incidence of pyloric stenosis in the Mersey region rose from 1.54/1000 births in 1976-8 to 2.22/1000 births in 1986-8. Reliance on ultrasonography for diagnosis in the 1980s resulted in fewer 'tumours' being felt; diagnostic delay was not shortened overall but serial ultrasonography showed evolving lesions in six patients. Clinical examination and selective use of ultrasonography is advocated. 
Blunt abdominal trauma resulting in intestinal obstruction: when to operate? The overall approach to blunt abdominal trauma resulting in hematoma and intestinal obstruction has been variable and controversial. Recent reports recommend conservative nonoperative management. We reviewed six cases of duodenal and jejunal hematomas resulting from blunt trauma of which five resolved with nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition. The average hospital stay was 16 days (10-23 days), and total parenteral nutrition days were 9 days (4-16 days). Upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) demonstrated partial bowel obstruction in all five cases. In contrast, the sixth case was a restrained passenger who had evidence of complete bowel obstruction on UGI series, which failed to resolve after 18 days of conservative management. Laparotomy revealed jejunal and colonic strictures with fibrosis, which were successfully resected. We recommend that based on radiologic documentation of persistent high-grade obstruction, as well as the clinical course, patients whose obstructions do not resolve by 10 to 14 days ought to be further investigated and operative intervention considered. This approach may facilitate an earlier diagnosis of complications, reduce length of hospitalization and days on parenteral nutrition, as well as to expedite the proper management. 
Cold cerebroplegia. A new technique of cerebral protection during operations on the transverse aortic arch. Profound hypothermia associated with circulatory arrest is the commonest method of cerebral protection during operations on the aortic arch. This technique allows a limited time to perform the aortic repair, however. It also necessitates prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass to rewarm the patient. This may be the cause of coagulation disorders or infection. Selective perfusion of the carotid arteries can also be used. When the perfusion is derived from the main arterial line, however, the repair of the aorta requires that the vessel be crossclamped, and cannot be performed in an "open, bloodless" manner. To avoid the disadvantages of both techniques, we have developed a new technique of cerebral protection. After a regular cardiopulmonary bypass has been established, the carotid arteries are cannulated and perfused with blood cooled at 6 degrees to 12 degrees C, through a separate heat exchanger, while the core temperature is maintained at moderate hypothermia (25 degrees to 28 degrees C, rectal). To perform the "open" distal repair, the cardiopulmonary bypass is discontinued while the carotid perfusion is maintained (250 to 350 ml/min). When the distal repair is completed, cardiopulmonary bypass is resumed and the carotid perfusion is discontinued. Between 1984 and June 1989, 54 patients (mean age 55 years) were operated on with this method (45 elective operations, 9 emergency procedures). Mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was 121 minutes (65 to 248), and mean duration of circulatory arrest was 22 minutes (10 to 51). The electroencephalogram, routinely recorded, showed return of the cerebral activity after a mean time of 12 minutes and normal activity after a mean time of 66 minutes. There was no intraoperative death. Hospital mortality rate was 13% (7/54). One death was related to neurologic disorders. All patients but one awakened normally within 8 hours after operation. Two patients (4.3%) experienced a transient neurologic episode (lateral hemianopia) 9 and 11 days postoperatively. There was no hemorrhagic complication (24-hour average blood loss: 840 +/- 540 ml). In our experience the technique of "cold cerebroplegia" has been demonstrated to provide excellent cerebral protection. It requires no prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass and does not limit the time necessary to perform the aortic repair. It may be considered as a safe alternative to profound hypothermia associated with circulatory arrest. 
Lectin-reactive patterns of markedly elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein in patients with chronic active hepatitis. Four cases of chronic hepatitis associated with high serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) without hepatocellular carcinoma are reported. All showed transient elevations of serum AFP, with peak levels of 13,500, 8,000, 4,450, and 3,000 ng/ml shortly after aggravation resulting from liver function tests. Liver biopsies revealed severe parenchymal damage in all the cases with piece-meal necrosis, bridging necrosis or bridging fibrosis. In two of four cases, there was a lobular distortion. AFP stain by an immunoperoxidase method showed a positive result in surviving hepatocytes. Lectin affinity electrophoresis of AFP in the four cases, together with an additional 12 patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis and 44 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, all having AFP levels above 1,000 ng/ml, revealed that the chronic hepatitis patients had a benign pattern of AFP bands, in contrast with the pattern of hepatocellular carcinoma with increased proportions of lentil lectin-reactive AFP-L3 and/or erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin-reactive AFP-P4, indicating that the analysis of lectin reactivity of AFP has a great value in differentiating the benign and malignant conditions with increased serum levels of AFP above 1,000 ng/ml. 
Effect of ST segment measurement point on performance of standard and heart rate-adjusted ST segment criteria for the identification of coronary artery disease BACKGROUND. Recent reports critical of the performance of heart rate-adjusted indexes of ST depression during exercise electrocardiography have used J-point rather than ST segment measurements. However, no standard exists for the optimal time after the J-point at which to measure ST segment deviation. METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess the effect of ST segment measurement position on performance of standard exercise electrocardiographic criteria, the delta ST segment/heart rate (delta ST/HR) index, and the ST segment/heart rate (ST/HR) slope for the detection of coronary artery disease, the exercise electrocardiograms of 50 clinically normal subjects and 80 patients with known or likely coronary disease were analyzed using ST depression measured at both the J-point and at 60 msec after the J-point (J + 60). A positive exercise electrocardiogram by standard criteria, defined as 0.1 mV or more of additional horizontal or downsloping ST depression at end exercise, had a specificity of 96% when ST depression was measured at either the J-point or J + 60. There was no difference in sensitivity of standard electrocardiographic criteria at J + 60 and J point (both 59%, p = NS). However, at matched specificity of 96%, the delta ST/HR index and ST/HR slope calculated using ST depression at J + 60 were significantly more sensitive (90% and 93%) than when calculated using J-point depression (64% and 61%, each p less than 0.001). Comparison of areas under respective receiver operating characteristic curves confirmed the superior performance of J + 60 as opposed to J-point measurements for both the delta ST/HR index (0.98 versus 0.89, p = 0.006) and the ST/HR slope (0.96 versus 0.87, p = 0.007) and also demonstrated modestly improved overall test performance for standard electrocardiographic criteria using J + 60 measurements (0.88 versus 0.82, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Use of J-point measurements significantly degrades performance of heart rate-adjusted indexes of ST depression but has less effect on standard criteria. 
Psychosis and physical aggression in probable Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency and type of psychotic symptoms in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease and to test whether there is a relationship between specific psychotic symptoms and episodes of physical aggression. METHOD: From 209 patients with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease who had been assessed in a research clinic every 6 months for up to 4.5 years, 181 subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease were selected for study. On the basis of the summary note for each visit in the patients' charts, the presence of delusions, hallucinations, misidentifications, and episodes of physical aggression was determined. Data regarding psychotic symptoms and aggression were available for 170 and 169 subjects, respectively. RESULTS: Delusions had been reported for 74 (43.5%) of the patients and were the most frequent psychotic symptom; persecutory delusions were the most common type. Physical aggression had been noted for 50 (29.6%) of the patients. Delusions and misidentifications frequently preceded and were significantly associated with episodes of physical aggression. The presence of delusions was a significant predictor of physical aggression but accounted for only 3.5% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that delusions are a risk factor for physical aggression in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease who have moderate to severe cognitive impairment. As delusions accounted for only a small percentage of the variance, further research is needed to identify other variables that may be significant predictors of physical aggression in this population. 
Management of complicated fractures involving the orbits and nasoethmoid complex in young children. This article presents some ideas and techniques for surgical reduction of complicated orbit and nasoethmoid complex fractures in young children. Operative techniques for surgical exposure and fracture reduction and fixation have evolved from standard facial incisions and wire fixation to complete exposure of the cranium and orbits via a bicoronal scalp flap, application of rigid plating techniques, and use of cranial bone grafts when necessary. This evolution of surgical techniques has been accompanied by an overall improvement in cosmetic and functional results. 
Postmenopausal estrogen therapy and cardiovascular disease. Ten-year follow-up from the nurses' health study BACKGROUND. The effect of postmenopausal estrogen therapy on the risk of cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Our 1985 report in the Journal, based on four years of follow-up, suggested that estrogen therapy reduced the risk of coronary heart disease, but a report published simultaneously from the Framingham Study suggested that the risk was increased. In addition, studies of the effect of estrogens on stroke have yielded conflicting results. METHODS. We followed 48,470 postmenopausal women, 30 to 63 years old, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, and who did not have a history of cancer or cardiovascular disease at base line. During up to 10 years of follow-up (337,854 person-years), we documented 224 strokes, 405 cases of major coronary disease (nonfatal myocardial infarctions or deaths from coronary causes), and 1263 deaths from all causes. RESULTS. After adjustment for age and other risk factors, the overall relative risk of major coronary disease in women currently taking estrogen was 0.56 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.80); the risk was significantly reduced among women with either natural or surgical menopause. We observed no effect of the duration of estrogen use independent of age. The findings were similar in analyses limited to women who had recently visited their physicians (relative risk, 0.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.66) and in a low-risk group that excluded women reporting current cigarette smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or a Quetelet index above the 90th percentile (relative risk, 0.53; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.91). The relative risk for current and former users of estrogen as compared with those who had never used it was 0.89 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.00) for total mortality and 0.72 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.95) for mortality from cardiovascular disease. The relative risk of stroke when current users were compared with those who had never used estrogen was 0.97 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.45), with no marked differences according to type of stroke. CONCLUSIONS. Current estrogen use is associated with a reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease as well as in mortality from cardiovascular disease, but it is not associated with any change in the risk of stroke. 
The short test of mental status. Correlations with standardized psychometric testing. The Short Test of Mental Status can be administered to patients in inpatient and outpatient settings in approximately 5 minutes, and it contains items that test orientation, attention, immediate recall, arithmetic, abstraction, construction, information, and delayed (approximately 3 minutes) recall. The test was administered to a group of demented community patients and their age- and sex-matched control subjects. Using an age-adjusted approach, sensitivity of the test to identifying dementia is 86.4, with a specificity of 93.5. The test was compared with standardized tests of cognitive function such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Mattis Dementia Scale, and the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and showed a high degree of correlation. Group means and standard deviations for subtest items and total score are presented for control subjects (n = 138), demented patients (n = 130), and patients with memory impairment only (n = 20). Percentile scores for subtest items in control subjects are also provided. 
Relationship of echocardiographic, shunt flow, and angiographic size to the stretched diameter of the atrial septal defect. Stretched diameter of the atrial septal defect (ASD), measured by balloon sizing, is generally used as a guide to the selection of the size of the device utilized for transcatheter closure of the ASD. Balloon sizing is a cumbersome procedure and sometimes requires the use of very large size balloon catheters. Several methods of assessment of ASD size, namely, echographic, pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (Qp:Qs), and angiographic measures, were undertaken in a group of 16 patients, aged 7 months to 45 years (median, 4.5 years), who were being evaluated for transcatheter closure of ASD; the results were compared with the stretched diameter. Although the echographic size of the ASD (9.9 +/- 4.1 mm, mean +/- SD) is similar (p greater than 0.1) to the angiographic size (7.9 +/- 2.5 mm), it is much smaller (p less than 0.01) than the stretched diameter (16.1 +/- 5.3 mm). When the relationship between various measures of ASD was examined, although the Qp:Qs ratio and angiographic size have a significant (p less than 0.05) correlation with the stretched diameter (r = 0.55 and 0.54, respectively), the echo diameter has the best correlation coefficient, r = 0.82, p less than 0.001. The stretched diameter can be estimated by the equation: 1.05 x echo + 5.49 mm. It is concluded that the echographic diameter is a useful adjunct in the estimation of the stretch ASD diameter, which in turn can be used in the selection of the size of the device for transcatheter occlusion of the ASD. 
Pattern of cell kinetics in colorectal mucosa of patients with different types of adenomatous polyps of the large bowel. It is generally accepted that adenomatous polyps represent the natural precursor of many colorectal malignancies. The sequence, however, which leads from a normally appearing mucosa to cancer is complex and involves many steps, including a hyperproliferative mucosa with an upward expansion of the replicative compartment. The current study evaluates cell replication in normal colorectal mucosa of patients with adenomatous polyps of various types and relates the observed findings to the main clinical and morphologic features of adenomas. Forty-four patients with polyps and 27 controls entered the study. Samples of colorectal mucosa were taken at endoscopy and cell replication was evaluated with a standard autoradiographic procedure. Cell replication was expressed as labeling index (LI), in the whole crypt and in each of the five longitudinal compartments in which the crypts were divided. Total LI and LI per crypt compartment were significantly higher (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.01, respectively) than in controls. There was no appreciable difference of LI values between patients with single or multiple, tubular or tubulovillous, small or large adenomas, but in all of these subgroups LI was significantly higher than in controls. In conclusion, in normally appearing colorectal mucosa of patients with adenomatous polyps there was a significant increase of cell replication and a marked upward expansion of the proliferative zone; these changes were more evident in the left colon and in the rectum. Finally, cell replication did not seem to be related to the number of polyps, to the most common histotypes, or to the pattern of recurrence. 
A new manifestation and treatment alternative for heparin-induced thrombosis. We treated a coronary artery bypass patient whose postoperative course was complicated by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and resultant pulmonary artery and saphenous vein graft thromboses. The pulmonary thromboemboli were found first, and pulmonary blood flow was restored with intravenously administered tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). A short time later, the vein grafts were found to be occluded, and we subsequently performed multivessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) using tPA as an adjuvant to oral warfarin sodium therapy with excellent results. We conclude that heparin-induced thromboses in the pulmonary arteries are amenable to thrombolytic therapy, including tPA, whereas this regimen appears to have little effect on saphenous vein grafts. We also found that a combination of warfarin and thrombolytic therapy is an alternative regimen for heparin-intolerant patients who require PTCA. 
Blood glucose control and albuminuria in type 1 diabetes mellitus. The relationship between long-term blood glucose control and albuminuria in type 1 diabetes was investigated in 42 male and 58 female patients who had had diabetes mellitus for more than 7 years. Their mean (+/- SD) age and diabetes duration were 18.6 +/- 3.6 and 12.1 +/- 3.5 years, respectively. For periods of observation ranging from 1 to 6 years (mean 4.4 +/- 1.5), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured two to six times yearly (mean of 8.8 +/- 3.9 determinations per patient). Albumin excretion rate (AER) was measured in single-void urine samples two to four times in 93 patients and once in the other seven patients. The 52 patients with mean HbA1c no more than 9.0% had significantly lower mean AER than those whose HbA1c was greater than 9.0% (20.1 +/- 24.6 vs 265 +/- 1005 mg/gm Cr, p less than 0.001). Only five (9.6%) of these 52 patients had elevated AER values (greater than 40 mg/gm Cr), whereas 21 (43.7%) of 48 patients whose mean HbA1c was greater than 9.0% had elevated AER values (p less than 0.001). Six male but no female patients had mean AER values greater than 300 mg/gm Cr. The 74 patients with normal AER had significantly lower mean HbA1c values than the 26 with elevated AER (8.6 +/- 1.5 vs 10.1 +/- 1.6%, p less than 0.001). These results support the contention that maintenance of HbA1c levels at no more than 9% (one and one-half times the upper limit of normal) will significantly decrease the likelihood that diabetic nephropathy will develop. 
Massive cystic ureteral diverticula in infancy. We report 2 cases of massive abdominal distension due to a mid ureteral diverticulum. In a 1-year-old boy the mid ureteral diverticulum was associated with an atrophied chronically scarred kidney. In a female newborn the diverticulum was associated with an upper pole ureter of a completely duplicated system. To our knowledge this type of ureteral diverticulum has not been reported previously. 
Neuronal and glial properties of a murine transgenic retinoblastoma model. Antigenic properties of a murine transgenic model for hereditary retinoblastoma, induced by a chimeric gene coding for Simian virus 40 large T antigen, an oncogene that inactivates the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product, were studied by immunohistochemistry. All transgenic mice develop bilateral intraocular retinal tumors in the inner nuclear layer with Homer Wright-like rosettes, and one quarter develop midbrain tumors resembling trilateral retinoblastoma. Cell lines TE-1 and TM-1 were established from intraocular and metastatic tumors, respectively. Intraocular tumors reacted with antibodies to neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin, while vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic, and S-100 proteins were detected only in reactive glia derived from adjacent retina. The midbrain tumors showed weak reactivity to synaptophysin, and they blended with reactive astrocytes positive for glial markers. The tumors were negative for cytokeratins. Finally both derived cell lines expressed synaptophysin and individual neurofilament triplet proteins in immunofluorescence and Western blotting, supporting their essentially neuronal nature. The antigenic profile resembles human retinoblastoma, but differences in morphology and antigen distribution suggest a more close relationship to neurons of the inner nuclear layer than to photoreceptor cells. 
Quantitation of early myocardial ischemia using acridine orange fluorescence--an experimental study. It has been observed in the present investigation that ischemic myocardium consistently produces bright green fluorescence after Acridine Orange (AO) staining. The area of ischemia in the left ventricular myocardium at different time intervals after onset of experimental ischemia has been calculated by use of this AO fluorescence technique. Zonal distribution of ischemia in the epicardial, middle, and endocardial zones has also been evaluated quantitatively from ten minutes to six hours after ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery in the Wistar strain of albino rats. No similar study was available for comparison from the literature reviewed. The total area of left ventricular ischemia showed an increase with the prolongation of duration of coronary ligation from 13.39 +/- 2.69 mm2 at ten to twenty-five minutes to 32.99 +/- 5.69 mm2 at six hours after ligation. Statistical analysis of the zonal area of ischemia has shown that ischemia in the middle and endocardial zones was greater than that in the epicardial zone at all time intervals recorded. Middle zone ischemia extended over a larger area than that over the endocardial zone at all intervals except at intervals II (30-45 min), IV (2-2 1/2 hrs) and V (3-4 hrs). The results of this experimental investigation are significant for these point to the value of Acridine Orange fluorescence in detecting early myocardial ischemia and in demarcating zonal differences in ischemia. The authors have successfully utilized the method in a few human cases of clinically suspected myocardial infarction and recommend the technique for routine use to detect early human myocardial ischemia. 
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome Four cases of T-cell lymphoma occurring in the setting of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been reported previously. We describe a 46-year-old man with AIDS in whom a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with lymph node involvement developed. Immunohistochemical staining of the skin revealed the lymphoid infiltrate to be CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and T-cell antigen receptor alpha/beta positive. Co-infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I was not detected by polymerase chain reaction. Human immunodeficiency virus infection may have contributed to the development of this patient's lymphoma. This case represents the rare occurrence of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and AIDS. 
The hemodynamic effects of intubation during nitroglycerin infusion in severe preeclampsia. The effectiveness of intravenous nitroglycerin infusion in lowering maternal blood pressure and in blunting the hemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation was evaluated in six primigravid women with severe preeclampsia. Monitoring consisted of continuous electrocardiogram monitoring, arterial cannulation, and flow-directed pulmonary arterial catheterization in each patient. All patients underwent oxytocin induction of labor and crystalloid and/or colloid expansion to produce a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10 to 15 mm Hg and a colloid osmotic pressure of greater than 17 mm Hg. Intravenous nitroglycerin was administered before induction of general anesthesia. The hemodynamic effects associated with endotracheal intubation revealed a change in the heart rate from 104 +/- 10 to 133 +/- 17 beats/min, an increase in mean arterial pressure from 134 +/- 12 to 164 +/- 32 mm Hg, and an increase in systemic vascular resistance from 1262 +/- 342 to 1351 +/- 259 dynes-sec-cm-5 that was accompanied by a small change in the cardiac index from 4.5 +/- 1.2 to 4.5 +/- 0.9 L.min-1.m-2. 
Malignant prolactinomas. Six cases of malignant prolactinoma have been reported; an additional two cases are presented here and the literature is reviewed. Diagnosis rests upon evidence of metastasis rather than histological criteria per se. Cases have arisen from known adenomas, particularly the invasive type. Bromocriptine is a useful palliative. The features and treatment of malignant prolactinoma are discussed. 
Evaluation of extracranial-to-intracranial bypass surgery using iodine 123 iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography. Eleven patients with occlusive cerebrovascular diseases were imaged with N-isopropyl-p-I-123 iodoamphetamine. Preoperative and postoperative single-photon emission computed tomography was performed in 10 patients undergoing extracranial-to-intracranial bypass procedures. New images were reconstructed from the two images obtained on the different days by superimposition and division in each pixel to get the ratio of cerebral perfusion change. All patients with bypass procedures had an increase in cerebral blood flow in the affected areas, and nine of 10 had an increase in cerebral blood flow in the contralateral cortex. There was no increase in cerebral blood flow in one case with no operation. Neither our procedure nor the results in this small series prove that recovery of function is due to an increase in blood flow, but we believe this is the case. 
Laser balloon angioplasty: clinical, angiographic and histologic results. Laser balloon angioplasty combines conventional coronary angioplasty with laser energy to transiently heat vascular tissue. Laser balloon angioplasty, was performed in 21 patients (aged 56 +/- 13 years), including 10 patients treated urgently after acute failure of conventional angioplasty and 11 patients treated with elective laser balloon angioplasty. Immediately after conventional angioplasty, laser doses (1 to 10 doses of 205 to 380 J each) were delivered during inflation of the laser balloon to a pressure of 4 atm. Seven (70%) of 10 patients with acute failure of conventional angioplasty were successfully treated with laser balloon angioplasty, but 3 (30%) were unsuccessfully treated with the laser procedure and required emergency coronary artery bypass surgery. In all three failures, the 3 mm laser balloon angioplasty catheter was not the optimal size for the vessel. In the 11 patients treated with elective laser balloon angioplasty (reference diameter 2.94 +/- 0.22 mm), the minimal luminal diameter increased from 0.45 +/- 0.25 to 1.85 +/- 0.46 mm after conventional angioplasty and to 2.44 +/- 0.29 mm after laser balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001). This corresponded to a decrease in diameter stenosis from 84 +/- 9% before to 35 +/- 16% after conventional angioplasty and to 15 +/- 10% after laser balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001). There were no instances of myocardial infarction, emergency coronary artery bypass surgery or death and no acute complications related to delivery of laser energy in this group. Follow-up coronary angiography was performed 5.5 +/- 1.1 months after laser balloon angioplasty in 18 patients discharged from the hospital after a successful procedure. Ten patients (56%) had angiographic restenosis, defined as recurrent diameter stenosis greater than 50%. Six patients were subsequently treated by directional coronary atherectomy, which revealed intimal proliferation indistinguishable from that in patients with restenosis after conventional angioplasty. In conclusion, laser balloon angioplasty may be effective in sealing severe coronary dissections and reversing abrupt closure associated with failed conventional angioplasty. After uncomplicated conventional angioplasty, laser balloon angioplasty improves immediate luminal dimensions, but restenosis appears to be mediated by intimal hyperplasia, similar to that seen after conventional angioplasty. 
Laser cordectomy for T1 glottic carcinoma: a 10-year experience and videostroboscopic findings. Fifty-three patients underwent laser cordectomy for T1 glottic squamous cell carcinoma between January 1980 and December 1989--sixteen after having undergone unsuccessful radiation and thirty-seven who had no previous treatment. There was a 51% five-year cure rate in the irradiated group vs. 62% in the nonirradiated group. Extension of tumor to the anterior commissure resulted in a higher failure rate. Patients experienced an overall 5-year cure rate of 98% after surgical or radiation salvage of unsuccessful laser cordectomies. Six patients had preoperative and postoperative videostrobolaryngoscopy. The most common postoperative problem with voice was a breathiness that did not resolve in any of the patients. All patients had absent or moderately reduced amplitude and mucosal wave patterns and imcomplete glottic closure proportional to the amount of cordal tissue removed. Despite it seemingly poor results in carefully selected patients, laser cordectomy is still indicated without compromising the ultimate oncologic results. Advantages over radiation therapy or conservation laryngeal surgery include a short treatment time, requiring only an outpatient surgical procedure at the time of the initial diagnostic and/or staging laryngoscopy, and the avoidance of potential radiation side effects or surgical complications. However, patients should be advised the possibility of persistent postoperative breathy dysphonia, in addition to the possibility of further treatment to effect a long-term cure. 
North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. Methods, patient characteristics, and progress. Fifty North American centers have combined to evaluate the benefit of carotid endarterectomy in randomized patients who have experienced symptoms related to arteriosclerotic stenosis of the carotid artery and who have received either best medical therapy alone or best medical therapy plus carotid endarterectomy. The outcome events are nonfatal and fatal stroke or death. A three-tier system identifies and adjudicates the type, severity, and location of each stroke and the cause of any death. Data about patients submitted to carotid endarterectomy outside the trial are compiled at the Nonrandomized Data Center at the Mayo Clinic. Between December 27, 1987, and October 1, 1990, 1,212 patients were randomized, 596 to medical therapy, 616 to carotid endarterectomy. Cross-over from the medical to the surgical arm has been low (4.2%). Patients eligible for the trial, but not randomized totaled 1,044; their characteristics were similar to those randomized so that, for the type of symptomatic patient in this study, our conclusions about the benefit of carotid endarterectomy can be generalized. Patients excluded by medical criteria totaled 679. Another 1,591 had carotid endarterectomy, but either lacked the disease under study, were asymptomatic, or received inadequate investigation to meet entry criteria. We set sample size at 1,900 patients, with continuing enrollment. The Monitoring Committee reviews at intervals the confidential analyses performed on the groups with moderate (30-69%) and severe (70-99%) stenosis. Stopping rules will be invoked for one or both groups if unequivocal benefit or harm is identified. 
Continuous automated monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials in posttraumatic coma. Using a microcomputer system, 36 patients were continuously monitored with somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) following closed head injury. The mean duration of monitoring was five days. The patients' GCS scores at the start of monitoring ranged from 3-10. Mortality was 44%. Of 14 patients who had initial absence of SSEP activity after the N20 wave or lost this activity during the period of monitoring, 12 died and two remained vegetative. Eighteen of 22 patients who had preservation or enhancement of this activity had a functional survival (3-month outcomes, p less than 0.001). The best outcomes were observed in the patients with the greatest number of peaks and highest amplitudes in the SSEPs, often in spite of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The management of three patients was altered as a result of SSEP monitoring. We conclude that continuous monitoring of SSEPs is a useful adjunct in the management of comatose head-injured patients. 
Prostate specific antigen after irradiation for prostatic carcinoma. The clinical significance of serum prostate specific antigen after primary irradiation for adenocarcinoma of the prostate is uncertain. Between September 1986 and December 1987 serial prostate specific antigen values were determined in 43 patients before and after definitive radiation therapy. The study group included 6 patients with stage T0d, 10 with stage T1, 11 with stage T2 and 16 with stage T3 disease, with a mean pre-treatment prostate specific antigen level of 49.2 +/- 10.8. For all patients the first post-treatment prostate specific antigen level was less than the pre-treatment level. One patient failed locally with recurrent prostatic cancer that invaded the rectum. The 6 patients who failed with symptomatic metastases had an increasing prostate specific antigen level 2 to 7 months before detection of recurrence. Based on the absolute value and trend of the prostate specific antigen, patients were described as being at high, intermediate or low risk for distant metastases. Of 9 high, 6 intermediate and 28 low risk patients 4 (44%), 2 (33%) and 0 (0%) have experienced recurrent disease (p = 0.0025). We conclude that serial post-irradiation prostate specific antigen values may be useful in the early identification of patients at risk for treatment failure. 
Complications of infection and immunologic status after surgery for patients with esophageal cancer. Correlations between defective cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and infections following surgery for esophageal cancer were evaluated. Peripheral lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, PHA transformation, and PPD skin test were measured in 81 patients with esophageal cancer, 58 with gastric cancer, and 50 healthy controls. The depression of CMI was predominant to a similar extent in patients with esophageal cancer and in those with gastric cancer. The average level of PHA transformation immediately before surgery was significantly lower in the esophageal cancer patients with fatal septic complications than in those without such problems. Although preoperative radiation therapy markedly depressed the levels of the four parameters, this association was also noted in 28 patients not given radiation. It thus appears that PHA transformation may be valuable in the prediction of fatal septic complications after major surgery in patients with esophageal cancer. 
Evidence from cadavers suggestive of entrapment of fifth lumbar spinal nerves by lumbosacral ligaments. Lumbosacral spines from 51 geriatric-age cadavers (25 men and 26 women) were examined both grossly and under the dissecting microscope for evidence of compression of fifth lumbar spinal nerves by their respective lumbosacral ligaments. These ligaments were found to extend from the transverse process and body of L5 to the ala of the sacrum in 97% of the specimens, and from the transverse process and body of L5 to the promontory of the sacrum in 3% of the specimens. Anterior primary rami of the fifth lumbar spinal nerve were observed to be compressed in 11% (11 of 102) of the specimens examined grossly and under the dissecting microscope. Histologic evidence of chronic compression, as suggested by perineurial and endoneurial fibrosis, peripheral thinning of myelin sheaths, or subjective evidence of a shift in fiber diameter to a population of smaller size fibers was found, deep to the lumbosacral ligament, in three of the 11 nerves judged to be compressed. The information derived is of interest to the clinician whose patient presents with L5 root signs and a myelogram, discogram, and computed tomographic scan which do not show any abnormality. The possibility of extraforaminal compression must be considered as a possible source of the clinical signs. 
The use of transdermal scopolamine to control drooling. A case report. Drooling is a serious social handicap experienced by some neurologically impaired patients. No one method has been identified to control drooling for all patients, however, anticholinergic drugs recently have been utilized. In the case study described, transdermal scopolamine patches were found to be effective for controlling drooling in a traumatic brain-injured patient for whom more conservative methods failed. From a baseline saliva flow rate, saliva flow decreased an average of 30% with one-patch and 59% with two-patch dosing. No significant side effects were observed with treatment, and the decrease in drooling was maintained for a 4-month period. Although transdermal scopolamine may represent one acceptable facet of long-term treatment, it must be stressed that efficacy is variable across patient populations and that treatment approaches must be individualized. 
Gastric collision tumor (carcinoid and adenocarcinoma) with gastritis cystica profunda. We report a rare case of gastric collision tumor (carcinoid and adenocarcinoma) with gastritis cystica profunda that developed in a 49-year-old Japanese man. Early gastric cancer (moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma) was present at the edge of an ulcer in the posterior wall of the upper gastric body. In addition, a carcinoid tumor was found adjacent to adenocarcinoma. This tumor displayed ribbonlike or trabecular patterns, and numerous constituent cells were positive for the argyrophil reaction with Grimelius' stain and serotonin. Electron microscopic features of this tumor confirmed typical carcinoid. There was no merged appearance between both tumors, suggesting collision-type tumor. 
Neopterin and interferon-gamma in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HIV-associated neurologic disease. We measured the levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and neopterin in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of 121 human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive (HIV+) and 62-seronegative (HIV-) individuals evaluated for neurologic disease. CSF levels of IFN-gamma and serum and CSF levels of neopterin were higher in HIV+ than in HIV- individuals. Patients with HIV- related meningitis and with opportunistic CNS infections had higher serum neopterin levels than HIV+ asymptomatic individuals. CSF levels of IFN-gamma were slightly higher in CSF of HIV+ individuals in all groups (0.31 +/- 0.03 U/ml) than in HIV- individuals (0.12 +/- 0.03). CSF levels of neopterin were similar in HIV+ asymptomatic individuals (6.9 +/- 0.7 nmol/l) and HIV- individuals (5.9 +/- 1.1), but were elevated in those HIV-infected individuals with neurologic disease, particularly patients with HIV-associated meningitis (72.1 +/- 13.3 nmol/l), opportunistic CNS infections (36 +/- 9.1), and inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (32.4 +/- 17.2). Levels of neopterin correlated positively with levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor and soluble CD8, 2 additional indicators of immune activation. In the absence of neurologic disease, levels of IFN-gamma and neopterin in both serum and CSF were stable for up to 4 years after seroconversion. These data suggest that increased CSF neopterin is associated with HIV-associated neurologic disease. 
Serum immunoglobulin G subclasses in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. We studied serum concentrations of IgG subclasses in 47 human immunodeficiency virus 1-infected (17 asymptomatic and 30 symptomatic) children. Thirty-nine of 47 (83%) had an abnormality of at least 1 subclass. Sixteen had only elevated IgG1, 6 had only elevated IgG3 and 12 had elevated IgG1 and IgG3 concentrations. IgG2, IgG4 and combined IgG2-IgG4 deficiency was found in 3, 4 and 4 patients, respectively. IgG2 concentrations did not differ between patients with (n = 23) or without (n = 24) bacterial infections. Additionally the number of bacterial infections was similar between the patients with normal or low IgG2 and/or low IgG4. These data indicate that IgG subclass abnormalities are found in most children with human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection, but quantitative deficiencies of specific subclasses do not appear to explain the high frequency of bacterial infections occurring in these patients. 
The bladder cooling test for urodynamic assessment: analysis of 400 examinations. The clinical significance of the bladder cooling test as one part of a standard urodynamic examination was studied in 375 consecutive patients and 25 controls. Inability to perceive cold sensation in the bladder was common in cases of neurogenic lesions and present in nearly half of the patients with outlet obstruction, some with no urodynamic abnormalities and some of the normal subjects. The bladder contractions provoked by the test were clearly associated with detrusor overactivity, as in those patients with upper motor neuron lesions of motor urgency, but 27% of such patients showed no response. In 7 cases the iced water provoked detrusor contractions when cystometry showed no overactivity. This clinical series confirms that the cold receptors found recently in animal experiments are also present in the human urinary bladder. The bladder cooling test is not an alternative to cystometry, but its inclusion as an integral part of the urodynamic examination seems to be useful, especially in cases where there is also a need to study the sensibility of the bladder at the same time. 
Choroideremia and deafness with stapes fixation: a contiguous gene deletion syndrome in Xq21. The study of contiguous gene deletion syndromes by using reverse genetic techniques provides a powerful tool for precisely defining the map location of the genes involved. We have made use of individuals with overlapping deletions producing choroideremia as part of a complex phenotype, to define the boundaries on the X chromosome for this gene, as well as for X-linked mixed deafness with perilymphatic gusher (DFN3). Two patients with deletions and choroideremia are affected by an X-linked mixed conductive/sensorineural deafness; one patient, XL-62, was confirmed at surgery to have DFN3, while the other patient, XL-45, is suspected clinically to have the same disorder. A third choroideremia deletion patient, MBU, has normal hearing. Patient XL-62 has a cytogenetically detectable deletion that was measured to be 7.7% of the X chromosome by dual laser flow cytometry; the other patient, XL-45, has a cytogenetically undetectable deletion that measures only 3.3% of the X chromosome. We have produced a physical map of the X-chromosome region containing choroideremia and DFN3 by using routine Southern blotting, chromosome walking and jumping techniques, and long-range restriction mapping to generate and link anonymous DNA sequences in this region. DXS232 and DXS233 are located within 450 kb of each other on the same SfiI and MluI fragments and share partial SalI fragments of 750 and greater than 1,000 kb but are separated by at least one SalI site. In addition, DXS232, which lies outside the MBU deletion, detects the proximal breakpoint of this deletion. We have isolated two new anonymous DNA sequences by chromosome jumping from DXS233; one of these detects a new SfiI fragment distal to DXS233 in the direction of the choroideremia gene, while the other jump clone is proximal to DXS233 and detects a new polymorphism. These data refine the map around the loci for choroideremia and for mixed deafness with stapes fixation and will provide points from which to isolate candidate gene sequences for these disorders. 
Mycobacterial infections after renal transplantation. Mycobacterial infections occurred in 11 of 633 (1.7 per cent) recipients of successful renal transplants. There were no cases of tuberculosis in patients receiving chemoprophylaxis, but amongst those who did not receive prophylaxis disease occurred in six of the 27 (22 per cent) high-risk patients. The major cause of morbidity during treatment was renal allograft rejection, largely due to reduction in immunosuppressive drug therapy. 
Facial reanimation after acoustic neuroma excision: the patient's perspective. Facial reanimation after acoustic neuroma excision is currently accomplished using a variety of surgical techniques. A multi-institutional survey of patient perceptions of facial reanimation success was accomplished by mailing a questionnaire to 809 randomly selected members of the Acoustic Neuroma Association. Four hundred sixty patients who underwent 296 reanimation procedures responded. Facial to hypoglossal nerve anastomosis, tarsorrhaphy, and upper eyelid implants were most frequently performed. The patient's estimations of initial deficit, spontaneous recovery, and overall satisfaction with the reanimation procedures are discussed. 
Successful shock-wave lithotripsy of bile duct stones using ultrasound guidance. Eighteen patients with 41 gallstones in the common bile duct, common hepatic, cystic, and intrahepatic ducts underwent shock-wave lithotripsy using the electrohydraulic Sonolith 3000 lithotripter. Lithotripsy was performed using ultrasound guidance alone under intravenous analgesia/sedation. All patients previously had failed stone extraction via retrograde endoscopy, T-tube, or cholecystostomy. Lithotripsy was performed according to an FDA-approved protocol allowing a maximum of two 2500 shock-wave treatments at a 48 hr interval. Following the final lithotripsy or cholangiographic evidence of stone fragmentation, residual fragments were removed via endoscopic or percutaneous route within 24-72 hr. Ultrasound localization of gallstones was aided by continuous infusion of the common bile duct with saline solution. In 15 of the 18 patients, complete fragmentation of the stones was accomplished, two had minimal fragmentation, and one with an encysted stone had no fracturing. No serious complications were encountered. Overall nonsurgical stone-free success rate was 17 of 18 patients, indicating biliary duct stones can be successfully treated using an ultrasound-guided lithotripter and intravenous sedation alone. 
Differentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells induced by the c-jun and activated c-Ha-ras oncogenes. The activated c-Ha-ras oncogene induced AP1-site DNA-binding activity in F9 cells. This induction appeared to be due, at least in part, to the induction of c-jun transcription. Both activated c-Ha-ras and c-jun induced the differentiation of F9 cells to endoderm-like cells. Thus, AP1 appears to play a key role in the initial stage of F9 cell differentiation. 
Pseudolymphoma of the parapharyngeal space. A case report of pseudolymphoma of the parapharyngeal space is presented, together with a literature review of pseudolymphoma and management suggestions for such lesions when they occur in the head and neck. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this represents the first case report of pseudolymphoma presenting within the parapharyngeal space. The key to management of these lesions is based on accurate diagnosis, with differentiation of pseudolymphoma from lymphocytic lymphoma, the disease process which it mimics. 
Effect of level of patient acuity on clinical decision making of critical care nurses with varying levels of knowledge and experience. This study is an examination of the effect of patient acuity on the clinical decision making of critical care nurses (N = 68) completing two computerized clinical simulations. Ventricular tachycardia represented the high-acuity situation and atrial flutter the lower-acuity situation. Clinical decision making was measured by proficiency score, patient outcome (cure or die), and amount of data collected. Analyses of variance were conducted to examine proficiency score and the amount of data collected. Fisher's exact test and the McNemar test of homogeneity of proportions were used to examine patient outcome. In the atrial flutter simulation, proficiency scores were higher (p = 0.000), more dysrhythmias were cured (p less than 0.005), and more data were collected (p = 0.040). Experienced and inexperienced nurses did not differ on proficiency score; however, inexperienced nurses collected more data (p = 0.048) and cured fewer atrial flutter simulations (p = 0.040). Nurses certified in advanced cardiac life support had higher proficiency scores (p = 0.033) and collected fewer data (p = 0.048). 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a patient with a cadaveric dural graft. We report a 26-year-old woman with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) who had received cadaveric dural material 33 months before the onset of neurologic symptoms. This is the fourth case in which a dural graft was the putative source of the CJD agent. All four cases had the grafting before changes in the sterilization procedure adopted in 1987 to inactivate the CJD agent. 
Intraoperative death during lumbar discectomy. A patient suffered cardiovascular collapse and died during surgery for prolapsed intervertebral disc. At postmortem a tear was found in the abdominal aorta. 
Flexible sigmoidoscopy screening for asymptomatic colorectal disease in patients with and without inguinal hernia. Several studies have evaluated the diagnostic value of flexible sigmoidoscopy for screening asymptomatic patients before hernia repair. All have shown a 16% to 28% incidence of neoplastic (malignant or premalignant) lesions. None of these studies compared a similar group of asymptomatic patients without hernia to determine whether the incidence is increased in patients with hernias. We reviewed 87 consecutive cases of male surgical patients without hernia or any anorectal disease who had flexible sigmoidoscopy between June 1986 and December 1989 (group 1) and compared them with a group of hernia patients that we previously reported (group 2). Patients with stool positive for occult blood were excluded from this study. Examinations in both groups were done under the direct supervision of an attending surgeon (W.W., C.S.C., or J.K.). No significant difference was noted between group 1 and group 2 in mean age (mean 65.6 vs 59.7 years), rate of normal findings (68% vs 63%), and incidence of neoplastic lesions (14% vs 22%). All patients tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications. 
The natural history of superficial femoral artery stenoses. Since the natural history of specific superficial femoral artery stenoses is not known, we examined progression rates of superficial femoral artery stenoses in 45 lower extremities found when arteriograms were obtained of 38 patients for symptomatic atherosclerotic disease in the opposite leg or abdomen. These initial superficial femoral artery arteriograms were compared with later arteriograms in 25 limbs, duplex scans in 27 limbs, and both modalities in 7 limbs. After a mean interval of 37 months, most superficial femoral artery stenoses (72%) did not progress. However, 12 superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed (28%; mean follow-up, 37 months, including 7 that occluded (17%). Superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed among patients who complained of symptom progression at a rate faster than that among asymptomatic patients (15.6%/year vs 3%/year; p = 0.006). Superficial femoral artery lesions also progressed more rapidly among patients whose contralateral superficial femoral artery was occluded (10%/year vs 1.6%/year; p = 0.04). By multivariate regression analysis, symptom progression and smoking history were predictive of superficial femoral artery stenosis progression. In the seven patients whose superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed to occlusion, the average rate of stenosis progression was 12%/year (maximum predicted rate, 30% per year by 95% confidence limit). These results indicate that superficial femoral artery stenoses usually progress with synchronous symptomatic deterioration. Other than symptom progression, only cumulative smoking history and contralateral superficial femoral artery occlusion could be associated with superficial femoral artery stenosis progression in this small series. 
Hyperglycemia and neurological outcome in patients with head injury. To examine the relationship between serum glucose and the outcome of patients suffering from head injury, the authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 169 patients admitted for treatment to Harborview Medical Center (a regional trauma center). All patients underwent craniotomy for evacuation of intracranial hematoma and/or placement of a subarachnoid bolt for intracranial pressure monitoring under general anesthesia. Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less had significantly higher serum glucose levels than patients with GCS scores of 12 to 15 (mean +/- standard error of the mean 192 +/- 7 mg/dl vs. 130 +/- 8 mg/dl or 10.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter vs. 7.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter) (p less than 0.0001). Patients who subsequently remained in a vegetative state or died had significantly higher glucose levels both on admission and postoperatively than patients who had good outcome or moderate disability (217 +/- 12 mg/dl vs. 167 +/- 6 mg/dl or 12.1 +/- 0.7 mmol/liter vs. 9.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter on admission, and 240 +/- 16 mg/dl vs. 156 +/- 5 mg/dl or 13.3 +/- 0.9 mmol/liter vs. 8.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter postoperatively) (p less than 0.0001). Among the more severely injured patients (GCS score less than or equal to 8), a serum glucose level greater than 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/liter) postoperatively is associated with a significantly worse outcome (p less than 0.01). The authors conclude that severely head-injured patients frequently develop hyperglycemia and the elevated serum glucose level may aggravate ischemic insults and worsen the neurological outcome in such patients. 
Human peripheral blood lymphocytes targeted with bispecific antibodies release cytokines that are essential for inhibiting tumor growth. We have compared the mechanisms by which human PBL targeted with bispecific antibodies either lyse tumor cells or block their growth in culture or in mice. We found that resting PBL were unable to mediate lysis, but were able to block tumor growth. Moreover, targeted PBL were unable to lyse bystander cells, whereas targeted PBL did block the growth of bystander tumor cells in culture and in nude mice. Supernatants from cultures of targeted PBL, or from PBL grown on anti-CD3-coated flasks, blocked the growth of tumor cells in the absence of added effector cells, and antibodies against TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma reversed the inhibition of tumor growth, but had no effect upon cytolysis mediated by targeted by PBL. Our results show that targeted human PBL mediate two different antitumor activities: lysis, which occurs rapidly and requires the direct attachment of the target cell to the cytotoxic cell, and tumor growth inhibition, which is mediated by cytokines released into the medium as a result of receptor cross-linking. The inhibition of bystander tumor growth in mice by targeted PBL suggests that factor release is sufficient to block tumor growth in vivo. Targeted factor release therefore provides a mechanism by which targeted PBL could block the growth of tumor cells in vivo that were not bound by the effector cells, but which were located in the vicinity of tumor cells that were bound. 
Digital artery embolization as a result of fibromuscular dysplasia of the brachial artery. A 74-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with sudden onset of a blue, painful right index finger, and the condition progressed to digital ulceration. The ulcer gradually healed over a period of 2 months. Peripheral pulses, Doppler-derived brachial and radial systolic pressures, and results of an echocardiogram were normal. Digital pulse volume recordings showed obstructive waveforms in all digits of the right hand. Arteriography showed a normal arch and normal innominate, subclavian, and axillary arteries. The midbrachial artery was markedly abnormal and had alternating areas of stenosis and aneurysm formation. Multiple occlusions involved the palmar arch and proper digital arteries. The abnormal brachial artery segment was excised and replaced with an autogenous reversed saphenous-vein conduit. Histologic examination confirmed the lesion to be medial fibromuscular dysplasia. Fibromuscular dysplasia that involves upper extremity arteries is extremely uncommon and rarely presents with digital artery embolization. This case emphasizes the importance of exclusion of proximal reconstructible arterial occlusive disease by means of complete arteriographic examination of patients who were admitted with unilateral finger or hand ischemia. 
Intracranial hemorrhage and hemophilia: case report and management guidelines. Hemophiliacs, as a result of low coagulation factor levels, may suffer spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. A case of intracranial hemorrhage in a hemophiliac patient with a history of intravenous drug abuse and HIV infection is reported. Factor replacement, airway management, and risks of HIV exposure to emergency department personnel are discussed. 
Cerebral sparganosis: case report and review. Sparganosis is a rare infection caused by a tapeworm larva from the genus Spirometra. A 21-year-old Indian man presented with an 18-month history of episodic confusion followed by a grand mal seizure. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed the presence of a lesion of the left occipital lobe. Subsequent stereotactic biopsy revealed a plerocercoid larva or sparganum. Surgical resection resulted in cure. This case prompted a review of the literature on central nervous system sparganosis. Altogether, 17 other cases of primary cerebral sparganosis have been reported previously. Seizures, headache, and focal neurologic signs are common at presentation. Neuroradiologic imaging is sensitive but not specific for the identification of lesions. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of cerebrospinal fluid or serum may be diagnostically helpful. However, the diagnosis is generally made after surgical resection, which is usually curative. 
An unusual complication of high dose infusion computerized tomography in a patient with a continent diversion. We describe a myelodysplastic woman with a Kock continent ileal reservoir who suffered parastomal herniation of the pouch following high dose infusion computerized tomography. Prophylactic indwelling catheterization in patients with continent diversion undergoing procedures that induce significant diuresis or involve prolonged distension of the reservoir is probably indicated. 
Analysis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia for the presence of human papillomavirus DNA. We have analyzed a number of invasive squamous cell carcinomas for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA using dot blot and Southern blot analysis. Seven of 31 samples (23%) were positive by dot blot and/or Southern blot analysis. In contrast, six of 11 (55%) of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias contained HPV DNA by dot blot and/or Southern blot hybridization. Less than 50% of the invasive vulvar carcinomas contained detectable HPV DNA. The average age at onset of vulvar carcinoma is higher than that for cervical carcinoma (in which HPV DNA is detected in over 80% of cases). Therefore, the role of HPV in the genesis of vulvar carcinoma may be different from the role of HPV in the genesis of cervical carcinoma. 
Familial nemaline myopathy: case reports. Two siblings of two generations in the same family with nemaline myopathy are described. The disease affects all skeletal muscles, especially the facial muscles, producing a typical facial appearance. The diagnosis was made by light microscopy of histologically stained sections of muscle biopsy. The disease in our patients seems to be transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. The purpose of this article is to emphasize the importance of recognition of the facial appearance by maxillofacial surgeons and the appropriate referral of patients for further neurologic examination. 
Failure of motor evoked potentials to predict neurologic outcome in experimental thoracic aortic occlusion. Motor evoked potential monitoring was tested as an alternative to somatosensory evoked potential monitoring in evaluating spinal cord function during thoracic aortic occlusion in dogs. Twenty-seven animals underwent 60 minutes of cross-clamping of the proximal descending thoracic aorta with (n = 18) or without (n = 9) cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Spinal cord blood flow was measured with microspheres, and neurologic outcome was evaluated at 24 hours with Tarlov's scoring system. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage improved neurologic outcome (p less than 0.05). Motor evoked potentials recorded over the lumbar spinal cord were lost in 9 of 20 dogs with ischemic cord injury and were not lost in any of the 7 dogs that were neurologically normal. Somatosensory evoked potential were lost in 19 of 20 paraplegic/paraparetic dogs and lost in 3 of 7 normal dogs (p less than 0.01). After reperfusion, motor evoked potentials returned in all nine neurologically injured dogs that lost the potentials and were still present at 24 hours. Changes in amplitude, latency, or time until loss or return of motor evoked potentials or somatosensory evoked potentials did not predict neurologic injury. Loss of somatosensory evoked potentials had a high sensitivity (95%) but had low specificity (67%) because of peripheral nerve ischemia. Loss of motor evoked potentials recorded from the spinal cord had high specificity (100%) but a low sensitivity (46%) and was therefore not a reliable predictor of neurologic injury. Return of motor evoked potentials during reperfusion did not correlate with functional recovery. Motor evoked potentials stimulated in the cortex and recorded from the spinal cord had low overall accuracy (59%). 
Snoring and the risk of ischemic brain infarction. To determine if a history of snoring is a risk factor for brain infarction, I conducted a case-control study of risk factors for ischemic stroke using 177 consecutive male patients aged 16-60 (mean 49) years with acute brain infarction. For each patient I chose an age-matched (+/- 6 years) male control. Arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, snoring (habitually or often), and heavy drinking (greater than 300 g/wk) were risk factors in the stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio of snoring for brain infarction was 2.13. By McNemar's test this association increased strongly if a history of sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, and obesity were all present with snoring (odds ratio 8.00). My study indicates that snoring may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke, possibly because of the higher prevalence of an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome among snorers than nonsnorers. 
Mechanisms of disruption of the articular cartilage surface in inflammation. Neutrophil elastase increases availability of collagen type II epitopes for binding with antibody on the surface of articular cartilage. We recently observed that specific antibodies to type II collagen do not bind in appreciable amounts to the intact surface of articular cartilage, whereas antibodies to the minor collagen types V, VI, and IX do. These results suggest that the outermost cartilage surface layer prevented interaction of the antibodies with the major collagen type in articular cartilage. The present studies were designed to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms involved in the disruption of the cartilage surface layer in inflammatory arthritis. Articular cartilage obtained from rabbits undergoing acute antigen-induced arthritis of 72 h duration showed a significant increase in binding of anti-type II antibody to cartilage surfaces compared with normal control cartilage (P less than 0.01). Augmentation of anti-type II binding was also observed upon in vitro incubation of bovine articular slices or intact rabbit patellar cartilage for 1 h with human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), PMN lysates, or purified human PMN elastase. This increase was not inhibited by sodium azide, nor was it enhanced by incubation of cartilage with the strong oxidant hypochlorous acid. Chondrocyte-mediated matrix proteoglycan degradation in cartilage explants cultured in the presence of cytokines failed to increase antibody binding appreciably. The augmentation in antibody binding seen with PMN lysates was inhibited by the nonspecific serine-esterase inhibitor PMSF, but not by the divalent metal chelator EDTA. The elastase-specific inhibitor AAPVCMK also inhibited most of the PMN-induced increase in antibody binding, whereas the cathepsin G-specific inhibitor GLPCMK was much less effective. Incubation of intact cartilage with purified human PMN elastase indicated that this serine esterase could account for the increase in anti-type II collagen antibody binding to intact cartilage surfaces. These studies suggest that in an inflammatory response, PMN-derived elastase degrades the outer layer of articular cartilage, exposing epitopes on type II collagen. They also help clarify the pathogenic mechanisms involved in early articular cartilage damage in inflammatory joint diseases. 
Duplex sonography in splenomegaly. The aetiology of splenomegaly is seldom clear from either clinical or imaging assessment of the spleen. In the majority of cases sonographic assessment of the spleen produces a homogeneous enlargement of variable echodensity, but with very poor correlation with pathology. A study has been undertaken to assess the Doppler characteristics of the splenic artery in splenomegaly, excluding cases of portal hypertension in an attempt to provide further diagnostic information. Duplex assessment of 18 normal subjects and 10 patients with splenomegaly due to five different causes was undertaken. Analysis of waveform, peak frequency and pulsatility index were compared and failed to demonstrate any significant change. In the normal subject there is a broad systolic spectrum related to the tortuosity of the splenic artery, with persistence of forward flow throughout diastole, a reflection of the low peripheral resistance of the spleen. In splenomegaly the broad systolic spectrum is unchanged, since vessel tortuosity persists. Pathological and physiological assessment of the spleen in splenomegaly shows that a low resistance circulation persists, explaining maintenance of the diastolic flow pattern in splenomegaly. Increased blood flow to the spleen in splenomegaly occurs either as a result of an increase in vessel diameter or an increase in flow velocity, or a variable combination of the two which does not seem to be governed by specific pathology. An increase in peak frequency in some cases reflected some increase in flow velocity but provided no useful correlation. Analysis of the pulsatility index supported the above findings without adding further information. 
Reflex anal dilatation: effect of parting the buttocks on anal function in normal subjects and patients with anorectal and spinal disease. Anal dilatation in response to gentle parting of the buttocks has been advocated as a sign of sexual abuse in children, but nothing is known of the physiology of this response or its existence in normal subjects, in patients with spinal disease, and in patients with a weak sphincter and whether it can be elicited after training. To answer these questions we investigated the effect of parting the buttocks on anal function. Combined anal manometry and electromyography was conducted in six normal subjects (five men, one woman, aged 19-53 years), in 18 patients with faecal incontinence (three men, 15 women, aged 30-80 years), and in seven paraplegic patients (six men, one woman, aged 25-36 years), in four of whom the posterior sacral roots had been cut. Parting the buttocks in normal subjects reduced the pressure in the anal canal from 102 (20) to 14 (3) cm H2O (mean (SEM), p less than 0.00001), but did not cause the anus to gape. This drop in pressure was associated with increased electrical activity in the external anal sphincter. Normal subjects could consciously relax the external anal sphincter and reduce the anal pressure but not so as to result in anal gaping during traction on the buttocks, even after anal dilatation. Stimulation of the anal lining by moving a probe in and out of the anal canal increased the activity of the external anal sphincter, raising anal pressures. Paraplegic patients who had lost conscious control of their external sphincters showed anal gaping when the buttocks were parted. 
Maple syrup urine disease in Mennonites. Evidence that the Y393N mutation in E1 alpha impedes assembly of the E1 component of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) in Mennonites is associated with homozygosity for a T to A transversion in the E1 alpha gene of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. This causes a tyrosine to asparagine substitution at position 393 (Y393N). To assess the functional significance of this missense mutation, we have carried out transfection studies using E1 alpha-deficient MSUD lymphoblasts (Lo) as a host. The level of E1 beta subunit is also greatly reduced in Lo cells. Efficient episomal expression in lymphoblasts was achieved using the EBO vector. The inserts employed were chimeric bovine-human cDNAs which encode mitochondrial import competent E1 alpha subunit precursors. Transfection with normal E1 alpha cDNA into Lo cells restored decarboxylation activity of intact cells. Western blotting showed that both E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits were markedly increased. Introduction of Y393N mutant E1 alpha cDNA failed to produce any measurable decarboxylation activity. Mutant E1 alpha subunit was expressed at a normal level, however, the E1 beta subunit was undetectable. These results provide the first evidence that Y393N mutation is the cause of MSUD. Moreover, this mutation impedes the assembly of E1 alpha with E1 beta into a stable alpha 2 beta 2 structure, resulting in the degradation of the free E1 beta subunit. 
In vivo regulation of virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa associated with genetic rearrangement. A chronic pulmonary infection model was used to induce conversion to the mucoid phenotype by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO. At 6 months after initial inoculation, organisms isolated from infected lungs demonstrated the mucoid phenotype. Significant decreases (P less than .01) were seen in the levels of exotoxin A, exoenzyme S, phospholipase C, and pyochelin produced by the mucoid P. aeruginosa PAO rat lung isolates that returned to parental levels after reversion to the nonmucoid phenotype. In addition, lipopolysaccharide of the mucoid PAO lung isolates failed to react with serotype B-specific antibody in contrast to the original PAO and the revertant PAO organisms. Digestion of chromosomal DNA and hybridization with P. aeruginosa virulence factor-specific probes demonstrated that conversion to the mucoid phenotype was associated with rearrangement of chromosomal DNA upstream of the exotoxin A gene. Analysis of DNA from revertant organisms revealed hybridization patterns identical to the original PAO organism. 
Delay to invasive investigation and revascularisation for coronary heart disease in south west Thames region: a two tier system? OBJECTIVES--To assess the accessibility of invasive investigation and revascularisation procedures in the management of coronary heart disease in a defined population in the South West Thames region over 10 years, and to audit the performance of both the NHS and the private sector. DESIGN--Analysis of all patient referrals to the regional cardiothoracic centres for coronary heart disease during 1979-88. SETTING--North West Surrey District Health Authority, which had a mean catchment population of 205,000 during the study period. The health district is one of the 13 in the South West Thames region. PATIENTS--823 patients aged 34-80 years with suspected coronary heart disease, 204 of whom were referred for private investigation and 619 were referred within the NHS. The NHS referrals were mainly to St Thomas's Hospital during 1979-83 and to St George's Hospital during 1984-8. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Difference in time to investigation and intervention between the NHS and the private patients. RESULTS--After some variation in earlier years the mean (SD, range) waiting times from referral to cardiac catheterisation and then revascularisation increased progressively in NHS patients, to 115.8 (126.5, 22-482) days and 305.9 (164.4, 22-620) days respectively in 1988. There was no significant change over the 10 years in waiting times within the private sector, with a mean of 17.2 (18.2, 1-62) days to angiography and 22.8 (14.5, 2-152) days to surgery. Fifteen people on the NHS waiting list died of probable cardiac causes. No people on the private waiting list died. CONCLUSIONS--The performance of the NHS system in South West Thames region in response to emergency referral is adequate. The waiting time to routine investigation and revascularisation is prolonged and seems to be worsening despite increased investigative and surgical activity by the regional centre. The delays may subject NHS patients to unnecessary risk, which is not shared by private patients. 
Prevention of retrovirus infection after injury with contaminated instruments: an experimental study. Owing to similarities between human immunodeficiency virus and feline retroviruses, the feline model was chosen for the study to investigate the efficacy of timely topical treatment of accidental human immunodeficiency virus infection in the operating room. Cats were subcutaneously inoculated with either feline leukemia virus or feline immunodeficiency virus. An effort was made to neutralize the virus in loco either by infiltration of the inoculation site with povidone-iodine or with monoclonal antibodies, or by cauterization and excision. The animals were periodically monitored for feline leukemia virus antigens or for feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies. The results indicated that in the feline model, the development of generalized virus infection may be prevented by local measures if applied immediately. 
Nuclear exercise testing and the management of coronary artery disease. Three hundred seventy-eight patients referred for nuclear exercise testing were classified using demographics and symptoms into low, intermediate, and high coronary disease likelihood categories. These likelihood groups constituted 15%, 41%, and 15% of referrals, respectively. Patients with prior infarction or disease at angiography (proven disease) made up the remaining 29% of patients. Only 2% of low likelihood patients had typical angina, but physicians diagnosed coronary disease in 64%, prescribed antianginal therapy in 50%, and were considering catheterization in 28% of these patients, all as frequently as for patients with intermediate or high likelihoods for disease. Patients with proven disease were treated differently in that 79% were receiving antianginal therapy and 56% were considered for catheterization (p less than 0.001). Nuclear exercise test results reduced the perceived need for catheterization in all groups, on average by 49%. Nuclear exercise tests are a standard by which patients are managed, sometimes substituting for the traditional role of the history in physician decision making. 
Arteriovenous malformation in meningothelial meningioma: case report. An unusual association of a meningioma and an arteriovenous malformation is reported. A 68-year-old man developed left homonymous hemianopsia, left hemiparesis, and gaze palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a right occipital mass lesion containing multiple signal-void areas with tubular and honeycomb appearance, suggesting a marked vascular component. An angiogram showed abnormal vasculature in the mass supplied by the posterior cerebral artery and a dural arteriovenous malformation on the tentorium. Neuropathological examination after total removal of the mass revealed a meningothelial meningioma including major portions of an arteriovenous malformation that extended from the dura and leptomeninges, through the meningioma, and into the occipital lobe, where the tumor was located. 
Role of vasopressin in salt-induced hypertension in baroreceptor-denervated uninephrectomized rabbits. To elucidate the contributions of renal, humoral, and arterial baroreceptor reflex components to salt-induced hypertension, we administered 10% NaCl intravenously for 10 days to sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy (n = 7), sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with intact kidneys (n = 7), and sham-operated sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy (n = 7). Serial changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, and blood pressure variability were recorded. In sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy, MAP increased significantly from 109 +/- 2 to 124 +/- 3 mm Hg (day 4) and remained elevated for the rest of the experiment. This elevation of MAP was accompanied by a reduction in the standard deviation of MAP, with significant elevations in plasma vasopressin, norepinephrine, and atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations and in sodium retention. In the other groups, there were no significant changes in these vasoactive hormones. In the sham-operated sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy, sodium retention was similar to that of sinoaortic-denervated rabbits with unilateral nephrectomy. Continuous infusion (1 microgram/kg/hr) of a V1 antagonist prevented the elevation of blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine, the accumulation of sodium, and the reduction of blood pressure lability, whereas a bolus injection (10 micrograms/kg) on day 4 reduced blood pressure from 128 +/- 3 to 115 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.005). These results imply that vasopressin plays a crucial role in the expression of salt-induced hypertension in rabbits with compromised baroreceptor and renal function. 
Giant adult malignant sacrococcygeal teratoma. Successful treatment by combined abdominosacral resection. This report describes the successful removal of the largest adult sacrococcygeal teratoma (18.75 kg) the authors could find on record. The patient was 58 years of age. The tumor had been present at birth and had been biopsied at the time of her cesarean section 34 years earlier without further treatment. Special planning was necessary for moving and positioning the patient for operation to prevent injury due to the size and weight of the tumor. A combined abdominosacral resection with preliminary ligation of the internal iliac arteries and a diversionary colostomy were performed without difficulty or undue blood loss. The defect was closed primarily and drained. The tumor proved to be malignant on pathologic examination. 
Ultrasonic decalcification of the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement. Aortic valve replacement for calcifica aortic stenosis requires meticulous debridement of the aortic annulus to effect optimal valve seating. Since 1987, we have used ultrasonic energy to debride the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement in 56 patients. In our experience, ultrasonic debridement of the annulus is superior to traditional methods of debridement, affords improved seating of the valve, and may allow placement of a larger valve. Our follow-up ranges from 2 to 32 months (mean follow-up, 13 +/- 9 months) with 0% incidence of paravalvular leak or valve failure. We advocate the use of ultrasonic debridement as an adjunctive tool in aortic valve replacement. 
Unilateral lumbar fusion. Unilateral fusion of the lumbar spine is rarely necessary or indicated. However, in patients with a "far-out syndrome" requiring decompression or in cases where unilateral posterior element resection is necessary for any reason, it may be both necessary and indicated. This unilateral destabilization effectively removes one leg of the tripod, rendering that intervertebral joint potentially unstable. The charts and radiographs of 13 patients (seven men, six women) with an average age of 60 years (range, 25 to 76) who underwent unilateral fusion were retrospectively reviewed. Follow-up time ranged from 12 1/2 to 2 years with a median follow-up of 8 years. Eleven of the fusions were at one level, and two were at two levels. Seven patients had a far-out syndrome secondary to degenerative scoliosis; four were secondary to spondylolisthesis. Two patients had an osteoid osteoma involving a pedicle. A paraspinal approach was used in the majority of patients. Autologous bone graft was used in all patients. Unilateral pedicle screw fixation was used in the last patient in the series. The fusion rate was 85% (11/13). Three patients were smokers, two of whom developed pseudarthrosis. Disc space height did not appear to affect fusion rate. There was no progression of slip noted in any of the patients. One complication was noted in this group: a moderate postoperative infection, which cleared spontaneously. 
Double compartment hydrocephalus in an adult. A case of double-compartment hydrocephalus in an adult is presented. Although this entity is infrequently noted in children, it is diagnosed even more rarely in the adult population. A discussion of the spectrum of abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics of the 4th ventricle and treatment options are presented. 
Neurophysiologic assessment of the anal sphincters. One hundred twenty consecutive patients with either fecal incontinence (60 patients), chronic constipation (41 patients), or idiopathic intractable pelvic pain (19 patients) were prospectively assessed. Patients underwent concentric needle electromyography (EMG), bilateral pudendal nerve terminal motor latency evaluation, anorectal manometry, and cinedefecography. The most common EMG finding in patients with fecal incontinence was decreased recruitment of motor units with squeezing and polyphasic motor unit potentials; these are consistent with an injury pattern. The most common EMG finding in the constipated patients was paradoxical puborectalis contraction. This latter abnormality was also a frequent finding in patients with rectal pain, as was prolongation of pudendal nerve latency. Paradoxical puborectalis contraction was diagnosed more frequently with EMG than with cinedefecography. Inter-examination correlation was best in the incontinent group between EMG and manometry. Cinedefecography had poor correlation with EMG in all patient groups but was valuable in the detection of additional pathology such as rectoanal intussusception and anterior rectocele. Electromyography including pudendal nerve terminal motor latency assessment is a valuable adjunct in the evaluation of disorders of evacuation. The information it yields is complementary to that offered by more routine physiologic examinations. 
Carpal tunnel syndrome: surgical treatment using the Paine retinaculatome. The operative technique for the relief of carpal tunnel syndrome has remained controversial. This report presents the results of 445 patients or 577 hands operated on using a transverse technique that varies little from that described by Paine and Polyzoidis. The patients were followed for 9 months to 3 years. In addition to the data received from follow-up visits, a questionnaire was sent to each patient for evaluation of their results. All surgery was performed under local anesthesia, sometimes with intravenous supplement. Of the 445 patients, 313 had unilateral operations and 132 had bilateral operations at one sitting. Postoperatively, normal hand function was achieved in 59.4% of patients in 1 week or less. Of the 577 hands operated on, 535 (92.7%) exhibited satisfactory results from surgery. No patient required postoperative physical therapy or splinting. There were no injuries to the median nerve or any of its branches. 
Motor responses after transcranial electrical stimulation of cerebral hemispheres with a degenerated pyramidal tract. Motor responses were evoked in the thenar muscles by transcranial electrical cortex stimulation in 5 stroke patients with an isolated lacuna in the internal capsule, in whom wallerian degeneration of the pyramidal tract was demonstrated in vivo. Suprathreshold stimulation of the affected hemisphere elicited bilateral motor responses; whereas, stimulation at identical intensities of the undamaged hemisphere yielded strictly unilateral responses in the contralateral hand, like the responses of all normal control subjects. Focused magnetic brain stimulation was performed in 1 patient and gave identical results. Because muscular excitability to cortical stimulation is preserved in spite of pyramidal tract disruption, other pathways must bypass the lesion. Because of the bilaterality of responses, we suggest polysynaptic corticoreticulospinal connections. 
Treatment of constitutional growth delay in prepubertal boys with a prolonged course of low dose oxandrolone. Forty six prepubertal boys who had constitutional growth delay were treated with oxandrolone. Mean age at the onset of treatment was 11.9 years (range 9.0-14.0) and bone age delay was 1.9 'years'. The dose of oxandrolone used was a mean of 0.05 mg/kg (range 0.03-0.18) for a mean of 0.9 years (range 0.2-3.6). Height velocity increased from a mean (SD) before treatment of 4.0 (1.0) to 7.5 (1.2) cm/year with oxandrolone. Growth rate was sustained at 7.6 (2.2) cm/year in the period after treatment. Those boys who attained a testicular volume of 4 ml or greater at the end of the treatment period had the most pronounced sustained growth acceleration. Height for bone age SD score did not alter significantly from a mean of -1.0 before treatment to -1.2 after treatment. Oxandrolone is a safe and effective treatment for prepubertal boys with constitutional growth delay. 
Use of duplex scanning in the diagnosis of arteria profunda femoris stenosis. To evaluate the accuracy of duplex scanning in diagnosing arteria profunda femoris stenoses in patients with concomitant superficial femoral artery occlusions, 123 femoral artery bifurcations were examined in 103 patients. Peak systolic and time-averaged maximal flow velocity parameters were measured in the arteria profunda femoris and compared with independently performed angiography. For detecting stenoses greater than 30% diameter reduction (50% by area) of the arteria profunda femoris, duplex scanning had a sensitivity of 91% and 96%, a specificity of 85% and 98%, a positive predictive value of 86% and 98%, and a negative predictive value of 91% and 96%, for a peak systolic velocity of 180 cm/sec and more, and for a time-averaged maximal velocity of 50 cm/sec and more in the arteria profunda femoris, respectively. The day-to-day variability for peak systolic and time-averaged maximal velocity parameters was low with correlation coefficients between velocity measurements on both days of 0.96 and 0.98 (n = 20), respectively. In 10 patients with arteria profunda femoris stenoses and superficial femoral artery occlusions, undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of arteria profunda femoris stenosis, the duplex scan revealed a reduction in stenotic peak systolic velocity from 330 +/- 84 to 163 +/- 50 cm/sec and a decrease in stenotic time-averaged maximal velocity from 156 +/- 47 to 54 +/- 17 cm/sec after the interventional procedure. These results show that peak systolic and time-averaged maximal velocities are accurate parameters to detect significant arteria profunda femoris stenosis in patients with superficial femoral artery occlusions. 
Hemobilia due to vasculitis of the gall bladder in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease. A 30-year-old woman with mixed connective tissue disease presented with acute abdominal pain and signs of blood loss. At cholecystectomy she appeared to have lost a considerable amount of blood into the biliary tract due to bleeding of the gall bladder. Microscopic examination showed vasculitis of the gall bladder wall. Hemobilia has not been described before as a complication in mixed connective tissue disease. 
Southern blot analysis in a case of Richter's syndrome. Evidence for a postrearrangement heavy chain gene deletion associated with the altered phenotype. Richter's syndrome (RS) can be defined as the emergence of an aggressive lymphoma in patients suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The authors performed immunophenotypic and Southern blot analysis of the peripheral blood and tissue specimen of a patient with RS. Using immunoperoxidase and immunogold-silver staining techniques and a panel of monoclonal antibodies, the authors found that the large cells characteristic of RS showed an altered immunophenotype as compared with the CLL cells and did not express mu heavy chain. Southern blot analysis revealed identical kappa light chain rearrangements in both tumoral cell populations consistent with a common clonal origin. Using the JH probe and several restriction enzymes, the authors also found evidence for a postrearrangement deletion of the heavy chain mu gene. These findings suggest that in this case of RS, a deletion of the heavy chain mu gene resulted in loss of mu expression by the larger cells that were characteristic of RS and was associated with their altered phenotype. 
Arterial insufficiency in hemodialysis access procedures: correction by "banding" technique. Arterial insufficiency distal to an antecubital access is fortunately an infrequent but disturbing and often debilitating complication resulting in suboptimal access. During an 8 1/2-year period, 335 vascular access procedures were performed, 108 of which were antecubital brachiocephalic Gore-Tex conduits. Of these Gore-Tex conduits, 1.8% (2/108) had developed symptoms of vascular insufficiency 2 to 3 1/2 months after such access surgery. As previously published, arterial steal after the creation of an AV fistula could be corrected by the placement of an interposition Gore-Tex loop that would cure the problem and save the access. We have presented a procedure to correct a steal syndrome once a Gore-Tex conduit is already in place. Proximal banding and distal ligation with division of the cephalic vein below an end-to-side Gore-Tex loop is a simple surgical solution. It is not only curative but the procedure also maintains the existing Gore-Tex graft as a sustained avenue for access. 
Clinical significance of the V-shaped space in the subluxed shoulder of hemiplegics. Recently, it has been proposed that shoulder subluxation in hemiplegia is accompanied by 1) the appearance of a V-shaped articular configuration occurring between the humeral head and glenoid fossa and 2) the presence of chronic pain. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of these statements. We evaluated 40 hemiplegic subjects over 3 months. Radiographs of the affected and nonaffected shoulders were taken at both a frontal plane (0 degree) and a 45 degree incidence. From these patients, subluxed (n = 19) and nonsubluxed (n = 21) groups were formed. Pain was evaluated using the Present Pain Intensity index of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. On these x-ray films, measurements were taken of the V-shaped space, abduction of the arm, and rotation of the scapula. The statistical analysis (analysis of variance for repeated measures) contrasted the results obtained from the nonaffected side with those from the affected side over the 3 months studied. At the 45 degree angle, which better exposes the articular configuration of the shoulder, the difference in the V angle between the affected and nonaffected shoulders was significant for the subluxed group (p less than 0.01), indicating that such a V-shaped space can be identified. The measures taken also indicate that a downward subluxation of the humeral head occurs relative to the scapula without any systematic abduction of the humerus or downward rotation of the scapula. None of the results obtained from the frontal plane x-ray films was significant. Finally, no significant relation was found between subluxation and shoulder pain. 
Telangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma of the extremities. Results in 17 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Seventeen patients with telangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma (TOS) of the extremities were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, according to two different protocols. Preoperatively, the patients received high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and cisplatinum (CPD) (HD-MTX/CPD) and doxorubicin. CPD was delivered intraarterially, the other drugs intravenously. Limb-salvage surgery was performed in 12 instances, and five patients were treated with amputation. Postoperative chemotherapy was tailored according to the grade of chemotherapy-induced necrosis. In 13 cases (86%), the resultant grade of necrosis was greater than 90% (good responders). The mean follow-up interval was 3.5 years with a range of 18 to 78 months. Fourteen patients (82%) remained continuously disease-free, while three patients developed lung metastases. Two of these died because of uncontrolled disease, whereas the third patient is alive and disease-free after metastasectomy. No local recurrences were observed. These results are better than those observed in 215 contemporary cases of conventional osteosarcoma treated with the same protocols. This study confirms that TOS is not a uniformly lethal tumor as suggested by prior reports. By employing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a high percentage of patients with TOS can be cured, and in most of them, a limb-sparing surgery is possible and safe. 
High-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate versus estramustine in therapy-resistant prostatic cancer: a randomised study. A series of 105 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, having progressed on first-line hormonal treatment, were randomised to high-dose medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 1000 mg i.m. daily for 15 days, followed by 1000 mg weekly (53 patients), or to estramustine 280 mg per os twice daily (52 patients). The treatment was discontinued because of side effects in 3 of 51 evaluable MPA-treated patients and in 8 of 51 evaluable estramustine-treated patients. Progression-free survival was short in both groups and no statistically significant difference between them was observed. After 1 year, 70% of the patients had died and there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatments in the cumulative observed survival rates. According to modified SPCG criteria, remissions lasting from 12 to 56 weeks were noted in 13 MPA-treated patients and in 4 estramustine-treated patients. This difference was statistically significant. After cross-over, 6 of 33 patients in the MPA group had a remission compared with 1 of 24 in the estramustine group. It was concluded that the response rate, considering both subjective and objective response criteria, was better with MPA and the side effects were fewer. 
Evidence for alpha 1-adrenoreceptor hyperresponsiveness in hypotensive cirrhotic patients with ascites. Cirrhosis with ascites is often characterized by arterial hypotension associated with increased plasma norepinephrine levels. Clinical evidence suggests a decreased sensitivity to norepinephrine in this clinical setting, indicating a potential derangement of alpha 1 adrenoreceptors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reactivity of the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor, using phenylephrine, a selective alpha 1 receptor agonist. First, we evaluated the pupillar response to the intraconjunctival administration of the agonist. Hypotensive cirrhotic patients showed a trend to a more marked and prolonged response, compared with age-matched healthy controls. Second, we studied the response of alpha 1-adrenoreceptors in the peripheral vasculature by administering iv phenylephrine to a similar group of patients. A significantly greater and longer lasting pressor response was observed in hypotensive cirrhotic patients (p less than 0.0001 vs. healthy controls). Our results indicate that in this group of patients, there is a rather peculiar situation, characterized by alpha 1-adrenoreceptor hyperresponsiveness in the presence of high levels of circulating norepinephrine. This finding could be related to biochemical abnormalities within the peripheral sympathetic nervous system endings. 
Hepatitis C virus infection and chronic liver disease in children with leukemia in long-term remission. Antibody to the recently identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) was investigated in sera of 50 leukemic children who had chronic liver disease (CLD), observed for 1 to 12.6 years after therapy withdrawal. All patients were tested for anti-HCV at regular intervals: Ortho-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was performed in all cases. Reactive sera were also tested by recombinant immunoblotting assay to define the specificity of the results obtained by ELISA. Twelve cases (24%) were persistently positive (group A), 11 (22%) were transiently anti-HCV+ positive (group B), and 27 (54%) were negative. Mean SGPT peak during follow-up was significantly higher in group A (P = .014, A v B and P less than .00001, A v C). SGPT normalized off-therapy in 1 of 12 cases (group A), 10 of 11 (group B), and 19 of 27 (group C) (P = .0004, A v B and P = .012, A v C). Accordingly, liver histology, available in 37 patients, showed signs of chronic hepatitis in all patients in group A while most patients in group B and C had less severe liver lesions. These results indicate that HCV plays a significant role in the etiology of chronic hepatitis in leukemic patients and that persistent anti-HCV activity correlates with a more severe CLD, which could jeopardize the final prognosis of children cured of leukemia. 
Superselective embolization of superior gluteal artery pseudoaneurysms following intramuscular injection: case report. Two bleeding superior gluteal artery pseudoaneurysms occurred in a patient with advanced malignant disease following an intramuscular injection. This was diagnosed by angiography and successfully managed by superselective embolization. This avoided further surgery and no additional complication from the pseudoaneurysm occurred up to the time of the patient's demise. 
Sternal wound infections and use of internal mammary artery grafts. Previous studies have provided conflicting evidence as to whether an increased risk of mediastinitis is associated with use of the internal mammary artery as a coronary bypass graft. In this study the effects of internal mammary artery grafts on wound complications were analyzed in a prospective, nonrandomized fashion. At New York University Medical Center from January 1985 through May 1988, 2356 patients underwent isolated coronary revascularization. Among these patients 1394 received one or more internal mammary artery grafts (group I) and 962 had vein grafts only (group II). Group I had a mean age of 59.5 years versus 67.7 years in group II; diabetes was equally present in both groups (22.7% versus 24.7%). Operative mortality rate was 1.3% in group I and 5.6% in group II. Sternal infection was significantly more prevalent in group I (2.2%, 31/1394) than in group II (0.8%, 8/962). Multivariate analysis revealed that aortic crossclamp time, use of a single internal mammary artery graft, use of a double mammary graft, and diabetes were associated with increased risk of sternal infection. The use of bilateral internal mammary artery grafting doubled the odds ratio of the risk compared with use of a single mammary graft, and the combination of diabetes and double internal mammary artery grafts increased the odds ratio 13.9-fold. Patients with an internal mammary artery graft who had sternal infection had a longer period of hospitalization than patients without a mammary artery graft who had sternal infection. We conclude that the risk of sternal infection is increased by the use of an internal mammary artery graft, especially use of double mammary grafts in the presence of diabetes. 
Socioeconomic status and cancer survival. Survival data from eight Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocols were examined for patients with lung cancer (N = 961), multiple myeloma (N = 577), gastric cancer (N = 231), pancreatic cancer (N = 174), breast cancer (N = 87), and Hodgkin's disease (N = 58). After accounting for differences in survival rate attributable to type of cancer, initial performance status, age, and 14 other protocol-specific prognostic indicators, the additional predictive value of socioeconomic status (SES) was evaluated. Race (white v non-white) was not a significant predictor of survival time, but income and education were. People with lower annual incomes (below $5,000 per year in the years 1977 to 1981) and those with lower educational level (grade school only) showed survival times significantly shorter than those with higher income or education, respectively. These survival differences were associated with, but could not be fully explained by, severity of disease at initial presentation. SES continued to exert a small but significant impact on cancer survival, even after controlling for all known prognostic variables. Economically and educationally disadvantaged cancer patients may require treatment programs that include education about treatment and compliance, even after an initial diagnosis is made and treatment is initiated. Because SES is related to survival independent of all known prognostic variables, it should be included in the data bases of clinical trial groups to provide a more accurate test of the effectiveness of new therapies. 
Extracapsular spread of squamous cell carcinoma in neck lymph nodes: prognostic factor of laryngeal cancer. Fifty-two patients with laryngeal cancer who underwent radical neck dissections were studied to provide further information on the prognosis of various clinical and histopathological parameters. Extracapsular spread (ECS) was found in 31% of patients with N1 nodes, and in 60% of patients with histopathologically positive nodes. The 5-year survival rate of histopathological findings was as follows: patients with no pathological evidence of neck metastasis (81%), patients with neck metastasis confined to the lymph node (no ECS) (76%), and patients with ECS (17%). The difference in survival rate between patients with no ECS and patients with ECS was statistically significant (P = .001). Staging classification, T-stage classification, the number of malignant nodes, the diameter of malignant nodes, and combined therapy had no prognostic importance. The most significant factor was the presence of extracapsular spread. 
Terazosin: pharmacokinetics and the effect of age and dose on the incidence of adverse events. Terazosin is a new, long-acting, selective, postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist with a chemical structure similar to that of prazosin. In this article the pharmacokinetics of terazosin are reviewed, and the incidence of adverse events in a dose-response study and a meta-analysis of 20 placebo-controlled trials involving a total of 1814 patients is presented. Peak plasma concentrations of terazosin are achieved 1 to 2 hours after oral administration. The relatively long half-life of terazosin (12 hours) enables it to be administered in a once-a-day regimen. Dose and plasma levels of terazosin show a linear relationship. Terazosin is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of terazosin are not significantly affected by food, age, hypertension, or renal impairment. Adverse events after the administration of terazosin are usually minor and not age related. The incidence of syncope after therapeutic dosages of terazosin is minimal. Terazosin's effectiveness, combined with its pharmacokinetics, safety profile, and potentially favorable lipid effect, makes it a highly appropriate choice for antihypertensive therapy. 
Positron emission tomography suggests that the rate of progression of idiopathic parkinsonism is slow. We performed sequential positron emission tomography scans with 6-[18F]fluoro-L-dopa in 9 patients with idiopathic parkinsonism and 7 age-matched normal control subjects to compare changes in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway over time. The mean interval between the scans was 3.3 years for the group with idiopathic parkinsonism and 3.9 years for the control subjects. The scans were analyzed by calculating the ratio of striatal to background radioactivity. Both groups showed statistically significant reductions of striatal uptake over the interval. The rate of decrease was almost identical in each group (p = 0.6). We infer that the usual rate of loss of integrity of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway in patients with idiopathic parkinsonism is slow and the rate of change between the two groups was comparable. 
Aggressive peripheral T-cell lymphomas containing Epstein-Barr viral DNA: a clinicopathologic and molecular analysis. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown to be associated with posttransplant lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and T-cell lymphoma, in addition to African Burkitt's lymphoma. In a retrospective study of 56 consecutive cases of T-cell lymphoma, EBV DNA was found by Southern blot and in situ DNA hybridization in 10 (20%) of 50 peripheral T-cell lymphomas, but in none of six cases of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas containing EBV DNA could be subclassified into three categories according to histology and immunophenotypic studies: (1) T-cell lymphoma of the helper phenotype, five cases. Two cases had histologic features resembling angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD). (2) T-cell lymphoma of the cytotoxic/suppressor phenotype, four cases. AILD-like features could also be recognized in two cases. Reed-Sternberg-like giant cells were identified in three cases designated Hodgkin-like T-cell lymphoma. (3) Angiocentric T-cell lymphoma or lymphomatoid granulomatosis in one case, initially affecting the skin and nose; no T-cell subset could be defined. Six of the eight EBV DNA-positive patients tested for serum EBV antibodies had elevated titers of IgG antiviral capsid antigen (greater than 640) and/or early antigen (greater than 10). From combined studies of Southern blot hybridization by using EBV termini fragment probe and in situ DNA hybridization, the EBV genomes appeared to be clonotypically proliferated in the neoplastic T cells. The patients in all three groups usually had prolonged fever preceding the diagnosis, hepatosplenomegaly, an aggressive clinical course, and poor response to chemotherapy; nine died with a median survival of only 8 months. We propose that these EBV-associated aggressive T-cell lymphomas, like human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus-positive T-cell lymphoma, have characteristic clinicopathologic features and should be treated as a separate disease entity. 
Seizures in series: similarities between seizures of the west and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. We observed seizures resembling infantile spasms in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Infantile spasms, the type of seizures that occurs in patients who have West syndrome, have been well characterized by video-EEG studies and typically occur as a series of sudden generalized flexor or extensor jerks. The seizure types that occur in LGS have not been as clearly delineated. Some patients with West syndrome (WS) in early infancy later develop LGS. Using intensive video-EEG monitoring, we evaluated 14 LGS patients who had seizures that occurred in series. Clinically, the seizures greatly resembled infantile spasms, and the ictal EEG changes were identical to those that occur with infantile spasms. These findings expand the number of features known to be shared by these two syndromes and strengthen the hypothesis that the two syndromes represent age-related manifestations of similar epileptogenic processes. 
Genetic susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. Genetic factors clearly cause Lewy-body Parkinson's disease (PD) in a subset of autosomal-dominant families. However, most cases of PD are sporadic. The two most likely models of four discussed for sporadic PD are the reduced penetrance model and the multifactorial model. Sporadic PD is likely to be caused by the combined effect of environmental precipitating factors and genetic susceptibility factors. Because the number of major genetic factors is likely to be small, these hypotheses can be tested and genetic factors located using linkage mapping techniques. The affected pair analysis methods are especially suited to PD. Finding the genetic susceptibility factors for PD is important because this may be the fastest way to identify the environmental precipitating factors and because it may lead to prevention of PD. Because of the usefulness of identifying genetic susceptibility factors for PD, we are carrying out linkage studies in a group of 16 large autosomal-dominant families with PD and more than 300 living affected PD pairs. 
Natural course of clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma in men less than 70 years old. A total of 61 patients, less than 70 years old at diagnosis, with clinical stage T1-2, NX, M0, cytologically well or moderately differentiated prostate adenocarcinoma was prospectively included in a surveillance study. Median patient age was 63 years (range 38 to 69 years). Mean followup was 96 +/- 24 months. The probability of local progression to stage T3 disease after 5 and 10 years was 49 and 72%, respectively. The probability of metastases developing after 5 and 10 years was 8 and 23%, respectively. The probability of dying of prostate adenocarcinoma was 2 and 8%, respectively. Moderately differentiated cancer progressed locally significantly faster than well differentiated disease. The relative number of patients who had metastases or died of prostate adenocarcinoma found in our study was comparable to the relative numbers reported after radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy. Therefore, deferred therapy may be an alternative to active therapy in patients with clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma and with a life expectancy of less than 10 years. 
Carcinoid tumors: the relationship between clinical presentation and the extent of disease. In this study the relationship between the initial clinical presentation and the extent of tumor progression was determined in a group of 31 patients with carcinoid tumors. The proportion of patients with symptomatic tumors was similar to those patients with carcinoid tumors that were incidentally found (55% versus 45%; SE = 0.089). Symptoms were caused by metastatic tumor in nine (30%) of the patients and by local effects of the primary tumor in eight (26%) of the patients. The patients with symptoms had a significantly increased frequency of metastatic disease, even when the symptoms were due to the primary tumor, compared to patients with no symptoms (76% versus 7%; p less than 0.001). Tumor size was related to the presence of symptoms and metastases. Symptoms were most common when the size of the primary tumor was greater than 1.0 cm (p less than 0.005), although the rate of metastases increased when primary tumors were 2.0 cm and larger (p less than 0.01). These results indicate that the presence of symptoms or a primary tumor 2.0 cm or larger are associated with an increased risk of metastatic disease in patients with carcinoid tumors. These patients should be treated with wide resection of the primary tumor and its lymphatic drainage. 
Colonic volvulus. The Army Medical Center experience 1983-1987. Colonic volvulus was first described in 1836 by von Rokitansky. The condition has been a formidable one, fraught with innumerable complications responsible for many deaths. Even with advances in surgical technology, mortalities have remained high. Often the diagnosis is delayed for hours or even days after presentation, and serious concomitant systemic diseases are often present. Treatment has been controversial, particularly the role of elective resection following successful nonoperative reduction. The Army Medical Center experience with colonic volvulus from 1983 through 1987 is reviewed. Fifty-four patients at the eight medical centers carried this diagnosis. Their presenting signs and symptoms are discussed. The Army patients are compared and contrasted with reviews presented in the surgical literature, and conclusions are made to give guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. 
Neuroanatomy and pathophysiology of pain related to spinal disorders. Sensation is achieved through the integration of many neural elements: receptors, afferent and efferent neurons, the spinal cord with its subdivisions, and the higher brain centers. One of the many sensations perceived by the human body is that of pain or nociception. To understand the concept of "back pain" associated with various spinal pathologies, some basic knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of sensation, and more specifically nociception, is necessary. This knowledge is presented herein. 
Development of a "Steps Questionnaire". Thousands of men and women have begun their recovery from alcoholism through the support of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and its well-known "12-Step" program. The purpose of the present study was to develop a scale to measure alcoholics' levels of agreement with the first three of AA's 12 Steps and to test the relationship between sobriety and belief in these three steps. Using both factor analysis and Rasch analysis, two versions of a "Steps Questionnaire" were developed. A 96-member subset of the original subject pool was assessed quarterly for 1 year following inpatient treatment to determine the predictive validity of the questionnaire. The results of this study suggested that agreement with AA's first three steps can be measured and that agreement with AA's first step correlates with number of sober days posttreatment. The dichotomization of Steps Questionnaire scores into total agreement versus partial agreement with Step 1, and from this the reduction of uncertainty in the prediction of abstention over a lengthy follow-up period, provides support for AA's contention that total surrender to one's powerlessness over alcohol is part of the process of achieving abstention. 
Retrospective postmortem dementia assessment. Validation of a new clinical interview to assist neuropathologic study. Neuropathologic studies of dementia and normal aging suffer from a lack of individuals examined for the presence and severity of dementia before death. To increase clinical information in such cases, a retrospective collateral interview was developed. Thirty-nine individuals were studied; 27 had autopsies. In all cases, the autopsy confirmed the Retrospective Collateral Dementia Interview (RCDI) diagnosis of the presence or absence of dementia; the RCDI had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 80% for specifically detecting probable Alzheimer's disease. Agreement between the RCDI and premortem diagnosis was 96%; between RCDI and medical records, 100%. Agreement between RCDI staging of dementia severity and the last assessment of the living subject was 70%; between the RCDI and a brief staging at death, 86%. This validation confirms the value of postmortem interviews with close informants to assess dementia presence and severity. 
Retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section: efficacy in disorders other than Meniere's disease. The retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section has evolved as an effective treatment for intractable vertigo of peripheral vestibular origin when hearing preservation is desired. This report studies the efficacy of retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section for control of vertigo due to causes other than Meniere's disease. This report details our experience with 42 patients with a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduced success rate of retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section in these patients is difficult to evaluate, as very few patients have been analyzed with respect to their specific diagnoses. Of patients who underwent retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section for control of vertigo, 23 patients had uncompensated vestibular neuritis and 19 others had a wide range of other diagnoses. For patients with uncompensated vestibular neuritis (n = 23), the physician record noted that 39% of patients were cured and 30% improved. This compares to our series of patients with Meniere's disease (n = 48), where 94% were cured and 2% improved. The true vestibular abnormality may be less reliably identified in patients with uncompensated vestibular neuritis, contributing to the less effective results. Since the development of a vestibular rehabilitation program, retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section for uncompensated vestibular neuritis has been all but abandoned. Retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section appears to achieve a high cure rate in patients with sensorineural hearing loss associated with their vestibular abnormalities. While retrolabyrinthine vestibular nerve section is helpful for control of vertigo in some diagnoses, a substantial incidence of persistent postoperative dysequilibrium was noted. 
Determinants of increase in plasma concentration of beta-carotene after chronic oral supplementation. The Skin Cancer Prevention Study Group. We studied the relationship between eight variables, including age, sex, baseline plasma beta-carotene (BC) concentration, and smoking status and the increase in plasma BC in 582 subjects receiving oral supplementation with 50 mg BC/d. Median plasma BC concentrations after 1 y of supplementation increased from 335 nmol/L at entry to 3163 nmol/L. Changes in plasma BC concentrations ranged widely from -313 to 16,090 nmol/L (median 2721 nmol/L). Multivariate analysis revealed that the subject's plasma BC concentration before supplementation was the most important indicator of the amount of increase after supplementation. Nonsmokers, women, and leaner subjects all had larger increases in plasma concentrations although the statistical model could account for relatively little of the variability in subjects' plasma response to BC supplementation (R2 = 0.14). We conclude that between-subject variability in response to daily supplementation with oral BC is very large and that the best predictor of this response is the initial plasma BC concentration. 
Ibuprofen provides longer lasting analgesia than fentanyl after laparoscopic surgery. The authors compared the analgesic efficacy of one dose of oral ibuprofen with that of intravenously administered fentanyl for relief of pain after outpatient laparoscopic surgery. Thirty healthy female patients received either 800 mg of oral ibuprofen preoperatively or 75 micrograms of intravenous fentanyl intraoperatively plus respective intravenous or oral placebos in a randomized, double-blind manner. Patients recorded their degree of pain and nausea in the recovery room, in the same-day surgery stepdown unit, during the ride home, and upon arrival at home. The postanesthesia care nurse recorded the amount of fentanyl and droperidol needed to treat pain and nausea in the recovery room. Patients who received ibuprofen were more comfortable in the stepdown unit (P less than 0.05) and after arrival home (P less than 0.05) than those in the fentanyl group. Additionally, patients who received ibuprofen had lower nausea scores in the step-down unit (P less than 0.05); this may have been related to the lower total fentanyl dose in these patients. The authors conclude that ibuprofen may be a useful alternative to fentanyl for providing postoperative analgesia for outpatient surgery. 
Leiomyosarcoma of the buttock. A 56-year-old man had a deeply invasive leiomyosarcoma of the right buttock. Leiomyosarcomas of the skin and subcutaneous tissues are rare, and most occur on the extremities. Wide local excision is the therapy of choice. 
Crohn's disease in a patient with multiple sclerosis. We report the occurrence of Crohn's disease in a patient with well-established multiple sclerosis. A relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis is supported by a higher than expected coexistence of these disease among families and individuals, as well as similar accepted and proposed mechanisms of pathogenesis and therapy. 
Class I and class II major histocompatibility complex antigens on hepatocytes: importance of the method of detection and expression in histologically normal and diseased livers. Methodological differences in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen detection were investigated on isolated, viable hepatocytes and cryostat hepatic sections from 27 children with liver disorders, six of whom had normal histology. Class I antigens were constantly found on sections using a three step immunoperoxidase technique after acetone/chloroform fixation, other techniques being less sensitive, or on isolated hepatocytes by indirect immunofluorescence alone. With mechanical isolation the percentage of positivity ranged from 85 to 100%, while with collagenase isolation it ranged from 22 to 49% on immediate testing, and from 53 to 80% after 24 hour incubation. Class II antigens were only detected in one patient with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and two with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Flow cytofluorimetric analysis in 11 cases confirmed class II or class I positivity, or both, on isolated hepatocytes, allowing MHC antigen expression on hepatocytes to be measured. Class I and II antigen detection on hepatocytes is influenced by the technique used. Although class I antigens are invariably expressed on hepatocytes, class II antigens are only found on hepatocytes from patients with immune mediated liver disorders. 
Stress echocardiography for detection of coronary artery disease. Stress echocardiography is a relatively new technique that combines cardiovascular stress with echocardiographic imaging for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. It is based on the hypothesis that stress-induced ischemia will result in regional wall motion abnormalities that can be detected by two-dimensional echocardiography or abnormalities of global function that can be detected with Doppler ultrasound. Its accuracy for detecting coronary artery disease is high enough to allow for clinical use. In such a role it has added value to the analysis of the routine electrocardiogram and symptoms during exercise. In the patient unable to exercise, pharmacological stress with the use of dobutamine or dipyridamole are realistic alternatives. In addition to the diagnosis of coronary disease, stress echocardiography can be used to demonstrate recovery of function after interventions and to assess prognosis after myocardial infarction. 
Premedication: an audit. A prospective study of routine premedication management was carried out at a large teaching hospital. Many patients received their premedication at times inappropriate for it to be effective. Several patients receiving regular medication had this suddenly stopped pre-operatively. Prolonged fasting occurred in both elective and emergency groups of patients. Benzodiazepines and opioids were prescribed most frequently and drying agents were used widely. Antacids, H2-blockers and agents to promote gastric emptying were used very little despite the potential of aspiration in many groups of patients. This audit of activity has revealed several areas of practice that can either be improved immediately or warrant detailed investigation. 
Comparison of the findings on preoperative dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy and intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography: implications regarding the identification of myocardium at ischemic risk. The evidence of myocardium at potential ischemic risk on preoperative dipyridamole perfusion scintigraphy was compared with that of manifest ischemia on intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in 26 patients at high risk of a coronary event undergoing noncardiac surgery. The clinical outcome was also assessed. Induced intraoperative wall motion abnormalities were more common in patients and myocardial segments with, than in those without, a preoperative reversible perfusion defect (both p less than 0.05). Conversely, a preoperative reversible perfusion defect was more common in patients and segments with, than in those without, a new intraoperative wall motion abnormality (both p less than 0.05). Six patients, five with a reversible scintigraphic defect but only three with a new wall motion abnormality, had a hard perioperative ischemic event. Events occurred more often among patients with, than in those without, a reversible perioperative scintigraphic defect (5 [33%] of 15 vs. 1 [9%] of 11) but this difference did not reach significance (p = 0.14), probably owing to the sample size. Intraoperative wall motion abnormalities were all reversible and did not differentiate between risk groups; these findings were possibly influenced by treatment. These preliminary data support the known relation between reversible scintigraphic defects and perioperative events and identify another manifestation of ischemic risk in the relation between reversible scintigraphic defects and induced intraoperative wall motion abnormalities. The value of intraoperative echocardiography in identifying ischemia and guiding therapy in patients with a reversible scintigraphic abnormality should be further assessed. 
Stress gastritis revisited. In current ICU populations, overt bleeding from stress gastritis occurs in 10% to 20% of patients. Bleeding rates may be reduced to about 3% in patients receiving prophylactic therapy. Although patients with bleeding have higher mortality rates than other critically ill patients, it is not clear that the mortality rate is improved with prophylactic therapy, as most patients die from their underlying disease. As new complications of prophylactic therapy are identified, better definitions of the population at risk to develop complications of stress gastritis will be necessary to select those patients who will benefit most from prophylactic therapy. 
Extra-anatomic bypass of failed traumatic arterial repairs. Arterial injuries are best treated by primary repair or anatomically placed interposition grafts. Occasionally, these repairs fail due to adverse local factors, such as soft-tissue infection or enteric contamination. In these instances, limb salvage may require extra-anatomic arterial reconstruction. Between 1979 and 1989, 13 extra-anatomic bypasses were performed in ten male patients following nine failed primary repairs and one ligation of a traumatic arterial injury. The sites of arterial injury were: aorta (two), iliac (five), femoral (two), popliteal (one). Enteric contamination was present at initial operation in six patients; the remaining four had sustained massive soft-tissue injury. Reoperation was required for hemorrhage (seven), pseudoaneurysm (two), and arteriovenous fistula (one). All patients had developed local wound problems that militated against another anatomic repair. Extra-anatomic bypasses performed were: axillo-femoral (three), femoro-femoral (four), obturator (one), and two extra-anatomic femoral to popliteal saphenous vein grafts routed around an infected field. A second extra-anatomic reconstruction was performed for recurrent hemorrhage in three patients, (axillo-femoral--two, obturator--one). One patient with a neuropathic extremity and a functioning graft underwent amputation at 2 months following the initial injury. Two patients died of systemic sepsis. Seven patients (70%) have functional extremities with intact pulses at 2 to 24 months post bypass (mean, 7 months). Limb salvage after secondary disruption of secondarily infected arterial repairs can be achieved by appropriate extra-anatomic arterial reconstruction. In such cases, limb loss is due to soft-tissue sepsis or neuro-skeletal injuries and not vascular insufficiency. 
The clinical significance and pathophysiology of stress-related gastric mucosal hemorrhage. Critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) develop a spectrum of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions that may result in mucosal hemorrhage and subsequent morbidity and mortality. Although stress-related mucosal lesions may be detected endoscopically in most critically ill patients, the incidence of clinically significant bleeding from these lesions is difficult to establish because of the heterogeneity in patient populations, the definitions of bleeding, and the methods of monitoring in various studies. Bleeding occurs overall in approximately 16% of patients not receiving prophylaxis, but the incidence of life-threatening hemorrhage appears to be much lower (less than 6%). In light of the increasing use of pharmacologic prophylaxis in ICUs, the clinical impact of stress-related bleeding and its prophylaxis is discussed in terms of bleeding incidence, morbidity and mortality, cost, and potential side effects. The pathophysiology of stress-related mucosal ulceration involves the complex interaction of gastric luminal factors, alterations in blood flow and intramucosal pH, and alterations in numerous factors that are normally responsible for maintaining an intact mucosa. The pathophysiology of stress ulceration is discussed, with an emphasis on cause-and-effect relationships, evolving areas of investigation, and implications for prophylaxis and treatment. 
Microbiological analysis of sepsis complicating non-surgical biliary drainage in malignant obstruction. Cholangitis with sepsis is a common complication of non-surgical biliary drainage and represents a difficult management problem. Microbiological data for 18 septic episodes in 15 patients following endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD) and 14 septic episodes in 14 patients following percutaneous transhepatic drainage (PTD) were reviewed. In the EBD group, all 18 patient episodes of sepsis had blood cultures and 10 had bile cultures obtained. In total, 17 gram-negative isolates and 5 gram-positive isolates were grown in the EBD sepsis group. All of the 14 PTD patients had bile cultures and 13 had blood cultures. In total, 23 gram-negative isolates and 26 gram-positive isolates were grown in the PTD sepsis group. When PTD cultures were compared with EBD cultures, there were significantly more gram-positive cultures (26 vs. 5) associated with PTD sepsis than EBD sepsis (p less than 0.0005). Analysis of the antibiotic sensitivities revealed that a combination of ticarcillin clavulanate with gentamicin covered 20 of the 22 (91%) EBD organisms and 38 of the 49 (78%) PTD organisms. Based on this data, ticarcillin clavulanate with gentamicin is the therapy of choice for EBD and PTD sepsis at our institution. 
Anaesthetic-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. A four-year-old deaf girl with a history of convulsions developed polymorphous ventricular tachycardia during induction of anaesthesia. The arrhythmia reverted to sinus rhythm spontaneously. Post-anaesthetic ECG showed marked prolongation of the QTc interval (570-690 msec). Deafness and prolonged QTc interval in association with microcytic-hypochromic anaemia confirmed the diagnosis of the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. This case report highlights the potentially lethal complication of halothane anaesthesia in patients with long QTc interval syndrome. 
Reduction of myocardial infarction after emergency coronary artery bypass grafting for failed coronary angioplasty with use of a normothermic reperfusion cardioplegia protocol. Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting is necessary in 2.7% to 13.5% of patients undergoing elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Myocardial infarction develops in 11% to 49% of these patients, with 18% to 46% of infarcts resulting in new Q waves. Since February 1987 a revised protocol for myocardial preservation has been used in 19 patients undergoing emergency bypass grafting for failed angioplasty. Cardioplegia is induced with a normothermic blood cardioplegic solution. Multiple maintenance doses of cold (4 degrees C) blood cardioplegic solution are then delivered through the aortic root and vein grafts. Before the aortic crossclamp is removed, normothermic reperfusion cardioplegic solution is delivered through the aortic root and vein grafts. This group was compared with all patients undergoing emergency bypass grafting for failed angioplasty before February 1987. These 45 patients received cold induction of cardioplegic solution, multiple maintenance doses of cold cardioplegic solution, and no reperfusion cardioplegic solution. The prevalence of myocardial infarction in the group receiving cold cardioplegic solution was 65% versus 26% in the group receiving normothermic cardioplegic solution (p less than 0.007). Multivariate analysis identified the use of the normothermic cardioplegia protocol (p less than 0.005), nontotal occlusion of the angioplasty vessel (p less than 0.03), and presence of collateral flow to the angioplasty vessel (p less than 0.04) as being independently associated with absence of myocardial infarction. 
The lower trapezius island musculocutaneous flap revisited. Report of 45 cases and a unifying concept of the vascular supply. The lower trapezius island musculocutaneous flap is valuable in head and neck reconstruction. It offers thin, pliable tissue and a long arc of rotation to reach virtually any defect in the head and neck. Recent reports have shown unacceptably high rates of failure and have questioned the reliability of the vascularity. We report our experience with 45 reconstructions using the lower trapezius island musculocutaneous flap. The literature is reviewed and the vascular anatomy is described in detail. The concept of angiosomes is applied to the trapezius muscle to help explain the reasons for flap failure and to provide guidelines for flap design and harvest. 
Perioperative chemotherapy in oral cancer. This is an interim report of a study of perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy following radical surgery for oral cancer, based on the hypothesis of Goldie and Coleman. 135 patients of alveolobuccal carcinoma, clinically stage III and IV, were entered on the protocol. After a curative resection, they were randomized. The test arm received methotrexate 50 mg/m2 on the 3rd, 10th, and 17th postoperative days. The control arm was only observed. This analysis at 12 months showed a disease free survival of 71% in the test arm vs. 45% in the control arm, which is statistically highly significant (P less than 0.01). Analysis of recurrence pattern showed that recurrence at the primary site was dramatically reduced during the first 6 postoperative months (P less than 0.01). Our study provided further clinical evidence in support of the concepts of Goldie and Coleman that the timing of chemotherapeutic drugs is very critical for a successful end result. 
Comparative evaluation of acid- and bile-induced damage to pedicled jejunal or colonic segments in the rat. The choice of the esophageal substitute after surgical resection for peptic stricture lies between the colon and jejunum. The current study was designed to compare long-term resistance of the colonic and jejunal mucosa to gastric or mixed duodenogastric secretions. The following preparations were performed in Wistar rats: transposition of a colonic or jejunal patch (a) to the gastric body, with or without truncal vagotomy, or (b) to the gastric antrum and proximal duodenum, with or without truncal vagotomy. Jejunal and colonic patches were removed 4, 8, and 12 months after surgery. The only damage to the transposed mucosae was the alteration of microvilli. The alteration was more severe in colonic than in jejunal patches and was prevented by truncal vagotomy. Long-term resistance of the transposed mucosae to the environmental challenge may depend on their adaptation potentiality, involving both specific and nonspecific mechanisms. Nonspecific mechanisms include the increased production of mucus and the gastric-like transformation of the superficial epithelial layer. Specific mechanisms include the reduction of the mucosal surface size for jejunal segments and the shifting in mucin secretion patterns for colonic segments. 
Are history and physical examination a good screening test for sleep apnea? OBJECTIVE: To determine whether presenting clinical history, pharyngeal examination, and the overall subjective impression of the clinician could serve as a sensitive screening test for sleep apnea. DESIGN: Blinded comparison of history and physical examination with results of nocturnal polysomnography. SETTING: Sleep clinic of a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 410 patients referred for suspected sleep apnea syndrome. Most patients reported snoring. MEASUREMENTS: All patients were asked standard questions and given an examination relevant to the diagnosis of the sleep apnea syndrome, and all had full nocturnal polysomnography. Patients with more than ten episodes of apnea or hypopnea per hour of sleep were classified as having sleep apnea. Stepwise linear logistic regression was used to develop two predictive models of sleep apnea: one based on the presence of characteristic clinical features, age, sex, and body mass index; and one based on subjective clinical impression. RESULTS: The prevalence of sleep apnea in our patients was 46%. Only age, body mass index, male sex, and snoring were found to be predictors of sleep apnea. The logistic rule discriminated between patients with and without sleep apnea (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] area, 0.77 [95% Cl, 0.73 to 0.82]). For patients with a predicted probability of apnea of less than 20%, the clinical model had 94% sensitivity and 28% specificity. Subjective impression alone identified correctly only 52% of patients with sleep apnea and had a specificity of 70%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a high predicted probability of the sleep apnea syndrome, subjective impression alone or any combination of clinical features cannot serve as a reliable screening test. However, in patients with a low predicted probability of sleep apnea, the model based on clinical data was sufficiently sensitive to permit about a 30% reduction in the number of unnecessary sleep studies. 
Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations in children hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay in sera of 118 children (median age, 1.7 years; range, 2 months-15 years) hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI). Both viral and bacterial ALRI were associated with elevated concentrations of TNF alpha. Concentrations greater than 40 ng/l were seen in children with bacterial or mixed ALRI in 64% and with viral ALRI in 50% of cases. Elevated concentrations were associated with longer duration of fever before admission (P less than .05) and with a higher serum C-reactive protein concentration (P less than .05). There were no significant differences in TNF alpha concentrations between gram-positive and gram-negative infections, nor was there an association with clinical severity of ALRI. TNF alpha concentrations decreased in most patients to normal within 5 days of hospitalization, irrespective of the etiology of the infection. 
Exercise testing and left main coronary artery stenosis. Can patients with left main disease be identified? Exercise testing is commonly used to evaluate patients with coronary artery disease who have serious anatomic characteristics. To study the characteristic exercise test variables in patients with left main coronary artery disease, the computerized data base of the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology Exercise Test Laboratory was used. Among 2,378 patients who had undergone a supine bicycle exercise test and who had abnormal coronary angiographic results, 65 patients with significant (greater than 50 percent diameter narrowing) stenosis of the left main coronary artery were found. The 65 patients were subgrouped according to their previous history and other vessel involvement. Nine patients had isolated left main coronary artery disease and no myocardial infarction (group 1); 28 patients had left main coronary artery stenosis and another diseased vessel but no prior myocardial infarction (MI) (group 2); and 28 patients had left main coronary artery disease, another diseased vessel, and a prior MI (group 3). For comparison, the 27 patients selected to be the control group (group C) had no history of MI but had significant stenosis of both the left anterior descending and the left circumflex arteries. Exercise time, calculated oxygen consumption, maximal work load, time to ST depression, prevalence of ST segment depression, and maximal ST depression were similar in the groups. Maximal heart rate and double product were higher in group 1, but we could find no single variable or group of variables characteristic of left main coronary artery disease. 
Cause of death in patients attending multiple sclerosis clinics. Between 1972 and 1988, 145 deaths occurred among 3,126 patients attending the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Clinics in Vancouver, British Columbia (N = 1,583), and London, Ontario (N = 1,543). We could determine the exact cause of death in 82.1% of cases (119 of 145). Of the 119 patients for whom the cause of death was known, 56 deaths (47.1%) were directly attributed to complications of MS. Of the remaining 63 deaths, 18 (28.6%) were suicides, 19 (30.2%) were due to malignancy, 13 (20.6%) to an acute myocardial infarction, seven (11.1%) to stroke, and the remainder (9.5%) to miscellaneous causes, of which two may have been suicides. The proportion of suicides among MS deaths was 7.5 times that for the age-matched general population, and the proportion of MS deaths from malignancy was 0.67 times that for the age-matched general population. The proportion of deaths due to malignancy and stroke was the same for the MS patients and the age-matched general population. 
A phase I study of high-dose ifosfamide and escalating doses of carboplatin with autologous bone marrow support. The dose-limiting toxicity in two separate phase I trials of the high-dose single agents ifosfamide and carboplatin was renal insufficiency at 18 g/m2 and hepatic and ototoxicity at 2,400 mg/m2, respectively. In this phase I study, 16 adults were treated with ifosfamide at 75% of the single-agent maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) (12 g/m2) and escalating doses of carboplatin (400 to 1,600 mg/m2) to determine the nonhematologic dose-limiting toxicity and the maximum-tolerated dose of the combination. Both drugs as well as mesna for uroprotection were given by continuous infusion over 4 days with an additional day of mesna (total dose per course, 15 g/m2). Autologous bone marrow support was stipulated for subsequent dose levels once granulocytes remained less than 500/microL for more than 14 days in two of three to five patients entered at a given dose level. Autologous bone marrow support was used at doses above the 400 mg/m2 carboplatin dose level. At the maximum-tolerated dose level of 1,600 mg/m2 of carboplatin, renal toxicity precluded further dose escalation. Of the five patients entered at this dose level, reversible creatinine elevation greater than 2 mg/dL (median peak, 2.6 mg/dL) was observed in three patients, and irreversible renal failure occurred in an additional patient (peak creatinine, 6.9 mg/dL. Transient gross hematuria appeared more common with the combination than with ifosfamide alone. Two patients developed severe somnolence and confusion associated with a rising creatinine. There were two complete (CRs) and four partial responses (PRs) in 14 heavily pretreated assessable patients (including four partial or complete responses in eight assessable patients with advanced refractory sarcoma, and one CR in two patients with germ cell carcinoma). Carboplatin and ifosfamide appear to have overlapping renal toxicity. Nevertheless, carboplatin and ifosfamide can be combined at 80% and 75% of the single-agent maximum-tolerated doses, respectively, with acceptable nonhematologic toxicity. Ifosfamide and carboplatin are an attractive core combination for further studies in the treatment of sarcoma, germ cell, ovarian, and lung carcinomas. 
A randomized, controlled study of behavioral intervention for chemotherapy distress in children with cancer. Fifty-four pediatric cancer patients were studied to determine the relative efficacy of two forms of behavioral intervention for reducing chemotherapy-related distress. Following baseline assessment, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either hypnosis, non-hypnotic distraction/relaxation, or attention placebo (control) during the subsequent identical chemotherapy course. Observational and interview measures of anticipatory and postchemotherapy nausea, vomiting, distress, and functional disruption served as outcome data. Results indicated that treatment condition was the single best predictor of change from baseline to intervention, with children in the hypnosis group reporting the greatest reduction of both anticipatory and postchemotherapy symptoms. The cognitive distraction/relaxation intervention appeared to have a maintenance effect in which symptoms did not get much worse or much better, while children in the control group had symptoms that consistently became worse over time. Emetic potential of the chemotherapy and the prophylactic use of antiemetics each appeared to contribute to the overall severity of symptoms. While the efficacy of hypnosis in the management of chemotherapy distress is supported, the complexities of interacting biologic and psychologic factors are highlighted. 
Fatal puerperal cerebral vasospasm and stroke in a young woman. A woman who experienced postpartum cerebral infarction, brain edema, and death is described. Angiography implicated cerebral vasospasm as the primary etiology. 
First-line management of sinusitis: a national problem? Overview. Traditional concepts of sinus disease as primarily involving the maxillary sinuses are giving way to understanding of the primary involvement of the ostiomeatal complex. Recognition of predisposing factors is also improving, as is localization of disease in the ethmoid, maxillary, frontal, and sphenoid sinuses. Because of the interdependence of the sinuses, acute sinusitis is rarely limited to one sinus. The diagnosis of acute disease is relatively easy compared with that of chronic sinusitis, which mimics many other conditions. Antibiotics and decongestants typically constitute initial therapy for acute sinusitis, and surgery is reserved for patients with threatened complications. The principal goal of this symposium is to outline the most rational approach to treatment of sinus disease on the basis of currently available diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Emphasis will be placed on first-line management, on therapeutic response, and on objective evaluation of therapeutic efficiency. 
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria with onset in childhood and adolescence. BACKGROUND. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal hematologic disorder characterized by hemoglobinuria, thrombosis, infection, and a tendency toward bone marrow aplasia. Onset usually occurs in adulthood. Few children and adolescents with PNH have been described, and data on diagnosis, clinical course, and survival in young patients are unavailable. METHODS. We retrospectively reviewed clinical and laboratory data on all patients 21 years old or younger in whom PNH had been diagnosed at Duke University Medical Center from 1966 to 1991. RESULTS. Medical records and clinical follow-up data were available for 26 young patients. Although 50 percent of adult patients present with hemoglobinuria, only four of our patients (15 percent) presented with this feature. In contrast, 15 of our patients (58 percent) had moderate or severe bone marrow failure at presentation, as compared with about 25 percent of adults in cases from the literature; all 26 patients eventually had evidence of bone marrow dysfunction. Eight patients (31 percent) have died, with a median survival of 13.5 years since their initial symptoms. CONCLUSIONS. Children and adolescents with PNH have a greater prevalence of bone marrow failure than do adults with this disorder, and their morbidity and mortality are high. Bone marrow transplantation should be considered for selected young patients with PNH. 
Malignant blue nevus. To elucidate the histologic features and biologic behavior of malignant blue nevus (MBN), 12 cases were analyzed in which the tumor showed no junctional activity and arose in a blue nevus background. Seven patients were men and five were women; their mean age was 48.8 years. Eight lesions were on the scalp, and no patient had a family history of melanoma. The histologic appearance of most lesions was a nodule or nodules of malignant cells in a blue nevus. Mitoses were present in all lesions with atypical forms in eight; however the mitotic rate exceeded two per ten high-power fields in only one lesion. Four lesions had necrosis, and four had a heavily pigmented malignant component. Four patients had recurrences; ten patients had metastases, and eight died of their disease. Therefore MBN is an aggressive neoplasm. 
Assessment of value of routine bone scans in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. The value of routine bone scans as a staging procedure was assessed in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. Records from 277 patients were reviewed retrospectively to determine the serum acid and alkaline phosphatases, the presence or absence of bone pain, and the results of bone scans and other radiographic studies at the time of initial diagnosis. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of an abnormal acid phosphatase, an abnormal alkaline phosphatase, and the presence of bone pain used in combination for assessing bone metastases. If at least one of these three parameters was present, the sensitivity was 97 percent, whereas if all three tests were normal, the specificity was 78 percent. The negative predictive value for all three tests combined is 99 percent. These results suggest that a routine bone scan to stage patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who have no bone pain and normal acid and alkaline phosphatases may not be warranted in all cases. 
Hypertensive heart disease in blacks. Although blacks may differ from whites in the response of hypertension to therapy, present data do not suggest that potential racial differences in cardiac structural adaptation to hypertension by themselves mandate a difference in therapeutic strategy. The results of large racially mixed trials of therapy that monitor LV mass regression, such as the VA Cooperative Monotherapy Trial, will be of interest in this regard. 
Association of Chlamydia pneumoniae (strain TWAR) infection with wheezing, asthmatic bronchitis, and adult-onset asthma OBJECTIVE--To study the clinical characteristics of respiratory tract illness caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae. DESIGN.-Prospective clinical, bacteriologic, and serologic study. Secondarily, a matched comparison of patients with and without evidence of C pneumoniae infection (serologic titers greater than or equal to 1:64 and less than 1:16, respectively). SETTING.--Four primary care (family practice) clinics in Madison, Wis, and nearby towns. PATIENTS.--The study included 365 white males and females (mean age, 34.2 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Association of acute C pneumoniae infection with signs and symptoms of respiratory illness and the relationship of C pneumoniae antibody titer with wheezing at the time of enrollment in the study, and with the diagnosis of asthmatic bronchitis. RESULTS.--Nine (47%) of 19 patients with acute C pneumoniae infection had bronchospasm during respiratory illness, and there was a strong quantitative association of C pneumoniae titer with wheezing at the time of enrollment in the study (P = .01). In the matched study, C pneumoniae antibody was significantly associated with asthmatic bronchitis after, but not before, respiratory illness (odds ratio, 7.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.2 to 23.4). Four infected patients had newly diagnosed asthma after illness, and four others had exacerbation of previously diagnosed asthma. There was no serologic evidence of coexisting Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, or respiratory viral infection in 96% of patients with asthmatic bronchitis and asthma. CONCLUSIONS.--Some C pneumoniae antibody titers, although not diagnostic of chlamydial infection by present criteria, probably represent acute reinfection or ongoing chronic infection. Repeated or prolonged exposure to C pneumoniae may have a causal association with wheezing, asthmatic bronchitis, and asthma. 
Pigmented postacne osteoma cutis in a patient treated with minocycline: report and review of the literature. Postacne osteoma cutis is a rare complication of acne vulgaris. If it occurs during a course of tetracycline or minocycline therapy, pigmented osteomas can occur as a result of tetracycline or minocycline bone complexes. We report a case of pigmented postacne osteoma cutis that developed after extensive acne surgery and a 2- to 3-month course of minocycline. Previously reported cases have been treated surgically, but our patient responded to 0.05% tretinoin cream, with transepidermal elimination of some osteomas. 
Correlation of motor units with strength and spectral characteristics in polio survivors and controls. The purpose of this study was to determine whether quantitative motor unit analysis in postpolio individuals correlates with muscle strength, endurance, work capacity, or power spectral characteristics of surface EMG and to determine whether power spectrum differentiates postpolio from control subjects. This study was designed to compare these variables in 34 symptomatic postpolio, 16 asymptomatic postpolio, and 41 control subjects. Quantitative motor unit analysis of the quadriceps femoris muscle was performed using a concentric needle electrode. Isometric knee extension peak torque, endurance (time to exhaustion) at 40% of maximal torque, work capacity (tension time index), and recovery of force through 10 minutes post-exhaustion were determined. Median frequency of the surface power spectrum was determined during the above testing. Power spectrum histograms were compared at the onset and termination of endurance exercise. Motor unit action potential variables did not correlate with isometric peak torque, tension time index, endurance time, recovery of strength, or with median frequency. Surface power spectrum did not differentiate postpolio from control subjects. 
Diverticulitis of the duodenum: clinical and radiological manifestations of seven cases. Seven patients with duodenal diverticulitis were evaluated by computed tomography (CT) and various other abdominal imaging techniques. The series included four men and three women who ranged in age from 47 to 84 yr (mean: 65 yr). They had presented with epigastric or periumbilical pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and loss of appetite and weight due to postprandial cramps or vomiting. In each instance, the abdominal CT examination proved crucial in the diagnosis of duodenal diverticulitis, with contained perforation or inflammatory changes involving the adjacent structures. Five patients underwent laparotomy while two others were treated conservatively with antibiotics and/or percutaneous drainage of peridiverticular abscess. The clinical and radiological features of this uncommon entity are herein described, along with a brief review of the medical literature regarding the current approach to its diagnosis and management. 
Arrhythmogenic effects of graded coronary blood flow reductions superimposed on prior myocardial infarction in dogs. BACKGROUND. We studied arrhythmogenesis and its underlying pathophysiology during graded reductions of coronary blood flow, superimposed on prior myocardial infarction to test the hypothesis that spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and induced ventricular tachycardia are dependent on different patterns of coronary flow reduction in hearts with prior myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. In 10 sham-operated dogs (control group) and 24 dogs with 3-week-old experimental apical myocardial infarction, the left circumflex coronary artery was constricted to produce four grades of flow reduction: 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Among the sham-operated control animals, only one of 10 (10%) developed spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and only two of nine (22%) were inducible into sustained ventricular tachycardia during 100% circumflex coronary artery flow reduction. No spontaneous ventricular fibrillation or inducible ventricular tachycardia occurred with lesser grades (25%, 50%, or 75%) of flow reduction among the control animals. In the myocardial infarction group, five of 24 dogs (21%) were inducible before flow reduction. However, 50% flow reduction in the myocardial infarction group resulted in inducibility of ventricular tachycardia in 12 of 24 dogs (50%); nine of 16 (56%) during 75% flow reduction; and six of 11 (55%) with 100% flow reduction. In addition, none of the dogs in the myocardial infarction group developed spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during 25% or 50% flow reduction, whereas six of 22 (27%) developed ventricular fibrillation during 75% flow reduction and 10 of 21 (48%) during 100% flow reduction. In dogs with spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during flow reduction, the total myocardial mass of the ischemic "risk" zone and infarcted zone was significantly greater than in those without spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (68 +/- 5% versus 56 +/- 6% [p less than 0.01]). There was no difference in the total myocardial mass of the ischemic risk zone and infarcted zone between dogs with and without inducible ventricular tachycardia during flow reduction. CONCLUSIONS. In canine model of subacute myocardial infarction, superimposed ischemia increased the likelihood of inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia with lesser grades of coronary flow reduction compared with that necessary to allow spontaneous ventricular fibrillation. The underlying pathophysiology appears to differ between spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and electrically induced sustained ventricular tachycardia. 
Diagnosis and cure of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias during a single electrophysiologic test BACKGROUND. We conducted this study to determine the feasibility of an abbreviated therapeutic approach to the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, in which the diagnosis is established and radiofrequency ablation carried out during a single electrophysiologic test. METHODS. One hundred six consecutive patients were referred for the management of documented, symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (66 patients) or the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (40 patients). All agreed to undergo a diagnostic electrophysiologic test and catheter ablation with radiofrequency current. No patient had had such a test previously. RESULTS. Among the 66 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, the mechanism was found to be atrioventricular nodal reentry in 46 (70 percent) (typical in 44 and atypical in 2), atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia involving a concealed accessory pathway in 16 (24 percent), atrial tachycardia in 2 (3 percent), and noninducible paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in 2 (3 percent). A successful long-term outcome was achieved in 57 of 62 patients (92 percent) with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in whom ablation was attempted and in 37 of 40 patients (93 percent) with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. The only complications were one instance of occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery, leading to acute myocardial infarction, and one instance of complete atrioventricular block. The mean (+/- SD) duration of the electrophysiologic procedures was 114 +/- 55 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. The diagnosis and cure of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome during a single electrophysiologic test are feasible and practical and have a favorable risk-benefit ratio. This abbreviated therapeutic approach may eliminate the need for serial electropharmacologic testing, long-term drug therapy, antitachycardia pacemakers, and surgical ablation. 
Liposarcoma of the thyroid gland. Fine-needle aspiration cytology, immunohistology, and ultrastructure. A 56-year-old woman presented with a rapidly growing tumoral mass of the thyroid. In fine-needle aspirates, neoplastic cells were interpreted as undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinoma. In contrast, histologic examination of tissue samples revealed a tumor with features suggestive of myxoid liposarcoma. The non-epithelial nature was confirmed by immunohistochemical and electron microscopic evaluation. Immunostains for vimentin and S-100 protein were positive, whereas no reactivity was obtained for epithelial markers. Ultrastructurally, the tumor consisted of poorly differentiated mesenchymal cells and lipoblastic elements in various stages of differentiation. Review of the literature reveals only one previous report of thyroid liposarcoma, the diagnosis of which was based on conventional light microscopic studies. 
Potent cytodifferentiating agents related to hexamethylenebisacetamide. Bishydroxamic acids are effective inducers of differentiation in murine erythroleukemia cells. Flexible analogs of suberic acid bisdimethylamide are approximately 100 times as active as the parent compound or hexamethylenebisacetamide. They also induce differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) and a subclone of human colon carcinoma cells (HT-29-U4). Some rigid bishydroxamic acids with benzene rings in the spacers are even more active toward murine erythroleukemia cells but show curious biological differences. In contrast to the flexible molecules, those with benzene spacers show poor activity toward HL-60 cells; they also have different geometric requirements, and they are not additive with hexamethylenebisacetamide in their effect. It is likely that rigid bishydroxamic acids, with a benzene ring spacer, induce differentiation by a different mechanism in spite of their chemical resemblance to the flexible bisamide and bishydroxamic acid inducers. 
Percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty of lesions not ideal for balloon angioplasty BACKGROUND. Excimer laser coronary angioplasty is a new, investigational technique for treating coronary artery stenoses. Initial reports have demonstrated acute efficacy and relative safety of this procedure, but have not addressed the effect of lesion type on acute success and complication rates. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the first 100 patients undergoing percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty at our institution, acute laser success was obtained in 84% and procedural success was obtained in 94%. There were six acute closures during laser angioplasty and one myocardial infarction. Two patients required emergency coronary bypass surgery. Sixty-five percent of patients had lesions not ideal for balloon angioplasty because of lesion morphology (tubular, diffuse, or chronic total occlusion) or ostial location. There were 10 tubular stenoses, 29 diffuse lesions, 18 chronic total occlusions, and eight ostial lesions, including five aorto-ostial lesions. In this nonideal subgroup, the acute success rate with laser was 86% (72% of chronic total occlusions and 91% of non-totally occluded lesions), and the procedural success rate was 94%. There were three acute occlusions during laser angioplasty but no myocardial infarctions, emergency bypass surgeries, or deaths. One coronary artery perforation occurred without clinical sequelae. Laser angioplasty was successful in four of six lesions (67%) in which balloon angioplasty had failed. Laser success was obtained in 10 of 11 (91%) moderately or heavily calcified stenoses. Eight eccentric lesions and two lesions on bends were successfully treated without dissection or perforation. No side branch occlusions occurred in the 15 patients in whom one or more major branches originated within the lesion treated. Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed in 47% of cases, usually to obtain a larger final luminal diameter. Need for adjunctive balloon angioplasty decreased to 36% after a larger (2.0 mm) laser catheter became available. Twenty-eight percent of the 105 lesions treated were American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification type A, 47% were type B, and 25% were type C. Laser and procedural successes were obtained in 83% and 97% of type A, 88% and 96% of type B, and 85% and 88% of type C lesions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. In our initial experience, excimer laser angioplasty was found to be acutely effective and safe therapy for lesions identified as not ideal for balloon angioplasty. This technique may provide a useful adjunct or alternative to balloon angioplasty in selected patients. 
Management of bleeding liver tumours in Hong Kong. A retrospective study was undertaken of 41 patients diagnosed as having suffered spontaneous liver rupture over a 4-year period to identify the clinical features, treatment and outcome of this complication in an area in which hepatocellular carcinoma is endemic. Two patients were excluded with a revised diagnosis of haemorrhagic malignant ascites. Of the remaining 39 patients, 37 bled from ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma, one from peliosis hepatis and multiple liver cell adenomas, and one from a malignant hepatic epithelioid haemangioendothelioma. Analysis showed that 59 per cent of patients were in shock on admission and that all but two of the 37 patients with ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma were men with cirrhosis. The association with cirrhosis was significantly higher than in a series of 45 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing elective resection during the same period (P less than 0.05). Treatment consisted of supportive care only in two patients, angiographic embolization in four, emergency liver resection in 11 of whom six died, hepatic artery ligation in 12 of whom eight died, and suture and/or packing in eight of whom six died. One patient died at laparotomy and in another patient bleeding was successfully arrested by intratumoural injection of absolute alcohol. Because of the high operative mortality of emergency surgery in these poor risk patients, prospective evaluation of emergency angiographic embolization is required. 
Where there is no anaesthetist.... In an unselected series of 254 operations representing a wide range of surgical, obstetric and gynaecological procedures carried out on the small Pacific island of Tuvalu, the majority (85 per cent) involved the lower half of the body. In all cases but one anaesthesia was administered by a non-specialist. In operations below the level of the diaphragm epidural anaesthesia was usually used with a success rate of 96 per cent. In the upper half of the body ketamine was used where local or regional block was insufficient. Only one operation was performed under general inhalation anaesthesia. The overall postoperative mortality rate was 0.4 per cent and the morbidity rate was 13 per cent. Only two minor complications were attributed to the anaesthetic method used. In situations where anaesthetists are not available, epidural and ketamine anaesthesia in the hands of non-specialists are safe and practical options to general inhalation anaesthesia and are appropriate for most surgical procedures. 
Lupus anticoagulant inhibition of in vitro prostacyclin release is associated with a thrombosis-prone subset of patients. PURPOSE: The effect of lupus anticoagulant-containing sera on endothelial prostacyclin generation (both basal and after thrombin stimulation) was determined. Subsets of patients who had experienced arterial, venous, or no thrombosis were compared with respect to the quantitation of antiphospholipid antibody and effects on prostacyclin production. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum antiphospholipid antibodies were detected in 26 patients by immunologic (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and kinetic (anticoagulant) assays. Cultured human endothelial cells were exposed to patient or normal serum, and the release of prostacyclin was determined by radioimmunoassay of supernatants. Release was determined in the absence and presence of the secretagogue, thrombin (1 U/mL), corrected for interassay variation, and correlated with other clinical and laboratory variables. RESULTS: The normal prostacyclin response was a 2.5-fold increase after thrombin (1 U/mL) compared to basal production. Patients with a history of arterial thrombosis (Group 1, n = 10) had the highest IgG anticardiolipin antibody titers (449 +/- 115 [OD x 1,000]), most prolonged kaolin clotting times (140 +/- 15 seconds), and the least prostacyclin response to thrombin (1.36-fold). Patients with venous thrombosis (Group 2, n = 6) had lower titers (329 +/- 120), intermediate clotting times (125 +/- 19 seconds), and slightly impaired prostacyclin responses (2.18-fold). Patients with no history of thrombosis (Group 3, n = 10) had low antibody titers (220 +/- 20), mildly prolonged clotting times (108 +/- 6 seconds), and normal prostacyclin responses (2.33-fold). Patient serum did not alter basal or arachidonate-induced prostacyclin production. Group 1 had significantly lower platelet counts (99 +/- 19) compared to Group 2 (167 +/- 35) or Group 3 (167 +/- 34), but were similar in age and associated diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of prostacyclin responses is commonly found in serum from patients with lupus anticoagulants, and is likely to be present in patients with high IgG anticardiolipin antibodies, strong lupus anticoagulants, low platelet counts, and a recent arterial thrombosis. 
Interrelationship between activation of dopaminergic pathways and cerebrospinal fluid concentration of dopamine tetrahydroisoquinoline metabolite salsolinol in humans: preliminary findings. The main objective of this study was to determine whether the activation of dopaminergic pathways, through adrenal-caudate transplantation, stimulated the production of dopamine and salsolinol in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease. Dopamine sulfate and salsolinol sulfate in CSF specimens were measured by radioenzymatic technique. The results of this study demonstrated that the replacement of degenerative nigrostriatal neurons with new dopamine-producing cells by adrenal brain transplants in patients with Parkinson's disease resulted in significant increase (p less than 0.05) in CSF levels of free dopamine, dopamine sulfate, free salsolinol, and salsolinol sulfate as compared with preoperative levels. Moreover, the oral administration of L-dopa to these transplanted patients caused substantial (p less than 0.001) elevation in CSF levels of free dopamine (before L-dopa, 146 +/- 57 pg/ml; after L-dopa, 575 +/- 207 pg/ml), dopamine sulfate (before L-dopa, 1966 +/- 945 pg/ml; after L-dopa, 41679 +/- 29326 pg/ml), free salsolinol (before L-dopa, 43 +/- 29 pg/ml; after L-dopa, 186 +/- 90 pg/ml), and salsolinol sulfate (before L-dopa, 405 +/- 477 pg/ml; after L-dopa, 2908 +/- 2572 pg/ml), respectively. 
Use of mammography in screening for breast cancer. Recognizing the enormous impact that quality breast screening mammography can have on reducing breast cancer deaths, we need to determine when women's and physician's perceived restrictions for mammography examination impede the progress of its use for early cancer detection. A uniform system should emphasize valid communication and education between women and their physicians. Women seek to have a voice in their medical treatment. Yet that responsibility has an emotional price. Physicians and patients must decide together on the most appropriate strategies to enhance communication and adopt specific guidelines they will adhere to, to detect and cure early breast cancer. Women must be educated about breast screening mammography, and physicians must increase their efforts to proclaim its importance. Women need be assured the trend is toward using the most modern mammographic techniques. Quality medical care is medicine's purpose and in women's best interest. At present, no other diagnostic method is equivalent to mammography and capable of providing an equivalent impact on improving the detection and cure rate of breast cancer. Despite medical activities designed to reduce uncertainty in medicine, scientific evidence has not provided systematic answers as to the "best" way to approach issues of quality, cost, accessibility, or communication for breast screening mammography. No particular expert opinion or preference prevails for breast screening protocols. What is needed is adoption of a multidisciplinary approach, educating and motivating women and physicians to participate in breast screening activities. With trends directed toward high-volume breast screening operations, low-cost, quality mammography must be available and be impeccably performed. Some activities are natural subjects for financial quantification. It is objectionable to assume, however, that we can accurately place and agree on dollar amounts alone to represent the costs and benefits of screening mammography. The gaps between practices and attitudes about the benefits, risks, and costs of screening mammography suggest that people are not satisfied with the way physicians, women, influential groups, or regulatory agencies are balancing all of the elements. Better communication must exist between physicians and their peer groups involved in performing responsible mammography. Better communication must be achieved between physicians and women to take advantage of the usefulness of quality breast screening mammography. High-quality screening programs must be linked to third-party reimbursement and to legislation, if we are to make a difference. Screening mammography deserves our medical, economic, social, and political attention and action. 
Delayed sternal closure for life-threatening complications in cardiac operations: an update. Over a 7-year-period, 25 patients had delayed sternal closure after open heart operations out of 34 patients whose sternum was not closed. The indications were extreme cardiac dilatation and uncontrollable mediastinal hemorrhage. This represented a 1.79% incidence in the overall open heart surgical experience at our unit. Sternal closure was performed at a mean of 2.64 days after the initial operation. Eighteen patients (52.9%) left the hospital alive and well, representing a 72% survival rate among patients undergoing delayed sternal closure. No mediastinal or fatal infection developed and only 1 patient had late superficial wound infection after delayed sternal closure. We conclude that delayed sternal closure is an effective method to treat severe complications after cardiac operations. 
Cerebellorubral degeneration after resection of cerebellar dentate nucleus neoplasms: evaluation with MR imaging. The authors describe the magnetic resonance (MR) findings in seven patients who developed severe cerebellar symptoms and atrophy of the contralateral red nucleus following removal of unilateral neoplasms in the deep nuclei of the cerebellum. For most patients, pre- and postoperative spin-echo MR images were obtained with long repetition times (TRs) at 1.5 T. The long TR images obtained before surgery demonstrated unilateral masses involving the dentate nucleus. Long TR images obtained after surgical resection of the dentate nucleus showed increased signal intensity in all of seven contralateral red nuclei, three of seven ipsilateral superior cerebellar peduncles, and two of seven contralateral inferior olivary nuclei. Three other patients who underwent surgery for cerebellar neoplasms without resection of the dentate nuclei showed no postoperative brain stem changes on MR images. The authors speculate that the changes in the contralateral red nuclei are due to cerebellorubral degeneration (since well-described neural tracts interconnect the dentate nucleus and the contralateral red nucleus). Injury of the dentate nucleus may result in degeneration of distant neural connections. 
N-terminal pro atrial natriuretic peptide in human plasma. N-Terminal pro ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) in human plasma has been measured by radioimmunoassay after extraction on Sep-Pak cartridges. Immunoreactive N-terminal pro ANP circulates in human plasma at higher levels than alpha-hANP (approximately 20-fold higher in normal subjects) and was elevated in patients with essential hypertension, cardiac transplantation and patients with chronic renal failure. In chronic renal failure patients undergoing hemodialysis, C-terminal ANP (ANP 99-126), but not N-terminal ANP, declined significantly after dialysis. Gel filtration experiments demonstrated a single peak of N-terminal ANP immunoreactivity, eluting in parallel with synthetic human pro ANP 1-67, indicating a similar molecular size and the absence of low molecular weight N-terminal fragments. 
Activity of intrapleural recombinant gamma-interferon in malignant mesothelioma. Twenty-two consecutive patients with malignant diffuse pleural mesothelioma were treated with recombinant gamma-interferon by the intrapleural route. Diagnosis was made by thoracoscopic examination and all cases were confirmed by the French Mesothelioma Panel of Pathologist. Patients were staged based on thoracoscopic examination and computed tomography (CT) scan: 12 patients were classified as Stage I and 10 were Stage II. A solution of gamma-interferon (40 X 106 U) was infused twice a week over 2 months. Every patient experienced fever. One patient had a Grade 2 leukopenia and one patient suffered from pleural empyema. Response evaluation was based on the following: (1) CT scan performed 2 weeks after treatment ended, and (2) repeat thoracoscopic examination with histopathologic verification in nine patients who had demonstrated a stabilization or a regression of the disease on CT scan. From the original group, 19 patients could be evaluated. Four complete thoracoscopic histopathologic responses and one partial response were observed in Stage I patients (56%). One partial response was observed in Stage II patients. 
Hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism due to hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic to the adrenal gland. Metastases to the adrenal glands are common in patients with cancer, but among those affected, hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism is noted very rarely. A case of hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism secondary to metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma is reported. Laboratory data revealed selective aldosterone deficiency with hyperreninemia. Biopsy documented replacement of the adrenal glands with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. A review of the literature disclosed that the present case was an extremely rare one of its kind. 
Controlling gastric pH: the impact of newer agents on the critically ill patient. The critically ill patient is at increased risk for developing erosive injury of the stomach, duodenum, and esophagus. To date, the most effective way to prevent and treat this problem is by assuring excellent intensive care support and by reducing gastric acid secretion. The histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are effective in both prevention and treatment of such gastric mucosal injury. Newer agents are available that have potential for use in this setting, although none have been studied as extensively in critically ill patients as have the H2RAs. These new agents include proglumide, pirenzepine, misoprostol, omeprazole, and somatostatin. To date, only the latter has been extensively studied in critically ill patients. Omeprazole, which suppresses acid very effectively, may be problematic in the critically ill, limited by its oral dosage form, acid-labile properties, and potential drug interactions. 
Beta-adrenergic-antagonist drugs in the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices. An analysis of data and prognostic factors in 589 patients from four randomized clinical trials. Franco-Italian Multicenter Study Group. BACKGROUND. The value of beta-adrenergic-antagonist drug therapy for the prevention of initial episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices is uncertain, both positive and negative study results having been reported. METHODS. In this study, we analyzed data on individual patients from four randomized, controlled trials to assess the efficacy of this treatment. Of the 589 patients studied, 286 received a beta-adrenergic-antagonist drug (propranolol in 203 and nadolol in 83) and 303 received placebo. RESULTS. After two years, the mean (+/- SE) percentage of patients who had had no upper gastrointestinal bleeding was 78 +/- 3 percent in the beta-adrenergic-antagonist treatment group and 65 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.002). The percentage of patients without fatal bleeding was 90 +/- 2 percent in the treatment group and 82 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.01). The percentage of patients surviving after two years was 71 +/- 3 percent in the treatment group and 68 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.34). After age and severity of cirrhosis were taken into account, the survival rate was better in the treatment group (P = 0.09). The percentage of surviving patients who had had no bleeding after two years was 62 +/- 3 percent in the treatment group and 53 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.04). Both propranolol and nadolol prevented a first episode of bleeding. Severe cirrhosis and especially the presence of ascites were associated with bleeding (P less than 0.001) and death (P less than 0.001) in both groups. The efficacy of beta-adrenergic-antagonist therapy in the prevention of bleeding (P less than 0.001) and of fatal bleeding (P = 0.004) and in the prevention of bleeding or death (P = 0.005) was the same after adjustment for cause and severity of cirrhosis, ascites, and size of varices. CONCLUSIONS. Propranolol and nadolol are effective in preventing first bleeding and reducing the mortality rate associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis, regardless of severity. 
Effect of irreversible dermal necrosis on phagocytic activity of reticuloendothelial system. A model of full-thickness dermal necrosis was produced in rats by the application of liquid nitrogen to a 20% total body surface area of the dorsal skin surface. In this model there was an alteration of reticuloendothelial system phagocytic activity of the lung and spleen as measured by the uptake of technetium 99m-labeled sulfur colloid in vivo. The present results suggest that marked alterations in reticuloendothelial system phagocytic activity can be produced by full-thickness dermal necrosis in the absence of heat. 
Iodine 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid [published erratum appears in South Med J 1991 Jul;84(7):816, 937] We have presented a case of sporadic medullary carcinoma of the thyroid with documentation of localization of tracer 131I-MIBG within the primary neoplasm. A review of the nuclear medicine literature of localization techniques for MCT demonstrates that 131I-MIBG, while an excellent choice for diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma, produces low yield and unpredictable concentration in other neural crest apudomas, including MCT. A low incidence of true-positive results with 131I-MIBG uptake and a high incidence of false-negative results make this radiopharmaceutical a suboptimal choice for diagnostic studies, but a potentially promising one as a therapeutic agent. 
Treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome with cyclosporin A in children. Cyclosporin A (CyA, Sandimmun) was given to 71 children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, 45 of whom were steroid-dependent with signs of steroid toxicity, and 23 who were steroid-resistant. Cyclosporin A was effective in 80% of the steroid-dependent patients, allowing cessation of corticosteroid treatment. However, most of these patients relapsed when CyA was tapered or withdrawn. In these patients, CyA may be required for long periods of time. Conversely, CyA was less effective in steroid-resistant patients; only 7% achieved remission with CyA alone. Cyclosporin A in association with prednisone may be an effective alternative as 8 out of 14 patients entered remission with this treatment combination. Serial renal biopsies were performed in 43 patients to evaluate the potential nephrotoxicity of the treatment. Eighteen patients developed significant tubulointerstitial lesions which were attributable to CyA nephrotoxicity. The risk of developing chronic nephrotoxicity appears to be higher in steroid-resistant patients, and was not related to the duration of treatment. Cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity can develop in patients with normal renal function. 
Calcium metabolism in hypertension and allied metabolic disorders. Data suggest a critical role for Ca metabolism in the pathophysiology of hypertensive disease. Intracellularly, all hypertension displays elevated cytosolic free-Ca2+ and suppressed free-Mg2+ levels. Extracellularly, however, heterogeneous defects in Ca and Mg metabolism are observed. This apparent divergence may be explained by considering all hypertension as the expression, in varying degrees, of two underlying Ca-related mechanisms: one (salt sensitive, low renin, Ca(2+)-antagonist sensitive) dependent on inappropriate cellular Ca2+ uptake from the extracellular space and the other (salt insensitive, renin dependent, Ca(2+)-antagonist insensitive) dependent on increased cellular Ca2+ release from intracellular sites. Recent work highlights the role of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and the newly described parathyroid hypertensive factor in volume-dependent low-renin forms of hypertension. Altered cellular ion handling may also explain metabolic and clinical correlates of hypertension, e.g., peripheral insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Thus, all subjects with NIDDM, whether hypertensive or not, display the same elevated cytosolic free-Ca2+ and suppressed free-Mg2+ levels observed in hypertension. Furthermore, adiposity, the level of blood pressure, and fasting and postglucose hyperinsulinemia are all closely and quantitatively related to intracellular free-Ca2+, free-Mg2+, and pH levels. This suggests a broader hypothesis, in which hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, and NIDDM, each usually considered a distinct clinical entity, represent different clinical expressions of a common defect in cellular ion handling, hence explaining their frequent clinical coexistence in the general population. 
Model for studying virus attachment. II. Binding of biotinylated human T cell leukemia virus type I to human blood mononuclear cells potential targets for human T cell leukemia virus type I infection. Purified human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) was biotinylated and used to study its attachment to human PBMC. The use of biotinylated HTLV-I (biot-HTLV-I) in conjunction with mouse mAb specific for selected cell-surface molecules and flow cytometric analysis allowed us to positively identify virus-binding cells among a heterogeneous blood mononuclear cell population. Biot-HTLV-I efficiently bound not only to T cells, but also to B cells and monocytes. Preincubation of monocytes with excess of unlabeled HTLV-I significantly reduced the attachment of biot-HTLV-I. HTLV-I not only bound to, but also infected, B cells, as suggested by: i) in situ hybridization of a 35S-labeled full length HTLV-I DNA probe with EBV-transformed B cells, previously cocultured with HTLV-I-producing (G11MJ) T cells, and ii) hybridization of the same nick-translated 32P-labeled DNA probe with blotted DNA from similar HTLV-I-infected EBV-transformed B cells. HTLV-I infection did not affect the ability of B cells to secrete IgG. These findings suggest that HTLV-I cannot only infect cells of the T lineage, but can also infect B cells. 
In vivo thrombus formation on a guidewire during intravascular ultrasound imaging: evidence for inadequate heparinization. We present a case in which thrombus formation on a guidewire was visualized during intravascular ultrasound imaging despite the administration of 10,000 units of heparin sulfate prior to the procedure. Gross thrombus formation was confirmed upon removal of the guidewire. The activated clotting time was found to be 191 s, suggesting heparin resistance. This report graphically illustrates the potential thrombogenicity associated with intravascular guidewire manipulation during procedures such as intravascular ultrasound imaging and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Moreover, this case suggests that adequate heparinization should be routinely verified by measuring the activated clotting time prior to introducing a guidewire into the arterial system. 
Infections with Chryseomonas luteola (CDC group Ve-1) and Flavimonas oryzihabitans (CDC group Ve-2) in neurosurgical patients. During a 20-month period at Temple University Hospital, three cases of infection with bacteria of the Ve group--Chryseomonas luteola (CDC group Ve-1) and Flavimonas oryzihabitans (CDC group Ve-2)--were seen in neurosurgical patients. Two of the patients, including one with what is thought to be the first reported case of meningitis due to C. luteola, had complications caused by prosthetic material. A review of the literature revealed 14 well-described cases of infection with C. luteola or F. oryzihabitans, the majority of which were cases of bacteremia or peritonitis in patients undergoing dialysis. The presence of foreign material and the use of corticosteroids may predispose to and influence the course of disease. As prosthetic material becomes even more widely used, the incidence of infection with bacteria of the Ve group will likely increase and the manifestations of the infections will probably become more varied. 
The use of absorbable sutures in laser-assisted microvascular anastomoses. The efficacy of the laser in performing microvascular anastomoses has been well established in the laboratory using a number of wavelengths. These studies have concluded that laser-assisted microvascular anastomoses are at least comparable to, if not superior to, ordinary suture techniques. The advantages have been the diminished foreign body reaction that occurs as a consequence of using only a few stay sutures to hold the vessels in approximation while the laser bonding is performed, as well as the rapidity of the surgery. We have already shown that absorbable sutures (polyglactin 910) are as efficacious as standard nonabsorbable sutures (nylon) in both arterial and venous microanastomoses. The current study was undertaken to see if the foreign body reaction could be diminished even further by the use of absorbable 10.0 sutures and compare these findings to laser-assisted microvascular anastomoses performed with nonabsorbable sutures. The carbon dioxide milliwatt laser was used to perform laser-assisted microvascular anastomoses in rat femoral arteries and veins. Patency rates and histological response were compared at intervals of 3 days and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Both arterial and venous patency rates were comparable (overall absorbable, 91.2%-52/57; overall nonabsorbable, 87.7%-50/57), as was the degree of inflammation and fibrosis. We conclude that absorbable sutures can be used for laser-assisted microvascular anastomoses and have the potential of allowing healing to occur without any foreign material within the surgical site. 
Immunomodulation of the induction phase of lymphokine-activated killer activity by acute phase proteins. Effective treatment of head and neck cancer with biologic response modifiers may be benefitted by an understanding of in vivo factors capable of modulating the lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell phenomenon. Eighteen patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were studied. Killer cells from each patient, activated by recombinant interleukin-2 (10 U/ml), were induced in either complete medium alone or complete medium plus 10% autologous serum solution and analyzed. Cytotoxicity against both K562 and squamous cell carcinoma (MDA686-Ln) cell lines was determined by use of standard chromium-release assays. The immunomodulatory capacity of serum was correlated with levels of various acute phase proteins. Autologous serum significantly inhibited the induction phase of the LAK phenomenon in 61% of patients and stimulated it in 22%. No patients with early stage I or II disease had significant inhibition of induction. No direct correlation between inhibition and serum acute phase protein levels were seen. An inverse relationship was seen between the C3 component of complement and induction inhibition (r = -0.6). These findings suggest that advances of in vivo immunomodulatory therapy will require elucidation of mechanisms of serologic inhibition of the induction phase of the LAK phenomenon. Such studies may lead to serologic modification to enhance treatment efficacy of biologic response modifiers. 
Diffuse esophageal spasm. A rare motility disorder not characterized by high-amplitude contractions. Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) has frequently been described as a motility disorder characterized by simultaneous, high-amplitude contractions. We reviewed the results of esophageal manometry testing on a total of 1480 patients referred to our lab over 36 months. Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure was determined by a mean of four station pull-through. Esophageal body motility was assessed following 10 wet swallows. In our lab a diagnosis of DES is made when greater than 10% but less than 100% of contractions are simultaneous. Manometric findings of DES were rare, with an overall prevalence of 4% (56/1480). Of the 56 patients with a manometric diagnosis of DES, high-amplitude (mean greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg) peristaltic contractions were found in only two (4%). No simultaneous contractions with amplitude greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg were seen. Pressures of simultaneous contractions were consistently lower than peristaltic contractions. A hypertensive LES pressure (greater than or equal to 45 mm Hg) was present in 5/56 DES patients (9%). Poor LES relaxation was found in 7/56 DES patients (13%). We conclude that DES is a rare manometric finding, regardless of the reason for referral, and that the occurrence of high-amplitude contractions in DES is equally rare. 
Proteins of the complement system and acute phase reactants in sera of patients with spinal cord injury. Complement activity was studied in patients with spinal cord transection. In some sera acute phase reactants: haptoglobin, C-reactive proteins, ceruloplasmin, as well as fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products, and immune complexes were monitored. Complement and acute phase reactants are increased in a majority of patients. Continuing inflammation and release of inflammatory mediators could be responsible for poor healing that commonly occurs in spinal cord injury. Urinary tract and other infections are associated with some but not all of the protein abnormalities. These proinflammatory proteins may contribute to the lack of healing of spinal transection. 
The influence of severity of spinal cord ischemia in the etiology of delayed-onset paraplegia. To clarify the cause of delayed-onset paraplegia, the authors evaluated the neurologic outcome after temporary (10 to 30 minutes) spinal cord ischemia in the awake rabbit. Loss of motor function occurred in less than 2 minutes in all animals. Restoration of flow within 16 minutes always resulted in full return of function, whereas with occlusion times of greater than 27 minutes all animals remained paralyzed. After temporary occlusion of 20 to 21 minutes, however, 71% of animals returned to normal neurologic function but developed delayed-onset paraplegia 14 to 48 hours later. This appears to be a reliable method for the creation of a model of delayed-onset paraplegia in the awake animal, and will facilitate more detailed studies of the pathophysiology of ischemia-induced paraplegia. 
Trauma history in diagnostic groups of temporomandibular disorders. Trauma history was studied for association with disease among six diagnostic subgroups of 230 patients with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) from a private practice setting with (1) disk displacement (DD) with reduction, (2) DD without reduction, (3) osteoarthrosis (OA) with prior derangement history, (4) primary OA, (5) myalgia only, and (6) subluxation only. Except for subluxation (29%), trauma history typified TMD patient groups 1 to 5 (63%, 79%, 44%, 53%, 54%) (p less than 0.001) compared with 13% and 18% of asymptomatic (n = 61) and symptomatic (n = 161) student control subjects, and 11% of general dental patients (n = 150). TMD groups 2 and 3 differed significantly (p less than 0.05). The high prevalence of trauma in the myalgia-only group complicates the concept of myofascial pain-dysfunction syndrome as solely a stress or centrally mediated disorder. DD without reduction (43%) and with reduction (38%) had the highest prevalences of motor vehicle accident trauma, myalgia and OA groups had less, and subluxation-only cases had none. On the other hand, patients with DD without reduction were also the only group to report multiple trauma (29%), suggesting that although specific traumatic events may seem to precipitate clinical symptoms, they may not always have initiated the problem. Trauma may be both an important cumulative and precipitating event in TMDs. 
Limitations of balloon angioplasty for vein graft stenosis. Vein graft stenosis remains an important contributing factor to the failure of infrainguinal arterial reconstruction. Repair of these lesions before graft occlusion provides sustained patency, yet the optimal method of repair has not been established. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of these vein graft lesions has been repeatedly advocated as an alternative to surgical revision. Balloon angioplasty was used in 30 patients with 54 stenotic lesions occurring in autogenous vein grafts after infrainguinal reconstruction. The primary 5-year cumulative patency rate was 18% overall, with no significant differences observed among patency rates based on initial indication, length of stenotic lesion, or requirement for preliminary thrombolytic therapy. The 3-year patency rate associated with vein graft lesions requiring only a single angioplasty proved significantly higher (59%) than those requiring repetitive dilations (6%). It is our conclusion that balloon angioplasty for vein graft stenosis has significant limitations in providing sustained secondary patency. 
Safety and tolerance of oral dextromethorphan in patients at risk for brain ischemia. Experimental ischemia models have shown the antitussive dextromethorphan to be an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist with neuroprotective properties. We treated 10 patients with a history of recent stroke or transient ischemic attack with oral dextromethorphan (60 mg q.i.d.) for 3 weeks in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover tolerance study. We documented no clinical evidence of toxicity attributable to dextromethorphan in this preliminary study. 
Imaging of cocaine-induced global and regional myocardial ischemia. Severe and often fatal cardiac complications have been reported in cocaine users with narrowed coronary arteries caused by atherosclerosis as well as in young adults with normal coronaries. We have found that in normal dogs cocaine induces severe temporary hypoperfusion of the left ventricle as indicated by a significantly lower 201Tl concentration compared to the baseline state. The most significant decrease in uptake occurred 5 min after injection and was more pronounced in the septal and apical segments. Following intravenous administration of cocaine, instead of gradual disappearance of 201Tl from the left ventricle, there was continuous increase in 201Tl concentration in the left ventricle. These imaging experiments indicate that the deleterious effects of cocaine on the heart are probably due to spasm of the coronaries and decreased myocardial perfusion. Since spasm of the large subpericardial vessels does not seem to explain the magnitude of the increased coronary resistance and decreased coronary flow after cocaine as described in the literature, it is suggested that microvascular spasm of smaller vessels plays a major role in the temporary decrease in perfusion. The data may also suggest that severe temporary myocardial ischemia is probably the initiating factor for the cardiac complications induced by cocaine. 
Fulminant childhood hemophagocytic syndrome mimicking histiocytic medullary reticulosis. An atypical form of Epstein-Barr virus infection. Ten cases of pediatric fulminant hemophagocytic syndrome, encountered between 1986 and 1989, are described. They occurred in the summer, and the patients presented with fever, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, coagulopathy, and abnormal liver function. Bone marrow studies revealed infiltration by atypical T-lymphoid cells, rare B immunoblasts, and mature histiocytes with hemophagocytosis. Initially, histiocytic medullary reticulosis was suspected in six cases. The clinical course was characterized by rapid deterioration, with a mean period of 16 days from onset of fever to death. The main causes of death were coagulopathy with multiple organ failure and opportunistic infection. In seven of eight cases studied by serologic assay and Southern blot hybridization, acute or active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was documented. It is suggested that an atypical or fulminant form of primary EBV infection distinct from classic infectious mononucleosis was prevalent in previously healthy children in Taiwan. Younger age involvement and seasonal clustering were characteristic of the disorder described. 
Mechanisms of visual spatial neglect. Absence of directional hypokinesia in spatial exploration. This study examines whether visuospatial neglect derives from failure in directing hand movements to the left (directional hypokinesia), or from loss of mental representation of the left side of space. Forty right brain-lesioned patients, 28 of whom revealed mild, moderate, or severe neglect in clock drawing and cancellation tasks, were asked to search for concealed targets on a stimulus display board, by either (1) moving a covering panel with a small window until the target appeared, or (2) moving the stimulus display board beneath a stationary covering panel until the target became visible through the window. In the second procedure, the direction of physical space exploration and hand movement is reversed, so that in order to bring a target from the right side of the stimulus into view (under the window) the entire display board had to be moved to the left. This pair of procedures was supplemented by an analogous pair of visual tasks in which the entire display board was visible during the search. As expected, response times were generally longer for targets located on the left side of the display board; however, the direction of required hand movement (left vs right) did not have a significant effect on response times, irrespective of the degree of clinically assessed neglect. 
Chimeric NGF-EGF receptors define domains responsible for neuronal differentiation. To determine the domains of the low-affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor required for appropriate signal transduction, a series of hybrid receptors were constructed that consisted of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the human low-affinity NGF receptor (NGFR). Transfection of these chimeric receptors into rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells resulted in appropriate cell surface expression. Biological activity mediated by the EGF-NGF chimeric receptor was assayed by the induction of neurite outgrowth in response to EGF in stably transfected cells. Furthermore, the chimeric receptor mediated nuclear signaling, as evidenced by the specific induction of transin messenger RNA, an NGF-responsive gene. Neurite outgrowth was not observed with chimeric receptors that contained the transmembrane domain from the EGFR, suggesting that the membrane-spanning region and cytoplasmic domain of the low-affinity NGFR are necessary for signal transduction. 
Effects of percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy on levels of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide during exercise. To clarify the factors that influenced the secretion of human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) during exercise, we studied the relations between the changes in ANP, transmitral pressure gradient, heart rate and blood pressure at exercise in 16 patients with mitral stenosis before and after percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC). Before PTMC, ANP levels increased from 107 +/- 70 to 183 +/- 96 pg/ml during exercise testing (p less than 0.01), concomitant with the increment in mean transmitral pressure gradient, heart rate and systolic blood pressure. After PTMC, ANP levels also increased from 78 +/- 43 to 117 +/- 64 pg/ml, concomitant with the increment of those parameters. However, increments of ANP, mean transmitral pressure gradient and heart rate after PTMC were lower than those before PTMC. Because the most important factor influencing the secretion of ANP was unclear, the differences between these parameters were calculated at submaximal exercise before and after PTMC. There was a significant relation only between the change in ANP and mean transmitral pressure gradient (r = 0.70, p less than 0.01). These results suggest that the most important factor influencing the secretion of ANP during exercise is the change in transmitral pressure gradient in patients with mitral stenosis. 
Self-administered hyperventilation cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 100 s of cardiac arrest during Holter monitoring. An 80-year-old man remained conscious due to vigorous deep breathing during 100 s of ventricular arrest which was recorded on a Holter ECG. Arterial blood flow is considered to have been maintained by changes in intrathoracic pressure produced by deep respiratory movements. This case may represent a pure model of the "thoracic pump" mechanism. 
Natural history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. The natural history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) was studied in 23 patients followed for at least 3 years with no treatment. The mean age of the patients was 41 years of age. A large proportion of the VAIN lesions (50%) were multifocal, and approximately one half of the lesions were associated with concomitant cervical or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. Progression to invasive vaginal carcinoma occurred in two (9%) cases, persistence of VAIN occurred in three (13%) cases, and regression of VAIN occurred in 18 (78%) cases. The risk for progression to invasive carcinoma emphasizes the significance of colposcopic examination of the vagina with directed biopsy specimens obtained from all lesions. 
Central retinal and posterior ciliary artery occlusion after particle embolization of the external carotid artery system. A 15-year-old boy underwent neuroradiologic embolization of the left internal maxillary artery with polyvinyl alcohol to stop traumatic epistaxis after failure of surgical clipping and nasal packing. Selective catheterization of the external carotid artery before embolization showed a faint choroidal blush. Although the procedure provided hemostasis, embolization to the central retinal artery and ciliary arteries resulted in loss of vision. The route of the emboli to the eye was via the anastomotic network of the lacrimal artery supplied by the external carotid artery system. Neuroradiologic embolization of the external carotid artery is an effective mode of therapy for dural-cavernous fistulas when fed by the external carotid artery system. Because the blood flow to the brain and eye is predominantly supplied by the internal carotid artery, embolization of the external carotid artery is considered relatively safe. The authors document the importance of recognition of the choroidal blush during selective external carotid artery angiography as a sign of collateral blood flow to the eye. Physicians and patients need to be aware of the risk of blindness as a complication of external carotid artery embolization when this sign is present. 
Functional domains of the poliovirus receptor. A number of mutant cDNAs of the human poliovirus receptor were constructed to identify essential regions of the molecule as the receptor. All mutant cDNAs carrying the sequence coding for the entire N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain (domain I) confer permissiveness for poliovirus to mouse L cells, but a mutant cDNA lacking the sequence for domain I does not. The transformants permissive for poliovirus were able to bind the virus and were also recognized by monoclonal antibody D171, which competes with poliovirus for the cellular receptor. These results strongly suggest that the poliovirus binding site resides in domain I of the receptor. Mutant cDNAs for the sequence encoding the intracellular peptide were also constructed and expressed in mouse L cells. Susceptibility of these cells to poliovirus revealed that the entire putative cytoplasmic domain is not essential for virus infection. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of the molecule appears not to play a role in the penetration of poliovirus. 
Resting energy expenditure in patients with pancreatitis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the resting energy expenditure of hospitalized patients with pancreatitis. DESIGN: Prospective, case-referent study. SETTING: Nutrition support service in a university tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients referred to the Nutrition Support Service with the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Excluded from study entry included those with cancer, obesity (greater than 150% ideal body weight), those measured within 3 postoperative days, or patients requiring ventilator support with an FIO2 of greater than 0.5. Forty-eight patients with either acute pancreatitis (n = 13), chronic pancreatitis (n = 24), acute pancreatitis with sepsis (n = 7), or chronic pancreatitis with sepsis (n = 7) were studied. The two septic groups were combined into a single pancreatitis-with-sepsis group, since no significant differences among measured variables were observed between individual septic groups. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry and compared with the predicted energy expenditure, as determined by the Harris-Benedict equations. Resting energy expenditure (percent of predicted energy expenditure) was significantly (p less than .02) greater for patients with pancreatitis complicated by sepsis (120 +/- 11%) compared with the nonseptic chronic pancreatitis group (105 +/- 14%). Resting energy expenditure for the nonseptic acute pancreatitis patients (112 +/- 17%) was not significantly different from the other groups. The septic pancreatitis group had the largest percentage (82%) of hypermetabolic (resting energy expenditure greater than 110% of predicted energy expenditure) patients, whereas 61% and 33% of the acute and chronic pancreatitis groups were hypermetabolic, respectively (p less than .02). CONCLUSIONS: Resting energy expenditure is variable in patients with pancreatitis (77% to 139% of predicted energy expenditure). The Harris-Benedict equations are an unreliable estimate of caloric expenditure. Septic complications are associated with hypermetabolism and may be the most important factor influencing resting energy expenditure in pancreatitis patients. 
MRC European Carotid Surgery Trial: interim results for symptomatic patients with severe (70-99%) or with mild (0-29%) carotid stenosis. European Carotid Surgery Trialists' Collaborative Group The European Carotid Surgery Trial is a multicentre trial of carotid endarterectomy for patients who, after a carotid territory non-disabling ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or retinal infarct, are found to have a stenotic lesion in the relevant (ipsilateral) carotid artery. Over the past 10 years 2518 patients have been randomised, and the mean follow-up is now almost 3 years among the 2200 thus far available for analysis of the incidence of strokes that lasted more than 7 days. For the patients with "moderate" (30-69%) stenosis on their prerandomisation angiogram the balance of surgical risk and eventual benefit remains uncertain, and full recruitment continues. For 374 patients with only "mild" (0-29%) stenosis there was little 3-year risk of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, even in the absence of surgery, so any 3-year benefits of surgery were small, and were outweighed by its early risks. For 778 patients with "severe" (70-99%) stenosis, however, the risks of surgery were significantly outweighed by the later benefits: although 7.5% had a stroke (or died) within 30 days of surgery, during the next 3 years the risks of ipsilateral ischaemic stroke were (by life-table analysis) an extra 2.8% for surgery-allocated and 16.8% for control patients (a sixfold reduction, p less than 0.0001). There was also a small reduction in other strokes, and at 3 years the total risk of surgical death, surgical stroke, ipsilateral ischaemic stroke, or any other stroke was 12.3% for surgery and 21.9% for control (difference 9.6% SD 3.3, 2p less than 0.01). The main concern was to avoid disabling or fatal events, and, among severe stenosis patients, 3.7% had a disabling stroke (or died) within 30 days of surgery, an extra 1.1% surgery versus 8.4% control (p less than 0.0001) had a disabling or fatal ipsilateral ischaemic stroke by 3 years, and the total 3-year risk of any disabling or fatal stroke (or surgical death) was 6.0% surgery versus 11.0% control (overall difference 5.0% SD 2.3, 2p less than 0.05); but, for disabling or fatal stroke the control risks seemed to diminish after the first year, so delay of surgery by just a few months after clinical presentation might make this overall difference non-significant. 
Relapsing transverse myelitis. Acute transverse myelitis is a monophasic disorder, the recurrence of which raises the question of multiple sclerosis (MS) or other multifocal CNS disease. We now report three patients with a previously undescribed syndrome of relapsing isolated acute transverse myelitis. Each had two to five attacks over periods of 3 to 8 years, characterized by ascending paresthesias, urinary retention, sensory loss with a thoracic or cervical level, paraparesis, hyperreflexia, and bilateral Babinski signs. MRI demonstrated areas of increased signal intensity on T2- and proton density-weighted scans and decreased signal intensity on T1-weighed scans of the cervical or thoracic spinal cord consistent with an inflammatory or demyelinating process. All patients had normal complete myelograms, oligoclonal IgG bands were consistently absent from the cerebrospinal fluid, cranial MRIs were normal, and there was no other clinical or laboratory evidence of MS, collagen-vascular disease, or active viral infection. They were treated with high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, stabilized between episodes, and had partial or complete recovery. The recognition of these three patients at a single medical center in a 1-year period suggests that relapses of acute transverse myelitis may not be rare. 
Clarification of the identity of the major M2 autoantigen in primary biliary cirrhosis. 1. In primary biliary cirrhosis, the major M2 autoantigen, reacting with antimitochondrial antibodies in sera from greater than 90% of patients, has been identified as the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. However, two recent reports suggest that alternative polypeptides may be major autoantigens. 2. The evidence that a 75 kDa subunit of complex I of the respiratory chain is a major autoantigen (Frostell, Mendel-Hartvig, Nelson, Totterman, Bjorkland & Ragan, Scand. J. Immunol. 1988; 28, 157-65) is refuted. The findings of Frostell et al. can be explained by contamination of complex I with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, evidence for which is presented here. 3. Inspection of the partial amino acid sequence of an unidentified mitochondrial autoantigen (Muno, Kominami, Ishii, Usui, Saituku, Sakakibara & Namihisa, Hepatology 1990; 11, 16-23) shows that it is the E1 beta-subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, previously identified as a major autoantigen, and not a 'new' alternative major autoantigen. 4. These findings substantiate previous work showing that the mitochondrial M2 autoantigens identified so far in primary biliary cirrhosis are all polypeptide components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or the other related 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes. 
A randomized comparative study of laser photocoagulation, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the treatment of actively bleeding ulcers. A randomized study was performed to compare the efficacy of Nd:YAG laser, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the treatment of active bleeding from peptic ulcers. Nine hundred and forty-eight consecutive patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding underwent endoscopy and 91 patients with active bleeding from peptic ulcer were randomized to receive laser (N = 30), heater probe (N = 31), and bipolar electrocoagulation (N = 30). The angulation of the probe to the ulcer base was assessed at endoscopy. The three treatment groups were comparable in their clinical and endoscopic characteristics. There was no significant difference among patients treated with laser, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the rate of re-bleeding (10%, 19.4%, and 10%), duration of hospital stay (4, 4, and 5 days), and proportion requiring emergency surgery (7%, 13%, and 7%), but the cost per patient was higher with laser than heater probe and bipolar electrocoagulation. The angulation of the probe to the ulcer base did not affect the re-bleeding rate. No complication was reported. We conclude that the three modalities were equally effective and safe in endoscopic hemostasis but because bipolar electrocoagulation and heater probe were cheaper, they were recommended for use. 
Occlusive and reperfused myocardial infarcts: MR imaging differentiation with nonionic Gd-DTPA-BMA. To increase the time during which effective contrast exists between normal and infarcted myocardium, a high dose (0.6 mmol/kg) of the nonionic contrast medium gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid bismethylamide (Gd-DTPA-BMA) was used to distinguish between occlusive and reperfused myocardial infarctions in rats. After administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA, there was clear and persistent demarcation of both occlusive and reperfused infarcts on T1-weighted MR images. In occlusive infarcts, normal, infarcted, and periinfarcted myocardium could be identified. High signal intensity was evident for 60 minutes in a band straddling the border between infarcted and normal myocardium, namely, the periinfarction zone. In the reperfused infarct, normal and infarcted myocardium could be identified. The reperfused zone was immediately enhanced after injection of Gd-DTPA-BMA. A differential pattern of enhancement between occlusive and reperfused myocardial infarcts was evident for 1 hour. Thus, Gd-DTPA-BMA has the potential to allow (a) depiction of occlusive and reperfused acute myocardial infarcts, (b) documentation of reperfusion of myocardial infarction, and (c) distinction between occlusive and reperfused infarction. 
Update on thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. There is a continuum of clinical research in thrombolytic therapy that will eventually evolve into the most effective regimen to chemically open a thrombosed artery. Numerous previous clinical trials, a number of ongoing trials, and planned future trials are shown in a list of acronyms and their translations as a convenience for identifying the trials. 
Discontinuation of phenytoin and carbamazepine in patients receiving felbamate. Five patients participated in a controlled discontinuation of phenytoin (PHT) and carbamazepine (CBZ) after a study in which all subjects had felbamate (FBM) added to both PHT and CBZ. Four subjects (three women and 1 man aged 23-36 years) completed the protocol. Mean total seizure frequency per day with PHT and CBZ was 1.33 +/- 0.93 (mean +/- SEM), decreasing to 0.87 +/- 0.71 with addition of FBM, and 0.82 +/- 0.78 after discontinuation of PHT. Only one subject tolerated discontinuation of CBZ; the other three had dosage reductions of 33, 54, and 63%. Toxicity attributable to FBM was not observed, and patients often described less severe seizures. Results from four refractory patients indicated that FBM was able to replace PHT and reduce the need for CBZ. In addition, as PHT dosages were reduced, FBM clearance decreased 21%. As the CBZ dosages were reduced. FBM clearance decreased an additional 16.5%. 
Immunocytological diagnosis of primary cerebral non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Four men with primary cerebral non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed by immunocytological analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) presented with cranial nerve palsies. All had CSF lymphocytoses and low CSF glucose. The cell phenotypes were two T cell tumours, one B cell, and one null. A review of 13 previously recorded cases of immunocytologically diagnosed CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showed that there were 10 B cell, two T cell, and one null tumour. Overall (17 cases) the cell phenotype distribution was 65% B cell, 24% T cell, and 11% null. High CSF lymphocyte counts were found in 94%, proteinosis in 85%, and low CSF glucose in 87%. In contrast to the B cell tumours, all of the T cell tumours were diagnosed by CSF cytology before being visualised radiologically. It is suggested that all CSF lymphocytes (greater than 5 x 10(6)/ml) should be immunohistochemically typed to permit earlier diagnosis of CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
Surface appearance and instability of empty H-2 class I molecules under physiological conditions. Recent evidence suggests that endogenously produced antigenic peptides are required for assembly of major histocompatibility complex class I chains with beta 2-microglobulin and transport to the cell surface. The RMA-S mutant cells are thought to be defective in intracellular peptide loading to class I molecules and, therefore, devoid of class I surface expression. Here we report that at physiological temperature (37 degrees C) "empty" class I molecules appear at the cell surface of RMA-S cells where they can be trapped with H-2 antibodies. In the absence of the stabilizing ligand, the class I molecules rapidly alter their conformation but remain at the cell surface as demonstrated with a rabbit antiserum. Such denatured H-2 molecules can also be found on normal wild-type RMA cells. However, their amount is strongly reduced after culture of RMA cells with a class I binding peptide. These findings indicate that empty class I molecules appear at the surface not only on mutant but also on normal cells, suggesting that in normal cells the supply with peptides is limited. 
Temporal bone findings in a family with branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR). A family group with confirmed branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome was investigated in this study. Computerized tomography of the temporal bones has demonstrated that the malformations of the inner ear consist of hypoplastic structural changes within the cochlea with reduced vertical diameters, and absent or hypoplastic semicircular canals and normal endolymphatic ducts. It is concluded that in the present cases, the Mondini malformation of the cochlea is not associated with the BOR syndrome. 
Melanoma tumor vaccine: five-year follow-up. For many years, various melanoma vaccines have been employed. This is a unique melanoma vaccine in that it is a subcellular tumor homogenate and no adjuvants have been added. This vaccine has been given to 129 stage I and 61 stage II melanoma patients. All were followed at least 5 years and had 87.5% and 63.9% 5-year survival rates, respectively. Sixty-four stage I males and 65 stage I females had 84% and 90% 5-year survival rates, respectively. We saw no difference between those with or without lymph node dissection. Thirty-six stage II males and 25 stage II females had 66.7% and 60% 5-year survival rates, respectively. Of stage II patients, 23 had only one positive node, 22 had two to four positive nodes, and 9 had five or more positive nodes with 69%, 63%, and 55% 5-year survival rates, respectively. Large published series were used as historical controls [6,27,28], and significant differences were noted when compared to our stage II patients (P = 0.001)--those with two to four positive nodes (P = 0.03), and those with five or more positive nodes (P = 0.04). We conclude that there is a significant increase in survival for these stage II patients, at high risk of recurrence, receiving a tumor homogenate vaccine. This vaccine warrants further analysis, development, and use in a phase III randomized clinical trial. 
Reoperative pulmonary resection in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma Resection of pulmonary metastases from soft tissue sarcoma has been shown to be associated with a 3-year survival of 25% to 30%. The role of multiple resections for recurrent pulmonary metastases, however, has not been clearly defined. Since 1976, 43 patients have had two or more thoracic explorations for the purpose of resecting pulmonary metastases from adult soft tissue sarcoma at our institution. In 89 reexplorations, through either median sternotomy or lateral thoracotomy, the operative mortality was 0%, and 31 of the 43 patients (72%) could be rendered free of disease at the second thoracotomy. Median survival from the second thoracotomy for the patients with resectable disease was 25 months, whereas median survival of patients who had unresectable disease was 10 months. A disease-free interval between the first and second thoracotomies of greater than 18 months was associated with prolonged survival from the second thoracotomy. Owing to lack of other therapies with proven salvage efficacy and in the absence of randomized trials, repeated thoracotomies to render patients free of disease from pulmonary soft-tissue sarcoma metastases appear justified considering the potential survival benefit and low attendant risk. 
Intracellular calcium transients in myocardium from spontaneously hypertensive rats during the transition to heart failure. To investigate the mechanism of impaired myocardial function after long-term pressure overload, we studied cardiac muscle mechanical contraction and intracellular calcium transients using the bioluminescent indicator aequorin. Left ventricular papillary muscle preparations were examined from three groups of rats: 1) aging spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with clinical and pathological evidence suggesting heart failure (SHR-F group), 2) age-matched SHRs with no evidence of heart failure (SHR-NF group), and 3) age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY group). Isometric force development was depressed in both SHR groups relative to the WKY group. Resting [Ca2+]i was lower in the SHR-F group, and the time to peak [Ca2+]i was prolonged in this group. The relative increases in peak [Ca2+]i with the inotropic interventions of increased [Ca2+]o and the addition of isoproterenol were similar among groups. Although inotropy increased in all groups with increased [Ca2+]o, after isoproterenol, inotropy increased only in the WKY group. Thus, in SHR myocardium, [Ca2+]i increased after isoproterenol, but inotropy failed to increase. Myosin isozymes were shifted toward the V3 isoform in both SHR groups; the V3 isoform was virtually 100% in papillary muscles from the SHR-F group. These changes may reflect events directly contributing to the development of heart failure or represent adaptive changes to chronic pressure overload and heart failure. 
A video system for investigating breathing disorders during sleep. A system has been developed for investigating breathing during sleep that superimposes physiological signals on a video image of the patient, with the combined image plus sound recorded on video tape for later analysis. Signals normally displayed include oxygen saturation, airflow, chest wall motion, electroencephalogram, and electrooculogram; but others can be recorded if desired. The information is displayed on a timebase appropriate for the recognition and analysis of respiratory events during sleep. In addition, use is made of normally invisible video lines to record the analogue voltage waveforms so that on replay this information can be displayed on a fast timebase for analysing the more rapidly changing waveforms of electrophysiological signals. The system allows detailed polysomnography to be performed in the normal ward setting with the subject monitored overnight by the nursing staff. Subsequent analysis of the synchronised video, audio, and analogue signals allows measurement of the conventional indices obtained by polysomnography and aids their interpretation. 
Events in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST): mortality in patients surviving open label titration but not randomized to double-blind therapy. The patient characteristics and outcomes were studied in the 318 patients who survived open label drug titration in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) and who were not randomized to double-blind therapy and in 942 patients, who were randomized to double-blind placebo therapy. The patients randomized to placebo therapy had a lower total mortality or resuscitated cardiac arrest rate (4% vs. 8.5%). However, at baseline, nonrandomized patients were dissimilar from patients randomized to placebo in the following ways: older; lower left ventricular ejection fraction; greater use of digitalis, diuretic drugs and antihypertensive agents; lesser use of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and more frequent prior cardiac problems, including runs of ventricular tachycardia and left bundle branch block. A matched comparison that took these inequities into account showed no significant differences in mortality or rate of resuscitation from cardiac arrest between nonrandomized patients and clinically equivalent patients randomized to placebo. Cox regression analysis indicated that two factors significantly increased the hazard ratio for arrhythmic death or resuscitated cardiac arrest in the nonrandomized patients: female gender (4.7, p less than 0.05) and electrocardiographic events (ventricular tachycardia, proarrhythmia, widened QRS complex, heart block, bradycardia) during open label titration (7.0, p less than 0.005). However, some potentially important differences between men and women were not included in the Cox regression model. Of the nonrandomized patients, approximately 70% were not randomized because of lack of suppression of ventricular premature depolarizations or adverse events, or both, and the remaining 30% because of patient or private physician request with no indication of another reason. 
Quantification of cell kinetic characteristics using flow cytometric measurements of deoxyribonucleic acid and bromodeoxyuridine for bladder cancer. A total of 56 human bladder tumors that were histologically proved to be transitional cell carcinoma was analyzed by simultaneous flow cytometric 2-color measurements of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and bromodeoxyuridine. Bromodeoxyuridine in vitro labeling was performed by sample incubation with bromodeoxyuridine under high atmospheric pressure oxygen. Grade 1 tumors showed 33.3% aneuploidy with a mean bromodeoxyuridine positive stained ratio (labeling index) of 5.1 +/- 3.4%. Grade 2 tumors featured 51.7% aneuploidy with a mean labeling index of 8.9 +/- 7.7%. On the other hand, a markedly increased labeling index of 15.2 +/- 8.2% with aneuploidy was observed in all but 1 grade 3 tumors. When DNA ploidy and labeling indexes were compared according to the presence or absence of muscular invasion of tumors, all 16 muscle invasive tumors showed aneuploidy (mean labeling index 18.7 +/- 8.0%), while 17 of 40 nonmuscle invasive tumors showed aneuploidy (mean labeling index 8.6 +/- 5.4%). This labeling index difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). These results indicate that bromodeoxyuridine/DNA 2-color flow cytometry may provide an objective parameter for quantification of the malignant potential of bladder cancers. 
Development of a computer-aided surgery system: three-dimensional graphic reconstruction for treatment of liver cancer. Simulation of the needle puncture and volume estimation for the tumors in the liver were carried out with the three-dimensional image reconstruction system, which consists of a medical image acquisition system, a data processing system, and a graphic display. A set of sliced-image data from a computerized tomography and/or a magnetic resonance imaging was used to reconstruct the liver, the vessels, and the tumors of the patients with liver cancer. A good agreement of anatomic locations of both the intrahepatic vessels and the tumors between the reconstructed liver model and the echography done intraoperatively was observed. Surgical simulations with these graphic models clearly indicated safety areas for needle puncture in the laser coagulation therapy. In addition liver volumes were calculated within 3% of error in comparison to the measured values. These results indicate that the computer-aided surgery system is a highly promising method that avoids cumbersome stereoscopic recognition of the anatomical location of the diseased area and the vessels, before and after surgery. 
External annular prosthesis in repair of biliary tract stricture. A surgical technique for treatment of benign intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary stenosis is described. It is based on the use of annular prostheses of Teflon placed around the outside of the anastomotic line using appropriate surgical instruments. This procedure leaves the blood supply to the bile duct intact, achieves hermetic apposition of epithelia, and prevents leakage of bile. It eliminates the use of intraductal splints, avoids retraction of scar tissue around the anastomotic zone, and increases or maintains the internal diameter of the biliary duct on the anastomotic line. The technique has been used in 33 patients with follow-up from 1 to 10 years. Excellent results were achieved in 32 patients, with 1 patient having a poor result. The average postoperative hospital stay was only 6 days. 
Adrenal rest carcinoma in hilum of kidney. Adrenocortical rests are uncommon in adults and infrequently undergo malignant changes. Most of the published cases are those of functional tumors allowing preoperative diagnosis on the basis of the resulting endocrinopathy. Most nonfunctioning tumors were found accidentally at operation or autopsy. A case is presented of a parapelvic nonfunctioning adrenocortical rest carcinoma situated in the renal hilus in a fifty-year-old woman. No such tumor has been described previously. 
A qualitative approach to primary care research: the long interview. Qualitative research methods offer useful complements to the traditional epidemiologic approaches most commonly used by primary care researchers. Narrative texts generated through open-ended interviews are one form of qualitative data that may provide useful insights into primary care issues that are otherwise overlooked by more structured designs. This paper presents a step-by-step process for conducting a long interview, a qualitative approach with distinct potential for primary care research. Advantages and limitations of the long interview and its relationship to other qualitative methods are also discussed. 
Evidence of a selective increase in cardiac sympathetic activity in patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias BACKGROUND. Although enhanced efferent cardiac sympathetic nervous activity has been proposed as an important factor in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, direct clinical evidence has been lacking. METHODS. We measured the rates of total and cardiac norepinephrine spillover into the plasma, which reflect respectively overall and cardiac sympathetic nervous activity, in 12 patients who had recovered from a spontaneous, sustained episode of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation outside the hospital 4 to 48 days earlier. The results were compared with those from three age-matched reference groups without a history of ventricular arrhythmias: 12 patients with coronary artery disease, 6 patients with chest pain but normal coronary arteries, and 12 healthy, normal subjects. RESULTS. The patients who had had ventricular arrhythmias had reduced left ventricular ejection fractions, as compared with the patients with coronary artery disease or chest pain (mean [+/- SE], 46 +/- 3 percent vs. 58 +/- 4 percent and 69 +/- 5 percent, respectively; P less than 0.003). The rates of total norepinephrine spillover into the plasma were similar in the three reference groups, but 80 percent higher in the patients with ventricular arrhythmias (P less than 0.005). The rate of cardiac norepinephrine spillover was 450 percent higher in these patients (176 +/- 39 pmol per minute, as compared with 32 +/- 8 pmol per minute in the normal subjects; P less than 0.001), a disproportionate increase relative to the increase in total spillover, which indicated selective activation of the cardiac sympathetic outflow. This increase in cardiac norepinephrine spillover was probably caused by a reduction in left ventricular function. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that in some patients major ventricular arrhythmias are associated with and perhaps caused by sustained and selective cardiac sympathetic activation. We speculate that depressed ventricular function was present before the ventricular arrhythmia occurred, and that this resulted in reflex cardiac sympathetic activation, which in turn contributed to the genesis of the arrhythmia. 
Bezold-Jarisch reflex in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical patients. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex is an inhibitory reflex that originates from the heart, is mediated by the vagus nerve, and is manifested by hypotension and bradycardia. We present 4 pediatric cardiac surgical patients, aged 1 day to 9 months, who exhibited cardiovascular collapse in their early postoperative course. In each patient, cardiovascular deterioration was marked by an insidious decrease in arterial blood pressure without an associated change in heart rate, central venous pressure, or airway pressure. Bradycardia followed the decrease in blood pressure. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex was suspected and atropine was administered, first as a bolus injection at 0.01 mg/kg, and later, as a continuous infusion at 0.01 mg.kg-1.h-1. Atropine prevented recurrent episodes of hypotension and bradycardia. We believe the Bezold-Jarisch reflex is more prevalent than previously suspected in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical patients. 
Sonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Acute appendicitis can be a diagnostic dilemma. The classic triad of leukocytosis, pain at McBurney's point and a history compatible with appendicitis has a diagnostic accuracy rate of only 80 percent. Ultrasonography, combined with this triad, can improve the diagnostic accuracy, decreasing the negative laparotomy rate from 20 percent to less than 10 percent. 
Mycotic aneurysms of the carotid arteries--case report and review of the literature. Mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries are rare. We report a new case with a mycotic aneurysm of the carotid bifurcation associated with acute bacterial endocarditis of the aortic valve. A concomitant treatment of both lesions was performed. Twenty-six cases of mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries have been reported in the literature. We present a review of all these cases. 
Prevalence of proximal faecal stasis in active ulcerative colitis. Proximal faecal stasis may occur when faecal matter accumulates in the uninflamed colon above an area of active ulcerative colitis. This phenomenon is thought to be the cause of symptoms in some patients with distal disease. It is not known, however, how often patients with active distal colitis exhibit slow colonic transit. Fifty two consecutive patients with active ulcerative colitis each ingested 10 radio-opaque markers nightly for 14 days. Minimum colonic transit times were derived from counts of retained markers shown by plain abdominal radiography on the 15th day. The transit times for each patient were related to their disease extent and bowel frequency. Four patients had colonic transit times greater than one week and two others had evidence of relative stasis. The results indicate that approximately 10% of attacks of distal colitis are associated with faecal stasis. 
Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: a multimodality approach--a single surgeon's experience (1979-1988). A retrospective review of a single surgeon's experience with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas was performed. One hundred-one patients were treated over a 10-year period from 1979 to 1988. Seven patients underwent potentially curative resections and 28 patients presented with metastatic (stage IV) disease. Sixty-four patients had locally advanced and unresectable primary lesions. A total of 51 patients received I-125 seed implantation. There was no statistically significant difference in morbidity (33% vs. 30%) or mortality (6% vs. 8%) between patients receiving I-125 implantation and those undergoing palliative surgical procedures without implantation. Operative mortality was highest in patients presenting with stage IV lesions (11%). In those patients with locally advanced and unresectable carcinomas, there was a nonsignificant increase in survival (12.8 mo vs. 10.7 mo) in those receiving intraoperative I-125 implants when compared to those who did not when both groups received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy. Based on these encouraging results, it is concluded that I-125 implantation can be performed safely and shows a trend toward improving long-term survivorship in patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma when used in conjunction with chemotherapy and external beam radiation. 
Head-up tilt for the evaluation of syncope of unknown origin in children. Fifteen patients aged 10 to 18 years with syncope of unknown origin, and 10 healthy control children aged 11 to 18 years, were evaluated by head-up tilt to 60 degrees for 60 minutes. Six patients (43%) reproduced symptoms of syncope during the examination. Four had a typical vasovagal reaction; two had marked hyperventilation. None of the children in the control group had syncope. The head-up tilt test offers a simple, noninvasive, high-yielding diagnostic tool for evaluation of syncope in children. 
Analysis and interpretation of treatment effects in subgroups of patients in randomized clinical trials. A key principle for interpretation of subgroup results is that quantitative interactions (differences in degree) are much more likely than qualitative interactions (differences in kind). Quantitative interactions are likely to be truly present whether or not they are apparent, whereas apparent qualitative interactions should generally be disbelieved as they have usually not been replicated consistently. Therefore, the overall trial result is usually a better guide to the direction of effect in subgroups than the apparent effect observed within a subgroup. Failure to specify prior hypotheses, to account for multiple comparisons, or to correct P values increases the chance of finding spurious subgroup effects. Conversely, inadequate sample size, classification of patients into the wrong subgroup, and low power of tests of interaction make finding true subgroup effects difficult. We recommend examining the architecture of the entire set of subgroups within a trial, analyzing similar subgroups across independent trials, and interpreting the evidence in the context of known biologic mechanisms and patient prognosis. 
Ventricular dysfunction does occur during liver transplantation. Ventricular dysfunction, then, does indeed occur during liver transplantation, particularly at the time of reperfusion. Pulmonary embolism contributes to right ventricular and right atrial encroachment on left-heart filling, and paradoxical embolism may occur. Pericardial effusions, tricuspid regurgitation, hypothermia, and the release of substances, particularly potassium from the donor liver, may further contribute to compromises in ventricular function. Proper monitoring and appropriate treatment, however, lead to successful operative outcomes in most cases. 
Impact of variability among surgeons on postoperative morbidity and mortality and ultimate survival. OBJECTIVE--To assess the differences among surgeons in postoperative complications, postoperative mortality, and survival in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. DESIGN--Prospective study of patients with colorectal cancer managed by one of 13 consultant surgeons, none of whom had a special interest in colorectal surgery. SETTING--Royal Infirmary, Glasgow. PATIENTS--645 sequential patients with colorectal cancer presenting over the six years from 1974 to 1979. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Postoperative complications, postoperative mortality (within 30 days), and survival (up to 10 years); predictive factors for postoperative mortality and survival; and relative hazard rate ratios for individual surgeons. RESULTS--The proportion of patients undergoing apparently curative resection varied among surgeons from 40% to 76%; overall postoperative mortality varied from 8% to 30%. After curative resection postoperative mortality varied from 0% to 20%, local recurrence from 0% to 21%, and the rate of anastomotic leak from 0% to 25%. Survival at 10 years in patients who underwent curative resection varied from 20% to 63%, two year survival in those who underwent palliative resection varied from 7% to 32%, and median survival in those who underwent palliative diversion varied from one to eight months. The hazard rate ratios among individual surgeons, taking into account the identified risk factors, varied from 0.56 to 2.03, from 0.17 to 1.92, and from 0.57 to 1.50 for curative resection, palliative resection, and palliative diversion, respectively. CONCLUSION--There were significant variations in patient outcome among surgeons after surgery for colorectal cancer; such differences compromise survival. A considerable improvement in overall survival might be achieved if such surgery were undertaken by surgeons with a special interest in colorectal surgery or surgical oncology. 
Effects of alfentanil and fentanyl on induction of anaesthesia in patients with severe pregnancy-induced hypertension. Forty patients with severe pregnancy-induced hypertension presenting for Caesarean section under general anaesthesia were allocated randomly to receive either fentanyl 2.5 micrograms kg-1 or alfentanil 10 micrograms kg-1 as part of the anaesthetic induction sequence. In all patients, the cardiovascular response to tracheal intubation was measured. Both drugs attenuated the response equally but did not abolish it in all patients. Alfentanil 10 micrograms kg-1 is a suitable alternative to fentanyl 2.5 micrograms kg-1 for patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension. 
Hemangioma of the nasal vault: MR and CT features. Six patients with a history of epistaxis (five patients) or nasal obstruction (one patient) were found to have a capillary hemangioma of the nasal vault that involved one or more nasal turbinates. Four patients underwent computed tomographic (CT) examination; two of these also underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Four others underwent only MR imaging. At CT and MR, all of the lesions were well circumscribed and intensely enhancing, with contralateral deviation of the nasal septum. Remodeling of the surrounding bone was present in three patients. On T1-weighted MR images, the masses were intermediate in signal intensity. Varying degrees of T2 shortening were shown on T2-weighted MR images, with an appearance that suggested the presence of blood products surrounding an inner matrix of higher-signal-intensity tumor. Intense enhancement at CT and MR assisted differentiation of tumor from retained sinonasal secretions. In two patients, external carotid arteriography revealed small foci of pooling contrast material; in one of these patients, arteriovenous shunting was also present. Pathologic examination in all patients demonstrated capillary hemangiomas with varying degrees of fibrosis and hemosiderin deposition. 
Sarcomatous change in a teratoma after treatment of testicular carcinoma. Treatment can transform the metastases of nonseminomatous germ cell carcinoma into histologically mature teratoma. These lesions typically have a benign clinical course. The authors present a case of leiomyosarcoma occurring within such a lesion. It arose 18 years after therapy for metastatic embryonal carcinoma of the testis and appears to have been radiation induced. 
Ossicular chain reconstruction: a combined prosthesis with organic and synthetic material. The surgical techniques to restore the sound pressure transfer mechanism in surgery of chronic otitis media are still in an evolutionary stage. Ossicular interposition is effective and certainly is not controversial. The use of various organic prostheses has been criticized. The prosthesis with a shaft of Teflon and a homograft bone flange is an alternative method which has been successful in our hands. 
Polycystic ovaries: do these represent a specific endocrinopathy? Serum pituitary gonadotrophins, oestradiol, testosterone and insulin pulse patterns were examined at 15-min intervals for 6 h in 40 women with a previous diagnosis of polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) based on clinical, endocrinological and ultrasound data. Age, duration of symptoms, body mass index (BMI) and ovarian volume showed no correlation with the 6-h mean value of any hormone and testosterone blood levels did not correlate with those of insulin. Some patients had high and others low LH pulse pattern components, and few had an inverted LH:FSH ratio. Morphological polycystic ovarian changes may be a reflection of various rather than a single pattern of gonadotrophin secretion. 
Interferon-gamma inhibits arterial stenosis after injury. BACKGROUND. Arterial injury initiates a proliferative response among the smooth muscle cells of the artery. This leads to the formation of a thickened intima that may reduce the diameter of the arterial lumen. Such intimal lesions often develop after vascular surgery and angioplastic procedures. Previous cell culture studies have shown that the lymphokine, interferon-gamma (gIFN), inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation. METHODS AND RESULTS. We therefore tested whether administration of exogenous gIFN could inhibit the development of intimal lesions. Rat carotid arteries were denuded with a balloon catheter, resulting in the formation of a standardized intimal lesion. The animals were then treated with recombinant rat gIFN at 200,000 units (approximately 400,000 units or 100 micrograms/kg body wt) administered parenterally once daily for 7 days. Autoradiographic analysis of 3H-thymidine incorporation revealed that gIFN reduced the early smooth muscle replication by approximately 75%. gIFN treatment for 1 week resulted in a 50% reduction of intimal cross-section area at 2 weeks after injury when compared to control rats injected with buffer alone. The difference in lesion development persisted in rats analyzed 10 weeks after injury, suggesting that proliferative events during the first week determine the long-term development of the intima. Inhibition of lesion development was accompanied by expression of the class II histocompatibility (Ia) gene, RT1B, suggesting that both were directly related to the administration of gIFN. CONCLUSIONS. These results show that gIFN is a potent inhibitor of the formation of arterial proliferative lesions in vivo. It is possible that gIFN could be useful in preventing arterial stenosis after surgery and angioplasty in man. 
Genetic susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. Genetic factors clearly cause Lewy-body Parkinson's disease (PD) in a subset of autosomal-dominant families. However, most cases of PD are sporadic. The two most likely models of four discussed for sporadic PD are the reduced penetrance model and the multifactorial model. Sporadic PD is likely to be caused by the combined effect of environmental precipitating factors and genetic susceptibility factors. Because the number of major genetic factors is likely to be small, these hypotheses can be tested and genetic factors located using linkage mapping techniques. The affected pair analysis methods are especially suited to PD. Finding the genetic susceptibility factors for PD is important because this may be the fastest way to identify the environmental precipitating factors and because it may lead to prevention of PD. Because of the usefulness of identifying genetic susceptibility factors for PD, we are carrying out linkage studies in a group of 16 large autosomal-dominant families with PD and more than 300 living affected PD pairs. 
Changes in neutrophil met-enkephalin containing peptides in episodic cluster headache. We have previously demonstrated an increase in plasma met-enkephalin levels during the pain attacks in episodic cluster headache. The present study was undertaken in order to clarify the source of the plasma met-enkephalin increase. Recent evidence has shown that peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells contain peptides derived from the proenkephalin A system, which can be released by specific stimuli. We studied neutrophil met-enkephalin containing peptides (NMECP) in 27 episodic cluster headache patients: 24 in a cluster period (6 of them during a pain attack), and 3 in the remission period. Neutrophil met-enkephalin containing peptide levels (after sequential enzymatic digestion with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B) were determined by radioimmunoassay with specific antiserum. Neutrophil peptide concentration (pmol/mg prot) was lower (p less than 0.01) in patients during the pain attack (14.4 +/- 0.36) than after their pain had subsided (36.7 +/- 0.31) and lower than in the remission period patients (35.8 +/- 0.4). We conclude that neutrophil met-enkephalin containing peptides decrease during pain in episodic cluster headache, and that they may be involved in the concomitant plasma met-enkephalin increase. 
Early abdominal complications following heart and heart-lung transplantation. In the first 11 years of the heart and heart-lung transplantation programme at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, 356 patients underwent heart transplantation, and 73 patients received both heart and lungs. Out of 429 patients 41 (9.5 per cent) developed abdominal complications within the first 30 days, and 20 of the 41 required surgery. The complications included pancreatitis (10), peptic ulceration (8), and pseudo-obstruction (8), in addition to colonic perforation and small bowel obstruction. When laparotomy was performed it was well tolerated. This paper supports the view that successful management of abdominal complications following transplantation requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Where doubt exists in the presence of an acute abdomen, laparotomy is the appropriate way to establish a definitive diagnosis. 
Acute and chronic hemodynamic effects of xamoterol in mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Xamoterol, a new beta 1 partial agonist, has the potential to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone in patients with heart failure. Its properties should result in beta-receptor stimulatory effects at low levels of sympathetic tone and beta-receptor protective effects at higher levels of sympathetic tone. The acute effects of intravenous (i.v.) xamoterol on hemodynamics at rest and during exercise were studied in 30 patients with mild to moderate heart failure (13 patients in New York Heart Association class II; 17 in class III) due to ischemic (n = 24) or cardiomyopathic (n = 6) heart disease. Cardiac index, stroke volume and stroke work index at rest were significantly improved after i.v. administration of xamoterol and consistent with net agonist effects. During exercise, heart rate and double product were significantly reduced (net antagonist effects), but with preservation of the expected increases in cardiac index and systolic blood pressure. These hemodynamic findings confirm the ability of xamoterol to modulate cardiac response to variations in sympathetic tone. Tachyphylaxis and arrhythmogenicity limit the chronic use of drugs with full beta-agonist properties as positive inotropes in heart failure. The patients were therefore entered into a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of chronic oral xamoterol therapy, 200 mg twice daily, and the hemodynamic responses to i.v. xamoterol were repeated at the end of the trial. No impairment in either resting or exercise effects was observed, indicative of a maintained response and absence of tachyphylaxis after chronic therapy. Furthermore, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring showed no change in ventricular arrhythmias during oral treatment. 
Ewing's sarcoma in children: twenty-five years of experience at the Instituto Portuges de Oncologia de Francisco Gentil (I.P.O.F.G.). Fifty children with Ewing's sarcoma were consecutively treated from 1962 to 1987 and retrospectively analyzed at the I.P.O.F.G. of Lisbon. At first diagnosis, 10 cases had distant metastases. The remaining 40 patients had clinically localized disease, and different protocols were followed over the years. The best results were obtained with chemotherapy and radiotherapy with or without surgery; and for these children the two-year survival rate was 42.8% vs. 8.3% for the group of patients submitted to local treatment alone. Besides the treatment modality, other factors influenced the prognosis, such as inflammatory signs, sex, tumor volume, and tumor site as well as evidence of distant metastases. 
The role of epidermal growth factor in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease. Duodenal biopsies obtained from seven normal subjects and six ulcerous patients were cultured in vitro for 30 min at 37 degrees C under various experimental conditions. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and somatostatin released in the culture medium were determined by radioimmunoassay. Under basal conditions, EGF and somatostatin levels were significantly higher in normal subjects (11.49 +/- 3.07 ng/mg protein and 3.06 +/- 0.8 ng/mg protein, respectively) than in ulcerous patients (6.9 +/- 1.98 ng/mg protein and 1.75 +/- 1.23 ng/mg protein, respectively). However, when antibodies to somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were added together to the culture media, in ulcerous patients, EGF levels also were lower as absolute values, but were higher as a percentage of variation than controls (p less than 0.05). The fall of EGF secretion from tissue cultures of ulcerous patients could be the consequence of endocrine cellular loss or damage, rather than the cause of ulceration. Moreover, the EGF-producing cells around the lesion in ulcerous patients seems to be hyperactive, and this hyperfunction of EGF-producing cells might contribute to the in vivo repair of tissue damage. 
Validation of hourly pain intensity profiles with chronic pain patients. This study examines how empirically derived pain intensity profiles relate to psychological adjustment in chronic pain patients. Hourly pain intensity ratings over the course of a day of 189 chronic pain patients were categorized into 6 groups using a hierarchical regression analysis technique. The profiles reflected linear, curvilinear, multilinear or "no profile" effects. Judges' ratings of pain intensity profiles were found to be less reliable than ratings based on empirical analysis. The majority of patients showed linear profiles while 26% of the patients showed no consistent relationship between hourly pain intensity and time of day. Patients who showed no consistent trend in their pain ratings reported having significantly higher ratings of emotional distress. They tended to have conflicts at home and showed more pain behavior than patients who had a distinct pain profile. Support is given for the potential clinical utility of pain rating profiles. 
Intrathoracic complications following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: CT findings. The authors retrospectively reviewed computed tomographic (CT) scans of 18 patients who developed 21 episodes of intrathoracic complications after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Pathologic and/or microbiologic diagnoses were available for all patients. All patients were immunocompromised due to either graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), neutropenia, or recurrent malignancy after BMT. CT demonstrated diagnostically relevant findings that were not apparent at radiography in 12 of the 21 cases (57%). These included a ground-glass pattern in early pneumonia (n = 5); a peripheral distribution in GVHD, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, and eosinophilic drug reaction (n = 4); cavitating lesions in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (n = 1); hemorrhagic infarcts in aspergillosis (n = 1); and mediastinal adenopathy in recurrent Hodgkin disease (n = 1). The authors conclude that chest CT is superior to radiography in demonstrating the presence, distribution, and extent of intrathoracic complications developing in patients after allogeneic BMT. CT is useful in guiding procedures for tissue diagnosis. 
Resting energy expenditure in patients with newly detected gastric and colorectal cancers. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured in 104 patients with newly detected gastric or colorectal (GCR) cancer and was compared with two groups of control subjects without cancer: healthy subjects (H control subjects) and patients with nonmalignant diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (GI patients). REE in GCR-cancer patients was not significantly different from REE in GI patients or H control subjects. Comparison of measured REE with predicted REE obtained from prediction equations may erroneously suggest that increased REE is a contributing factor in the development of cancer cachexia. No significant differences in REE were found when patients with liver metastases were compared with patients without metastases. There were no differences in REE between gastric and colorectal cancer patients. The decrease in energy expenditure, which normally occurs during starvation and weight loss in healthy men and women, could not be demonstrated in weight-losing, GCR-cancer patients. In conclusion, elevation of REE contributes little to the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia in GCR-cancer patients. 
Caesarean section in undiagnosed Eisenmenger's syndrome. Report of a patient with a fatal outcome. An obstetric patient is described in whom the first sign of cardiac disease was unexplained hypoxaemia during emergency anaesthesia for antepartum haemorrhage, with an eventual fatal outcome. The case highlights the importance of patient information at the booking clinic, and the implications of a raised haemaglobin in early pregnancy. 
Acute airway obstruction, hypertension and kyphoscoliosis. An elderly woman developed acute respiratory obstruction after choking on a bolus of food. On rigid bronchoscopy no foreign body, or anatomical obstruction was seen, but airway obstruction recurred during emergence from general anaesthesia, and was thought to be functional in nature. A recurring airway obstruction followed, relieved by induction of anaesthesia and by sedation. This was subsequently demonstrated to be caused by a tortuous aorta which impinged intermittently on the anterior tracheal wall, as a result of kyphoscoliosis of the thoracic spine. We attribute the relief of airway obstruction by general anaesthesia to a reduction in arterial blood pressure. 
Serum immune response to Helicobacter pylori in children: epidemiologic and clinical applications. Antibody responses to Helicobacter pylori were measured by a solid-phase whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 150 children and adolescents; in 47 consecutive children undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, including 17 with H. pylori infection before and after antimicrobial treatment; and in 46 family members of the infected children. Abnormal levels of either IgG or IgA were found in 6% of the 150 children. In the latter group the prevalence of H. pylori seropositivity increased with age. Parents and siblings of the infected children had 94% and 71% seropositivity, respectively, suggesting intrafamilial spread. Abnormal levels of IgG or IgA against H. pylori identified infected children with 95% sensitivity and 84% specificity. Eradication of the infection was accompanied by a significant decrease in IgG and IgA titers, with normalization in 10 cured patients in 12 months or less. We conclude that the method described for evaluation of H. pylori-specific IgG and IgA antibodies gives helpful information on the epidemiology of the infection and represents a useful adjunct to diagnosis and management of chronic gastritis in children. 
Endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral blood vessels during chronic hypertension. Acetylcholine produces less dilatation of pial arterioles in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) than in normotensive (WKY) rats. Responses of cerebral vessels to acetylcholine and bradykinin appear to involve different mechanisms. Our first goal was to determine whether responses of pial arterioles to bradykinin are impaired in SHRSP. Diameter of pial arterioles (20-60 microns) was measured using intravital microscopy in WKY rats and SHRSP (9-12 months old). Superfusion of bradykinin (3 x 10(-7) M) dilated pial arterioles by 35 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) in WKY rats, but only 21 +/- 3% in SHRSP (p less than 0.05 versus WKY rats). Both nitric oxide (5 x 10(-7) M) and nitroglycerin (10(-5) M) produced similar vasodilatation in WKY rats and SHRSP. Our second goal was to determine whether alteration of postreceptor mechanisms contributes to impairment of endothelium-dependent cerebral vasodilatation in SHRSP. Calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-5) M) produced more vasodilatation in WKY rats than in SHRSP (32 +/- 8% versus 9 +/- 4%, p less than 0.05). Responses to A23187 (10(-5) M) were inhibited by indomethacin (46 +/- 13% versus 15 +/- 5%, p less than 0.05) in WKY rats, whereas responses to A23187 (10(-6) M) were potentiated modestly by indomethacin (-3 +/- 2% versus 4 +/- 2%, p less than 0.05) in SHRSP. 
Molecular epidemiology and the genetics of environmental cancer. Environmental, occupational, and recreational exposures to carcinogens contribute to cancer risk in humans. Cancer formation is a multistage process involving tumor initiation, promotion, conversion, and progression. Carcinogens can affect any of these stages through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The association of a suspected carcinogenic exposure and cancer risk can be studied in populations with classic epidemiologic techniques. However, these techniques are not applicable to the assessment of risk in individuals. Molecular epidemiology, in contrast, is a field that integrates molecular biology, in vitro and in vivo laboratory models, biochemistry, and epidemiology to infer individual cancer risk. Carcinogen-macromolecular adduct levels, and somatic cell mutations can be measured to determine the biologically effective dose of a carcinogen. Molecular epidemiology also explores host cancer susceptibilities, such as carcinogen metabolic activation, DNA repair, endogenous mutation rates, and inheritance of mutated tumor suppressor genes. Substantial interindividual variation for each of these biologic end points has been shown and, therefore, highlights the need for assessing cancer risk on an individual basis. Given the pace of the last decade, it is feasible that the next 10 years will allow molecular epidemiologists to develop a cancer-risk profile for an individual that includes assessment of a number of factors. This will help focus preventive strategies and strengthen quantitative risk assessments. 
Abnormal small bowel permeability and duodenitis in recurrent abdominal pain. Thirty nine children with recurrent abdominal pain aged between 5.5 and 12 years, underwent endoscopic duodenal biopsy to find out if there were any duodenal inflammatory changes, and if there was a relationship between duodenal inflammation and intestinal permeability to 51Cr-EDTA. Duodenal inflammation was graded by the duodenitis scale of Whitehead et al (grade 0, 1, 2, and 3). In 13 out of 39 patients (33%) definite signs of inflammation were found (grade 2 and 3). Intestinal permeability to 51Cr-EDTA in patients with duodenitis (grade 1, 2, and 3) was significantly higher (4.42 (1.73)%) than in patients with normal (grade 0) duodenal biopsy appearances (3.3 (0.9)%). A significant association was found between duodenal inflammation and abnormal intestinal permeability. Our results give further evidence that there is an intestinal origin of these patients' complaints. 
Clinical evaluation of closed-loop control of blood pressure in seriously ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a new method of closed-loop (automatic) control of BP with usual manual control. DESIGN: Within-subject crossover trial. SETTING: General and open heart ICUs in a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Convenience sample of 74 seriously ill patients aged 17 to 88 yr. Twenty had hypertension: postoperative (n = 7), neurologic damage (n = 6), miscellaneous (n = 7), and were prescribed nitroprusside (n = 11) or nitroglycerin (n = 9). Fifty-four had hypotension: septic (n = 33), other (n = 21), and were prescribed norepinephrine (n = 30), dopamine (n = 11), epinephrine (n = 8), or dobutamine (n = 5). An additional 21 trials were omitted from analysis because of technical (n = 7), clinical (n = 1), or drug-related problems (n = 13). INTERVENTION: Closed-loop and manual drug administrations 1-hr were studied during periods in each patient. The target and observed mean arterial pressure (MAP) and drug infusion rate were recorded electronically every 30 sec. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Time taken to achieve initial control (min); fidelity of control (the integral of size and duration of error from target MAP +/- 10% in mm Hg.hr/hr); and average drug dose administered (microgram/min as % maximum possible per drug). RESULTS: Compared with manual control, closed-loop achieved faster initial control (log-rank chi 1 = 5.04, p less than .05) and greater fidelity (mean 1.37 vs. 2.36; F = 7.15, p less than .01). There was no difference in average drug dose administered. There was uniformity in the efficacy advantage of closed-loop drug administration across drugs and patient classifications. CONCLUSION: The new closed-loop system is more effective than the usual manual control in managing acute BP disturbances in the seriously ill patient. 
Hemodynamic and oxygen transport changes following endotracheal suctioning in trauma patients. Hemodynamic and oxygen transport responses to four preoxygenation techniques prior to endotracheal suctioning (ETS) were evaluated in 24 critically ill trauma patients with no preexisting lung disease. A within-subjects, repeated measures design was used. All patients had functional arterial and pulmonary artery catheters and were ventilated with a Puritan-Bennett 7200 which could immediately deliver a fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 1.0. Six breaths of maintenance FIO2 and hyperinflation without hyperoxygenation caused a fall in tissue oxygen delivery as measured by continuous transcutaneous oximetry (PtcO2). The largest increases in PtcO2 and arterial oxygen tension were seen with hyperoxygenation alone and a combination of hyperoxygenation and hyperinflation. No significant changes were found in hemodynamic (cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance) or oxygen transport variables (oxygen delivery, oxygen extraction, oxygen consumption) 5 minutes postsuctioning. During both hyperinflation protocols, patients experienced dyspnea. It was concluded that three hyperoxygenation breaths before ETS, using a clinically feasible protocol, are adequate in preventing postsuction hypoxemia in young, hemodynamically stable trauma patients. Large volumes of hyperinflation, although found to increase PtcO2, are not advocated because of demonstrated patient discomfort and the possibility of barotrauma. 
1990 ARRS Executive Council Award. Intravascular sonography in the detection of arteriosclerosis and evaluation of vascular interventional procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of intravascular sonography for the detection of arteriosclerosis and to determine the effects of vascular interventional procedures on the arterial wall. A catheter-based 20-MHz transducer was used. Forty patients were studied. Twelve had clinical evidence of peripheral vascular disease, 13 were healthy renal donors, and 15 underwent vascular interventional procedures. The aorta and the ipsilateral iliac artery were examined in real time under fluoroscopic guidance and the results were compared with angiography. Sonography in eight of the 13 renal donors showed arterial wall abnormalities in the absence of angiographic evidence of disease. Sonography of the 15 patients after angioplasty or atherectomy demonstrated plaque fractures, intramural dissections, or atherectomy grooves. Our experience suggests that intravascular sonography is of value in reducing the use of angiography to monitor progress or complications of vascular interventional procedures. 
Bilateral episodic mydriasis as a migraine equivalent in childhood: a case report. We report a 14-year-old girl who presented with yearly attacks of bilateral internal ophthalmoplegia, nausea and headache, since the age of nine. The episodic isolated bilateral mydriasis in this child is believed to be a migraine equivalent. 
Altered swallowing function in elderly patients without dysphagia: radiologic findings in 56 cases. Swallowing disorder is an increasing problem in our aging population. A majority of these patients have a functional abnormality of the oral, pharyngeal, and/or esophageal stage of swallowing. However, what constitutes normalcy is not well understood, and baseline swallowing in elderly persons without dysphagia has not been adequately described. We therefore evaluated 56 persons with a mean age of 83 years who had no symptoms of dysphagia or eating difficulty. Videofluoroscopy and radiographs with the subject erect and recumbent were obtained. Normal deglutition, as defined in young persons, was present in only 16%. Oral abnormalities (difficulty ingesting, controlling, and delivering bolus relative to swallowing initiation) were seen in 63%. Pharyngeal dysfunction (bolus retention and lingual propulsion or pharyngeal constrictor paresis) was seen in 25%. Pharyngoesophageal segment abnormalities were observed in 39% (mostly cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction). Esophageal abnormalities (mostly motor in nature) were observed in 36%. What has been described as swallowing dysfunction in young persons may not be abnormal in very elderly persons. It is difficult to distinguish the effect of normal aging from the effects of specific diseases or gradual degenerative changes. 
Double intensive consolidation chemotherapy in adult acute myeloid leukemia. Of 115 adult patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 87 (75.5%) achieved complete remission (CR) after induction treatment with zorubicin and conventional doses of cytarabine (Ara-C). Patients under age 45 years with histocompatibility locus antigen-identical sibling underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The others were treated with two courses of intensive consolidation chemotherapy (ICC): course 1 with 4 days of high-dose Ara-C and 3 days of amsacrine (m-AMSA); course 2 with carmustine (BCNU), Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. Forty-two patients received both planned courses, 15 received only the first, and 13 patients could only support conventional maintenance therapy. Four patients died during consolidation. With a median follow-up of 60 months, the disease-free survival (DFS) after ICC at 5 years is 40.3% (+/- 6.5%), with no statistically significant difference between patients receiving one or two courses. The DFS for the 17 transplanted patients is comparable (P = .72) and is lower for the 13 excluded patients (23% +/- 11.5%, P = .046). Age did not influence the probability of remaining in CR. In univariate analysis, three parameters had a negative impact on the 5-year DFS: a high initial WBC count (52% for patients with less than 30 x 10(9) WBC/L v 12% for patients with greater than 30 x 10(9) WBC/L, P = .01), a long delay between induction treatment and course 1 (+/- 60 days; 63% v 29%, P = .01), and a long delay between course 1 and course 2 (+/- 60 days, 61.5% v 28.5%, P = .05). In multivariate analysis (Cox model), only the WBC count remained significant. This study confirms the value of intensive postremission chemotherapy, which can be compared in AML with allogeneic or autologous BMT. It also demonstrates the prognostic value of the initial WBC count. The optimal modalities of ICC remain to be defined by further studies. 
Intravascular IL-8. Inhibitor of polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation at sites of acute inflammation. IL-8 has been characterized primarily as a polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemoattractant and proinflammatory mediator. Recently, we have reported that [Ala-IL-8]77 is secreted by activated cultured human endothelial cells and can function as a potent inhibitor of PMN adhesion to these monolayers. The pathophysiologic relevance of this in vitro observation was examined by determining the effects of intravascular or extravascular administration of IL-8 on PMN emigration at sites of acute inflammation in the skin of NZW rabbits. An i.v. bolus of [Ala-IL-8]77 (12 micrograms/kg) produced a marked and selective reduction of circulating PMN within 3 min, which returned toward preinjection levels within 30 min, and subsequently exceeded this level. A similar response was observed for circulating radiolabeled PMN, and gamma-scintigraphy determined that the lungs were the primary site of leukosequestration. During the 30- to 150-min interval after i.v. infusion of [Ala-IL-8]77, PMN emigration into acute inflammatory sites, elicited by various chemoattractants or cytokines, was significantly reduced, as judged histologically and quantitated with 51Cr-labeled PMN and myeloperoxidase measurements. Intravenous administration of [Ser-IL-8]72 yielded similar results. This inhibitory effect of i.v. IL-8 was transient and reinducible and did not reflect a suppression of the responsiveness of circulating PMN to chemoattractants. Intradermal injections of [Ala-IL-8]77 or [Ser-IL-8]72 induced dose-dependent PMN accumulation, which also was significantly reduced by i.v. administration of either form of IL-8. These results indicate that i.v. IL-8 can function as a PMN-directed leukocyte adhesion inhibitor and suggest that local secretion of IL-8 by activated endothelium may differentially modulate leukocyte-endothelial interactions at sites of acute inflammation. 
Acute and chronic urticaria and angioedema. Urticaria and angioedema are clinical manifestations of various immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms, or they may be idiopathic. The respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts as well as the cardiovascular system may be involved in any combination. Patients with urticaria and/or angioedema can be classified based on pathophysiologic mechanisms into those with IgE-dependent or complement-mediated immunologic disorders, those with nonimmunologic disorders in which there is a direct effect on the mast cell or on arachidonic acid metabolism, and those whose condition is idiopathic. Evaluation of patients should focus on a thorough history. Laboratory tests provide minimal additional information. About one half of patients with urticaria alone and 25% with urticaria and angioedema or angioedema alone are free of lesions within 1 year. With urticaria, angioedema, or both, 20% of patients experience episodes for more than 20 years. 
Breathing during sleep in patients treated for obstructive sleep apnea. Nasal CPAP for only part of the night. To determine whether long-term NCPAP therapy influences severity of sleep disordered breathing during the second part of a night when NCPAP is applied for only the first four hours of sleep, we studied 21 patients with OSA receiving NCPAP therapy for 253 +/- 41.6 days. Results from polysomnography for the period after withdrawal from NCPAP (night B) were compared to the corresponding period of sleep prior to initiation of NCPAP therapy (night A). There was no significant change in RDI from night A (53.9 +/- 8.6) to night B (28.7 +/- 3.3), but maximal apnea length diminished from 55 +/- 2.9 s to 40 +/- 2.9 s (p less than 0.05). Whereas daytime Po2 and the amplitude of desaturations during sleep remained equal, overall oxygenation during sleep improved slightly (mean SaO2 night A = 90.6 +/- 0.9 percent; night B = 92.8 +/- 0.5 percent; p less than 0.05). Differences between nights A and B were more prominent the more severe sleep apnea had been prior to treatment and could not be explained by weight loss. There was strong correlation between improvements in oxygenation measurements and the daily time of NCPAP use. In conclusion, we found a subgroup of OSA patients receiving long-term NCPAP therapy with less disturbed ventilation during sleep following use of NCPAP for only the first part of the night, but in the majority of patients, sleep disordered breathing off NCPAP remained unchanged. 
Synchronous lung cancers defined by deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry. When two pulmonary tumors are seen simultaneously in patients with lung cancer, it always raises a question as to whether the lesions are synchronous lung cancers or lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis. To settle this issue, we used deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry. Deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy patterns of tumors were able to be analyzed in 14 patients with two simultaneous pulmonary tumors resected by operation. These two tumors, with completely different patterns of deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy, were defined as synchronous lung cancers. Tumors were defined as lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis when both tumors showed diploidy or when at least one deoxyribonucleic acid index of abnormal clones between two aneuploid tumors was the same or almost identical. Tumors of the five patients with stage I disease were classified as synchronous lung cancers according to the criteria involving deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry. Both tumors were adenocarcinomas in four patients and large-cell and squamous cell carcinomas in one. Both tumors in four patients were located in the same lobe but different segments. All but one patient with different histologic types are alive without recurrence from 24 to 100 months after operation. Tumors of the nine patients with stage III disease in whom intrapulmonary metastasis was clinically suspected were classified as lung cancer with intrapulmonary metastasis according to the criteria. These data suggest that deoxyribonucleic acid flow cytometry of tumors may have diagnostic value in determining synchronous lung cancers. 
Inferior vena caval involvement by renal cell carcinoma. Use of venovenous bypass as adjunct during resection. Venovenous bypass allows the safe conduct of operation during resection of renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena caval involvement by allowing venous return when the inferior vena cava is clamped, thus preventing hypotension. It obviates the heparin required for full cardiopulmonary bypass and therefore decreases postoperative bleeding. A blood retrieval system decreases the volume of banked blood required. A Moretz clip placed early on the intrapericardial inferior vena cava allows adequate venous return and prevents a massive pulmonary tumor embolism. 
Aortoesophageal fistula: a comprehensive review of the literature. Aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) is a relatively rare but life-threatening cause of upper gastro-intestinal bleeding. The clinical characteristics of AEF are so unique that a presumptive bedside diagnosis can be made at the time of presentation. In the past decade, surgical management has improved to the point that cure is now possible. For these reasons, we have reviewed the literature. We summarize our findings with respect to the etiology and clinical characteristics of AEF. Further, we discuss the diagnostic modalities that may be used to confirm the diagnosis, and the therapeutic modalities available to slow the hemorrhage, so as to allow time to correct the anatomic defect. 
Metastases of a gastric adenocarcinoma presenting as colonic polyposis. Report of a case. The authors report a case of multiple colonic metastases of a gastric signet ring cell adenocarcinoma, presenting as colonic polyposis revealed by diarrhea, iron deficiency anemia, and left supraclavicular lymph node. 
Placenta previa percreta involving the urinary bladder: a report of two cases and review of the literature. The incidences of both placenta previa and placenta accreta are increased in patients with scarred uteri, and patients with uterine scars and placenta previa are at increased risk for also having placenta accreta. Two cases are presented of placenta previa percreta with involvement of the urinary bladder necessitating cesarean hysterectomy, partial cystectomy, and, in one case, bilateral ureteral reimplantation. Both patients had two previous cesarean deliveries. Serious hemorrhage is common in patients with placenta percreta. The primary goal of surgical management must be to control bleeding, which usually requires resection of all tissue involved by the infiltrating placenta. After hemorrhage is controlled, the surgeon must reestablish the integrity of the urinary system and reconstruct the pelvis as necessary. 
Porencephalic cyst: a complication of fetal intravascular transfusion. A case of unilateral porencephalic cyst as a result of intravascular intrauterine transfusion is reported. Although other factors may have contributed, fetal bradycardia and relative hyperviscosity as a result of increased fetal hematocrit value were considered to be related to this event. Because some authors recommend direct intravascular transfusion to supraphysiologic hematocrits to prolong the interval between procedures, we would caution the use of this approach on the basis of theoretic considerations and the occurrence of this complication. 
Suppressive effect of sulfate on the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the sulfate ion on blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertension, which involves increased sympathetic nervous activity. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups, and received one of the following drinking solutions: distilled water [control], 171 mmol/L sodium chloride [NaCl group], 171 mmol/L sodium chloride plus 12 mmol/L magnesium sulfate [S(+) group], or 171 mmol/L sodium chloride plus 12 mmol/L magnesium chloride [S(-) group]. In the S(+) group, the elevation of systolic blood pressure (SBP; mm Hg) was significantly attenuated (168 +/- 17 v 213 +/- 26, P less than .005) and intraerythrocyte calcium concentration (R-Ca; mumol/L cells) was significantly lower (11.5 +/- 3.0 v 17.4 +/- 6.5, P less than .05) than in the S(-) group. The cardiac norepinephrine content (H-NE; ng/100 g tissue) of the S(+) group was significantly lower than that of the S(-) group. SBP was correlated negatively with H-NE (r = -0.70, P less than .001) and positively with R-Ca (r = 0.45, P less than .005). R-Ca was negatively correlated with H-NE (r = -0.36, P less than .05). These results suggest that the replacement of chloride with sulfate ion suppresses the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt rats at least in part by its inhibitory effect on sympathetic nervous activity through the decreased intracellular calcium concentration. 
Physiologic stress and cellular ischemia: relationship to immunosuppression and susceptibility to sepsis. Multiple organ system failure secondary to infection is the most frequent cause of late mortality after hemorrhage, burns, and trauma. Although multiple immunologic abnormalities have been identified following injury, blood loss, and tissue ischemia, the mechanisms that produce these alterations in T- and B-cell function have not been completely defined. Physiologic stress and ischemia result in increased release of neuroendocrine peptides and hormones, capable of affecting normal neuroendocrine-immunologic balance and producing immunosuppression. Tissue ischemia leads to increased expression of heat shock proteins by hypoperfused cells, which can alter T-cell function. Injury also is followed by the appearance of serum immunosuppressive factors, which have been shown to inhibit T- and B-cell function. Future therapies directed at these and other cellular and molecular abnormalities initiated by tissue hypoperfusion may reverse the immunosuppressed state in critically ill patients and lead to improved outcome in this setting. 
Metachronous occurrence of collagenous colitis and ulcerative colitis. Collagenous colitis and ulcerative colitis are distinct disorders. A 67 year old woman with clinical and histological evidence of collagenous colitis had an abrupt symptomatic exacerbation while taking anti-inflammatory treatment with sulphasalazine and prednisone. Repeat colorectal endoscopy showed active mucosal inflammation and colonic biopsy specimens were consistent with active ulcerative colitis. After bowel rest, total parenteral nutrition, intensification of the anti-inflammatory regimen, and withdrawal of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (which she had taken continuously for osteoarthritis) diarrhoea abated. Colorectal biopsy specimens obtained when the patient's symptoms had improved showed inactive ulcerative colitis with no evidence of collagenous colitis. This may be the first case to be reported of the metachronous association of collagenous and ulcerative colitis. 
The use of aspirin to prevent heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty. A preliminary report. The reported incidence of heterotopic ossification (HO) after total hip arthroplasty (THA) ranges up to 50%. HO causes pain and restricted range of motion (ROM) in a significant number of these THA patients. From 1983 to 1988, 177 primary cemented THAs were performed in 131 consecutive patients. Six hundred fifty milligrams of buffered aspirin administered twice daily for two weeks was used as a prophylaxis for thromboembolic disease. There was an unusually low incidence of HO in this group of patients. Aspirin treatment was instituted the night before surgery and continued for two weeks, except in 13 patients (7%) who had to stop treatment because of gastrointestinal symptoms. All patients had at least one year of roentgenographic study postoperatively. According to the Brooker Classification of HO, there were 169 (96%) Grade I and Grade 0 hips, six (3%) Grade II, two (1%) Grade III, and no Grade IV. None of the patients had symptomatic restriction of ROM attributable to heterotopic bone. Aspirin is a safe and inexpensive agent for prevention of HO after THA. 
Salvage of thrombosed forearm polytetrafluoroethylene vascular access grafts by reversal of flow direction and venous bypass grafting. A technique is described for salvage of looped forearm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular access grafts that fail because of thrombosis due to cephalic vein outflow obstruction. It entails reversal of blood flow direction through the graft and construction of a new venous outflow in the medial upper arm. This procedure was performed in nine patients and, at the present time, has increased the graft life by an average of 6.2 months (range: 2 to 14 months) in eight. We conclude that this is a useful alternative to abandoning failed looped forearm PTFE grafts that have cephalic vein outflow obstruction. 
High rate of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with esophageal varices and idiopathic portal hypertension. Data on 126 consecutive patients who were admitted to our clinics from January 1979 to May 1989 were scrutinized to assess changes in portal hemodynamics following splenectomy. Two groups were classified: (1) a group of 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and (2) a group of 20 patients with idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH). Portal thrombosis was present in five (25.0%) of the 20 patients with IPH and in two (1.8%) of the 106 patients with cirrhosis of the liver. As seen on celiac arteriography, the mean (+/- SD) diameter of the trunk of the splenic artery and vein was 8.99 +/- 1.55 and 16.2 +/- 3.6 mm, respectively, in patients with IPH, while it was 7.94 +/- 1.28 and 14.2 +/- 3.1 mm, respectively, in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Changes in portal venous pressure were 78.4 +/- 59.4 mm H2O in patients with IPH and 43.5 +/- 38.7 mm H2O in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. There were no significant differences in the maximum level of thrombocytes in patients with IPH or in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver. These events suggest that portal thrombosis can occur with a significantly higher incidence in patients with IPH than in those patients with cirrhosis of the liver after splenectomy, and a decrease in blood flow in the portal vein may be closely linked to the formation of portal thrombosis after splenectomy in patients with IPH. Preoperative examination of portal hemodynamics must be thorough. 
The value of Doppler echocardiography in the management of patients with valvular heart disease: analysis of one year of clinical practice. Management recommendations based on Doppler echocardiographic examination and cardiac catheterization were compared in a prospective study in 100 consecutive patients who were admitted for evaluation and treatment of suspected valvular heart disease during 1988. Management recommendations were provided independently after both Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization by different and blinded investigators. Criteria for severe (clinically significant) and moderate to mild (insignificant) valvular lesions and management recommendations were agreed on in advance. There was disagreement on the severity of aortic stenosis based on the aortic valve area and maximum instantaneous pressure gradient in 1 of 54 patients, which resulted in differing management recommendations. Mitral stenosis was severe (valve area less than or equal to 1 cm2) at Doppler echocardiography but not at cardiac catheterization in 5 of 14 patients. Because pulmonary artery pressure increase during exercise at cardiac catheterization also suggested severe obstruction, management recommendations were similar. There was a potentially significant disagreement on the severity of aortic regurgitation in 9 of 76 patients and of mitral regurgitation in 14 of 90 patients; however, this did not produce differing management recommendations because with most patients coexistent valvular lesions or an impaired ventricular function mainly determined the ultimate management decision. Although of good quality, Doppler echocardiographic examination was nonconclusive for clinical decision-making in 15% of the study population because of uncertainty about the severity of mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation or because of problems in assessing the degree of left ventricular dysfunction in patients with severe regurgitation. 
Sexual asphyxia in siblings. We present an accidental autoerotic asphyxiation of a 24-year-old man. Further investigation revealed that 18 years earlier, his brother, then 13, had been found dead, hanging in the family bathroom. Although that death had been ruled a suicide, reevaluation of the death scene indicates that this was also an autoerotic asphyxiation. This is the first reported case of sexual asphyxia involving siblings. 
Larynx preservation with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy in advanced but resectable head and neck cancer. Forty patients with advanced, resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, oropharynx, or hypopharynx whose surgery would have required total laryngectomy (TL), were treated with one to three cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy before local therapy with the goal of larynx preservation. Clinical complete responses (CRs) or partial responses (PRs) to chemotherapy were seen in 26 of 40 patients (65%). Three patients with primary-site disease unresponsive to chemotherapy underwent resection of the primary lesion and neck dissection followed by radiation therapy (RT). Thirty-seven patients were referred after chemotherapy for RT +/- neck dissection. Thirty-one of 40 patient (78%) were rendered disease-free (no evidence of disease [NED]). With a median follow-up of 49 months (range, 31 to 76), the overall actuarial survival rate for the group was 58% at 2 years and 33% at 5 years. The failure-free survival rate was 42% and 33% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Seven patients refused recommended TL throughout their course. This may have adversely affected survival results. A greater proportion of patients who achieved a CR or PR to chemotherapy remained disease-free compared with those who achieved less than a PR (P less than .001). Sixteen patients relapsed, 10 with locoregional disease. Six patients underwent TL, either for initial induction failure or at relapse, for an actual larynx-preservation rate of 34 of 40 patients (85%). If the seven patients who refused TL are included, the anticipated preservation rate is 27 of 40 patients (68%). Larynx preservation with combined chemotherapy and radiation is feasible and effective in patients with advanced, resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCHN). This treatment approach requires a motivated patient, careful patient monitoring, and close interdisciplinary cooperation among oncologists. 
Development of a novel 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3 analog with potent ability to induce HL-60 cell differentiation without modulating calcium metabolism. We describe several novel analogs of the seco-steroid 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D3[1,25(OH)2D3] and their effects on differentiation and proliferation of HL-60 human myeloid leukemic cells in vitro as well as their effects on calcium metabolism in vivo. The 1 alpha-25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-26,27F6-vitamin D3 is the most potent analog reported to date, having about 80-fold more activity than the reference 1,25(OH)2D3 for inhibition of proliferation and induction of differentiation of HL-60 cells. Also, this analog decreased RNA expression of MYC oncogene in HL-60 by 90% at 5 x 10(-10) mol/L. Intriguingly, intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium mobilization mediated in vivo by 1 alpha-25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-26,27F6-D3 was found to be markedly (15-fold) less than that of 1,25(OH)2D3. In addition, 1 alpha-25(OH)2D3 bound to 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors of both HL-60 and intestine more avidly than did 1 alpha-25(OH)2-16ene-23yne-26,27F6-D3. This novel analog may open up new therapeutic strategies for several hematopoietic, skin, and bone abnormalities and may provide a new tool to understand how vitamin D3 seco-steroids induce cellular differentiation. 
Identification of the proximal neck of giant paraclinoidal aneurysms. Technical note. Introduction of a double-lumen Swan-Ganz balloon catheter into the parent artery facilitated precise identification of the proximal neck in two giant paraclinoidal aneurysms. Reduction of the flow rate as low as possible and positioning of the patient's head were the most important factors in this procedure. 
Glutethimide treatment of disabling action tremor in patients with multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Glutethimide has been used to control essential tremor. Its efficacy in the treatment of disabling cerebellar and rubral tremor was assessed in an open study of six patients with multiple sclerosis and two patients with traumatic brain injury. Functional and quantitative tremor severity was assessed before treatment and 7 to 14 days after a stable dose was achieved. Six of eight patients exhibited visible functional benefit from treatment with glutethimide; abstract testing results correlated well with functional status in most cases. Four patients chose to continue to receive medication. Controlled trials of glutethimide to compare its efficacy with that of other medications used in the treatment of action tremor are indicated. 
Short-course versus long-course antibiotic treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A randomized controlled study of 100 patients. In an attempt to determine the optimal duration of therapy of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, 100 patients with neutrocytic ascites and suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were randomized to short-course vs. long-course treatment groups. Empiric therapy was initiated before the results of ascitic fluid culture were available. Of the 90 patients who met strict criteria for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or culture-negative neutrocytic ascites, 43 were randomized to a group receiving 5 days and 47 to a group receiving 10 days of single-agent cefotaxime, 2 g IV every 8 hours. Infection-related mortality (0% vs. 4.3%), hospitalization mortality (32.6% vs. 42.5%), bacteriologic cure (93.1% vs. 91.2%), and recurrence of ascitic fluid infection (11.6% vs. 12.8%) were not significantly different between the 5- and 10-day treatment groups, respectively. Recurrence rates were comparable to the values reported in the literature. The cost of antibiotic and antibiotic administration were significantly lower in the short-course group. Short-course treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is as efficacious as long-course therapy and significantly less expensive. 
Acid secretion and suppression. Hydrochloric acid is involved in the causation of peptic ulcer, but the exact role has not been defined. Suppression of acid secretion is associated with ulcer healing. The acid secreting cell is the parietal cell, which possesses a proton pump in the secretory membrane; morphologic changes accompany and facilitate the active secretion of hydrochloric acid. Stimulation of acid secretion occurs by three major pathways, which utilize acetylcholine, histamine, and gastrin. The predominant effects of histamine are mediated by adenylate cyclase, whereas those of gastrin and acetylcholine involve cytosolic calcium. There is a complicated arrangement of receptors and pathways that culminate in the activation of the proton pump. The parietal cell is influenced by neurocrine, hormonal, and paracrine mechanisms. Peptides join the more familiar neurotransmitters in affecting the parietal cell. Somatostatin is present in the gut and acts to decrease acid secretion. The hormone gastrin is released, in a feedback fashion, when the antrum is alkalinized. Most stimuli of acid secretion are blocked by H2-antagonists. Inhibitory hormones are released when acid arrives in the intestine. Inhibition of acid secretion can be achieved by influencing the parietal cell at the level of histamine, gastrin, and muscarinic receptors. The proton pump itself can be blocked by drugs that inhibit the final phase of acid secretion. 
Platelet emboli in rat brain cross when the contralateral carotid artery is occluded. The pathogenesis of embolic events ipsilateral to an occluded carotid artery is uncertain. To examine this question we combined occlusion of the left common carotid artery with embolism from the right common carotid artery in rats. Following ligation of the left carotid artery in 20 experimental rats, we irradiated the right carotid artery with a laser (632 nm, 200 mW/cm2, 12-15 minutes) following the intravenous injection of 12.5 mg/kg of the photosensitizing agent Photofrin II. Controls had left carotid artery occlusion with (n = 13) or without (n = 6) Photofrin II. Fifteen of the 20 experimental rats survived to be perfused at 24 hours; cerebral infarcts were identified in 12 rats, with bilateral infarcts in 10. There were 112 infarcts (101 small [less than 2.5 mm] and 11 large [greater than 2.5 mm] on the right and 103 (93 small and 10 large) on the left. Emboli were seen in association with some infarcts and were evenly distributed in the two hemispheres (37 emboli on the right and 40 on the left, with the midline azygous artery occluded in four animals). Left carotid artery occlusion did not produce infarcts or emboli in the controls. We conclude that cerebral infarcts in the distribution of an occluded common carotid artery may be caused by emboli from the contralateral carotid artery in rats. 
Traditional first-line therapy. Overview of medical benefits and side effects. When diuretic-based stepped care was first advocated for the treatment of hypertension, there were fewer classes of antihypertensive medication than there are today. In 1984, the third Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) for the first time suggested an alternative initial treatment with a beta-blocker in selected hypertensive patients, and the fourth JNC report has recommended the alternatives of calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for step-one therapy as well. However, only the diuretic drugs and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in prospective, long-term, controlled trials. Moreover, 30 years' experience with diuretic agents and 20 years' experience with beta-blockers have defined the advantages, disadvantages, and potential side effects of these drugs more precisely than is possible for newer agents. The diuretic drugs and beta-blockers remain excellent choices in the management of hypertension. 
Timing of invasive procedures in therapy for primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Timing of invasive procedures during chest tube therapy in spontaneous pneumothorax is undefined. Evaluation of 115 patients with primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax treated with tube thoracostomy revealed nearly maximal healing rates after 48 hours without a relevant increase if drainage was maintained for up to 10 days. In secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, a significantly lower healing rate was observed after 48 hours compared with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (60% vs 82%). Therapeutic success was not predictable by single clinical variables available at admission (eg, age, gender, and smoking habits) nor by their combinations. Recurrence rates were 30% in both primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Hospital stay averaged 6 days in primary and 15 days in secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Considering their efficacy and the low incidence of complications, the early use of invasive procedures such as surgical pleurectomy, after 48 hours of persistent gas leaking, seems justified. Shorter in-patient care and lower recurrence rates may result. 
Focal high signal on MR scans of the midbrain caused by enlarged perivascular spaces: MR-pathologic correlation. Punctate and linear foci of abnormal signal were observed near the substantia nigra in the midbrains of 32 (20%) of 157 patients undergoing high-resolution MR imaging of the brainstem. The lesions were most easily seen on long TR/long TE images, where they were of high signal intensity. Their location was consistently in the lower mesencephalon near the junction of the substantia nigra and cerebral peduncle. Unilateral lesions were observed in 18 cases, while bilateral lesions were noted in 14. A review of anatomic specimens revealed the constant presence of penetrating branches of the collicular or accessory collicular arteries in this location. Enlarged perivascular spaces around these vessels were frequently seen in the specimens and probably account for punctate and linear foci observed on high-resolution MR images of the midbrain. 
Dietary calcium supplementation as a treatment for mild hypertension. The blood pressure responses of 19 mildly hypertensive (diastolic blood pressure 90-104 mmHg) individuals to treatment with either 1200 mg of elemental calcium supplementation or placebo were assessed weekly in a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Both groups showed a decrease in blood pressure (calcium treated: 6 +/- 12 mmHg systolic, 7 +/- 7 mmHg diastolic; and placebo controlled: 9 +/- 14 mmHg systolic, 9 +/- 8 mmHg diastolic). Differences between the two groups were not significant (P greater than 0.1). There were no adverse effects to either treatment. This study does not support the hypothesis that dietary calcium supplementation is more effective than placebo in reducing blood pressure in mildly hypertensive individuals. 
The contributions of interpersonal conflict to chronic pain in the presence or absence of organic pathology. This study investigated the influences of social support and interpersonal conflict on chronic pain in patients with arthritis or with myofascial disorders. Measures of social support, conflict, and pain were drawn from subscales of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, the Family Environment Scale, and the Interpersonal Relationship Inventory. Patients with myofascial disorders reported significantly worse pain (sensory and affective), higher depression scores, more interpersonal conflict, and less support from others than patients with arthritis, but did not differ from them on personality traits. Also, the contributions of conflict to pain were found to depend on the nature of the chronic disorder and on the source of the conflict, i.e., significant other, family, or social network members. For patients with arthritis, less intense pain (sensory and affective) was associated with higher family conflict. Less intense sensory pain in arthritis was also associated with more punishing responses from the significant other to pain. For patients with myofascial disorders, more intense affective pain was associated with higher social network conflict. Social support did not significantly contribute to pain for either group. Thus, chronic painful disorders may differ on the influences that social relationships have on pain. The implications of these differences for treatment are discussed. 
cis-platinum ototoxicity in children. Cis-platinum is an ototoxic antineoplastic drug. Evaluation of auditory thresholds in 33 children receiving cis-platinum shows that a threshold shift at 6 and 8 kHz is first measurable after a cumulative dose of 201 to 300 mg/m2. A 35- to 40-dB high-frequency threshold shift is evident after a cumulative cis-platinum dose of 301 to 400 mg/m2. Increasing cumulative doses of cis-platinum are associated with a greater degree of hearing loss. Receiver-operator characteristic curves were used to find a criterion value that effectively identified threshold shifts that were due to cis-platinum ototoxicity. A 15-dB or greater shift in the 6- and 8-kHz threshold average identifies a high true-positive (50%) and low false-positive (0%) rate of cis-platinum-induced hearing loss. Using this criterion, cis-platinum ototoxicity affected 77% of children who received cis-platinum (median cumulative dose 360 mg/m2). 
Ultrastructural localization of interferon-producing cells in the livers of patients with chronic hepatitis B. Cells expressing alpha- and gamma-interferon were localized in the liver tissue of patients with chronic hepatitis B by means of light and electron microscopy using monoclonal antibodies. Interferon-positive cells were regularly seen in the infiltrating mononuclear cells, and the number showed a good correlation with the degree of the necroinflammatory activity of the disease. In chronic persistent hepatitis and in normal livers, they were infrequent or virtually absent. alpha-Interferon was shown to be positive in lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and fibroblasts, Kupffer cells and, weakly, in the cytoplasm of a few hepatocytes in cases of active hepatitis, whereas gamma-interferon was demonstrated only in lymphocytes. The expression of human leukocyte class I antigens on hepatocytes showed a close association with the number of interferon-producing cells, but not with the presence of virus particles and HBcAg in liver cells, when studied using electron microscopy and double-labeling. Interferon seems to be an important regulator of the local immune response in the liver in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Its functions may play a role in inducing the human leukocyte class I antigen expression on hepatocytes, thus enhancing the elimination of virus-containing hepatocytes by major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic lymphocytes. 
Factors affecting perioperative pulmonary function in acute respiratory failure. To determine the magnitude, duration, and associated factors of perioperative changes in pulmonary function, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 145 patients who required preoperative mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure before undergoing 200 surgical procedures. Patients were grouped into five pulmonary diagnostic categories: (1) adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 49); (2) pneumonia (n = 20); (3) atelectasis (n = 65); (4) congestive heart failure (n = 11); and (5) acute ventilatory failure (n = 55). Sixty patients underwent intra-abdominal surgery, 135 patients required surgery on the periphery, and five patients had a thoracotomy. For all patients, PaO2/FIO2 declined significantly from 321 mm Hg (mean) preoperatively to 258 mm Hg intraoperatively, and shunt fraction (Qs/QT) increased from 0.16 to 0.23 without a significant change in PaCO2. The magnitude of the increase in Qs/QT did not differ among pulmonary diagnostic groups. Preoperatively, patients undergoing laparotomy had lower PaO2/FIO2 (278 vs 340) and higher Qs/QT (0.19 vs 0.14) than patients requiring surgery on the periphery. Intraoperatively, Qs/QT increased more during abdominal procedures than during peripheral procedures. Intraoperative hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2 less than 80 mm Hg) occurred during 13 procedures. Hypoxemic patients had a mean increase in Qs/QT of 0.20 (0.25 preoperatively to 0.45 intraoperatively), and a significant increase in PaCO2 from 38 mm Hg to 45 mm Hg intraoperatively). In general, these patients had ARDS (n = 10), sepsis (n = 10), a laparotomy (n = 9), and intraoperative mechanical ventilation via the Ohio Anesthesia ventilator (n = 8), a commonly used operating room ventilator. Their preoperative peak airway pressure (54 cm H2O) and minute ventilation (20 L/min) requirements exceeded the capabilities of the Ohio Anesthesia ventilator and likely contributed to impaired gas exchange intraoperatively. Within the first several hours postoperatively, PaO2/FIO2 recovered to preoperative levels in all patients, even in those who had severe intraoperative hypoxemia develop and who underwent laparotomy. We conclude that most patients with acute respiratory failure receiving preoperative mechanical ventilation experienced mild-to-moderate deterioration in intraoperative pulmonary oxygen exchange that rapidly returned to preoperative levels after surgery. We recommend that necessary surgery not be postponed by concern that pulmonary function will be worsened by surgery and anesthesia. 
Spinal cord pial metastases: MR imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine. The purpose of this investigation was to describe gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced MR findings in metastatic disease to the pial lining of the spinal cord. Correlation was made with clinical data, other radiologic studies, and pathologic findings. Eighty-six patients with a known malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms were studied with pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images. In seven of these patients, abnormal enhancement of the pial lining of the cord was seen on the sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted images. This appeared as a thin rim of enhancement along the surface of the cord in six patients and as a focal, thick rim of enhancement in addition to the thin rim of enhancement in the seventh patient. Axial images confirmed the location along the pial lining in each case. Precontrast T1-weighted images in all seven cases and precontrast T2-weighted images in five cases failed to detect any focal abnormalities of the pial lining of the cord. Pathologic confirmation was available in five of the seven patients. Primary malignancies in these patients included breast carcinomas (two), lymphoma (one), leukemia (one), adenocarcinoma of the lung (one), prostate carcinoma (one), and malignant melanoma (one). Three of seven patients had metastatic disease evident only within the CNS, while four patients had widespread disease outside the CNS. We conclude that contrast-enhanced MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis of pial spread of metastatic disease in patients with a known primary malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms. 
Cough, exertional, and other miscellaneous headaches. We have discussed several miscellaneous headache disorders not associated with structural brain disease. The first group included those headaches provoked by "exertional" triggers in various forms. These include benign cough headache, BEH, and headache associated with sexual activity. The IHS diagnostic criteria were discussed. Benign exertional headache and cough headache were discussed together because of their substantial similarities. In general, BEH is characterized by severe, short-lived pain after coughing, sneezing, lifting a burden, sexual activity, or other similar brief effort. Structural disease of the brain or skull was the most important differential diagnosis for these disorders, with posterior fossa mass lesions being identified as the most common organic etiology. Magnetic resonance imaging with special attention to the posterior fossa and foramen magnum is the preferred method for evaluating these patients. Indomethacin is the treatment of choice. The headache associated with sexual activity is dull in the early phases of sexual excitement and becomes intense at orgasm. This headache is unpredictable in occurrence. Like BEH, the headache associated with sexual activity can be a manifestation of structural disease. Subarachnoid hemorrhage must be excluded, by CT scanning and CSF examination, in patients with the sexual headache. Benign headache associated with sexual activity has been successfully treated with indomethacin and beta-blockers. The second miscellaneous group of headache disorders includes those provoked by eating something cold or food additives, and by environmental stimuli. Idiopathic stabbing headache does not have a known trigger and appears frequently in migraineurs. Its occurrence may also herald the termination of an attack of cluster headache. Indomethacin treatment provides significant relief. Three headaches triggered by substances that are eaten were reviewed: ingestion of a cold stimulus, nitrate/nitrite-induced headache, and MSG-induced headache. For the most part, avoidance of these stimuli can prevent the associated headache. Lastly, we reviewed headache provoked by high altitude and hypoxia. The headache is part of the syndrome of AMS during its early or benign stage and the later malignant stage of HACE. The pain can be exacerbated by exercise. The best treatment is prevention via slow ascent and avoidance of respiratory depressants. Acetazolamide and dexamethasone have proved useful in preventing this syndrome. 
Differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia with tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid). BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia have a characteristic (15;17) translocation, with a breakpoint on chromosome 17 in the region of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha). Since this receptor has been shown to be involved with growth and differentiation of myeloid cells in vitro, and since recent clinical studies have reported that tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) induces complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia we studied the effects of tretinoin on cellular maturation and molecular abnormalities in patients undergoing the induction of remission with this agent. RESULTS. Eleven patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were treated with tretinoin administered orally at a dose of 45 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day. Nine of the 11 patients entered complete remission. In two patients, complete remission was preceded by striking leukocytosis that then resolved despite continued drug treatment. Serial studies of cellular morphologic features, cell-surface immunophenotypic analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with a chromosome 17 probe revealed that clinical response was associated with maturation of the leukemic clone. All patients who responded to treatment who were tested by Northern blot analysis had expression of aberrant RAR-alpha. As patients entered complete remission, the expression of the abnormal RAR-alpha message decreased markedly; however, it was still detectable in several patients after complete morphologic and cytogenetic remission had been achieved. CONCLUSIONS. Tretinoin is a safe and highly effective agent for inducing complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Clinical response to this agent is associated with leukemic-cell differentiation and is linked to the expression of an aberrant RAR-alpha nuclear receptor. Molecular detection of the aberrant receptor may serve as a useful marker for residual leukemia in patients with this disease. 
Canine myocardial creatine kinase isoenzymes after chronic coronary artery occlusion. BACKGROUND. Creatine kinase (CK) exists as three cytosolic isoenzymes, CK-MM, CK-MB, and CK-BB, and one mitochondrial isoenzyme. Animal and human observations suggest that the CK-MB content of myocardium is dynamic and may increase in response to ischemia, but the response of the myocardial CK system to chronic coronary artery occlusion is not well-defined. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured serial changes in myocardial total CK, percent CK-MB, and percent CK-BB before and 3 weeks after coronary artery occlusion in 17 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Tissue biopsies were obtained from the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery myocardium, the right coronary artery (RCA) myocardium, and the circumflex coronary artery myocardium at baseline and 3 weeks after LAD occlusion (n = 6), RCA occlusion (n = 5), and no coronary artery occlusion (n = 6). Tissue samples were assayed for total CK, percent CK-MB, and percent CK-BB. Samples were also examined by electron microscopy for evidence of ischemic myopathy. Total myocardial CK activity did not change over 3 weeks. Percent CK-MB increased significantly in the tissue supplied by the occluded artery (4.1-fold in dogs with LAD occlusion and 6.7-fold in dogs with RCA occlusion). Percent CK-BB did not change. Dogs with LAD occlusion had ultrastructural evidence of myopathic fibers interspersed with normal fibers in the LAD myocardium. Dogs with RCA occlusion had no ultrastructural evidence of myopathic fibers in the RCA myocardium. CONCLUSIONS. Chronic coronary artery occlusion causes a pronounced change in the canine myocardial CK system that is limited to the tissue supplied by the occluded coronary artery. These biochemical alterations do not correlate with any cellular ultrastructural changes. Myocardial CK-MB content is dynamic, varies geographically within the heart, and increases rapidly after coronary artery occlusion. 
Segmental neurofibromatosis. Two patients had localized multiple cutaneous neurofibromas; one had bilateral involvement of the scalp and the other had true segmental neurofibromatosis. Other signs of neurofibromatosis were absent. Segmental neurofibromatosis may not be related to the generalized types of neurofibromatosis but may be a cutaneous hamartoma. 
Mandible reconstruction with vascularized bone grafts. A histologic evaluation. To our knowledge, a histologic evaluation of bone healing after mandible reconstruction with vascularized human bone grafts has not been previously reported. Serial sections through both the decalcified graft and the junction between mandible and graft were evaluated in four patients who required surgical removal of their reconstructed mandibles. A failed scapular bone graft that had been wrapped within a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap for salvage following pedicle thrombosis showed markedly resorbed but viable bone with a fibrous union to the native mandible. Viable vascularized grafts without evidence of ongoing resorption characterized an iliac osteocutaneous bone graft and two scapula osteocutaneous grafts that healed with continuity of healthy bone between graft and mandible. Observations from the evaluation of these specimens are made regarding bone circulation, bone union, and bone graft survival as they occur clinically. Implications regarding the techniques of bone plating and indications for use of vascularized bone in mandible reconstruction are discussed. 
Conservative treatment and long term prophylactic thyroxine in the prevention of recurrence of multinodular goiter. It has not been universally agreed upon that there is an optimum treatment for multinodular goiter and that use of thyroxine postoperatively in preventing recurrence is effective. We have studied a group of 185 patients who underwent thyroid gland operations and who were observed for a mean period of 10.25 years. Of these, 171 patients received postoperative thyroxine in a dose of 100 micrograms per day and a small group (14 patients) received no medication. In the group receiving no thyroxine, there were six recurrences, and in the group that received postoperative prophylactic thyroxine, there were nine recurrences, which is statistically significant (p = 0.003 per cent). When recurrences did occur in the thyroxine treated group they were small and easily managed by increasing the dose of thyroxine. No patient who took thyroxine postoperatively continuously underwent a second thyroidectomy. We conclude that, in this series, our policy of resecting only macroscopically pathologic thyroid tissue and prescribing prophylactic postoperative thyroxine is successful in preventing recurrent nodular goiter. 
Immunohistochemical quantification of substance P in spinal dorsal horns of patients with multiple system atrophy. Using a computer-assisted image analyser, an immunohistochemical quantification method of substance P-like immunoreactivity (SPLI) in laminae I + II of spinal dorsal horn was established and applied to 13 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) with no disturbance of pain sensation, including olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy and striatonigral degeneration, and 13 neurologically normal controls. To investigate whether alteration of SPLI is related to an autonomic disorder, myelinated fibre counts of the fourth thoracic ventral roots were performed. Eleven of 13 MSA patients showed a significant decrease in small and large myelinated fibres, and were diagnosed with definite Shy-Drager syndrome (SDS), with the exception of two who had no apparent history of autonomic dysfunction. SPLIs in laminae I + II in 10 of these 11 patients, when adjusted for age, were significantly decreased at both levels of the fourth thoracic and third lumbar spinal segments. The results suggest the disorder of SP-containing synapses of primary afferent neurons and/or those of interneurons in SDS. 
Screening for renovascular hypertension. The most common curable cause of high blood pressure is renovascular hypertension. Although hypertension is common in the United States, only a minority, approximately 1%, of patients have a renovascular cause. Using clinical criteria, a subgroup of these patients can be selected in which the prevalence of renovascular hypertension will be approximately 15%. In these selected patients, it is appropriate to proceed to a radiographic screening modality to look for a significant renal artery stenosis. The choice of modality should reflect the strengths and expertise of each specific institution. Hypertensive urography is no longer recommended for screening. Excellent results have been reported with intravenous DSRA in institutions where a strong interest in this procedure exists. Furthermore, intravenous DSRA is easily coupled with the collection of renal vein samples for renin assay. Intravenous DSRA, however, has not maintained widespread use. Although the radionuclide renogram is no longer adequate as a radiographic screening tool, stimulation with an ACE inhibitor, such as captopril or enalaprilat, may produce excellent results. In many institutions, this is the most appropriate examination. Furthermore, it is relatively noninvasive. Merely detecting a significant renal artery stenosis does not, however, mean the patient has renovascular hypertension. Both hypertension and a renal artery stenosis may be present and not be causally related. Because renovascular hypertension is, at least initially, renin mediated, the demonstration of increased renin production by the ipsilateral kidney should confirm renovascular hypertension. Prospective application of these results to patients undergoing revascularization techniques, however, has been disappointing. This may be related to problems in patient preparation, sample collection, renin assay, or even the physiology of chronic hypertension, which is incompletely renin mediated. Thus, offering revascularization only to those patients with lateralizing renal vein renins is not appropriate. If radiographic screening is limited to those patient at greatest likelihood for a renovascular etiology, intra-arterial DSRA or conventional arteriography may be used. These techniques most reliably detect renal artery stenosis. Their main disadvantage lies in their relatively invasive nature, as an arterial puncture is required. The poor predictive value of selective RVRRs implies that revascularization may be attempted without awaiting those results. If percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty can be performed with a satisfactorily low complication rate, both the diagnostic and the interventional procedure may be undertaken at the same setting. It is expected that further refinements in these diagnostic procedures, particularly with the use of stimulating drugs such as ACE inhibitors, will lead to further improvement in the diagnostic results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Malignant colorectal polyps: venous invasion and successful treatment by endoscopic polypectomy. We reviewed the pathology of 81 malignant colorectal polyps in 80 patients treated by endoscopic polypectomy and assessed the importance of carcinomatous invasion of veins in the stalk (submucosa). All the patients were followed up for at least five years. Venous invasion was present in 30 of the polyps (37%). The histological features of lymphatic invasion were considered too subjective to be of value. Most of the tumours were well or moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas, one was poorly differentiated, and one was a signet ring cell carcinoma. Seventy one patients were treated by polypectomy alone, and 58 of these were alive and well five years later, with no evidence of recurrence. Nine died of unrelated causes within five years, but four died of carcinomatosis: one with recurrent tumour, one with a possible metachronous caecal cancer, and in two patients there was late development of malignancy of uncertain nature. The remaining nine patients underwent surgical resection after initial endoscopic polypectomy because of incompleteness of excision, poor differentiation of the tumour, or a decision by the surgeon. Tumour was not present in the resection specimens apart from a single lymph node deposit in the patient with signet ring cell carcinoma. These nine patients were alive and well without evidence of recurrence five years later. The results reemphasise the necessity of good cooperation between endoscopist and pathologist, meticulous laboratory technique, strict histopathological criteria including examination of resection margins and degree of differentiation of the tumour, and regular endoscopic follow up. 
Acute promyelocytic leukemia in Crohn's disease. Case report and review of the literature. A 19-year-old man with a documented 2-year history of Crohn's disease abruptly developed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. A diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia was established by bone marrow cytology. Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow aspirate revealed aberrations of no. 8 trisomy and translocation between no. 15 and no. 17 [46,XY,t(15q+,17q-)/47,XY,+8,t(15q+,17q-)]. Nine cases of Crohn's disease complicated by leukemia have been reported, including the present one; once again, a relationship between Crohn's disease and leukemia is suggested. 
Endocrine therapy for desmoid tumors. Two female patients with desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) showed tumor regression after endocrine therapy. In one patient, tumor response to tamoxifen has been maintained over several years of treatment. In the second patient, who had inoperable mesenteric fibromatosis, the tumor progressed on tamoxifen but regressed after treatment with Zoladex (goserelin acetate, ICI, Melbourne, Australia) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of the use of Zoladex in the treatment of desmoid tumors. This review of the literature reveals that the biology of this disease is related to the endogenous hormonal environment and that estrogen receptors have been documented in desmoid tumors. Thirty-five cases are identified where endocrine agents have been employed, with a response rate of 51%. Furthermore, tumors may respond to second-line hormonal therapy after failing to respond to initial endocrine treatment. Endocrine treatments have also been used in other disorders of fibroblastic origin. The authors recommend that endocrine treatment be employed in inoperable desmoid tumors or where there has been postsurgical recurrence. In addition, the role for endocrine therapy in other soft tissue neoplasms should be determined. 
Risk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage in a longitudinal population study. The known risk factors of atherosclerotic diseases may be involved in the development of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. We studied the morbidity and mortality due to subarachnoid hemorrhage among 42,862 men and women aged 20-69 years who had participated in a large health survey in Finland. During a mean follow-up of 12 years, 102 non-fatal and 85 fatal cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage were observed. The total incidence was 37 per 100,000 person-years. Smoking and hypertension were positively associated and body mass index was inversely associated with the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage. These associations were not confounded by age or each other. No statistically significant association with risk was detected for serum cholesterol level, hematocrit content, known heart disease, or diabetes. The risk was especially elevated among lean hypertensive subjects and lean smoking subjects. The age-adjusted relative risks of subarachnoid hemorrhage for lean, hypertensive smokers were 18.3 (95% confidence interval (CI), 7.8-42.7) among women and 6.7 (95% CI, 2.3-19.7) among men as compared to the risk among subjects without these risk factors. We conclude that modifiable risk factors are predictive of subarachnoid hemorrhage, for which reason subarachnoid hemorrhage may in part be preventable. Leanness combined with arterial hypertension and/or smoking, in particular, poses a substantially elevated risk. 
On a possible protective effect of HLA-A11 against skin cancer and keratotic skin lesions in renal transplant recipients. Renal transplant recipients who have skin cancer potentially related to human papillomavirus were HLA typed with a special focus on HLA-A11, which in nonimmunosuppressed patients is negatively associated with the occurrence of virus-related carcinoma of the cervix. We found also a negative association between HLA-A11 and skin cancer; none of the 66 transplant recipients with skin cancer were positive for HLA-A11. As HLA-A11 seems to have a protective effect against skin cancer, we speculate that antigens induced by squamous cell carcinomas and possibly also by human papillomavirus may be efficiently presented through HLA-A11 to cytotoxic T cells. We also investigated a possible influence of other HLA alleles on the susceptibility of renal transplant recipients to skin cancer. The frequency of HLA-B27 was significantly higher in the transplant recipients with skin cancer, with a relative risk of 3.4 relative to healthy controls. No significant differences were found for other HLA class I or class II antigens. 
Acute promyelocytic leukemia in Crohn's disease. Case report and review of the literature. A 19-year-old man with a documented 2-year history of Crohn's disease abruptly developed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. A diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia was established by bone marrow cytology. Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow aspirate revealed aberrations of no. 8 trisomy and translocation between no. 15 and no. 17 [46,XY,t(15q+,17q-)/47,XY,+8,t(15q+,17q-)]. Nine cases of Crohn's disease complicated by leukemia have been reported, including the present one; once again, a relationship between Crohn's disease and leukemia is suggested. 
Glucagon and clonidine testing in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of glucagon stimulation and clonidine suppression tests in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma in 113 hypertensive patients, 39 with and 74 without the tumor. In the glucagon stimulation test, blood was sampled 2 minutes after intravenous injection of 0.28 mumol (1 mg) glucagon, and in the clonidine suppression test, blood was sampled 3 hours after administration of oral clonidine, 1.30 mumol (0.3 mg)/70 kg body wt. Baseline levels of catechols in antecubital venous blood were abnormal, with norepinephrine greater than 7.10 nmol/l (1,200 pg/m), epinephrine greater than 1.51 nmol/l (276 pg/ml), norepinephrine/dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) ratio greater than 1.09, or dopa greater than 35.53 nmol/l (7,000 pg/ml), in 30 of 39 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 77%) and 1 of 74 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 99%). Results of the glucagon test were abnormal (norepinephrine greater than 11.83 nmol/l [2,000 pg/ml] or more than threefold increase from baseline) in 25 of 31 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 81%) and 0 of 72 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 100%). Results of the clonidine test were abnormal (after clonidine norepinephrine greater than 2.96 nmol/l [500 pg/ml] or less than 50% decrease from baseline) in 29 of 30 patients with pheochromocytoma (sensitivity 97%) and in 7 of 30 patients without pheochromocytoma (specificity 67%). Very high baseline levels of catechols therefore indicated the presence of pheochromocytoma, but there were several false-negative results when normal levels were obtained. The glucagon test alone was highly specific but not sensitive, and the clonidine test was highly sensitive but less specific. 
The relationship between locomotor disability, autonomic dysfunction, and the integrity of the striatal dopaminergic system in patients with multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and Parkinson's disease, studied with PET. 18F-dopa and S-11C-nomifensine (NMF) are positron emitting tracers whose caudate and putamen uptake reflects striatal dopamine storage capacity and the integrity of dopamine reuptake sites, respectively. Using these two tracers, the integrity of the presynaptic striatal dopaminergic system has been studied with positron emission tomography (PET) in 10 subjects with multiple system atrophy (MSA, Shy-Drager syndrome) who had an akinetic-rigid syndrome that was poorly responsive to L-dopa, autonomic failure, and cerebellar ataxia. PET findings for the 10 MSA patients were compared with those for 13 age-matched controls, 8 subjects with L-dopa responsive Parkinson's disease (PD), and 7 subjects with pure autonomic failure (PAF). Influx constants, Ki, reflecting specific 18F-dopa uptake into striatal tissue, were severely reduced in the putamen and caudate of the 10 MSA subjects (mean putamen Ki 0.005 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls; mean caudate Ki 0.007 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls). Reduction of putamen, but not caudate, 18F-dopa uptake correlated with severity and duration of locomotor disability. Eight patients with PD, and a similar degree and duration of locomotor disability to the patients with MSA, demonstrated equal impairment of mean putamen 18F-dopa uptake, but significant preservation of mean caudate function. The 7 PAF patients had normal mean levels of putamen and caudate 18F-dopa uptake, although 1 individual PAF patient had significantly impaired striatal function. The MSA and PD groups of subjects both showed significantly reduced levels of specific striatal S-11C-NMF binding, again caudate function being relatively preserved in PD. It is concluded that in both MSA and PD there is a parallel decline of striatal dopamine storage capacity and reuptake site integrity, probably reflecting a loss of nigrostriatal nerve terminals. Caudate function is relatively preserved in PD compared with MSA. The majority of PAF patients have an intact nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, suggesting that PAF is a condition distinct from PD and MSA in spite of some pathological similarities. PET is capable of detecting subclinical nigrostriatal involvement in PAF patients when this is present. 
Factors affecting decisions made by family members of patients with severe head injury. An exploratory descriptive study was conducted to determine factors affecting decisions made by families of patients with severe head injury during the first two stages of recovery. Nineteen family members of 11 patients participated in this study. Five interviews of each family member were conducted over a 1-month period after the injury. Sixty decisions were identified by family members. Six factors: personal functioning, relationships, information, uncertain outcomes, environment, and emotions, were found to affect these decisions. The six factors identified by family members have specific implications for nursing. 
Birth interval among breast-feeding women not using contraceptives. One hundred twelve Orthodox Jewish mothers were surveyed by means of questionnaire about birth interval in relationship to formula-feeding (n = 30) and breast-feeding (n = 236) experiences in the absence of birth control. Analyses indicate that mothers who breast-fed have longer birth intervals than those who did not. Moreover, data obtained from the same mothers show that birth intervals preceded by breast-feeding were longer than those preceded by formula-feeding of the previous infant. For those mothers who breast-fed, there was significant positive correlation between duration of breast-feeding and the length of lactational amenorrhea and total birth interval. The age at which night feeding was terminated had corresponding but less strong associations with lactational amenorrhea and total birth interval. 
Statistical modeling of prognostic indices for evaluation of critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To identify the most predictive association of variables from the usual indices of severity of illness by statistical objective analysis. DESIGN: Logistic regression analysis of the different variables of the most important indices. SETTING: A general critical care medicine group practice in a university hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 630 critical care patients age 12 to 87 yrs were evaluated. The most important indices of severity of illness and the corresponding variables were recorded and the patient's course was followed for 3 months after ICU admission. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One of our hypotheses was that the inclusion of an excessive number of variables to obtain the most common prognostic indices of mortality in critical care patients results in an underestimation of mortality and a redundancy of prognostic information. We performed a logistic regression analysis using the variables of the currently used indices of critical care prognosis: Acute Physiology Score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score, Acute Physiology Score-II, and Mortality Prediction Model. This mathematical approach resulted in a model of five variables: organ system failure, blood glucose, serum calcium, serum prothrombin activity, and serum osmolality. The score obtained from this model gave accurate prognostic criteria:sensitivity 91.2% and specificity 90%, using a cutoff point of 0.7; sensitivity 86% and, specificity 94%, using a cutoff point of 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that suitable statistical management of the discriminant prognostic variables allows reduction of the number of variables of the severity indices currently used, obtaining five more predictive variables. 
Enhancement of tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 antigen expression in hormone-related ovarian serous borderline tumors. The immunoreactivity of monoclonal antibody (MoAb) B72.3 with ovarian serous tumors of borderline malignancy from 44 women who were pregnant, were on hormone medication containing a progestin, or were known to be in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, was compared with that of similar tumors of 32 patients who were not known to be in any of these three categories. All 76 borderline tumors expressed the tumor-associated glycoprotein (TAG-72) recognized by MoAb B72.3. Striking staining differences (P less than 0.0001) were observed between the hormone-related and the nonhormone-related tumors. Differences were also noticed between the staining of tumors from pregnant patients and that of previous, persistent, or recurrent tumors of the ipsilateral or contralateral ovaries when the same patients were not pregnant. Tumor MoAb B72.3 reactivity increased with progressive gestational age and fell to lower levels at term and during the postpartum period. Although it has been suggested by cell culture studies, enhanced TAG-72 expression in human tumors under hormonal stimulation has not been described before. 
Pilonidal disease: 25 cases treated by the Dufourmentel technique. Twenty-five patients with pilonidal disease were treated by the Dufourmentel technique between 1984 and 1989. In this series, 18 patients (72 percent) were women and 7 (28 percent) were men (mean age, 24 years); hospital stay averaged 4 days. There were no recurrences and no reports of surgical wound infection. Diagnosis was confirmed histologically in all cases. 
Bleeding complications following initiation of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction: a comparison of helicopter-transported and nontransported patients. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of helicopter transport of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients after initiation of thrombolysis on bleeding complications through hospital discharge. DESIGN: Prospectively identified incidence (cohort) study. SETTING: Air medical service of tertiary-care teaching hospital. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-five consecutive AMI patients transported within 12 hours of the initiation of thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator were compared with 119 nontransported AMI patients treated in a similar manner. RESULTS: The transported and nontransported populations were similar with regard to age, sex, and infarct location. Transport was well tolerated with no episodes of cardiac arrest or cardioversion occurring during transport. Hypotension requiring fluids or increased pressors occurred in 18 patients. Bleeding complications of all types occurred in 43.2% of the transported and 49.6% of the nontransported patients, respectively (relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.17). CONCLUSION: Helicopter transport of AMI patients after initiation of thrombolysis appears to be safe acutely and without a clinically significant increase in risk of bleeding complications through hospital discharge when accomplished by a highly skilled team. 
Oral melanoma and other pigmented lesions of the oral cavity. This article presents a review of oral malignant melanoma and other oral cavity pigmented lesions. The dismal prognosis for patients with oral malignant melanoma is partly due to patients' delayed recognition of signs of early disease and delayed diagnosis by physicians. Pigmented macules and plaques in the oral cavity, representing the radial growth phase of tumors, often go unrecognized for months or years before tumor invasion. Therefore, if early detection of thin oral melanomas is to be achieved, all pigmented oral cavity lesions should be viewed with suspicion. Biopsies of such lesions are indicated when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain. Prompt aggressive surgical treatment is essential in reducing the morbidity and mortality from oral melanomas. The differential diagnosis of oral melanomas includes nevi, oral melanotic macules, amalgam tattoos, Kaposi's sarcoma, oral melanoacanthoma, and physiologic pigmentation. 
Social density, stressors, and depression: gender differences among the black elderly. This research examined gender differences with regard to the effects of social density and stressors upon depressive symptomatology among 600 Black elderly community residents (aged 55-85 years) of Nashville, Tennessee. The sample had more females than males and fewer married individuals. Approximately half of the males and females lived alone. Regression analyses show that poor ego and chronic medical problems were the common predictors of depression among both the males and females. Gender differences were found with regard to life events in that females tended to become more depressed as the number of events increased and as level of contact with relatives and friends decreased. Further, females with lower levels of social attachment, guidance, and reliability were more depressed. None of these social support dimensions related to depression among the males. These relationships tended to be stronger for those living alone than for those living with others. 
Maintenance treatment of duodenal ulceration: ranitidine 300 mg at night is better than 150 mg in cigarette smokers. Two hundred patients received either ranitidine 150 mg or 300 mg at night for 18 months to prevent duodenal ulcer relapse. Recurrence rates were lower in patients receiving the higher dose of ranitidine (3.1% v 9.7%, p = 0.78; 6.5% v 16.7%, p = 0.037; and 8.9% v 17.0%, p = 0.121 at six, 12, and 18 months respectively). In patients receiving ranitidine 150 mg, recurrences were significantly more common in smokers than non-smokers after 12 and 18 months, while in patients receiving ranitidine 300 mg recurrence rates were similar in smokers and non-smokers. Ranitidine 300 mg at night abolishes the adverse effect of smoking observed during maintenance treatment with ranitidine 150 mg at night and may therefore be an appropriate maintenance dose for smokers who relapse during standard dose maintenance treatment. 
Impact of dosage schedule on the efficacy of gentamicin, tobramycin, or amikacin in an experimental model of Serratia marcescens endocarditis: in vitro-in vivo correlation. Aminoglycosides are usually considered to be concentration-dependent antibiotics and to have similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. To verify the equivalent activity of the aminoglycosides on a susceptible strain, we tested the killing rate of three aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin) on one strain of Serratia marcescens both in vitro and in vivo by using a rabbit model of left-ventricle endocarditis. Despite, similar MICs, the time-kill curve of gentamicin was consistently better than those of amikacin and tobramycin, whatever the concentration of each antibiotic used (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg/liter), after a 5-h incubation. The in vivo bacterial reduction in the vegetations was measured 24 h after administration of an intravenous 48-mg/kg bolus of each antibiotic or at the end of a 24-h continuous intravenous infusion of the same dose. Gentamicin was significantly more effective when administered as a bolus than when administered as a continuous infusion (2.8 +/- 0.2 versus 6.4 +/- 1.5 log10 CFU/g of vegetation, respectively; P less than 0.01), whereas amikacin was more effective as a continuous infusion than as a bolus injection (3.6 +/- 2.0 versus 7.5 +/- 1.3 log10 CFU/g of vegetation, respectively; P less than 0.01). Tobramycin was not very effective, whatever the dosage tested (approximately 6.5 to 7 log10 CFU/g). These results suggest that concentration-dependent bactericidal activities, both in vitro and in vivo, may vary greatly among aminoglycosides despite similar MICs. 
Morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in family members of patients with malignant and nonmalignant hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver diseases. Three-hundred forty-one HBsAg-positive family members of 152 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (47 asymptomatic carriers, 59 with chronic hepatitis, 17 with cirrhosis and 29 with hepatocellular carcinoma) were prospectively studied to determine the morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the family members of patients with malignant and nonmalignant hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver diseases. Most of the family members had no history of acute hepatitis, were asymptomatic and were unaware of their carrier status. However, 5.3% had stigmata of chronic liver disease, 6% had serum ALT levels that exceeded two times the upper limit of normal and 78% of those who had biopsies had chronic hepatitis with or without cirrhosis. During a follow-up period of 12 to 90 mo (median = 39 mo), 3% had symptoms of chronic liver disease; 24% had transient, recurrent or persistent elevation in serum ALT levels, 1.4% had cirrhosis and 1% had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither hepatocellular carcinoma in the index patient nor a previous history of hepatocellular carcinoma in the family was associated with an increase in the morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the HBsAg-positive family members. 
Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis and surgical management of right atrial myxoma. An asymptomatic patient was discovered to have a large right atrial myxoma by transthoracic echocardiography. Preoperative considerations included the possibility of satellite lesions, left atrial origin, and a question of tricuspid valve involvement. Subsequent operative transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated single-stalk attachment in the right atrial septal wall and no satellite lesions. Doppler and color flow examination immediately following tumor removal aided in the decision not to perform tricuspid annuloplasty as there was no significant tricuspid regurgitation. The combined use of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography with Doppler and color flow imaging aids in the preoperative and intraoperative diagnosis and surgical management of right atrial tumors. 
Age differences in depressive symptom experiences. Age differences in depressive symptom experiences were investigated in a community sample of 368 women between the ages of 51 and 92 who were administered the SCL-90 Depression and Additional Symptoms Scales. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess and compare depressive symptom experiences in a younger (age 51-65) and older (age 66-92) age cohort. Findings show that two somewhat different depressive syndromes underlie symptom reporting patterns, one having higher levels in the older age cohort, the other having higher levels in the younger age cohort. In addition, three more delimited forms of distress -- feelings of enervation, dysphoria, and sleep disturbances -- show higher levels among the older cohort. Implications of these findings for future research on the relation between aging and depression are discussed. 
Experimental treatment of thrombotic vascular occlusion. The role of laser energy in the treatment of thrombotic vascular occlusion was evaluated in two sets of experiments. First, 10 polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were used to replace segments of the superficial femoral arteries in dogs and were thrombosed by distal ligation. Occlusion was maintained for one hour, or for 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in each of two grafts. Patency was restored in all 10 grafts without perforation or anastomotic disruption using a 2 mm hot tip probe powered by an Argon laser. However, increased organization of thrombus related to the duration of occlusion lead to decreased laser channel diameters, and 75% of the 28 day thrombus remained in the graft after recanalization. The second experiments tested the added benefit of thrombolytic infusion following laser recanalization. Bilateral external iliac artery thrombosis was induced in dogs by operative vessel isolation, de-endothelialization, and thrombin injection. At 7 days the efficacy of laser-assisted thrombolysis (LAT) versus enzymatic thrombolysis (ET) alone was compared. Eight vessels underwent ET by urokinase (4000 I.U./min.); 14 vessels were laser recanalized prior to thrombolytic infusion. LAT was performed from a carotid artery approach in 8 vessels (antegrade) and from a femoral artery in 6 vessels (retrograde). In contrast to studies using the hot tip alone, both ET and LAT accomplished complete thrombus removal. However, LAT lead to significant iliac arterial flow in 9 +/- 8 min. (antegrade) and 25 +/- 8 min. (retrograde) while ET required 109 +/- 47 min (p less than 0.01). 
Using anticoagulants safely. Guidelines for therapeutic and prophylactic regimens [published erratum appears in Postgrad Med 1991 Sep 1;90(3):48] Heparin and warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin) are used most often to treat acute and recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, arterial disease, valvular heart disease, and atrial fibrillation. These agents along with dextran, pneumatic compression devices, and gradient stockings are also used to prevent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients at high risk (eg, those with venous stasis, lower limb or spinal cord trauma, clotting abnormalities). Anticoagulation therapy is monitored by maintaining the activated partial thromboplastin time and the prothrombin time in the therapeutic range. 
Trends in preterm survival and incidence of cerebral haemorrhage 1980-9. The annual survival rates and incidence of cerebral haemorrhage in 2618 preterm infants of 34 weeks' gestation or less were examined in one referral centre over a 10 year period from January 1980 to December 1989. Survival was independently related to weight, gestation, sex, and inborn delivery. When these variables had been taken into account, survival was 56% greater at the end of the decade compared with 1980. The incidence of cerebral haemorrhage (diagnosed by cranial ultrasound scanning) was related to birth weight, gestation, sex, inborn delivery, and caesarean section, but there was no significant trend in the incidence with time. Rates of caesarean section in this group increased from 31% in 1980 to over 50% more recently. Haemorrhage affecting the brain parenchyma was related to gestation and inborn delivery, and showed a small but significant decline over time. The lack of association between changes in survival rates and rates of cerebral haemorrhage may indicate that factors associated with both neonatal mortality and the incidence of cerebral haemorrhage may not be causally related as previously assumed. 
Endoscopy as an adjuvant to biliary radiologic intervention. Twenty-two patients underwent 24 percutaneous biliary procedures guided with choledochoscopy, an adjunctive percutaneous biliary technique. All but four procedures were performed through established percutaneous tracts; the others, through tracts less than 4 weeks old. The procedures were done for the following reasons: removal of calculi (n = 15), electrohydraulic lithotripsy (n = 1), biliary duct biopsies (n = 8), cauterization of a bleeding tract (n = 1), and evaluation of biliary-enteric anastomoses (n = 11). The only complication was one case of severe nausea after choledochoscopy. This patient required overnight hospitalization and medical treatment. All procedures were technically successful, except one case in which the tract was undersized. All patients received intravenously administered antibiotics before and after the procedure. It is concluded that choledochoscopy is a safe, atraumatic, and well-tolerated method of evaluating and treating biliary disease and that it markedly reduces radiation exposure. It can be performed rapidly with minimal sedation on an in- or outpatient basis. 
Blood transfusion and laryngeal cancer. Evidence exists to suggest a detrimental effect of blood transfusion on survival after resection for malignant disease. Immune suppression due to transfusion has been implicated, though this remains unproven. We have conducted a retrospective study of 69 patients (38 transfused, 31 not transfused) with squamous carcinoma of the larynx to assess the effect of blood transfusion on survival after laryngectomy. Patients were compared for age, sex, smoking habit, tumour site and stage, grade of operating surgeon, preoperative haemoglobin, tumour nucleolar organizer region status, and operation time. The minimum follow-up was 5 years. In the transfused group 21/38 died as a result of their malignant disease and only 4/31 in the untransfused group. This difference was highly significant (P less than 0.001, chi-squared test) and using a multivariate analysis the only variable associated with a decreased survival time was whether a blood transfusion had been received. We conclude that peri-operative blood transfusion is associated with decreased survival after laryngectomy. However, whether this association is causal remains unproven. 
L-tryptophan supplementation does not affect postoperative pain intensity or consumption of analgesics. Aiming at optimizing serotonin levels in endogenous pain-modulating systems, L-tryptophan supplementation pre- and postoperatively (2 g/day for 7 days) did not affect pain development or analgesic consumption after third molar surgery. Biological effects related to an increase in mood were observed, however, indicating transport of L-tryptophan to the central nervous system. The findings are discussed in relation to earlier reports on favorable effects of L-tryptophan on experimental pain in healthy subjects and in chronic pain patients. 
A chemical score to evaluate the protein quality of commercial parenteral and enteral formulas: emphasis on formulas for patients with liver failure. Essential amino acids, found in abundance in high-quality dietary protein, are required daily by hospitalized patients and healthy persons to maintain the dynamic process of protein metabolism. One method for assessing dietary protein quality is by determining a diet's chemical score, ie, the ratio of a gram of the limiting amino acid in a test diet to the same amount of the corresponding amino acid in a reference diet (eg, whole-egg protein) multiplied by 100. This investigation used the chemical score to evaluate the protein quality of 9 parenteral and 17 enteral diets commonly used to feed hospitalized patients. Standard parenteral and enteral products (ie, formulas that had not been designed for patients with a specific disease state) had chemical scores that ranged from 46% to 70%. Limiting amino acids were either methionine (plus cysteine) or phenylalanine (plus tyrosine). Products designed for patients with renal failure had the highest scores, which ranged from 85% to 145%. Products that were enriched with branched-chain amino acids for trauma patients had scores that ranged from 38% to 73%. The only product available for patients with pulmonary compromise had a score of 50%. The lowest scores, which ranged from 5% to 13%, were found in products for patients with hepatic failure. All products, except those with chemical scores below 13%, may be fed in relatively small amounts of protein (7 to 33 g) to satisfy the minimum daily requirements of essential amino acids, although such levels would not meet minimal daily nitrogen requirements. We recommend that dietitians use the chemical score to assess the protein quality of parenteral and enteral diets. 
Cecal rupture after continent ileocecal urinary diversion during total pelvic exenteration. Continent ureteral diversion at the time of pelvic exenteration avoids an external appliance and allows patients to retain "bladder" reservoir function. The technical difficulty of this procedure requires meticulous attention to operative and perioperative care, particularly after pelvic irradiation. A patient with recurrent stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix underwent total pelvic exenteration with reconstructive procedures including low rectal anastomosis, neovagina formation, and ileocecal (Indiana) continent diversion. Early catheterization of the reservoir began 2 weeks postoperatively. One week later cecal rupture occurred, not related to suture line (technical) failure. Because of the high wall tension and reduced compliance in the irradiated cecum, we do not recommend catheterization of the urinary reservoir before 4-6 weeks. In order for continent diversion to become the standard diversion in exenteration patients, the major complication rate must remain comparable to that of noncontinent diversion. 
Percutaneous transhepatic choledochoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy for common bile duct stones: experience in four high-risk patients. Choledochoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy was applied through a percutaneous transhepatic approach in four high-risk patients with common bile duct stones that were not extractable by duodenoscopic means. All stones were fragmented and removed from three patients, but one patient died from bronchopneumonia before ductal clearance could be achieved. The procedure was well tolerated, without any complication. The major disadvantage is the multiple maneuvers required and the prolonged hospital stay. Percutaneous transhepatic choledochoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy provides a safe and effective alternative for nonoperative treatment of common bile duct stones in high-risk patients when the duodenoscopic approach fails. 
Evaluation of the extracranial carotid arteries: correlation of magnetic resonance angiography, duplex ultrasonography, and conventional angiography. We compared duplex scanning, "bright blood" and "black blood" magnetic resonance angiography, and conventional angiography for evaluation of the extracranial carotid arteries. All three methods were applied to 39 vessels in 20 patients. Duplex scanning was inaccurate when compared to conventional angiography in six instances. In three instances the degree of stenosis was overgraded by the scanner, and in three cases the stenosis was undergraded. Magnetic resonance angiography was inaccurate when compared to conventional angiography in three instances. In all cases magnetic resonance angiography overgraded the degree of stenosis. By use of a greater than 70% stenosis as a positive study, the sensitivity of magnetic resonance angiography was 100% and the specificity 92%. With use of the same criteria, the sensitivity of duplex scanning was 86%, and specificity was 84%. In those evaluations where the results of the magnetic resonance angiography and duplex scanning were in agreement, the correlation with conventional angiography was 100%. We conclude that magnetic resonance angiography is an alternative means to duplex scanning for noninvasive carotid imaging. A combination of bright and black blood magnetic resonance angiography is precise in delineating lesions of the extracranial carotid artery and may ultimately eliminate the need for conventional angiography in the evaluation of carotid stenosis. 
Percutaneous balloon valvotomy for the treatment of isolated tricuspid stenosis. A 46-year-old woman with isolated tricuspid stenosis complained of increasing fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Exercise Doppler echocardiography reproduced her symptoms and revealed a marked increase in trans-tricuspid gradient. Successful percutaneous balloon tricuspid valvotomy was performed, with resolution of her symptoms. 
Urticaria and angioedema: diagnosis and evaluation. Because urticaria clears spontaneously in most patients, an extensive workup is not advised during the early weeks of an urticarial eruption. Whether and when to perform a screening workup or a more extensive workup depend on the degree of suspicion that the patient is ill, the urgency with which the patient presses for an answer, and the presence or absence of signs or symptoms that might lead the physician to pursue a diagnosis other than chronic idiopathic urticaria. Angioedema may occur with urticaria, and when it does, the prognosis is worse. Whereas urticaria manifests as circumscribed edema involving the superficial dermis, angioedema involves primarily the deep dermis or subcutaneous or deeper layers. Individual urticarial lesions usually disappear within 2 to 4 hours, whereas those of angioedema can persist for 72 hours. The workup for patients with chronic angioedema can be similar to that for patients with urticaria. However, several additional diagnostic possibilities should be pursued in patients with angioedema, such as hereditary angioedema caused by C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency, because anabolic steroids are effective in the treatment of these conditions. 
Hemodynamic effects of octreotide in patients with autonomic neuropathy. BACKGROUND. The somatostatin analogue, ectrootide, is being used to treat postprandial hypotension in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Although the therapeutic effect of the drug is presumably secondary to a splanchnic vasoconstrictor action, its effect on splanchnic hemodynamics has never been characterized in patients with autonomic neuropathy. Moreover, it is unknown whether octreotide acts on other vascular beds in this group of patients or whether it affects cardiac output. We, therefore, measured splanchnic, forearm, and systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output before and after administering octreotide (0.4 microgram/kg s.c.) to patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy and diabetic autonomic neuropathy. METHODS AND RESULTS. Splanchnic blood flow was determined from the clearance of indocyanine green in seven patients. We observed that octreotide decreased splanchnic blood flow (from 850 +/- 77 to 664 +/- 48 ml/min, p less than 0.005), increased mean blood pressure (from 97 +/- 6 to 115 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.005), and increased splanchnic vascular resistance (from 0.118 +/- 0.012 to 0.18 +/- 0.018 mm Hg/ml/min, p less than 0.005). Forearm blood flow was measured by plethysmography in 13 patients. Octreotide increased forearm vascular resistance in patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy (n = 8) from 19.1 +/- 1.0 to 27.2 +/- 3.8 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml forearm volume (p less than 0.01) and from 25.2 +/- 3.9 to 41.0 +/- 6.8 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml (p less than 0.01) in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (n = 5). Cardiac output was measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. Octreotide administration increased cardiac output in five of six patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy (from 4.4 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.5 l/min, p less than 0.02) and five of five patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy (from 3.8 +/- 0.4 to 5.1 +/- 0.4 l/min, p less than 0.02). Systemic vascular resistance increased in patients with idiopathic autonomic neuropathy from 21.2 +/- 2 to 24.9 +/- 2.6 (p less than 0.05) but did not change in patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy. CONCLUSION. The pressor effect of octreotide in patients with autonomic neuropathy is associated with increased splanchnic and forearm vascular resistance and with increased cardiac output. 
Persistence of hepatitis B viral DNA after serological recovery from hepatitis B virus infection. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a major medical problem worldwide. Apart from HBsAg carriers, hepatitis B virus has also been identified in some HBsAg-individuals with or without antibodies to viral antigens. The molecular mechanisms underlying hepatitis B virus persistence in HBsAg-individuals are unresolved, however. To identify a possible genetic basis for viral persistence, we cloned the viral genome from the liver of a patient serologically immune to hepatitis B virus infection. DNA sequence analysis of the complete viral genome identified numerous mutations in all viral genes. Analysis of the biological effects of these mutations revealed three major findings: a low level of HBsAg synthesis, absence of HBeAg production and a defect terminating viral replication. These data suggest that mutations accumulating during the natural course of hepatitis B virus infection may be a mechanism underlying viral persistence in HBsAg-individuals, presumably through escape from immune surveillance. 
Complete ophthalmoplegia as a complication of acute corticosteroid- and pancuronium-associated myopathy. We report acute complete external ophthalmoplegia and severe myopathy in a patient treated with high doses of IV methylprednisolone and pancuronium. Awareness of this rare syndrome in a common clinical setting can lead to prompt recognition and avoid confusion with other causes of acute weakness and ophthalmoparesis. 
Feasibility of universal screening mammography. Lessons from a community intervention. It is estimated that 44,500 American women will die of breast cancer in 1991. The breast cancer screening guidelines of the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute calling for annual mammography for all women older than 50 years have been endorsed by numerous professional groups. Third-party reimbursement for screening mammography is becoming more prevalent, and payment for screening mammography is now a Medicare benefit. Our studies, conducted as part of a National Cancer Institute grant to increase the routine use of screening mammography and clinical breast examination in women 50 to 75 years of age, have uncovered a number of significant barriers to the implementation of screening guidelines among women, primary care physicians, and providers of mammography services. These barriers, as well as methods to assure the quality of mammography, need to be addressed before universal screening is feasible. 
The association of laryngoceles with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. The clinical diagnosis of laryngoceles simultaneously occurring with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx is infrequent; however, when specimens from patients with laryngeal cancer have been examined closely, the two entities have been associated in 4.9% to 28.8% of cases. Despite this apparent relationship, the literature has failed to address the potential impact of a concurrent laryngocele on surgical decision making. Also, the wide variation in the reported rates of simultaneous occurrence of these two entities is unexplained. We performed whole-organ histopathologic analysis on a laryngeal specimen with bilateral external laryngoceles associated with squamous cell carcinoma and correlated this to computed tomography findings. Based on this information and other reports concerning the pattern of spread of carcinoma within laryngoceles, it appears that supraglottic laryngectomy is oncologically sound in the presence of a laryngocele as long as the usual criteria for this procedure are met. 
Esophageal motility disorders and chest pain. Motility abnormalities have long been recognized as a possible esophageal cause of chest pain; however, their exact role and prevalence remain largely unknown. Baseline manometry and the various provocative tests may suggest an esophageal origin, but their yield is low. The recent advent of prolonged ambulatory monitoring of intraesophageal pressure and the assessment of psychological factors are contributing to a clearer understanding of this complex problem. 
Absent left main coronary artery: angiographic findings in 83 patients with separate ostia of the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries at the left aortic sinus. Among 20,332 adult patients who underwent consecutive cardiac catheterization and coronary arteriography, 83 (0.4%) were angiographically identified as having an absent left main coronary artery. The angiographic characteristics of this coronary anomaly include: (1) the presence of two well-separated coronary ostia at the left aortic sinus resulting in separate origin of the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries; (2) an increased incidence of left coronary dominance; (3) a higher (6%) than usual (0.5% to 1.5%) incidence of myocardial bridging; (4) lack of a high incidence of congenital heart anomalies; and (5) an incidence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease similar to that of patients whose left main artery is intact. In 39% of the patients difficulties in selectively cannulating the separate ostium of the circumflex artery and adequately opacifying this vessel resulted in a need to change the diagnostic catheter size. Recognition of this coronary anomaly is needed to ensure accurate angiographic interpretation and is important for patients undergoing cardiac surgery to selectively perfuse these separate vessels during cardiopulmonary bypass. 
Popliteal aneurysm with spontaneous arteriovenous fistula. This report documents a rare manifestation of aneurysmal disease of the popliteal artery. We describe a popliteal aneurysm presenting with acute venous hypertension due to a spontaneously occurring arteriovenous fistula. The fistula was defunctionalized by treating the aneurysm with a standard technique of exclusion and bypass with resolution of the symptoms of venous hypertension and maintenance of normal distal perfusion. 
Liver dysfunction associated with long-term total parenteral nutrition in patients with massive bowel resection. Sixteen patients with massive bowel resection receiving long-term home total parenteral nutrition (HTPN) for 31 to 145 months were reviewed for evidence of liver disease. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1 with duodenocolostomy (n = 3), group 2 with an estimated 15-43 cm residual small bowel (n = 7), and group 3 with an estimated 55-120 cm residual small bowel (n = 6). Two patients in group 1 developed liver cirrhosis; one was diabetic and died of sepsis and liver failure at the 88th month on HTPN; the other died of lung cancer at the 46th month on HTPN. The third patient, followed for 33 months, had transient severe liver function abnormalities associated with a blood transfusion. In groups 2 and 3, only one patient (with a history of probable liver disease before HTPN) developed biopsy-proven cirrhosis at the 60th month of HTPN. All four patients with clinically apparent liver disease developed persistent elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) early in HTPN. Four other patients (all in group 3) with abnormal AST values in the early phase of HTPN normalized them later; they did not develop clinical liver disease over a mean follow-up time of 110 months (range, 39-152). None of the remaining eight patients (seven in group 2 and one in group 3) had significant liver function test abnormalities and none developed clinical liver disease over a mean follow-up period of 72 months (range, 39-120). 
Prenatal hepatitis B testing in a midsize southern city. Universal prenatal screening for hepatitis B in low-risk populations remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to characterize the obstetric population of the city/county hospital in a midsize southern city. A total of 2013 patients were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody between June 1988 and February 1990, with 1893 negative for both, 105 (5.2%) positive for surface antibody, and 15 (0.8%) positive for surface antigen. Only 25% of the patients with positive results of hepatitis B screening would have been identified by the 1984 Centers for Disease Control risk group criteria, and no other predictive features were identified. We conclude that universal prenatal screening for hepatitis B is indicated in low-risk populations because of the high prevalence and the lack of predictive features. 
Hypertension sustains plaque progression despite reduction of hypercholesterolemia. To assess the effect of hypertension on diet-induced coronary artery plaques after a return to a nonatherogenic diet, 10 cynomolgus monkeys were fed an induction regimen containing 2% cholesterol and 25% peanut oil for 6 months and then were subjected to midthoracic aortic coarctation to induce hypertension. The animals were then fed a nonatherogenic "prudent" ration for 6 additional months (hypertension-regression group). Twelve additional monkeys were fed the atherogenic diet for 6 months; six were killed (lesion-induction control group) and six were changed to the prudent diet for 6 additional months without coarctation (normotension-regression control group). At the end of the induction period, cholesterol levels averaged 744 +/- 178 mg/dl for the 22 animals and were similar for the three groups throughout the induction period. For the animals restored to the nonatherogenic diet (hypertension-regression and normotension-regression groups), serum cholesterol levels fell to 486 +/- 252 mg/dl at 1 month, to 341 +/- 162 mg/dl at 2 months, and to 234 +/- 78 mg/dl at 6 months. There was no significant difference between the hypertensive and normotensive animals. Six months after coarctation, blood pressure proximal to the coarctations for the hypertension-regression group ranged from 100/60 to 220/145 mm Hg with a mean of 166/103 +/- 36/28 mm Hg. Cross-sectional area of coronary plaques was somewhat lower for the normotension-regression control group compared with the lesion-induction control group, but the difference was not significant. Plaque area was, however, markedly greater in the hypertension-regression group than in either the lesion-induction or the normotension-regression groups (p less than 0.05 for each) despite progressive reduction in hyperlipidemia. 
Public health consequences of acute displacement of Iraqi citizens--March-May 1991. In late March 1991, following military and civil strife in Iraq, approximately 400,000 ethnic Kurds and other Iraqi minority groups sought refuge in rugged mountains on the border of Iraq and Turkey; an additional estimated 1.3 million Iraqi refugees fled to Iran. In contrast to groups affected in other recent refugee emergencies, a large proportion of this displaced population comprised educated urban dwellers. This report describes the major public health consequences of this population displacement and international relief efforts directed toward these problems. 
Serum interleukin-6 levels correlate with disease status in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Interleukin-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with a wide range of effects, including induction of B-cell and cytotoxic T-cell differentiation, and induction of acute phase reactant production by hepatocytes. Interleukin-6 also can act as an autocrine growth factor in malignancy. Various cell types produce interleukin-6, including T and B cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, and some solid tumor cells. In previous work we detected the production of substantial amounts of interleukin-6 by human ovarian cancer cells, including the ovarian cancer cell lines CAOV-3, OVCAR-3, and SKOV-3, and several primary ovarian tumor cultures. In this study we retrospectively examined 90 separate serum specimens for interleukin-6 in 36 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. The mean serum interleukin-6 concentration of those ovarian cancer patients with macroscopic disease (n = 57) was 0.26 +/- 0.04 U/ml (mean +/- SEM). Healthy adult donors have interleukin-6 serum levels of 0.12 +/- 0.03 U/ml. Sixteen of 21 ovarian cancer patients with macroscopic disease (76%) had elevated (greater than 0.20 U/ml) levels of serum interleukin-6, with levels approaching 1 U/ml in some patients (p less than 0.01). Of those nine patients with bulky tumor (residual greater than 2 cm), eight (89%) had an elevated interleukin-6 level (mean, 0.31 +/- 0.05), while eight of 12 (66%) with minimal residual disease (less than 2 cm) had elevated levels. Only two of 15 (13%) patients who were in clinical remission and who had microscopic disease had elevated values. Of the 36 patients, 22 were CA 125 negative (less than 35 U/ml), and of these, four had elevated interleukin-6 levels. Of the 14 patients with an elevated CA 125 level, 12 (86%) had elevated interleukin-6 levels. In those 16 patients in whom serial levels of interleukin-6 were measured, rising levels were found over a 3 to 4 month interval in nine (56%); this correlated with tumor progression. Furthermore, the subsequent survival of patients was shown to correlate with the level of interleukin-6, such that patients whose levels were elevated greater than 0.20 U/ml interleukin-6 survived a mean of 12.5 months, compared with 27.2 months for patients with normal levels (p less than 0.001). These data support the concept that interleukin-6 may be a useful tumor marker in some patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, as it correlates with the tumor burden, clinical disease status, and survival. 
The nature of congenital posterior cervical or cervicothoracic midline cutaneous mass lesions. Report of eight cases. Between 4% and 8% of cases of spina bifida cystica occur in a cervical or cervicothoracic location. Despite a large body of literature concerning spinal dysraphism, there has been little written specifically about patients afflicted with this disorder in a cervical location. Eight children who presented at birth with posterior cervical or cervicothoracic lumps, all of which represented a dysraphic state, are discussed. Two types of abnormalities were noted. Three patients had hydromyelia with an associated myelocystocele herniating posteriorly into a meningocele sac. In these three patients there was an associated Chiari II malformation and hydrocephalus. The other five children had a meningocele in which a band of tissue extended from the posterior aspect of the spinal cord through a defect in the bone and fascia to the posterior part of the meningocele sac itself. No patient had a lesion that could be described as a meningomyelocele. The investigation and surgical management of these conditions are discussed and the need for intradural exploration to untether the spinal cord in the cervical region is stressed. 
MSG and hydrolyzed vegetable protein induced headache: review and case studies. Monosodium glutamate (MSG), an established headache trigger, has become far more prevalent in canned, packaged and prepared foods over the past decade. The presence of MSG in food may be difficult to detect since the terms "natural flavor," "flavoring," or "hydrolyzed vegetable protein (HVP)," all may appear on food labels to refer to MSG, according to current FDA food labeling codes. HVP typically contains 10-30% MSG. Case studies are presented in which the elimination of all food sources of MSG resulted in decreased headache frequency. Information and food lists helpful in identifying dietary MSG and HVP are presented. When patients are put on an MSG-free trial diet, attention needs to be given to identification of the wide variety of foods containing MSG and HVP. 
Identification of false positive exercise tests with use of electrocardiographic criteria: a possible role for atrial repolarization waves Atrial repolarization waves are opposite in direction to P waves, may have a magnitude of 100 to 200 mu V and may extend into the ST segment and T wave. It was postulated that exaggerated atrial repolarization waves during exercise could produce ST segment depression mimicking myocardial ischemia. The P waves, PR segments and ST segments were studied in leads II, III, aVF and V4 to V6 in 69 patients whose exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) suggested ischemia (100 mu V horizontal or 150 mu V upsloping ST depression 80 ms after the J point). All had a normal ECG at rest. The exercise test in 25 patients (52% male, mean age 53 years) was deemed false positive because of normal coronary arteriograms and left ventricular function (5 patients) or normal stress single photon emission computed tomographic thallium or gated blood pool scans (16 patients), or both (4 patients). Forty-four patients with a similar age and gender distribution, anginal chest pain and at least one coronary stenosis greater than or equal to 80% served as a true positive control group. The false positive group was characterized by 1) markedly downsloping PR segments at peak exercise, 2) longer exercise time and more rapid peak exercise heart rate than those of the true positive group, and 3) absence of exercise-induced chest pain. The false positive group also displayed significantly greater absolute P wave amplitudes at peak exercise and greater augmentation of P wave amplitude by exercise in all six ECG leads than were observed in the true positive group. 
Supravalvar aortic stenosis: a 29-year review of surgical experience Between February 1960 and August 1989, 73 consecutive patients underwent surgical correction for supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS) at the Texas Heart Institute. There were 43 male (59%) and 30 female patients (41%) ranging in age from 5 days to 27 years (mean age, 12 years). Preoperatively, 8 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I, 43 in class II, 18 in class III, and 4 in class IV. Of the 73 patients, 62 had localized SVAS and 11 (15%), diffuse SVAS. For all procedures, patients were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass. Those with localized SVAS were successfully treated with patch aortoplasty, whereas those with diffuse SVAS required either an apicoaortic conduit or extensive end-arterectomy with extended patch aortoplasty. There were eight early deaths (less than or equal to 30 days postoperatively) (11%) and four late deaths (greater than 30 days postoperatively) (6%) in a follow-up period ranging from 2 months to 28 years. Sixteen patients (25%) underwent one or more additional operations in the follow-up period. Postoperatively, there were 44 patients in New York Heart Association functional class I and 17 in class II. Preoperative functional class III and class IV (p less than 0.0005), diffuse SVAS (p = 0.05), and the presence of associated congenital defects (p less than 0.01) were important determinants of death. 
An innovative method for neuraxis radiotherapy using partial transmission block technique. Whole CNS (neuraxis) radiotherapy is an important part of therapy for certain CNS tumours which seed via the CSF. Many, if not the majority, of these predominantly young patients are cured but the neuropsychometric, neuroendocrine and growth morbidity of neuraxis radiotherapy on children by conventional methods may be considerable; patients receiving such therapy at an early age often are eventually in the educationally subnormal category. Recent radiobiological data support the concept that all aspects of CNS radiation tolerance are heavily dependent on daily fraction size. We describe a new radiotherapy technique that allows lower daily fraction sizes to be delivered to the neuraxis without prejudicing the total dose to the neuraxis or primary area and without prolonging the overall treatment time. Published radiobiological data support the concept that all the major morbidities attributed to conventional neuraxis radiotherapy will be reduced by the currently described technique without reducing tumour control rates. 
Mechanical obstruction to ventilation from an ovarian cyst during pregnancy. This report documents the danger of the gravid uterus fixing a large ovarian cyst in a position disadvantageous to diaphragmatic excursion and thereby obstructing ventilation. A 34-year-old pregnant patient presented at 18 weeks amenorrhoea with a large ovarian cyst. She gave a history of exertional dyspnoea and orthopnoea. Clinical examination revealed a grossly enlarged abdomen and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths.min-1. Intraoperatively, ventilation was markedly impaired resulting in cyanosis and bradycardia. This was relieved by drainage of the ovarian cyst. A left lateral tilt with manual traction on the tumour may have avoided this problem. Should the above measures be inadequate, immediate drainage of the cyst is essential. Severe respiratory distress may require ultrasound-guided, percutaneous, aspiration of the cyst preoperatively. However, as in this patient, the absence of gross signs of respiratory failure does not preclude acute ventilatory failure after induction of anaesthesia. 
Different lectin-binding patterns in primary breast cancers and their metastases. The expression of glycoconjugates in primary tumors and their metastases in 18 consecutive cases of metastasized breast cancer was studied by use of lectin histochemistry. Paraffin sections were stained with a panel of seven fluorochrome-labeled lectins with defined sugar specificities. The study revealed variation in the lectin binding patterns of individual cancers. In the primary tumors the lectin reactivity was diversified, whereas in their respective metastases it was rather homogeneous. This finding indicates that there is intratumoral heterogeneity in the primary cancers, whereas the selected subclones of malignant cells with restricted glycoconjugate expression seem to give rise to metastases. 
A report of familial carotid body tumors and multiple extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. A case of familial carotid body tumors and multiple extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas is reported. The carotid body tumors, resected previously, were bilateral and associated with 4 intra-abdominal extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. Magnetic resonance imaging was far superior to computerized tomography and 131iodine-metaiodobenzylguanidine in visualizing the intra-abdominal lesions, and may soon become the imaging technique of choice in the evaluation of patients with suspected pheochromocytoma. 
Prevention of alloimmunization in patients with acute leukemia by use of white cell-reduced blood components--a randomized trial. Platelet refractoriness arising from HLA alloimmunization is a serious complication of transfusion therapy. In a prospective randomized trial, white cell (WBC)-reduced blood components were compared to standard platelet and red cell concentrates with respect to alloimmunization, refractoriness, and platelet increments after transfusion. Sixteen of 31 adult acute leukemia patients received only WBC-reduced platelet concentrates (PCs) and red cells (RBCs), with fewer than 10(6) WBCs per unit. Fifteen control patients received standard blood components with a mean of 0.1 x 10(9) (PCs) and 1 x 10(9) (RBCs) WBCs per unit. Platelet loss during cotton-wool filtration averaged 14 percent (range, 3-32%) from fresh PCs and 24 percent (range, 9-62%) from stored PCs. Filtration did not change corrected increments (CI) measured after transfusion of fresh PCs. The Cl 1 hour after filtration of stored PCs diminished by 27 percent, but the difference was smaller after 18 hours, which suggests better survival of WBC-reduced platelets. The number of platelet units transfused did not differ in the two groups. No patient in the WBC-reduced group developed permanent platelet refractoriness; transient HLA antibodies of low titer developed in two patients. In the control group, one patient became refractory because of immunization and two developed transient HLA antibodies. It can be concluded that the reduction of WBCs in blood components can effectively prevent alloimmunization. 
Basophil-bound and serum immunoglobulin E directed against Helicobacter pylori in patients with chronic gastritis. The immunoglobulin (Ig) E immune response in patients with Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis has been evaluated. Of 26 patients with H. pylori infection, 22 (84%) tested positive for basophil-bound specific IgE (determined by the histamine release test) and 18 (69%) for serum specific IgE (determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). In contrast, only 1 of 17 persons in whom the bacterium was not detected presented cell-bound and serum specific IgE. In the 4 histamine release test--positive but enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay--negative patients, removal of antibody from the basophil surface by acid elution showed that histamine release occurred through an IgE-dependent mechanism. When normal basophils, passively sensitized with serum from IgE-positive patients, were exposed to the H. pylori antigen, a significant release was observed, confirming the class specificity of the response. Inhibition experiments with bacteria other than H. pylori showed that the IgE antibody was specifically directed against this organism. The percentage of antigen-induced histamine release did not correlate with serum specific IgE level. However, the response of basophils to antigenic challenge was proportional to IgE-dependent cellular releasability. This finding suggests that target cell sensitivity may be the most important factor in determining the entity of biological response to the antigenic challenge. The ability of H. pylori to induce a specific IgE immune response could answer key questions regarding the mechanisms inducing gastric inflammation. 
Personality traits in the mechanisms of interferential therapy for osteoarthritic knee pain. The role of hypochondriacal, depressive, and hysterical personality traits in response to interferential therapy (IFT) was studied in 50 patients with chronic knee osteoarthrosis. Personality traits were assessed through the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Each patient received ten sessions of IFT during two weeks. Pain relief was assessed subjectively (with a numerical pain-relief scale) at the end of treatment and one week later in a single-blind method. Patients who experienced pain relief of 50% or more were considered responders (n = 22). Those who experienced pain relief of 25% or less were considered nonresponders (n = 24). No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups on any of the personality traits studied. These personality traits apparently have no effect on the response of osteoarthritic knee pain to IFT. 
Human gallbladder morphology after gallstone dissolution with methyl tert-butyl ether. The effects of methyl tert-butyl ether exposure on the human gallbladder in five patients who were treated for gallstones by contact dissolution is described. Two patients underwent cholecystectomy within 1 week of methyl tert-butyl ether treatment, one patient 2 weeks after, another 10 weeks after, and one 12 weeks after. Indications for cholecystectomy were bilirubinate stones (resistant to methyl tert-butyl ether), catheter dislodgement, bile leakage, and gallstone recurrence (2 patients). Gallstones were dissolved completely in three patients, there was approximately 50% stone reduction in one patient, and no dissolution occurred in the fifth patient. Each gallbladder was examined grossly and histologically. Electron microscopic evaluation was performed in one cases. Typical inflammatory findings of chronic cholecystitis were observed in each gallbladder and were most conspicuous in the submucosa; the mucosal and serosal surfaces were intact. Mild acute inflammatory changes were noted in the submucosa in the two patients with the shortest interval between methyl tert-butyl ether administration and cholecystectomy. There were no ulcerations in the mucosa and no unusual wall thickening or fibrosis in any patient. These observations support the safety of methyl tert-butyl ether perfusion in the human gallbladder; the mild acute changes may be a transient and reversible phenomenon. 
Extensive hepatic granulomas associated with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. A case of T-cell lymphoma presenting with marked hepatosplenomegaly and extensive hepatic granulomas is described. A 55-yr-old female experienced long-term liver damage showing histological triaditis with atypical lymphoid cell infiltration and erythrophagocytosis. The patient developed marked hepatosplenomegaly and eventually died of respiratory failure. Neither systemic lymphadenopathy nor hematological disorder was noted until her death. Autopsy revealed small atypical lymphoid cells positive for T-cell marker, as well as extensive infiltration of generalized organs, including the liver, spleen, and lungs. As a result of diffuse proliferation of atypical lymphoid cell admixed with variable reactive cells, mainly at the T-zone, the lymph nodes underwent effacement of normal architecture; however, the peripheral sinuses and the fibrous capsule remained relatively well preserved. These histological features were consistent with a diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL). It is interesting to note that there were numerous epithelioid granulomas admixed with a small number of atypical lymphoid cells within the hepatic parenchyma. The atypical lymphoid cells may be responsible for the granulomatous reaction in the liver. To our knowledge, there have been no other reported cases of PTL that presented with numerous epithelioid granulomas confined to the liver. 
Aggressive malignant hemangiopericytoma in the neck. Hemangiopericytomas are rare vascular tumors, one fourth of which occur in the head and neck. These lesions are characteristically slow growing and slow to metastasize. We describe an otherwise healthy patient with a hemangiopericytoma on the left side of his neck that metastasized to his chest wall within 3 months after the tumor was first observed. The metastasis occurred while the patient was receiving radiation therapy. The patient died soon afterward. This case illustrates the aggressive malignant potential of hemangiopericytomas. 
Immunization response varies with intensity of acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy. Twenty-four children receiving maintenance chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia were given booster doses of tetanus-diphtheria combined toxoids. One month later, 19 of the 24 children were given Haemophilus influenzae B oligosaccharide-cross-reacting material conjugate vaccine. Following immunization, all patients had protective antibody titers against tetanus, 92% had protective antidiphtheria titers, and 84% had protective titers against H influenzae. Preimmunization titers, postimmunization titers, and response to immunization varied according to the intensity of therapy. There was no correlation with duration of therapy or quantitative hematologic values in the peripheral blood. These observations support the recommendation that children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia should be immunized against H influenzae B. 
Anomalous insertion of papillary muscle directly into anterior mitral leaflet in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Significance in producing left ventricular outflow obstruction. BACKGROUND. Obstruction to left ventricular outflow in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is usually due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Occurrence of structural mitral valve abnormalities in HCM and their significance in producing outflow obstruction (even in the absence of typical systolic anterior motion) has not been fully appreciated. METHODS AND RESULTS. Analysis of 78 mitral valves excised from patients with obstructive HCM showed that 10 (13%) had anomalous insertion of one or both left ventricular papillary muscles directly into the anterior mitral leaflet. This malformation was identified by echocardiography, which demonstrated direct continuity between the hypertrophied papillary muscle and mitral leaflet, resulting in a long rigid area of midcavity narrowing that appeared to be solely or largely responsible for outflow obstruction. Basal subaortic pressure gradients were large (70-150 mm Hg). Mitral valve replacement reduced the outflow gradient substantially to 0-15 mm Hg in four patients with postoperative cardiac catheterization. However, two other patients who underwent septal myotomy/myectomy had persistent symptoms and incomplete relief of obstruction (gradients 60 and 70 mm Hg) because of continued midcavity apposition of papillary muscle and ventricular septum. CONCLUSIONS. Anomalous papillary muscle insertion into anterior mitral leaflet represents a mechanism of obstruction to left ventricular outflow in patients with HCM and differs considerably from typical dynamic obstruction caused by mitral valve systolic anterior motion that occurs in many other patients with HCM. Recognition of this malformation emphasizes the diverse morphological expression of HCM and also has important clinical implications for patients requiring operation because the gradient is likely to persist even after adequate myotomy/myectomy; consequently, mitral valve replacement would appear to be the operation of choice in most such patients. 
Coronary stenting with a new, radiopaque, balloon-expandable endoprosthesis in pigs. BACKGROUND. Intracoronary stents may be effective when used as "bail-out" devices for acute complications after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Furthermore, preliminary reports have demonstrated some promising results with stents with regard to the reduction of restenosis. Several stent devices are available for preclinical and clinical evaluation. The use of these stainless-steel stents has been limited by poor visibility during fluoroscopy and thrombogenicity during the first days to weeks after implantation. We therefore investigated the immediate and short-term effects on arterial patency of a new, radiopaque, balloon-expandable coil stent in normal coronary arteries of pigs. METHODS AND RESULTS. In 10 animals, a stent was placed in two of the three epicardial coronary arteries. During the implantation procedure, the animals received heparin; after the procedure, no antithrombotic drugs were administered. After 1 week (five animals and 10 stents) or 4 weeks (five animals and 10 stents), repeat angiography was performed, followed by pressure-fixation of the coronary arteries for light and electron microscopic examination. Angiographic analysis revealed that all stented coronary segments were patent and without signs of intraluminal defects. Scanning electron microscopy showed complete endothelial covering of all stents within 7 days. Light microscopy showed a reduced tunica media locally under the stent wires, which resulted from exerted pressure. The neointima on top of the stent wires measured 56 microns (range, 42-88 microns) after 1 week and 139 microns (range, 84-250 microns) after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS. Results from this study show that this radiopaque endoprosthesis can be safely placed in normal coronary arteries of pigs. After 4 weeks, all stents were patent and there was no need for additional antithrombotic treatment, whereas neointimal proliferation was limited. 
Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver: assessment with contrast-enhanced TurboFLASH MR imaging. Twenty-two patients with 25 cases of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) proved with pathologic study were imaged with a TurboFLASH (fast low angle shot) sequence combined with bolus administration of gadolinium tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid (DOTA), spin-echo (SE) T2-weighted sequences, and postcontrast T1-weighted sequences. FNH-liver signal-difference-to-noise ratios were quantified; the features of the central scar were qualitatively analyzed. On SE T2-weighted images, all FNHs were hyperintense; in two cases the central scar exhibited a high signal intensity associated with hypointense areas corresponding to fibrous tissue within the branches of the scar. Unenhanced TurboFLASH images always demonstrated the FNHs as hypointense and always depicted the central scar as a hypointense area within the lesion. After bolus injection, arterial enhancement of FNH was clearly seen, and in 10 of 25 lesions, enhancement within the scar was seen 40-80 seconds after injection. Both unenhanced and enhanced TurboFLASH sequences produced the best signal-difference-to-noise ratios in comparison with T2-weighted images. 
Solitary extradural cavernous hemangiomas in the spinal canal. Report of five cases. Five cases of solitary extrathecal cavernous hemangioma in the spinal canal are reported. In one case, two coexistent massive cerebral venous medullary malformations were found. The symptomatology and prognosis of extrathecal spinal cavernous hemangiomas are discussed, as is the significance of various diagnostic measures. The patient material further permitted a rough calculation of the incidence of symptomatic extrathecal cavernous hemangiomas in the spinal canal. 
Adverse psychologic consequences of positive cytologic cervical screening. Cervical cancer is still widely prevalent in the female population. This study explores the relationship of cervical cancer screening, positive versus negative Papanicolaou's test results, and psychologic status among lower-income minority women. All patients were interviewed 3 months after they had received initial test results. One hundred six women with normal Papanicolaou's test results were compared with 118 women who were referred for colposcopic examination for follow-up of positive test results. Women with positive Papanicolaou's-test results showed statistically significant elevations in worries about cancer and impairments in mood, daily activities, sexual interest, and sleep patterns. More fine-grained analyses revealed that the effects of positive results were most pronounced among those women who did not comply with colposcopy (n = 53). These findings suggest that lack of compliance with follow-up may maintain high levels of uncertainty about disease and may interfere with successful psychologic adaptation. Health education targeted to psychologically vulnerable individuals may reduce psychologic distress and enhance compliance. 
Hypothyroidism resulting from generic levothyroxine failure. In today's cost-conscious health care system, generic preparations should be prescribed whenever possible provided that safety and efficacy are not compromised. Several reports, however, suggest that generic levothyroxine may not always be interchangeable with the proprietary preparations. Such interchangeability is critical because patients are likely to receive different brands of levothyroxine during the life of their treatment. We report a case of severe hypothyroidism that developed in a patient who had been well controlled before receiving a generic levothyroxine preparation. Analysis of the patient's tablet by high-pressure liquid chromatography showed that the levothyroxine content was approximately 30 percent less than its labeled content and outside current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements. It is likely that poor tablet bioavailability was a contributory factor. Euthyroidism was achieved with the same dose of a more potent and possibly more bioavailable brand-name product. Until levothyroxine products become more uniform and the FDA confers therapeutic equivalence, product substitution with expense as the principal consideration should be avoided. 
Risk factors for pancreatic cellular injury after cardiopulmonary bypass BACKGROUND. Pancreatitis is a known complication of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Although ischemia is believed to be a factor, the cause of pancreatitis after cardiopulmonary bypass remains unknown. METHODS. We prospectively studied 300 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Serum amylase, pancreatic isoamylase, and serum lipase were measured on postoperative days 1,2,3,7, and 10. Pancreatic cellular injury was defined as the presence of hyperamylasemia (greater than 123 U per liter) with an increase in either the serum level of lipase (greater than 24 U per liter) or the peak level of pancreatic isoamylase. Trypsinogen-activation peptides, which indicate intrapancreatic enzyme activation, were measured in the urine of the last 101 patients studied. RESULTS. Evidence of pancreatic cellular injury was detected in 80 patients (27 percent), of whom 23 had associated abdominal signs or symptoms and 3 had severe pancreatitis (2 with pancreatic abscess and 1 with necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis). Two of 19 postoperative deaths were secondary to pancreatitis. In multivariate analyses, the development of pancreatic cellular injury was significantly associated with preoperative renal insufficiency, valve surgery, postoperative hypotension, and perioperative administration of calcium chloride. The administration of more than 800 mg of calcium chloride per square meter of body-surface area was an independent predictor of pancreatic cellular injury, and the increase in risk was dose-related. No differences were found in the level of trypsinogen-activation peptides between patients who had pancreatic cellular injury and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS. Pancreatic cellular injury, as indicated by hyperamylasemia of pancreatic origin, is common after cardiac surgery. The administration of large doses of calcium chloride is an independent predictor of pancreatic cellular injury and may be a cause of it. 
The golden hours of the myocardial infarction: nonthrombolytic interventions. Emergency care of patients with acute myocardial infarction requires active decision making to use agents that may improve morbidity and mortality. Thrombolysis remains the primary tool to accomplish this goal. Other pharmacologic agents, including lidocaine, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and aspirin, have been used acutely in myocardial infarction in the hopes of preventing death and salvaging myocardium. The decision to select one or all of these agents requires a knowledge of the clinical evidence of their efficacy and risk-to-benefit ratios. The clinical studies of the use of these agents acutely in the management of myocardial infarction are reviewed. 
Lower limb problems in diabetic patients. What are the causes? What are the remedies? Peripheral neuropathy, infection, and peripheral vascular disease can produce serious problems in diabetic patients, particularly in the lower limbs. Ulceration of the foot may progress to gangrene and ultimately necessitate amputation. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy causes sensory loss. Such loss in patients with peripheral vascular disease creates a high risk for foot ulcers, which are vulnerable to infection. Treatment includes relief of neuropathic pain and antibiotic therapy for infection. Pentoxifylline (Trental) improves microvascular flow and appears to be effective against peripheral vascular disease. Aldose reductase inhibitors are being investigated as therapy for diabetic neuropathy. Prevention is the mainstay of management in these patients. Patient education is essential to help maintain health and prevent the potential adverse effects of diabetes. 
Assessment of 21-[18F]fluoro-16 alpha-ethyl-19-norprogesterone as a positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical for the detection of progestin receptors in human breast carcinomas. We have used 21-[18F]fluoro-16 alpha-ethyl-19-norprogesterone (FENP) for imaging progestin receptors by PET in patients with primary carcinoma of the breast. In vitro binding and in vivo tissue distribution studies in rats have shown that FENP has high specific activity, high affinity for progestin receptors, and receptor-mediated uptake in target tissues. Eight patients with primary breast carcinoma were studied. Breast carcinoma was identified correctly in 50% of the patients with progestin-receptor-positive tumors; however, the FENP uptake was not correlated with progestin-receptor levels. We noted a low target-to-background ratio in humans, with high relative activity in the spine, blood pool, and normal breast tissue. Our findings indicate that FENP is not a suitable agent for imaging progestin receptors in humans. 
Comparison of intravenous urokinase plus heparin versus heparin alone in acute myocardial infarction. Urochinasi per via Sistemica nell'Infarto Miocardico (USIM) Collaborative Group. In a randomized trial of the effects on in-hospital mortality of intravenous urokinase plus heparin versus heparin alone, 2,531 patients with acute myocardial infarction in 89 coronary care units were enrolled for greater than 30 months. Patients admitted within 4 hours of the onset of pain were randomized to receive either intravenous urokinase (a bolus dose of 1 million U repeated after 60 minutes) plus heparin (a bolus dose of 10,000 U followed by 1,000 IU/hour for 48 hours) or heparin alone (infused at the same rate). Complete data were obtained in 2,201 patients (1,128 taking urokinase and 1,073 taking heparin). At 16 days, overall hospital mortality was 8% in the urokinase and 8.3% in the heparin group (p = not significant). Among patients with anterior infarction, mortality was 10.3% in the urokinase and 13.9% in the heparin group (p = 0.09; relative risk = 0.73). The incidence of major bleeding (urokinase 0.44%, heparin 0.37%) as well as the overall incidence of stroke (urokinase 0.35%, heparin 0.20%) was similar in the 2 groups. The rates of major in-hospital cardiac complications (reinfarction, postinfarction angina) were also similar. 
A case report of malignant pleural mesothelioma with long-term disease control after chemotherapy. Long duration of responses to chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is rare. The authors report a patient with inoperable MPM who achieved complete remission with combination chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin. 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C (FM) induced another remission after recurrence of the tumor. Retreatment with FM after chemotherapy had been stopped for 20 months yielded another continuing response. The overall tumor-control time is more than 4 years. Literature reviews and the authors' results suggest that MPM may be a chemosensitive tumor in some patients. Additional evaluations of CAP, FM, and methotrexate combination regimens in this disease should be considered. 
Tonic pain perception in the mouse: differential modulation by three receptor-selective opioid agonists. The proposition that tonic nociception models are more analogous to clinical pain than traditional acute models prompted our previous development of a modified mouse paw formalin test. To discern possible modulatory roles and site(s) of action of endogenous opioid systems, the receptor-preferring agonists sufentanil (mu), U-50,488H (kappa) and [D-Pen2,5]enkephalin (DPDPE, delta) were evaluated for antinociceptive activity in the formalin paradigm by systemic (except DPDPE), spinal and supraspinal routes. All observations were done under blind conditions. Doses causing overt behaviors that indicated a breach of receptor specificity (during the observation period) were rejected. Higher doses of centrally administered DPDPE (greater than 0.3 micrograms/mouse, intrathecal; greater than 3 micrograms/mouse, intracerebroventricular) induced a behavioral syndrome traditionally associated with mu agonism, and thus were not considered for this study. A50 values from behaviorally acceptable dose ranges for mean percent analgesia (reduction of paw licking compared to controls) were: trans-(+/- )-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[U-50,488H 2-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate,U-50,488H--3200 nmol/kg, subcutaneous, 1100 nmol/kg, intrathecal and 314 nmol/kg, intracerebroventricular; sufentanil--11.1 nmol/kg, subcutaneous, 8.6 nmol/kg, intrathecal; and DPDPE--inactive. On the basis of our dose-response data, we suggest that, in mice, kappa and mu, but not delta, opioid receptors modulate tonic pain perception at both spinal and supraspinal loci. The results also support inclusion of the modified formalin test in preclinical evaluations of potential kappa agonists. 
Myocardial infarct size reduction by the synergistic effect of hyperbaric oxygen and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Fasting mongrel dogs underwent hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT), recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment, and simultaneous HBOT and rt-PA treatment following prior experimental left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 2 hours. Thrombosis in and around a copper coil was recorded angiographically at regular intervals, and immediately prior to treatment conclusion. Controls (n = 10) were untreated. Group two animals (n = 10) were treated additionally with 90 minutes of HBOT at 2 atm absolute. Group three animals (n = 8) were treated additionally with 50 mg rt-PA over 90 minutes. Group four animals (n = 10) were treated additionally with simultaneous HBOT and rt-PA over 90 minutes. Myocardial injury was determined by a combination of triphenyltetrazolium chloride histochemical staining and by formazan dye extraction. Damage was measured as a percent of left ventricular cross-sectional area studied. HBOT alone restored 35.9% of oxidative enzyme activity (p greater than 0.001). Treatment with rt-PA alone restored 48.9% of enzyme activity (p greater than 0.001). The combination of HBOT and simultaneous rt-PA resulted in 96.9% restoration of oxidative enzyme activity versus the control group (p greater than 0.001). 
Sequence variations in the 5' flanking and IVS-II regions of the G gamma- and A gamma-globin genes of beta S chromosomes with five different haplotypes. We have amplified and sequenced the 5' flanking and the second intervening sequence (IVS-II) regions of both the G gamma- and A gamma-globin genes of the beta S chromosomes from sickle cell anemia (SS) patients with homozygosities for five different haplotypes. The sequencing data, compared with previously published sequences for the normal chromosomes A and B, show many similarities to chromosome B for haplotypes 19, 20, and 17, while haplotypes 3 and 31 are remarkably similar to chromosome A and also similar to each other. Several unique mutations were found in the 5' flanking regions (G gamma and A gamma) of haplotypes 19 and 20 and in the IVS-II segments of the same genes of haplotypes 19, 20, and 17; the IVS-II of haplotypes 3 and 31 were identical to those of chromosome A. Dot-blot analyses of amplified DNA from additional SS patients with specific probes have confirmed that these mutations are unique for each haplotype. The two general patterns that have been observed among the five haplotypes have most probably arisen by gene conversion events between the A and B type chromosomes in the African population. These patterns correlate with high and low fetal hemoglobin expression, and it is speculated that these and other yet unknown gene conversions may contribute to the variations in hemoglobin F and G gamma levels observed among SS patients. In vitro expression experiments involving the approximately 1.3-kb 5' flanking regions of the G gamma- and A gamma-globin genes of the beta S chromosomes with the five different haplotypes failed to detect differences between the levels of expression, suggesting that the sequence variations observed between these segments of DNA are not the primary cause of the differences in hemoglobin F levels among the SS patients. 
Left ventricular regional wall motion assessment by radionuclide ventriculography: a comparison of cine display with Fourier imaging Radionuclide ventriculography and contrast ventriculography were performed in two comparable projections on 50 patients with suspected coronary artery disease. The efficacy of conventional cine display and Fourier image analysis of the radionuclide ventriculogram was compared using contrast ventriculography as the gold standard. Of seven different combinations of Fourier images, the combination of left anterior oblique amplitude and phase and left posterior oblique amplitude and phase provided the highest sensitivity (87%), specificity (83%), accuracy (86%), and kappa coefficient (0.64). To increase statistical power, segment data were collapsed to global data in which a heart was considered normal if all segments were normal and abnormal if one or more segments were abnormal. Fourier images had higher sensitivity (Fourier 87%, cine 47%); lower specificity (Fourier 83%, cine 92%), higher accuracy (Fourier 86%, cine 58%), and higher kappa coefficient (Fourier 0.64, cine 0.25), and these differences were statistically significant (p less than 0.01). 
Variable histotoxicity of histoacryl when used in a subcutaneous site: an experimental study. Histoacryl (butyl-2-cyanoacrylate) is one of the least histotoxic cyanoacrylate derivatives and is used as a tissue adhesive. Clinical applications primarily include skin closure (blepharoplasty incisions, etc.). In a recent study, we demonstrated that Histoacryl elicits minimal histotoxicity when used to glue bone grafts to rabbit-ear cartilage. Acute inflammation was limited to areas where Histoacryl escaped from between the bone graft and ear cartilage to contact well-vascularized soft tissue. In this study, Histoacryl was applied between bone graft and cartilage in one rabbit ear and adjacent to well-vascularized soft tissue with no graft in the opposite ear. Histologic analysis revealed minimal if any inflammation when small amounts of glue was used in the nonvascular region between bone graft and cartilage. However, subcutaneous implantation contacting well-vascularized soft tissue resulted in increased acute inflammation and prolonged foreign-body giant-cell response. Further studies are required to rule out any long-term problems associated with subcutaneous implantation of Histoacryl. 
Stroke and hypertension and its prevention. Systolic and diastolic hypertension in both men and women is a well-established risk factor for the development of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Antihypertensive treatment decreases the risk, but questions remain as to the precise level of hypertension to be treated, whether the effects of antihypertensive treatment are blunted with increasing age, and the best type of antihypertensive drug or combination of drugs to be used. Further questions remain concerning the incidence of pseudohypertension and the potentially harmful effects of its treatment on the brain, and the possibility that fluctuations in blood pressure may be worse than elevation alone. A pragmatic approach would be to treat hypertension with vigor in the young, with caution in the mature, and with reluctance in the old. 
Management options in fulminant hepatic failure. The diagnosis of FHF carries with it a high mortality rate. Though the early results of OLT for FHF are encouraging, some have called for caution as these results are in a select population and may be similar to the optimistic early reports of now-discredited therapies. However, OLT differs fundamentally from all other interventions and, as such, it is ethically unjustified to withhold potentially life-saving therapy from patients with a predicted mortality in excess of 60%. Therefore, patients with FHF should be transferred at an early stage to an experienced liver unit where the option of liver transplantation can be considered. 
Predictors of relapse into major depressive disorder in a nonclinical population. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to describe, the natural history of major depressive disorder in a large group of nonclinical subjects. In particular, the analysis determined demographic and clinical risk factors for the recurrence of major depressive disorder. METHOD: Relatives, comparison subjects (matched to relatives for age and sex), and spouses of affectively ill probands underwent structured clinical assessments before and after a 6-year interval. RESULTS: Of 396 individuals who had had only major depressive disorder that ended before the initial evaluation, 33.8% (N = 134) developed a new episode during the 6-year follow-up period. Youth, but not sex, was an important demographic risk factor. The presence of minor depression at the time of initial evaluation and the number of symptoms recalled from the worst previous episode were additional clinical risk factors. At the initial evaluation, 200 other subjects had described a previous history of both major depressive disorder and a nonaffective mental disorder. When compared to the subjects who recalled only a history of major depressive disorder, these subjects were more likely to have been in an episode of chronic intermittent depression at the initial evaluation and to recall a greater number of episodes as well as a greater number of symptoms in the worst episode. A history of a nonaffective mental disorder significantly increased the risk of relapse into major depressive disorder. CONCLUSIONS: These findings agree well with a recent review of clinically based follow-up studies. Thus, youth and a history of nonaffective illness are important risk factors for the recurrence of major affective disorder in a broad variety of settings. 
Postoperative epidural morphine is safe on surgical wards. The use of epidural morphine for postoperative analgesia outside of intensive care units remains controversial. In this report our anesthesiology-based acute pain service documents experience with 1,106 consecutive postoperative patients treated with epidural morphine on regular surgical wards. This experience involved 4,343 total patient days of care and 11,089 individual epidural morphine injections. On a 0-10 verbal analog scale, patient-reported median pain scores at rest and with coughing or ambulation were 1 (inter-quartile range 3) and 4 (interquartile range 4), respectively. The incidence of side effects requiring medication were as follows: pruritus 24%, nausea 29%, and respiratory depression 0.2%. There were no deaths, neurologic injuries, or infections associated with the technique. Migration of epidural catheters into the subarachnoid space and into epidural veins each occurred twice. Overall, 1,051 of the 1,106 patients (95%) experienced none of the following problems: catheter obstruction, premature dislodgement, painful injections, catheter migration, infection, or respiratory depression. We conclude that postoperative pain can be safely and effectively treated with epidural morphine on surgical wards. 
Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor after autologous bone marrow transplantation for lymphoid cancer. BACKGROUND. The period of neutropenia after autologous bone marrow transplantation results in substantial morbidity and mortality. The results of previous phase I-II clinical trials suggest that recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) may accelerate neutrophil recovery and thereby reduce complications in patients after autologous bone marrow transplantation. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at three institutions. The study design and treatment schedules were identical, and the results were pooled for analysis. One hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled. Sixty-five patients received rhGM-CSF in a two-hour intravenous infusion daily for 21 days, starting within four hours of the marrow infusion, and 63 patients received placebo. RESULTS. No toxic effects specifically ascribed to rhGM-CSF were observed. The patients given rhGM-CSF had a recovery of the neutrophil count to 500 x 10(6) per liter 7 days earlier than the patients who received placebo (19 vs. 26 days, P less than 0.001), had fewer infections, required 3 fewer days of antibiotic administration (24 vs. 27 days, P = 0.009), and required 6 fewer days of initial hospitalization (median, 27 vs. 33 days; P = 0.01). There was no difference in the survival rate at day 100. CONCLUSIONS. In patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation for lymphoid neoplasia, rhGM-CSF significantly lessens morbidity. Further studies will be required to establish its optimal dosage and schedule of administration. 
Frequency of deep venous thrombosis in asymptomatic patients with coronary artery bypass grafts. The frequency of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery has not been established. Therefore to estimate the frequency of clinically silent DVT, we performed ultrasound examinations of the leg veins in 29 asymptomatic CABG patients before hospital discharge. We used high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography with color Doppler imaging. Fourteen (48.3%, 95% confidence interval 30.1 to 66.4%) had 20 documented leg vein thromboses, and all but one patient had DVT limited to the calf veins. Of the 20 thrombi 10 (50.0%) were present in the leg ipsilateral and 10 (50.0%) in the leg contralateral to the saphenous vein harvest site. None of the DVTs were suspected clinically. DVT was not associated with any local sign attributed to saphenous vein harvest such as pitting edema, incisional drainage, or local tenderness or with any putative risk factor for DVT such as cigarette use, distant history of malignancy, or varicose veins. Follow-up of these patients 5 to 11 months after CABG surgery showed no clinical evidence of DVT or pulmonary embolism. Our findings indicate that asymptomatic DVT of the calf occurs with surprisingly high frequency, 44.8% after CABG surgery. Future studies in patients undergoing CABG surgery should address the natural history of asymptomatic DVT, determine its clinical importance, and develop optimal strategies for prophylaxis and treatment. 
Expansion of immature thymic precursor cells in peripheral blood after acute marrow suppression. Leukemoid reactions occur in response to a number of infectious agents and sometimes may be associated with bone marrow suppression. After acute suppression of the bone marrow, a resurgent hyperplasia occurs that may appear as synchronous maturation of a single cell type. The authors describe the case of a 13-year-old child in whom a remarkable lymphocytosis developed during a period of pancytopenia associated with a febrile syndrome resembling Ehrlichiosis. Most of these lymphoid cells were morphologically similar to large granular lymphocytes (LGLs), but many appeared to be less mature. Immunophenotypic studies demonstrated most of these lymphoid cells to be immature T cells at an "intermediate" or "transitional" stage of thymocyte differentiation characterized by the CD1-CD3+CD4-CD8- phenotype, as well as positivity for nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. In T-cell ontogeny, this stage represents a transition between thymic precursors and mature thymocytes. Their presence in the peripheral blood of this child is thought to represent a lymphocytic leukemoid response to his infection. Cases such as this may be confused with malignancy. 
Preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Severe upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious adverse effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the elderly are at increased risk of developing this complication. Bleeding episodes can be prevented. Replacing NSAIDs with acetaminophen may be appropriate when a simple analgesic is needed that eliminates the risk of GI bleeding. Using the lowest effective NSAID dose may decrease the incidence and severity of NSAID gastropathy. Histamine H2-receptor antagonists, sucralfate, and misoprostol have been studied for the prevention of NSAID gastropathy, but only misoprostol prevents mucosal injury in both the stomach and duodenum. Patients who have a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastric bleeding from NSAIDs are candidates for prophylactic measures. Although other patients are at risk, no one knows who should receive prophylactic therapy for NSAID gastropathy. Future studies should attempt to define patient populations that warrant prophylactic therapy. 
An analysis of ten-year trends in infections in adults on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Infectious complications are the Achilles heel of CAPD. To determine trends in these events, we analyzed the CAPD related infections of 303 adults on CAPD at a single university center between 1979 and 1989. During this decade the percentage of insulin-dependent diabetics increased from 14% to 39% (p less than 0.005). Peritonitis rates fell from 2.4 episodes/y in 1979 to 0.8 episodes/y in 1989. The proportion of patients with multiple episodes of peritonitis decreased (40% of the patients in 1979-1982 vs 15% in 1983-1989, p = 0.0001) while the proportion of patients with no episodes of peritonitis increased during the same periods (29% vs 49%, p = 0.005). The proportion of peritonitis episodes due to S. aureus rose over the 10-year period (p = 0.005), while those due to S. epidermidis decreased (p less than 0.10). The overall incidence of S. aureus peritonitis remained unchanged. Catheter infection rates initially increased and then fell during the decade; S. aureus remained the predominant cause. The proportion of peritonitis episodes associated with catheter infection rose (13% in 1982 vs 24% in 1989, p = 0.025), and in 1989, 80% of these episodes were caused by S. aureus. Catheter loss was also primarily due to S. aureus infections in 1989 (80%). Infections due to P. aeruginosa were a persistent problem. The proportion of patients transferring to hemodialysis each year paralleled catheter loss rates, which in turn appeared to be more related to catheter infection rates than to peritonitis rates. We conclude that control of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa will be the key to future reductions in the infectious complications of CAPD patients. 
The silence: the asbestos industry and early occupational cancer research--a case study. To gain insight into corporate activities regarding the identification of occupational carcinogens earlier in this century, the actions of one industry, the asbestos industry, were reviewed. This industry, in concert with many of its insurers, systematically developed and then suppressed information on the carcinogenicity of asbestos. The development of warnings for those exposed to the asbestos was delayed. As a result, millions of workers were exposed to the carcinogen and hundreds of thousands died. These events are placed into the context of similar activities in other industries during this time. 
Coronary artery bypass grafting in the octogenarian. We have performed coronary bypass grafting in 25 patients 80 years of age or more. The patients' preoperative conditions were characterized by recent myocardial infarction (16/25, or 64%), obesity (15/25, or 60%), hypertension (14/25, or 56%), and left ventricular dysfunction (21/25, or 84%). There were no deaths in the hospital or within 30 days of operation (0/25, or 0%). Postoperative complications occurred in five cases (20%). Complications were leg incision infection (2/25, or 8%), urinary tract infection (1/25, or 4%), stroke (1/25, or 4%), and transient neurologic deficit (1/25, or 4%). There were no instances of reoperation for bleeding, perioperative myocardial infarction, renal failure, pulmonary failure, intraaortic balloon pump use, or sternotomy infection in these patients. Eleven patients (44%) were hospitalized for fewer than 10 days after operation, and all but two (23/25, or 92%) were discharged within 20 days after operation. All patients were followed up, and survival and New York Heart Association functional class were determined. Cumulative survival rate was 94% at 1 year and 88% at 5 years. The cumulative percent survival rate with class I or II function was 92% at 1 year and 80% at 5 years. No patient had recurrent angina. 
Myocardial oedema and ventricular function after cardioplegia with added mannitol. Myocardial oedema may contribute to the impaired myocardial performance which commonly follows open heart surgery with cardioplegia-induced cardiac arrest. The rate of oedema formation during crystalloid cardioplegia and the relation of this to changes in ventricular compliance and ventricular function following reperfusion were studied using an isolated rabbit heart preparation. Myocardial tissue water content increased during cardioplegic arrest and the water content prior to reperfusion demonstrated an inverse correlation with ventricular function after reperfusion. In further studies the effect of adding mannitol to a standard crystalloid cardioplegic solution was investigated. The preparations were divided into two groups: nine were administered a standard cardioplegic solution (Plegisol*) (control group) and a further eight were administered the same solution mixed with mannitol to adjust the osmotic pressure to 360 mOsmol.L-3 (mannitol group). The mannitol group demonstrated less increase in RV water content and superior LV dP/dtmax following reperfusion. It is concluded that mannitol enhances protection of the myocardium during cardioplegic cardiac arrest. 
Sternohyoid muscle biopsy. A diagnostic technique in respiratory failure of neuromuscular origin. Patients with neuromuscular disease may develop respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. We describe a sternohyoid muscle biopsy technique as a diagnostic aid in such patients undergoing tracheostomy for prolonged ventilatory support. The biopsy procedure is quick and without added discomfort or morbidity for the patient. Our preliminary observations in three patients suggest that the sternohyoid muscle biopsy may be a useful diagnostic tool in this selected group of patients. 
Mechanical complications associated with mentor inflatable penile prosthesis. The Mentor inflatable penile prosthesis was developed in an attempt to decrease the mechanical failure rate of the various prostheses' components. We herein report on the reliability of the device in 46 men implanted with the Mentor device from December 1982 to June 1987. Prior to manufacturer device modification in 1985, mechanical failure mainly attributable to input tubing cracks occurred in 10 of 30 implantations. Since device improvement in April 1985, the mechanical failure rate has decreased to 4 percent. The Mentor inflatable penile prosthesis has been a mechanically reliable device since design improvement in 1985. 
Pituitary hormone response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone in secondary amenorrheic women associated with simple weight loss. OBJECTIVE: To investigate endocrine dysfunction in simple weight loss amenorrhea. DESIGN: We studied pituitary hormone responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in 10 women with simple weight loss amenorrhea. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital, University of Tokushima at Tokushima, Japan. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Secondary amenorrheic women associated with simple weight loss who did not have anorexia nervosa. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous injection of 500 micrograms of synthetic TRH. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyrotropin, and prolactin were measured before and 15, 30, and 60 minutes after TRH injection. RESULTS: In normally menstruating women on day 7 of the cycle TRH did not affect serum LH and FSH levels. In women with simple weight loss amenorrhea, however, TRH raised serum LH and FSH levels significantly (P less than 0.01, respectively). Prolactin response to TRH was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower in women with simple weight loss amenorrhea than in normally menstruating women. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that TRH causes a significant rise in serum LH and FSH and the impaired prolactin response in women with simple weight loss amenorrhea. 
Risk factors in relation to postoperative complications and mortality after total gastrectomy in aged patients. To clarify the risk factors contributing to postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing total gastrectomy, 84 patients with primary gastric cancer were evaluated. Twenty-seven patients were older than 65 years of age; they had much more preoperative cardiac (P = 0.00003), respiratory (P = 0.0008), and multiorgan impairment (P = 0.009) than did the control group (age less than 65 yrs). Although overall morbidities (44.4% vs. 19.2%; P = 0.01) and overall septic complication rates (33.3% vs. 12.2%; P = 0.02) were higher in aged patients, no significant differences between the two groups were found in the incidence of major surgical complications (18.5% in aged patients vs. 10.5% in control groups; P = NS), serious septic (sepsis score greater than 10) complications (18.5% vs. 7.0%; P = NS) and hospital mortalities (11.1% vs. 3.5%; P = NS). In older patients the occurrence of multiorgan impairment and malnutrition was significantly related to postoperative complication rates. These results suggest that the degree of organ impairment rather than age is predictive of postoperative difficulty and should be used in assessing preoperative risk. 
Interferon gamma response region in the promoter of the human DPA gene. The interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) response region of the human class II major histocompatibility complex gene, DPA, has been localized to a 52-base-pair (bp) DNA fragment in the proximal promotor at -107 to -55 bp after transfection into HeLa cells of a series of 5', 3', and gap deletion mutants linked to a reporter gene, human growth hormone, as well as of synthetic oligonucleotides fused to the heterologous promoter thymidine kinase. The 52-mer sequence contains the X and Y box elements conserved in all class II genes; their presence is indispensable for IFN-gamma inducibility. Furthermore, an additional 5 bp immediately 5' of the X box of the DPA gene are necessary and sufficient for IFN-gamma induction. This region may contain an IFN-gamma response element. A closely related sequence has also been found in the vicinity of the critical deletion sites of three other well-studied class II gene promoters, all of which require a much longer sequence 5' of the X box. A fourth element, the W element, located about 15 bp 5' of the X box in all class II genes, is clearly of little importance in IFN-gamma inducibility of the DPA gene. 
Microvascular permeability increases early in the course of acid-induced esophageal injury. To test the hypothesis that microvascular injury is involved in the pathophysiology of acid-induced esophagitis, the effect of acid perfusion on intraluminal plasma protein loss was studied in relation to histological changes. Four groups of opossums (n = 6 in each) were perfused with either normal saline control) or 10, 20, or 100 mmol/L isoosmolar hydrochloric acid at 2 mL/min for 90 minutes using a midesophageal catheter. The distal esophagus was cannulated via a gastrostomy, and the effluent was collected and measured for intraluminal loss of IV injected 125I-bovine serum albumin. Plasma protein loss in the control group was constant with a total loss of 3.40 +/- 0.69 mg/g dry wt. Perfusion of 10, 20, and 100 mmol/L hydrochloric acid increased total protein loss to 8.06 +/- 2.62, 13.94 +/- 2.72, and 27.34 +/- 4.34 mg/g dry wt, respectively. The protein loss was not associated with intraluminal blood loss, as measured by previously injected 51Cr-labeled autologous red blood cells. Histological changes, scored by a blinded observer, were significant only between control animals and those perfused with 100 mmol/L hydrochloric acid. Separate studies using the vascular tracer monastral blue B demonstrated an increase in labeling of lamina propria blood vessels that varied directly with the concentration of acid perfusate, thereby providing direct morphological evidence of microvascular injury. These studies suggest that increased microvascular permeability occurs early in the course of acid-induced esophageal injury. 
Patterns of gene expression that characterize the colonic mucosa in patients at genetic risk for colonic cancer. We have used a computer-driven scanning and image-processing system to identify a panel of 30 cDNA clones whose pattern of expression in individual biopsy specimens distinguishes the flat, normal-appearing colonic mucosa of patients in two genetic groups at high risk for development of colorectal cancer from that of normal colonic mucosa in low-risk individuals. The two high-risk groups, familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, are indistinguishable based on the pattern of expression of the 30 selected clones. This suggests that the extensive pleiotropic effects of the inherited loci, which may play an important role in the mechanism of increased risk and early onset of the disease, are similar in these populations. 
Molecular genetic considerations in osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma tumorigenesis is consistent with a model by which tumorigenesis results if both alleles at the retinoblastoma susceptibility locus (RBI) are altered. Additional genetic evidence strongly suggests that another obligate event in osteosarcoma tumorigenesis is the homozygous alteration of another gene, p53. Both the RB1 gene and p53 have been proposed to act as tumor-suppressor genes, suggesting that, in this instance, tumorigenesis is the result of the loss of gene function of these two genes, rather than a gain of function. 
Ovarian cancer screening: potential effect on mortality. Serum tumor markers and ultrasonography are being investigated as possible ovarian cancer screening tests. Data from the United States on ovarian cancer incidence and survival were used to estimate the potential benefit on ovarian cancer mortality from screening tests of various sensitivities. A test with 80% sensitivity could reduce ovarian cancer mortality by 50% if all screening-detected cases were to experience current stage I survival rates; the benefit would be greatest among women aged 45 or older. For each cancer detected there would be at least 50 false-positive screening tests unless test specificity is greater than 98%. If our most optimistic assumptions about screening could be met, then universal periodic screening of women aged 45 to 74 would result in about 5000 additional 5-year survivors of ovarian cancer annually. Uptake of existing screening tests is far less than universal; thus we would expect the impact of any ovarian cancer screening program to fall short of these projections. 
Rare presentation of a parapharyngeal schwannoma. Schwannoma, or neurilemmoma, is included in the differential diagnosis of masses in the parapharyngeal space. Schwannomata do not usually cause acute inflammation, and therefore do not tend to present as emergencies as in this case, in which there was acute respiratory embarrassment. 
Intracellular free magnesium and high energy phosphates in the perfused normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rat heart. A 31P NMR study. We have employed 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to examine the relationship between cytosolic free Mg2+ ([Mg2+]in), intracellular pH, high energy phosphates, and genetic hypertension using the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY) as a control and the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) as a model for essential hypertension. The mean systolic blood pressures (measured using the tail cuff method) of control and hypertensive rats (aged 7 to 12 weeks) were 113 +/- 4 mm Hg (mean +/- 2 SE, n = 14) and 162 +/- 5 mm Hg (mean +/- 2 SE, n = 17), respectively. Intracellular free Mg2+ levels were significantly depleted in the isolated Langendorff perfused hypertensive rat hearts (452 +/- 39 mumol/L, mean +/- 2 SE, n = 17) compared to control hearts (756 +/- 52 mumol/L, n = 14); however, intracellular pH did not differ in the SHR hearts (7.02 +/- 0.03, mean +/- 2 SE, n = 7) compared with controls (7.03 +/- 0.03, n = 7). Although we could not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the levels of P-creatine or ATP, intracellular Pi was two-fold higher (5.71 +/- 2.28 mmol/L v 2.92 +/- 0.66 mmol/L, n = 4) and the phosphorylation potential, [MgATP]/[MgADP][Pi], was correspondingly lower (3.0 X 10(4) +/- 1.6 x 10(4) v 8.3 X 10(4) +/- 1.4 X 10(4) (mol/L)-1, n = 4) in SHR compared to WKY hearts. These data demonstrate free magnesium depletion in heart muscle and indicate an alteration in cardiac bioenergetics in essential hypertension. 
Direct derivation of conditionally immortal cell lines from an H-2Kb-tsA58 transgenic mouse. Studies on cell lines have greatly improved our understanding of many important biological questions. Generation of cell lines is facilitated by the introduction of immortalizing oncogenes into cell types of interest. One gene known to immortalize many different cell types in vitro encodes the simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor (T) antigen (TAg). To circumvent the need for gene insertion in vitro to generate cell lines, we created transgenic mice harboring the SV40 TAg gene. Since previous studies have shown that TAg expression in transgenic mice is associated with tumorigenesis and aberrant development, we utilized a thermolabile TAg [from a SV40 strain, tsA58, temperature sensitive (ts) for transformation] to reduce the levels of functional TAg present in vivo. To direct expression to a broad range of tissues, we used the mouse major histocompatibility complex H-2Kb promoter, which is both widely active and can be further induced by interferons. tsA58 TAg mRNA was expressed in tissues of all animals harboring the hybrid construct. Development of all tissues was macroscopically normal except for thymus, which consistently showed hyperplasia. Fibroblast and cytokeratin+ thymic epithelial cultures from these mice were readily established without undergoing crisis and were conditionally immortal in their growth; the degree of conditionality was correlated with the levels of tsA58 TAg detected. One strain of H-2Kb-tsA58 mice has been bred through several generations to homozygosity and transmits a functional copy of the transgene. 
Concomitant medical disease and headache. The treatment of headache disorders in patients with concomitant medical illness constitutes one of the more challenging areas of headache therapy. As new agents are added to our pharmacologic armamentarium, it will become easier to tailor therapy to our patients. The physician who treats the headache patient with concomitant medical illness must be particularly aware of drug side effects and pharmacology in order to prevent a worsening of underlying medical conditions or an exacerbation of headaches. 
Utilizing lung sounds analysis for the evaluation of acute asthma in small children. One of the most difficult aspects of management of acute asthma in the small child is the clinician's inability to quantitate the response or lack of response to bronchodilator agents because of the inability of a child this age to perform objective lung measurements in the acute state. The present study was designed to evaluate bronchodilator responsiveness in children between 2 and 6 years of age with wheezing by means of a computerized lung sound analysis, computer digitized airway phonopneumonography. Children between ages 2 and 6 who were experiencing acute exacerbations of asthma were included in this study population. The 43 children were evaluated by physical examination, pulmonary function testing, if possible, by use of (spirometry or peak flow meter) and transmission of lung sounds to a computer using an electronic stethoscope to obtain a phonopneumograph with sound intensity level determinations during tidal breathing. A control group of 20 known asthmatic patients between the ages of 8 and 52 years who also presented to the office with acute asthma were evaluated similarly. In each of these individuals, a physical examination was followed by complete spirometry as well as computer digitized airway phonopneumonography recordings. Following initial measurements, all patients were treated with nebulized albuterol (0.25 mL in 2 mL of saline). Five minutes after completion of the nebulization all patients were reexamined and repeat pulmonary function tests were performed followed by CDAP recordings. In the study group of children, the mean pretreatment sound intensity level was 1,694 (range 557 to 4,950 SD +/- 745). 
Use of femoral venous catheters in critically ill adults: prospective study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of clinically important complications of femoral venous catheters. DESIGN: Prospective survey of major and minor complications. SETTING: A mixed medical/surgical ICU in a university hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-three patients admitted to the ICU who underwent femoral venous catheterization over a 2-yr period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 150 catheters inserted in 123 patients for a mean duration of 6.4 days. There were no major complications including catheter-related sepsis. Minor complications consisted of arterial puncture (9.3%), local bleeding (10%), and local inflammation (4.7%). Critical care fellows had a significantly lower rate (6%) of insertion complications than interns or medical students (16%). We did not specifically look at the frequency of deep venous thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Femoral venous catheterization offers an alternative site of insertion to the subclavian and jugular veins for central venous access in the critically ill. The occurrence rate of clinically important complications is acceptably low. 
Prevalences of endoscopic and histological findings in subjects with and without dyspepsia OBJECTIVE--To examine the association between dyspeptic symptoms and endoscopic and histological diagnoses. DESIGN--Cross sectional study of people with dyspepsia and controls matched for age and sex identified by questionnaire survey of all inhabitants aged 20 to 69. Endoscopy and histological examination was performed with the examiner blind to whether or not the patient had dyspepsia. SETTING--Population based survey in Sorreisa, Norway. SUBJECTS--All people with dyspepsia and age and sex matched people without dyspepsia were offered endoscopy. A total of 309 people with dyspepsia and 310 without dyspepsia underwent endoscopy, giving 273 matched pairs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Prevalences of endoscopic and histological diagnoses made according to internationally accepted standards. RESULTS--In all, 1802 of 2027 (88.9%) people returned the questionnaire. Of the 163 subjects who refused endoscopy, 114 were controls. Of five endoscopic and four histological diagnoses only peptic ulcer disease, endoscopic duodenitis, and active chronic gastritis were diagnosed significantly more often in people with dyspepsia. In all, 30% to 50% of the diagnoses of mucosal inflammation and peptic ulcer disease were made among subjects without dyspepsia, and only 10% of both those with and those without dyspepsia had normal endoscopic findings. CONCLUSIONS--The diagnostic findings, with possible exceptions of peptic ulcer disease and endoscopic duodenitis, showed no association of clinical value with dyspeptic symptoms. The small number of "normal" endoscopic findings in both those with and those without dyspepsia challenge well accepted endoscopic and histological diagnostic criteria with relation to the upper gastrointestinal tract. 
Outpatient liver biopsy: one man's experience. As an academically based gastroenterologist, I performed 94 outpatient liver biopsies over a 42-month period, using the standard suction technique. Differential blood count and vital signs were monitored, with no statistically significant postbiopsy changes noted in the group at large. One patient required admission to the hospital for bleeding, and six patients required intramuscular analgesics for pain at the biopsy site. Four patients had bradycardia, and one of them required atropine for bradycardia and hypotension. Outpatient liver biopsy is a safe procedure with low morbidity and complication rate. It would appear that prolonged monitoring is not necessary. 
Vagally mediated acid hypersecretion and lesion formation in anesthetized rat under hypothermic conditions. The pathophysiological changes associated with hypothermia were investigated in the rat stomach under anesthetized conditions. The animal was placed in a styrene foam box and the core body temperature was kept between 24 and 36 degrees C using a heat lamp and refrigerant pack. Lowering of body temperature (less than 30 degrees C) produced acid hypersecretion and induced hemorrhagic lesions in the gastric mucosa; these responses reached the maximum at 28 degrees C, and a significant relationship was found between acid output and lesion score. Hypothermia (28 degrees C) also caused a marked increase of gastric contractile activity and mucosal blood flow (MBF), but the ratio of acid output to MBF became greater when compared to that obtained under normothermic conditions. These changes induced by hypothermia (28 degrees C) were completely blocked by vagotomy and were significantly inhibited by atropine, hexamethonium, clonidine, or TRH antiserum. However, lowering body temperature did not significantly affect acid secretory, motility, and ulcerogenic responses induced by carbachol in the vagotomized rat, excluding local mechanisms (suppression of the inhibitory nerves) in the hypothermia-induced changes. We conclude that hypothermia alone stimulates vagally dependent acid secretion and motility, resulting in damage in the gastric mucosa. These changes may be centrally mediated by TRH, which is released in association with the thermogenic response to hypothermia. 
Nonneoplastic enhancing lesions mimicking intracanalicular acoustic neuroma on gadolinium-enhanced MR images. The authors describe five patients with nonneoplastic lesions of the facial and/or vestibulocochlear nerves that demonstrated focal enhancement within the internal auditory canal on magnetic resonance (MR) images. MR and surgical findings for four patients with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and one with Ramsay Hunt syndrome were reviewed. Three patients with hearing loss underwent surgical exploration and decompression of the internal auditory canal. The MR findings in all four patients with hearing loss were similar: Focal enhancement of the internal auditory canal was depicted on postcontrast T1-weighted images. Nonneoplastic lesions of the seventh and eighth cranial nerves may show focal enhancement on MR images, which mimics the appearance of a small intracanalicular neuroma. This potential for misdiagnosis may have important therapeutic implications. 
Supratentorial dermoid cysts. Supratentorial dermoid cysts are rare lesions. In eight cases presented here, the lack of recurrence after subtotal removal of the capsule and the good long-term prognosis are emphasized. This finding is in agreement with the literature. The frequent relationship of these lesions with the cavernous sinus suggests a vascular genesis in the development of intracranial dermoid cysts. 
Plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide in spontaneous atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardias of childhood. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was measured in 13 children between the ages of 1 week and 2 years 9 months during atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia and 15 minutes after the restoration of sinus rhythm. There was a significant decline in atrial natriuretic peptide during sinus rhythm. Plasma concentrations of the peptide were significantly higher during tachycardia in seven infants under 1 year than in the six older children. The heart rates and the duration of tachycardia were not significantly different in the two age groups. Cardiac failure was present in five of seven children under 18 weeks of age during tachycardia but in none of the older children. The plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide did not significantly correlate with duration of tachycardia or heart rate. If tachycardia occurs in young infants the low functional reserve capacity of the developing heart leads to cardiac failure more frequently and it is likely that this was the cause of the significantly higher plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide in the younger children. 
Sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus and its relation with hepatitis B virus and HIV OBJECTIVE--To determine the extent of transmission of hepatitis C virus in sexual partners of intravenous drug misusers and to examine the relation between the prevalences of HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus infections in homosexual men and intravenous drug misusers and their sexual partners. DESIGN--Serum samples collected between 1984 and 1988 were tested for hepatitis B virus markers and antibodies against hepatitis C virus by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for HIV antibody by enzyme immune analysis and western blotting. SETTING--Large referral university hospital with an external AIDS clinic in the metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain. SUBJECTS--243 Intravenous drug misusers, 143 of their regular heterosexual partners, and 105 homosexual men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Prevalences of hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV infections. RESULTS--In all, 178 of the 243 (73%) intravenous drug misusers, 16 out of 143 (11%) of their partners, and 17 of the 105 (16%) homosexual men had antibodies against hepatitis C virus. The presence of hepatitis C virus infection was unrelated to sex, age, the presence of HIV or hepatitis B virus infections, or the Centers for Disease Control stage of HIV. In sexual partners of intravenous drug misusers there were strong correlations between the presence of hepatitis C virus infection and that of HIV (p = 0.001) and hepatitis B virus (p = 0.013) infections. CONCLUSIONS--Intravenous drug misusers have a high risk of acquiring hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV infections, but the presence of hepatitis C virus infection seems to be unrelated to the presence of the other two viruses. Homosexual men have a high prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B virus infections with a low prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection, the presence of which is not related to that of the other two infections. Conversely, heterosexual partners of intravenous drug misusers have low prevalences of the three virus infections, but the presence of hepatitis C virus infection correlates significantly with the presence of HIV and hepatitis B infections. The rate of sexual transmission of hepatitis C virus seems to be low, even in partners of people known to be seropositive for this virus. 
Traumatic asphyxia and blunt cardiac injury: case report and selected review. An unusual case is described featuring traumatic asphyxia and blunt cardiac injury. An association between these is possible but not previously described. Coronary artery contusion, malignant arrhythmias, and a normal electrocardiogram were also noted and discussed. The relevant literature was reviewed. 
Transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography of the normal St. Jude Medical mitral valve prosthesis. Transesophageal color flow Doppler findings are reported in 36 patients with a St. Jude Medical mechanical mitral valve prosthesis who had no auscultatory evidence for prosthetic valve dysfunction. Multiple jets consistent with mitral regurgitation originating from the central and lateral portion of the prosthesis were found in all patients. Maximum jet length ranged from 11 to 51 mm (mean 21 +/- 9 mm). Maximum jet area ranged from 0.2 to 4.1 cm3 (mean 1.2 +/- 0.9 cm2). The color M-mode Doppler interrogation showed two distinct components of the regurgitant jet: brief early systolic flow consistent with valve closure followed by holosystolic regurgitant flow consistent with transvalvular leakage. Four patients (11%) had a maximum regurgitant jet length exceeding 30 mm and absence of early systolic closure regurgitant flow by M-mode color imaging, suggesting clinically silent paravalvular leakage. Two pin-sized paravalvular suture line defects were confirmed in one patient at cardiac transplantation. We conclude that transesophageal echocardiography is a highly sensitive method for detection of mitral regurgitation in the St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis. Clinically silent paravalvular leakage should be suspected if the maximum jet length exceeds 30 mm and color M-mode interrogation fails to demonstrate an early systolic closure regurgitant flow component. 
Total hip replacement for juvenile chronic arthritis. We review the results of 96 primary total hip replacements in 54 patients with juvenile chronic arthritis at five years or longer after surgery. The mean age at operation was 16.7 years (range 11.25 to 26.6); the follow-up period averaged 11.5 years. The clinical results in terms of pain, range of movement, mobility and function are presented. A revision procedure was required in 24 hips (25%) in 18 patients at an average of 9.5 years after the primary operation. A further 17 hips had radiographic signs of loosening. The factors thought to contribute to this relatively high failure rate in patients with juvenile chronic arthritis are discussed. 
History of epilepsy in Chinese traditional medicine. The first known document on epilepsy in China appeared in The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine, Huang Di Nei Ching, written by a group of physicians around 770-221 B.C. The description of epilepsy in this book and in many others later published was confined to generalized convulsive seizures. No documentation of absence or simple partial seizures was provided. The first classification of epilepsy, probably by Cao Yuan Fang in A.D. 610, listed five types of epilepsy: "Yang Dian," "Yin Dian," "Feng (Wind) Dian," "Shih (Wet) Dian," and "Lao (Labor) Dian." Later, other classifications named seizures after the cry of animals whose cry the "epileptic cry" resembled, or after "visceral organs" believed to be responsible for the seizures. The concept of partial versus generalized seizures, however, was not observed in any of these classifications. The treatment of epilepsy, based on principles of "Yin Yang Wu Xing," consisted of herbs, acupuncture, and massage. 
A phase I trial of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta alone and in combination with myelosuppressive doses of 5-fluorouracil in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. We studied escalating doses of recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) alone and after a myelosuppressive dose of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Transient neutropenia, monocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia were observed followed by a 1.3- to 6.0-fold (mean, 3.46-fold) dose-dependent neutrophil leukocytosis (P less than .00001) on the days of IL-1 beta administration. Increases in platelet counts were observed at a median of 14 days (range, 6 to 23) after IL-1 beta administration. Transient hypoglycemia, rebound hyperglycemia, elevations in serum cortisol, and C-reactive protein were observed. Side effects included fever, rigors, and headache in the majority of patients. Hypotension was observed in three of five patients at the highest dose level (0.1 micrograms/kg) and was dose-limiting. Fewer days of neutropenia were noted after 5-FU plus IL-1 beta than after 5-FU alone; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance. These data show that IL-1 beta has stimulatory effects in human hematopoiesis. 
Lewis blood group antigens (a and b) in human breast tissues. Loss of Lewis-b in breast cancer cells and correlation with tumor grade. The Lewis blood group antigens (Lewis-a [Lea] and Lewis-b [Leb]) and their precursors are present on various normal human epithelial cell surfaces. The authors examined 35 benign and malignant human breast lesions using mouse monoclonal antibodies to synthetic Lea and Leb carbohydrate antigens. Normal breast lobular and ductal epithelium and benign breast lesions showed Leb staining but only occasional Lea staining. In invasive ductal carcinomas of breast, of all grades, a loss of Leb antigen staining was found in 80% of the breast cancer cases. This reduced Leb antigen expression increased with the grade of malignancy. Therefore, the loss of Leb blood group antigens on breast cancer cell surfaces may suggest altered fucosylation patterns in malignant cells and reflect the degree of malignancy and/or invasiveness. 
Infarction in focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. A case report. An unusual case of focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver with infarction is presented. The patient, a 16-year-old girl with a three-year history of oral contraceptive use, presented with a two-week history of intermittent abdominal pain. Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver and the role of estrogens in the development of this lesion are discussed. 
Autofluorescence of normal and malignant bronchial tissue. In vivo autofluorescence spectra were obtained in 5 patients with carcinoma in situ, 26 patients with invasive tumors, and 1 patient with severe dysplasia. Significant spectral differences were observed between pre-cancerous, cancerous, and normal bronchial tissues. This difference may afford a method to image and/or detect early lung cancer by using tissue autofluorescence alone. 
Mapping of human microtubule-associated protein 1B in proximity to the spinal muscular atrophy locus at 5q13. A polyclonal antiserum directed against the C-terminal domain of dystrophin was used to isolate a cDNA clone encoding an antigenically cross-reactive protein, microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP-1B). Physical mapping of the human MAP-1B locus places its chromosomal location at 5q13, in proximity to the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) locus. SMA is a degenerative disorder primarily affecting motor neurons. Genetic linkage analysis of SMA families using a human dinucleotide repeat polymorphism just 3' of the MAP-1B gene has shown tight linkage to SMA mutations. These mapping data together with the postulated role of MAP-1B in neuronal morphogenesis and its localization in anterior horn motor neurons suggest a possible association with SMA. 
Current approaches to chronic pain in older patients. As the population ages, primary care physicians face an increasing number of individuals who suffer from the effects of chronic diseases, including the accompanying chronic pain. This article reviews the common causes of pain in the elderly and suggests a system for assessing its severity. Five different approaches to treating pain in this population are outlined, as are guidelines for managing the potential side effects of treatment. 
Magnetic resonance imaging and late-onset epilepsy. The value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in investigation of patients with late-onset epilepsy has not been studied systematically. We evaluated prospectively the usefulness of MRI in 50 patients with late-onset epilepsy in whom a computed tomography (CT) scan was normal (32), did not allow a definitive diagnosis to be made (12), or showed irrelevant lesions (6). Patients were assessed clinically and had an EEG, and CT and MRI scans were reported by one neuroradiologist blinded to clinical and laboratory data. Of the 32 patients with a normal CT scan, MRI was normal in 20, showed irrelevant ischemic lesions in 8, and showed the cause of seizures in 4 patients. Of the 12 patients with nondiagnostic CT, MRI clarified the diagnosis in 5 and was normal in 2 patients. In 6 patients, both scans showed irrelevant ischemic lesions, and in 1 patient MRI showed a relevant additional lesion. The incidence of MRI-detected white matter ischemic lesions was no greater than in an age- and sex-matched group of subjects without seizures. MRI was diagnostic in 32% of the patients with partial seizures and/or focal EEG findings, as compared with 0% of patients without focal features (p less than 0.01). We conclude that MRI is useful in investigation of patients with late-onset epilepsy with focal features. 
Acute nonhemodynamic pulmonary edema with nifedipine in primary pulmonary hypertension. A 34-year-old man with primary pulmonary hypertension developed acute nonhemodynamic pulmonary edema after a loading dose of nifedipine. Changes of the vascular permeability induced by the drug acting on the arteriolar wall of the capillary system could be an explanation. 
Staging carcinoma: its value in cancer of the larynx. Three thousand four hundred and forty-five cases of cancer of the larynx were examined and 3,235 assigned to their TNM group. While good correlation with prognosis could be seen, the value of the detailed subsite (as opposed to the main laryngeal regions) was limited to defining T1a and T1b and aiding that of T2. T status gives some indication of prognosis, but the N status is of almost overriding importance. 
Control of blood gas measurements in intensive-care units. The frequency of blood gas measurement in two adult intensive-care units was assessed for 7 months before and 12 months after introduction of a protocol of indications for such investigation. Demographic, diagnostic, outcome, and intervention data were collected prospectively. There were no differences in demographic characteristics, severity or type of illness, survival, or frequency of arterial or pulmonary artery catheter use between the two observation periods, but the frequency of blood gas analysis fell by 44% (p less than 0.001) after the protocol was introduced. 
Myocardial perfusion imaging with technetium-99m-labeled agents. Thallium-201 (201Tl) is suboptimal as a single-photon emitting agent for myocardial perfusion imaging, in view of its low-energy photons and long half-life. To circumvent these limitations, two new myocardial perfusion imaging agents labeled with technetium-99m (99mTc) have been developed. They are Tc-sestamibi and Tc-teboroxime. Clinical trials of myocardial perfusion with both tracers have shown results similar to those obtained with 201Tl for detection of coronary artery disease. Results to date indicate that Tc-sestamibi accurately detects and locates myocardial infarction and can accurately assess both left and right ventricular ejection fractions by the first-pass technique. In addition, research has shown that rest-stress studies can be performed on the same day and that Tc-sestamibi can be used to assess the results of thrombolytic therapy. Tc-teboroxime has excellent myocardial tracer uptake characteristics but is cleared very rapidly from the myocardium. These features make Tc-teboroxime well suited to rapid serial studies. These new technetium myocardial perfusion agents have just become available for routine clinical use and are likely to replace 201Tl in many of its clinical applications. 
Novel approach to iatrogenic bile peritonitis. Bile peritonitis after injury to the biliary tree is a serious complication that requires exploratory laparotomy. Our patient had an obstructing ampullary carcinoma, and generalized bile peritonitis developed from attempted percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. The patient's condition was managed by peritoneal lavage and endoscopic transampullary stenting, with immediate relief of pain and toxicity. Exploratory laparotomy was avoided, and an eventual pylorus-sparing Whipple resection was the definitive treatment. We believe this to be the first report of successful nonoperative treatment of a patient with bile peritonitis with obstructive jaundice. 
Hepatic lesions in alcoholic HBV carriers. Liver biopsies were taken from 54 alcoholic HBV carriers with liver dysfunction to assess whether HBV infection or habitual drinking was the main cause of their illness. In 28 cases, ultrastructural studies were done. Results showed that 50% of the cases predominantly displayed virus-related histological changes, whereas 13% of them mainly had alcohol-related ones. Both pathological changes were evenly distributed in four cases. The remaining 15 cases showed nonspecific or other histological changes. Electron microscopy revealed that HBV core and Dane particles were seen with Mallory bodies in the same hepatocytes. Thus, we postulate that HBV-related changes are more often encountered than alcoholic ones in alcoholic HBV carriers and that HBV replication can occur even in hepatocytes bearing Mallory bodies. 
Elevated intravesical pressure causes arterial hypoperfusion in canine colocystoplasty: a fluorometric assessment. Since 1988 there have been 15 reported cases of late, spontaneously ruptured intestinal cystoplasties at bowel sites remote from the anastomosis. Ischemic necrosis has been suggested as a possible etiology. We examined this hypothesis by quantifying the uptake of intravascular fluorescein in the augmented bowel of adult mongrel canines. There was a statistically significant decrease in fluorescein uptake at high intravesical pressures, which appeared to be most pronounced at the antimesenteric border. This laboratory study supports a recent clinical report of histological changes pathognomonic for chronic ischemia in the augmented bowel of patients with spontaneous rupture. 
Endorectal sonography in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. Endorectal sonography initially was developed for evaluation of the prostate and now has been adapted for evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. We used endorectal sonography to evaluate a spectrum of diseases, including primary and recurrent rectal carcinoma, metastases, villous adenoma, leiomyosarcoma, endometriosis, sacrococcygeal teratoma, chordoma, retroperitoneal cystic hamartoma, pelvic lipomatosis, diverticulitis, and perirectal abscess. The technique has been useful in localization of perirectal abscesses and in sonographically guided biopsy of perirectal masses. Knowledge of normal sonographic anatomy of the rectum is essential in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease. In this essay, we describe the technique of endorectal sonography and illustrate the sonographic findings in a variety of diseases. 
Geniculate neuralgia: the surgical management of primary otalgia. Intractable, unexplained deep-ear pain presents a rare, albeit significant problem in otolaryngological and neurosurgical practice. The authors review their experience with 18 cases of primary otalgia during the past 15 years. A total of 31 surgical procedures were performed. Seventeen patients had sequential rhizotomies and one patient had microvascular decompression alone. Based on the clinical diagnosis, the nerves sectioned were singly or in combination: the nervus intermedius (14 patients), geniculate ganglion (10 patients), ninth nerve (14 patients), 10th nerve (11 patients), tympanic nerve (four patients), and chorda tympani nerve (one patient). Microvascular decompression of the involved nerves was undertaken in nine patients, in whom vascular loops were discovered. Adhesions (six patients), thickened arachnoid (three patients), and benign osteoma (one patient) were other intraoperative abnormalities noted. The overall success of these procedures in providing pain relief was 72.2%, and the mean follow-up period was 3.3 years (range 1 month to 14.5 years). There was no surgical mortality. Expected side effects were: decreased lacrimation, salivation, and taste related to nervus intermedius nerve section, and transient hoarseness and diminished gag related to ninth and 10th nerve section. Four patients developed sequelae consisting of sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, and transient facial nerve paresis. One patient had a cerebrospinal fluid leak and another developed aseptic meningitis as postoperative complications. Except when primary glossopharyngeal neuralgia is the working diagnosis, a combined posterior cranial fossa-middle cranial fossa approach is recommended for adequate exploration and/or section of the fifth, ninth, and 10th cranial nerves as well as the geniculate ganglion and nervus intermedius. 
Clinical utility of transesophageal echocardiography. Routine transthoracic echocardiography fails to generate images of diagnostic quality in a significant number of patients who are obese, uncooperative, or unable to be properly positioned (eg, patients receiving ventilatory assistance), and in those with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chest wall deformities, or recent thoracic surgical procedures. In addition, posterior structures in the heart such as the left atrium, left atrial appendage, atrial septum, and mitral valve are seen with poorer resolution than structures closer to the anterior chest wall. Placement of a sonographic transducer in the esophagus immediately behind the heart circumvents these limitations. Newly developed probes are well tolerated by sedated conscious patients as well as by patients receiving ventilatory assistance in the intensive care unit and those under general anesthesia. Consequently, transesophageal echocardiography is now available for further enhancement of cardiac diagnosis in outpatients, for evaluating the hemodynamic status of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, for intraoperative assessment of cardiac repairs, and for intraoperative cardiac monitoring in noncardiac surgical procedures. A series of case examples from our practice during a recent 1-year period illustrates the clinical utility of this technique in these settings. 
A pseudoaneurysm of the superficial femoral artery as a late complication of a stab wound. Limited arteriography based on clinical indications has become increasingly popular. We present the case of a patient with pseudoaneurysm formation of the superficial femoral artery as a late consequence of a lateral stab wound to the thigh. This case demonstrates the need for postinjury follow-up to identify missed injuries before they are limb threatening. 
Reduction to homozygosity involving p53 in esophageal cancers demonstrated by the polymerase chain reaction. Loss of heterozygosity affecting chromosome 17p has been detected at high frequencies in a variety of human tumors, including cancers of the colon, breast, lung, and brain. One presumed target of these losses is p53, a tumor suppressor gene located on 17p. To our knowledge, loss of heterozygosity has not yet been reported at any locus, including p53, in human esophageal cancer. Moreover, current methods of detecting loss of heterozygosity depend on the availability of large amounts of high molecular weight DNA, making the study of small biopsy specimens or paraffin-embedded tissues problematic. We examined 52 primary human esophageal neoplasms for loss of heterozygosity affecting the p53 gene by using the polymerase chain reaction. Loss of one allele was detected in 52% of informative cases and was more common in squamous carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas. Southern blot analysis was used to confirm polymerase chain reaction-derived data. The identification of allelic loss in approximately half of the tumors analyzed supports the hypothesis that inactivation of p53 is involved in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer. 
Photodynamic therapy for multiple primary bronchogenic carcinoma. In recent years, multiple primary lung cancers have been reported with greater frequency, partly as a result of technologic advances in the detection of lung cancer and therapeutic achievements in its management. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively new therapy used with increasing frequency in the treatment of a wide variety of malignancies, including central lung cancers. In PDT, the differential retention of an injected photosensitizer by malignant tissue is exploited by treatment with a low-power laser beam delivered endoscopically. Since 1980, 145 patients with central lung cancers, including 35 cases of endoscopically evaluated early-stage lesions were treated with PDT at Tokyo Medical College. Thirteen of these 145 patients had multiple primary bronchogenic carcinomas, five cases of which were synchronous with the rest, metachronous. Three of 13 patients with multiple tumors had early-stage lesions and were treated with endoscopic PDT alone. In the other ten cases, PDT was used to treat accessible early-stage foci although operative excision was required for advanced lesions. Mean survival after PDT, alone or in combination with surgery, was 38 months (range, 14 to 87 months), and seven patients remain alive to date. It was concluded that PDT is useful in extending the therapeutic options for, and improving the prognosis of patients with, multiple primary bronchogenic carcinomas. 
Electrothrombosis of saccular aneurysms via endovascular approach. Part 1: Electrochemical basis, technique, and experimental results. Eleven experimental saccular aneurysms were created on the common carotid artery of swine. Between 3 and 15 days after creation of these aneurysms, they were thrombosed via an endovascular approach, using a very soft detachable platinum coil delivered through a microcatheter positioned within the aneurysm. This detachable platinum coil was soldered to a stainless steel delivery guidewire. Intra-aneurysmal thrombosis was then initiated by applying a low positive direct electric current to the delivery guidewire. Thrombosis occurred because of the attraction of negatively charged white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, and fibrinogen to the positively charged platinum coil positioned within the aneurysm. The passage of electric current detached the platinum coil within the clotted aneurysm in 4 to 12 minutes. This detachment was elicited by electrolysis of the stainless steel wire nearest to the thrombus-covered platinum coil. Control angiograms obtained 2 to 6 months postembolization confirmed permanent aneurysm occlusion as well as patency of the parent artery in all cases. No angiographic manifestation of untoward distal embolization was noted. Due to the encouraging results of this research, this technique has been applied in selected clinical cases which are described in Part 2 of this study. 
Non-Q- and Q-wave infarction after thrombolytic therapy with intravenous streptokinase for chest pain and anterior ST-segment elevation The clinical features of patients treated with streptokinase for chest pain and anterior ST-segment elevation who subsequently develop non-Q-wave infarction are unknown. Of the 75 consecutive patients who initially presented with chest pain and ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads (V1-V6, I, aVL) and were treated with intravenous streptokinase (time from symptoms to treatment averaged less than 3 hours), 32 (43%) developed a non-Q-wave and 43 (57%) a Q-wave myocardial infarction. Twenty seven of 32 patients (84%) from the non-Q-wave group and 39 of 43 (91%) from the Q-wave group were studied by angiography at 5.16 +/- 2.88 days after the onset of myocardial infarction. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 13 +/- 6 vs 20 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction was 60 +/- 8 vs 49 +/- 14% (p less than 0.001) and the infarct vessel patency rate was 85 vs 72% (p = 0.44) in patients with a non-Q versus a Q-wave infarction, respectively. In summary, when patients presenting with chest pain and ST-segment elevation are treated with streptokinase, a significant portion of these symptoms will evolve into a non-Q-wave infarction. Patients with a non-Q-wave infarction will have a better preserved left ventricular function than patients who develop a Q-wave infarction. This suggests the need for equal distribution of such patients in randomized trials of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction to avoid misinterpreting data between groups. 
Cardiac sources of embolism and cerebral infarction--clinical consequences and vascular concomitants: the Lausanne Stroke Registry. We studied clinical characteristics and coexisting causes of stroke in 305 patients admitted to a population-based primary care center with an initial ischemic stroke and a potential cardiac source of embolism (PCSE). Using systematic standardized cardiac, arterial, and cerebral investigations and the logistics of the prospective Lausanne Stroke Registry, we found that nonprogressive onset, hemianopia without hemiparesis or hemisensory disturbances, Wernicke's aphasia, ideomotor apraxia, involvement of specific territories (posterior division of middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, cerebellum, multiple territories), and a hemorrhagic component were associated with the presence of a PCSE, as compared with 1,006 initial ischemic stroke patients without PCSE. Although age and sex did not differ, the frequency of hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, elevated blood cholesterol, and deep hemispheric or brainstem infarcts was higher in the patients without a PCSE. Nearly one-fourth of the patients with a PCSE had a coexisting potential arterial cause of stroke (large artery greater than or equal to 50% stenosis or small-vessel disease). In the majority of patients with a PCSE (76.7%), cardioembolism was the most likely cause of stroke, although a direct source of embolism was uncommon (4.3%) and intracranial embolic occlusions were present in less than one-half of the patients who were angiographed. 
Clinical factors affecting the immediate outcome of PTCA in patients with unstable angina and poor candidates for surgery. Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) has been successfully applied in unstable angina to carefully selected patients. In this study, PTCA was performed in 277 consecutive patients suffering from unstable angina and for whom bypass surgery was not a valid alternative because either of inoperable conditions or of emergency, or because surgery was not the best option. All patients were admitted first to the intensive care unit where an attempt was made to control unstable angina under conventional medical therapy using at least iv nitroderivative, heparin, and calcium blockers. After a standardized preparation PTCA was performed either as an emergency procedure in medically refractory unstable angina (107 cases) or as an elective procedure in controlled situations after a 7 to 10 days symptom-free period. Three hundred fifty-three coronary vessels were attempted. Results of this group are compared with those of a control group made of 670 consecutive stable patients recruited during the same period, and clinical characteristics are envisaged as potential predictive factors. Unstable angina is undoubtedly associated with a higher overall complication rate, but the immediate outcome is strongly affected by the clinical context. As an example, respective success and mortality rates are: 93% and 0% when a full revascularization is attempted; 91% and 0% in elective procedures in patients under 60; 87% and 1.2% in elective PTCA for multiple vessel disease; 80% and 6.5% in emergency PTCA; 80% and 11% in the overall triple vessel disease; 84% and 16% in patients with deeply altered ejection fraction; and 58% and 26% in triple vessel disease with 2 previously occluded coronary arteries. 
Different types of chronic hepatitis in alcoholic patients: does chronic hepatitis induced by alcohol exist? To verify the existence of chronic hepatitis induced by alcohol, the clinicopathological features of chronic hepatitis in heavy drinkers were studied using various viral markers. Histological features of chronic active hepatitis were seen in 27 heavy drinkers. These patients were divided into four groups. The AL group (seven cases) consisted of alcoholics who were negative for both hepatitis C antibody and HBsAg; the HB group (four cases) was positive for HBsAg; the HC1 group (seven cases) was positive for hepatitis C antibody but negative for hepatitis C virus-RNA genome; and the HC2 group (nine cases) was positive both for hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis C virus-RNA genome. Serum AST and ALT activity declined during 4 wk of abstinence in most patients in the AL group and in the HC1 group. The response of serum AST and ALT to abstinence was poor in most patients in the HB group and the HC2 group. Serum desialo-transferrin and alcohol liver membrane antibodies were detected more frequently in the sera of patients in the AL group and HC1 group. A trend toward increased frequency of centrilobular ballooning existed in the AL group, but this did not reach statistical significance. These results suggest that chronic active hepatitis in patients in the AL group, in whom markers of HBV and hepatitis C virus were absent, may be caused by alcohol. Patients in the HC1 group who had hepatitis C antibody but not hepatitis C virus-RNA may represent cases where both alcohol and hepatitis C virus are involved. 
Clinical evaluation of stenosis of the carotid bifurcation with magnetic resonance angiographic techniques. We evaluated the images of 60 carotid artery bifurcations in 31 patients suspected to have carotid artery disease who underwent invasive carotid angiography and combined two-dimensional, phase-sensitive and a gradient-echo magnetic resonance angiography. The phase scans consisted of seven serial projections that were obtained at 20 degrees intervals (11.0 minutes) around the carotid bifurcation; the gradient-echo (GRASS) scans were composed of 11 axial images (2.4 minutes) acquired through the bifurcation. The two magnetic resonance angiographic techniques yielded complementary pieces of information and were used together to compare magnetic resonance angiography with invasive angiography. Comparison of magnetic resonance and invasive angiograms of the 60 carotid arteries shows that the sensitivity (86%) and specificity (92%) of the magnetic resonance angiographic techniques we used to diagnose clinically significant carotid stenosis approach but do not reach those of invasive angiography. 
Radionuclide assessment of infarct size and left ventricular function in clinical trials of thrombolysis. Mortality, left ventricular ejection fraction, and infarct size are important end points in evaluating the efficiency of thrombolytic treatment in clinical trials. Radionuclide assessment of ejection fraction and infarct size is safe, accurate, reproducible, and readily available. Its use in clinical trials supplements mortality data and allows meaningful results in trials with smaller patient numbers. Single photon emission computed tomography improves the detection and quantification of infarct size, and its use with new radiopharmaceuticals will assume an important role in future trials. For an 8-year period, these radionuclide techniques have been used in the Western Washington Thrombolysis Trials and have generally shown smaller infarct size and higher ejection fractions in patients receiving streptokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator. However, in the most recent trial there was no direct relation between these end points and the time between symptom onset and initiation of treatment. Future trials that direct efforts to treatment in the first hour after symptom onset should further clarify this observation. 
Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: the risks and benefits of vascular interventions. Our experience with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS), a rare congenital malformation, has increased considerably in recent years and now includes 144 patients (65 male and 79 female patients). Hemangioma was present in 137 patients (95.1%), varicosity in 110 (76.4%), and hypertrophy of the soft tissues or bones in 134 (93.1%). In most patients (71.5%) the disease involved one lower extremity. Diagnostic workup included roentgenogram to document limb length discrepancy, noninvasive arterial and venous evaluation, contrast venography, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Most patients did well without treatment or with elastic compression only. Surgical treatment for the vascular malformation in KTS is rarely needed and it continues to be controversial. To evaluate the risks and benefits of vascular interventions, we examined in detail the clinical histories of nine patients who in the last decade underwent operation for a vascular malformation of the lower extremity. In seven patients we removed varicose veins or resected hemangioma of the lower extremity. Although none was cured, all five who underwent resection of varicose veins and one of the two patients who underwent resection of a hemangioma improved. Two additional patients, however, who underwent resection of varicose veins in another institution had worsening of the symptoms. In one patient we performed deep venous reconstruction for atresia of the superficial femoral vein, using the contralateral saphenous vein. Such operation in KTS has not been reported previously. The patient has a patent graft with a competent valve and clinical improvement 6 months after the operation. Although patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency, disturbing cosmetic appearance, or complications of hemangioma may benefit from surgical treatment, detailed preoperative imaging of the extremity and pelvis with magnetic resonance imaging and contrast venography is needed to decrease complications. Rarely, reconstruction for atresia or hypoplasia of the deep veins may be needed. 
DNA ploidy pattern of flat adenomas of the large bowel. In an attempt to clarify the nature of "flat adenomas," DNA content was measured by means of microspectrophotometry. Thirty-nine flat adenomas (FA), 13 with mild, 22 with moderate, and 4 with severe atypia, were collected for this study. In FA, diploidy (D), polyploidy (P), and aneuploidy (A) were found 100, 0, and 0 percent in mild atypia, 41.9, 4.5, and 54.5 percent in moderate atypia, and 0, 0, and 100 percent in severe atypia, respectively. It is assumed that FA have a much higher malignancy potential than previously expected since, histologically, benign-appearing FA with moderate atypia have already contained malignant DNA patterns. In particular, those more than 5 mm in diameter show aneuploidy in 80 percent. These data suggest that FA with moderate atypia play an important role in the pathogenesis of small colonic carcinomas. 
Failure of MR imaging to detect reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the extremities. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy of the extremities is a disease with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. It is characterized by pain, hyperthermia, and cutaneous changes and has been linked to an abnormality of regional blood flow. The disease is associated with previous injury or trauma including surgery, but also has been found in association with myocardial infarctions and tumors. The final diagnosis can be made only on the basis of the clinical course, which is characterized either by regression without sequel or the appearance of aponeurotic and tendinous retractions including bony sclerosis in the affected region occurring over many months to years. The literature and our own results show that MR imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosing transient osteoporosis of the hip, which is generally thought to be a form of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Therefore we investigated the usefulness of MR imaging for diagnosing sympathetic dystrophy of the extremities. Twenty-five patients underwent T1- and T2-weighted MR imaging of the affected body region. They were selected on the basis of the initial clinical findings and positive findings on scintigraphy, which is known to be a sensitive, but not very specific, imaging method for sympathetic dystrophy. The final diagnosis was established on the basis of the clinical course in 17 of the 25 patients. In 10 of these, findings on MR images were completely normal, in six the MR images showed only nonspecific soft-tissue changes or bone marrow sclerosis, and in one patient they showed changes in bone marrow signal. Of the remaining eight patients without a final diagnosis of sympathetic dystrophy, MR showed soft-tissue or bone marrow alterations in six. MR imaging appears to be of little value in establishing the diagnosis of sympathetic dystrophy, but it may improve diagnostic specificity when used in conjunction with scintigraphy. 
Hypertensives' pressor response to norepinephrine. Analysis by infusion rate and plasma levels. After 5 days of a 10 mEq sodium diet or 4 days of a 200 mEq sodium diet, 15 hypertensives and 11 normotensive control subjects received pressor doses of intravenous norepinephrine (NE). Analysis of pressor responses to the rate of NE infusion showed that the high salt diet sensitized subjects so that they needed less NE to raise systolic blood pressure (SBP) 20 mm Hg (P = .005). There was a complex interaction of salt intake, black race, and hypertension on NE pressor sensitivity (P = .03). Hypertensives attained lower plasma NE levels during the stepwise NE infusion, so we reanalyzed NE sensitivity in terms of the changes in plasma NE levels. This analysis also showed that during the high salt diet, subjects initiated a pressor response at lower plasma NE levels (P = .017) and raised SBP 20 mm Hg at lower NE levels (P = .007). The reanalysis showed that hypertensives initiated a pressor response at lower plasma NE levels (P = .03) and raised SBP 20 mm Hg at lower NE levels (P = .002). Plasma NE levels should provide a better guide to the concentration of NE at cardiovascular receptors than the rate of NE infusion. Analysis of pressor responses to plasma NE levels demonstrated that the hypertensives had an exaggerated pressor response to NE. 
Chaos, balance, and development: thoughts on selected childhood epilepsy syndromes. Age-specific epilepsy syndromes raise important questions about developmental susceptibility to seizures and epileptogenesis and about the effect of seizures on function. The diagnosis and treatment of these syndromes has been enhanced by the use of modern science and technology. Epidemiologic studies have changed our approach to febrile convulsions. This developmental seizure disorder is benign and self-limited. We have been forced to think carefully about threshold, therapy, and whether other seizures in childhood may be equally benign. This framework of developmental specificity can also be applied to West syndrome, especially with respect to neurophysiology, neurochemistry, neuroimaging, and epidemiology--the types of seizures, clustering, variations associated with sleep, PET scans, and therapy. Rasmussen's syndrome and other unilateral developmental epilepsies are progressive but remain confined to a single hemisphere. However, they usually are devastating to global neurologic function. They are models for examining the impact of epilepsy in one pathologic hemisphere on the function of the entire brain. Current therapy for this condition is hemispherectomy. Recovery of function after this major surgery is striking and provides clues to brain organization. The analysis of these three syndromes provides windows on the dynamic, changing central nervous system of the child and may lead to better understanding and therapy for other seizure disorders. 
Classification of epilepsies and epileptic syndromes in two different samples of patients. We attempted to classify, according to the International Classification of Epilepsies and Epileptic Syndromes, 986 patients consecutively examined during a 13-month period either in a specialized private practice (n = 642) or in an adult neurology unit in a university hospital (n = 344). Without major difficulty, we classified 97% of patients in more or less clearly defined syndromes. Benign frontal and benign psychomotor epilepsies of childhood were represented in this sample of patients. In either partial or generalized idiopathic epilepsies, a diagnosis of epilepsy appears justified even after a single epileptic event when sufficient electroclinical characteristics are present. Patients with symptomatic generalized epilepsies often have to be classified under two or three headings. Many children with a symptomatic generalized epilepsy also experience partial seizures. Alcoholic epilepsy is described as a veritable epileptic syndrome. The distribution of epileptic syndromes was clearly different in the two samples, casting doubt on the value of some epidemiologic surveys based on selected groups of patients. 
Factors influencing postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease in childhood. We have reviewed the outcome of all patients undergoing their first intestinal resection for Crohn's disease at this hospital between 1970 and 1987. Recurrence rates, defined by recurrent intestinal symptoms and radiological confirmation of mucosal disease, were calculated using survival analysis. Age, sex, anatomical location of disease, indication for surgery, preoperative duration of symptomatic disease, use of preoperative bowel rest, and pathological features of the resected bowel were analysed individually and jointly as potential risk factors influencing postoperative recurrence of disease. Eighty two patients (age, mean (SD) 14.8 (2.5) years) underwent intestinal resection and were followed postoperatively for a minimum of one year (mean 5.3 (3.3) years). Anatomical location of disease, indication for surgery, and preoperative duration of symptomatic disease were the only factors that significantly influenced the duration of the recurrence free interval. Patients with diffuse ileocolonic inflammation experienced earlier recurrence (50% at one year) than children with predominantly small bowel disease (50% recurrence at five years, p less than 0.0001). Failure of medical therapy independent of disease location as the sole indication for surgery was associated with an earlier relapse than when surgery was performed for a specific intestinal complication such as abscess or obstruction (p less than 0.003). Patients undergoing resection within one year of onset of symptoms experienced delayed recrudescence of active disease (30% recurrence by eight years) compared with patients whose preoperative duration of symptomatic disease was longer (50% recurrence by four years when preoperative duration of disease was one to four years and 50% by three years when disease had been present greater than four years preoperatively, p = 0.03). 
Clinical follow-up and progression of carotid atherosclerosis determined by duplex scanning in patients suffering from TIA. We investigated the clinical outcomes and the progression of the internal carotid arterial lesions of a group of patients presenting with hemispheric TIAs. The cumulative frequency of TIAs during a mean follow-up period of 40 +/- 14 months was 14%, and no relationship was found between new TIAs and the presence of known cardiovascular risk factors or plaque characteristics as determined by duplex scanning. With the exception of one patient who died of stroke, none of the patients developed a permanent neurologic deficit. The cumulative death rate was 6.5%; myocardial infarction was the most common cause (3 out of 7). Anatomic progression of plaques was determined by duplex scanning in 22% of the internal carotid arteries. No relationship between progression of these plaques and the development of new TIAs was evident. We conclude that, in this group of patients, TIAs do not inevitably lead to stroke and that TIAs are not predictable based on risk factors or plaques characteristics. 
Proopiomelanocortin gene expression in normal and tumoral human lung. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression is not restricted to the pituitary corticotroph cell, but also takes place in many normal and tumoral nonpituitary tissues. In contrast, the ectopic ACTH syndrome is a rare event. Because it is most often associated with lung tumors, we specifically studied this tissue, analyzing the different forms of POMC RNAs in normal specimens as well as in various types of tumors. The endocrine nature of the tumors was assessed by both histological examination and measurements of secretogranin-I fragments in the tissue extracts. POMC RNA was first detected by Northern blot analysis; its absolute amounts and its various molecular forms were more precisely quantified and discriminated by S1 mapping studies using a single stranded DNA probe located at the 5' end of exon 3. In five bronchial carcinoid tumors associated with the ectopic ACTH syndrome, a highly predominant, if not single, POMC RNA identical to the 1200-nucleotide (nt) pituitary message was present, the high amounts of which were correlated with those of POMC peptides in the same tissues. In five bronchial carcinoid tumors not associated with the ectopic ACTH syndrome, the same message was detected (four of five), with a second, often predominant, short RNA of about 800 nt (five of five), and the overall amounts of POMC RNAs were low. Similar patterns of POMC RNAs were observed in squamous cell tumors, adenocarcinomas, and normal lung, where the short 800-nt RNA tended to be predominant. These results show that POMC gene expression can be demonstrated in normal lung tissue and in all types of lung tumors. The ectopic ACTH syndrome only occurs with tumors capable of generating high amounts of the pituitary-like message, a phenomenon that seems to be restricted to an occasional tumor with features of neuroendocrine differentiation. 
Autoantibody-encoding kappa L chain genes frequently rearranged in lambda L chain-expressing chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients with kappa L chain expressing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) frequently have leukemia cells reactive with a murine mAb, designated 17.109. Raised against a monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor autoantibody, this mAb recognizes a major kappa-L chain-associated cross reactive Id, designated 17.109-CRI. Molecular studies reveal that the 17.109-CRI in CLL is a serologic marker for expression of a conserved kappa L chain V region gene (V Kappa gene) of the V Kappa 3 subgroup, designated Humkv325. We isolated an upstream gene fragment of Humkv325 to examine for Ig gene rearrangements of this and other closely related V Kappa 3 genes by Southern analyses. Consistent with Humkv325 encoding the 17.109-CRI, we find that the genomic DNA from all 17.109-reactive leukemia cell populations have gene rearrangements that are detected using this probe. In addition, we observe V Kappa 3 gene rearrangements frequently in the genomic DNA of lambda L chain-expressing leukemia cells. Of the genomic DNA from 33 lambda-L chain-expressing CLL samples, 8 (24%) had additional nongerm-line bands detected with the Humkv325 probe. Consistent with these bands representing Ig gene rearrangements, the additional band in each but one sample also hybridized with probes specific for the J Kappa region and/or the kappa-deleting element. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we examined the genomic DNA from all lambda L chain-expressing CLL for V Kappa 3 gene rearrangements to J Kappa and/or Kde. PCR on each DNA sample with V Kappa 3 gene rearrangements detected by Southern analysis generated gene fragments that hybridized specifically with oligonucleotides corresponding to framework or CDR of the Humkv325 gene. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of representative samples confirmed that these DNA contained abortive Humkv325 gene rearrangements. PCR for rearranged V Kappa 3 genes in the DNA of other lambda-L chain-expressing CLL either did not generate any PCR product or produced fragments that failed to hybridize with all Humkv325 oligonucleotide probes. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of the latter demonstrated that these represent abortive V Kappa gene rearrangements involving another conserved V Kappa 3 gene, designated Vg. These studies indicate that Humkv325 and Vg frequently may undergo Ig gene rearrangement independent of their expression. As such, the frequent use of Humkv325 in CLL may be secondary, in part, to an enhanced propensity of this V Kappa 3 gene to undergo genetic rearrangement during B cell ontogeny. 
Relationship between redistribution on exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy and repetitive ventricular premature beats in patients with recent myocardial infarction. The relationship between myocardial ischemia detected by exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy and repetitive ventricular premature beats (VPBs) during ambulatory monitoring was evaluated in 57 patients with recent myocardial infarction. Multivariate analysis was performed to obtain the relatively important factor related to repetitive VPBs with the use of the following variables: age, redistribution, left ventricular ejection fraction, serum potassium and magnesium concentration, QRS score, left ventricular aneurysm, and the number of diseased vessels. Thirty-five patients had redistribution, but only three of them had repetitive VPBs during exercise testing. The average heart rate before 79% of 398 episodes of repetitive VPBs during ambulatory monitoring was in the range of 56 to 70/min. These data indicate that most of repetitive VPBs during ambulatory monitoring were not provoked by exercise-induced acute myocardial ischemia. However, redistribution was found to be an important factor associated with repetitive VPBs. The electrical abnormality relating to a substrate characterized by chronic reversible ischemia may explain the association between redistribution and repetitive VPBs. 
Prediction of subclinical tumor infiltration in basal cell carcinoma. Two thousand-sixteen basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) were documented in terms of age, anatomic location, tumor diameter, initial excision depth, safety margin, histologic type, and the position of tumor outgrowths as determined by three-dimensional histologic study of the tumor margins in paraffin sections (micrographic surgery). The extent of each subsequent excision was recorded until tumor-free tissue was reached. The results showed that BCCs have a highly irregular infiltration pattern and a predilection for small, fingerlike outgrowths whose bases occupy 1-30 degrees of the tumor circumference. When superficial extension was expressed mathematically, the resulting exponential functions varied highly significantly (P = .001) according to histologic tumor type and diameter. The resulting curves permitted very precise prediction of the probability of tumor-positive margins (ie, subtotal excision), depending on the safety margin, histologic tumor type, and tumor diameter. For example, the probability of tumor-positive margins after excision of a BCC up to 10 mm in diameter is 30% with a safety margin of 2 mm, 16% with a safety margin of 3 mm, and 5% with a safety margin of 5 mm. The probability of tumor-positive margins for fibrosing primary BCCs 10-20 mm in diameter is 48, 34, and 18% with safety margins of 2, 3, and 5 mm, respectively. Recurrent tumors have a significantly higher probability of positive margins (P = .001) than primary ones. Anatomic location and tumor age affect subclinical extension only indirectly. 
Effect of antitumor surgery on soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum levels. Surgically induced immunosuppression may play a role in cancer, because of the possible existence of micrometastases at the time of surgical removal of tumors. Antitumor immune reactions are mediated by interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 acts on a specific IL-2 cell surface receptor; moreover, a soluble form of IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) can be released in the blood. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of surgery on sIL-2R serum levels in patients with operable solid tumors. A total of 48 patients with cancer and 11 controls who underwent major surgery for non-neoplastic disease were evaluated before and 7 days after surgery. Serum mean levels of sIL-2R were significantly higher after than before surgery in both the cancer and control groups. No correlation was seen between surgery-induced changes in sIL-2R and in T lymphocyte subsets. Because of its capacity of binding to IL-2, the increased blood concentrations of sIL-2R could reduce the IL-2 availability and negatively affect antitumor immune reactions. 
Maternal reproductive history and birth characteristics in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using birth-registration data, a case-control study was done to investigate the possible associations of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with birth characteristics and maternal reproductive history. The data included cases born and diagnosed in Minnesota since 1969. Matched analyses were conducted using 337 cases and 1336 birth year-matched controls. There was a statistically significant increased odds of ALL for birth to older (greater than 35 years) mothers (odds ratio (OR) = 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.28, 3.58), older fathers (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.14, 2.30), mothers with at least a high school education (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.05, 2.48), and larger intervals (greater than 5 years) between the birth of the proband and the preceding sibling (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.12, 3.09). The increased odds of ALL for birth by Caesarean section approached significance (OR = 1.42, P = 0.06). No overall association was found for: gender, race, paternal education, fetal-loss history, birth order, prenatal care history, pregnancy complications, inducement of labor, multiple birth, gestational age, or birth weight. Age at diagnosis was an important effect modifier of some analyses. For cases diagnosed before age 2 years, there was a 2.7-fold increased odds of ALL if the last pregnancy had resulted in a fetal loss (P = 0.03). For cases diagnosed before age 4 years, birth weight greater than 3800 g was associated with a significant 2.05-fold increased odds of ALL. These data strengthen the hypothesis that prenatal events may play a causative role in childhood ALL, particularly in those cases diagnosed at a younger age. 
Laser uvulopalatoplasty in treatment of habitual snoring. Velopharyngeal sonorous snoring is best treated with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). To reduce surgical risks and minimize the morbidity, a simplified carbon dioxide laser uvulopalatoplasty (LUPP) was performed under local anesthesia. Among a total of 146 patients who had a LUPP performed, there was no significant bleeding or postoperative episodes of asphyxia. The procedure was well tolerated even by those patients with strong vomiting reflexes. The operation time was halved, as was the convalescence. Two patients (1.4%) developed scarring with nasal obstruction, but the impact of factors other than the laser approach itself seemed to be the cause. By scored questionnaires the effect on snoring, family complaints, and daytime somnolence was evaluated in two comparable random groups of patients. Sixty-three patients had LUPP procedures, and 37 had UPPP. The short-term results showed that about 90% of the patients considered themselves essentially improved as regarded snoring and that most patients felt more alert, irrespective of the surgical method used. 
Cerebral granular cell tumor occurring with glioblastoma multiforme: case report. A 65-year-old man presented with 4 weeks of partial right visual field loss. A left occipital granular cell tumor was diagnosed via open biopsy. No specific tumoricidal therapy was given, and the patient returned 2 weeks later with fluent dysphasia and mild right hemiparesis, and formed visual hallucinations. A large left parietotemporal mass, separate from the granular cell tumor, was diagnosed as a glioblastoma multiforme by stereotactic biopsy. The histogenesis of cerebral granular cell tumors is controversial; this case supports recent speculation of their possible glial origin. 
The parietal cell autoantibodies recognized in neonatal thymectomy-induced murine gastritis are the alpha and beta subunits of the gastric proton pump. Murine autoimmune gastritis, induced by neonatal thymectomy, bears a striking similarity in pathology to the human autoimmune disease, pernicious anemia. Autoantibodies to parietal cells are found in both murine and human diseases. Monoclonal immunoglobulin G autoantibodies, obtained from neonatally thymectomized mice, have previously been shown to recognize two groups of gastric parietal cell antigens. In the present study, it is shown that two of these monoclonal autoantibodies, designated 1H9 and 2B6, are directed against the alpha subunit and beta subunit, respectively, of the gastric hydrogen-potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (H+,K(+)-ATPase; proton pump). Monoclonal antibody 1H9 showed reactivity by immunoblotting with a 95-kilodalton component of dog gastric tubulovesicular membranes and with a fusion protein containing the hydrophilic domain of the alpha subunit of the H+,K(+)-ATPase. Monoclonal antibody 2B6 reacted by immunoblotting with the 60-90-kilodalton glycoprotein (beta subunit) of the tomato lectin-purified dog H+,K(+)-ATPase and with the 60-90-kilodalton autoantigen purified with human parietal cell autoantibodies. Monoclonal antibody 2B6 also reacted with the deglycosylated 35-kilodalton core protein of the tomato lectin-purified 60-90-kilodalton beta subunit and of the purified 60-90-kilodalton autoantigen. Parietal cell autoantibody-positive sera from 20 mice with experimentally induced gastritis showed reactivity predominantly with the alpha and/or beta subunit of the gastric H+,K(+)-ATPase. Therefore, it is concluded that the major molecules targeted by parietal cell autoantibodies from mice with neonatal thymectomy-induced murine autoimmune gastritis and from humans with pernicious anemia are identical. 
Immunohistochemical staining of CA 50 antigen in human bladder cancer. Relation to histologic grade, clinical stage, and prognosis. The immunohistochemical detection of tumor marker CA 50 was studied in bladder cancer of WHO grades I-III. The material consisted of tumors in 83 patients and the mean clinical follow-up time was thirteen years (range 9.6-22 years). The fraction of CA 50-positive cells (FPtot) in microscopic image was scored 0-100 percent. Also the maximally staining region was selected, and the fraction of CA 50-positive cells in this region was scored 0-100 percent (FPmax). The average staining intensity of CA 50-positive cells was scored from 0 to 3 in the whole section (ASItot) and in the maximally staining area (ASImax). The inverse relation between histologic grade, FPtot (p = 0.0001), and ASItot (p = 0.006) was statistically significant. FPtot (p = 0.039) and ASItot (p = 0.018) were also inversely related to clinical stage. Occurrence of metastasis during the follow-up was associated with low CA 50 positivity (FPtot, p = 0.003; ASItot, p = 0.002). The lower the staining intensity or the lower the fraction of CA 50-positive cells, the more aggressive was the tumor. In survival analysis, low FPtot (p = 0.002) and ASItot (p = 0.007) values were related to high risk of bladder cancer death. The results show that immunohistochemical staining of bladder tumor specimens with CA 50 can be used to predict bladder cancer aggressiveness and survival. 
The bottom end. Handling of the perineal wound after abdominoperineal resection. There are a number of options for handling the perineal wound following abdominoperineal resection, including open packing or primary closure with suction drainage. Open packing has not been widely accepted, fearing that it may delay perineal wound healing. The purpose of this paper, therefore, was to retrospectively evaluate, the experience at Ferguson Hospital with abdominoperineal resection from 1977 through 1986. The study population consisted of 288 patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma. Forty-six patients had the perineal wound closed primarily and 242 had the perineal wound packed open. Ninety-four patients had the pelvic peritoneum left open and 194 underwent closure of the pelvic peritoneum. Overall operative mortality was 2.1 per cent, and there was no significant difference between primary closure and open packing of the perineal wound with respect to hospital stay, operating time, operative blood loss, perioperative mortality, incidence of postoperative bowel obstruction, incidence of postoperative complications, or average time for perineal wound healing. Therefore, it would appear that packing the perineal wound following abdominoperineal resection is a viable means of handling the bottom end. 
Potential role of PFOB enhanced sonography of the kidney. II. Detection of partial infarction. Aside from its ability to assess flow velocity within vessels, color Doppler and gray-scale sonography cannot distinguish perfused from non-perfused tissues. In this study we evaluated whether Perfluorooctylbromide (PFOB), a sonographic contrast agent given i.v., could aid sonography with this recognition. Partial renal infarction was produced by a 1 mm bead embolized in the right, the left, or both renal arteries of 20 normal rabbits. The sonographer, unaware of rabbit assignment, attempted to diagnose the infarct 24 hours later. All 20 rabbits were studied with gray-scale and color Doppler sonography, 10 before and after PFOB and 10 only after PFOB. Angiography and post-mortem examination were done for confirmation. Of the 20 kidneys evaluated before PFOB, the sonographer was unable to diagnose the 10 partial infarctions. Color Doppler identified five of the ten infarcted kidneys, but accurately localized the infarction in only two. Of the 40 kidneys evaluated after PFOB infusion, 20 scanned before and 20 scanned only after PFOB, all 20 partial infarctions were accurately diagnosed with both gray-scale and color Doppler. PFOB enhanced the echogenicity of perfused renal tissue allowing the easy detection of the unenhanced infarct. Because of the increased signal from vessels after PFOB, color Doppler displayed the entire vascular tree, allowing the detection of the truncated embolized branch. The ability of PFOB to enhance Doppler signals and the echogenicity of perfused tissues improved the diagnostic accuracy of sonography when used to detect partial renal infarctions. 
Sarcoid neuropathy. In a case of subacute sensory and motor polyneuropathy associated with sarcoidosis, multiple epineurial and endoneurial granulomas were demonstrated in a sural nerve. Neighbouring nerve fibres were displaced by the granulomas and some were undergoing axonal degeneration. Ultrastructural and teased fibre studies showed axonal atrophy and degeneration with secondary demyelination. Histochemical studies indicated the presence of HLA-DR antigen on epithelioid cells in the granulomas. A non-specific inflammatory process in the nerve does not cause significant primary demyelination. 
Measurement of in vivo urological tumour cell kinetics using multiparameter flow cytometry. Preliminary study. The in vivo labelling of urological tumour cells using the S phase marker bromodeoxyuridine (BRdU) for histochemical studies is reported. The use of multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) with BRdU labelling to study tumour proliferation offers significant advantages. It provides simultaneous measurements of the DNA ploidy (DI), the duration of the S phase (Ts), the potential doubling time (Tpot) and the total and aneuploid tumour labelling indices (LI) from a single specimen. Heterogenous tumour cell populations can be measured with high sensitivity. We report a preliminary study to evaluate the method in the measurement of the kinetics of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCCB). Nineteen patients with TCCB, 1 with leukoplakia of the bladder, 2 with renal carcinoma, 1 with prostatic carcinoma and 1 with a squamous carcinoma of the penis were studied. Of the bladder tumours, 3 were aneuploid, DI = 1.32, 1.58 and 1.89. BRdU uptake was detected in all tumours. The median LI was 1.5% (range 0.5-10.0). In 15/19 tumours the labelling profile was satisfactory for calculation of the Ts and Tpot. The median Ts was 6.2 h and the median Tpot was 17.1 days. This study demonstrates that measurement of multiple parameters of urological tumour proliferation in vivo is possible. These parameters require further assessment as indices of biological aggressiveness and clinical prognosis. 
Fate of patients with acute myocardial infarction with patency of the infarct-related vessel achieved with successful thrombolysis versus rescue angioplasty. Patients with failure of infarct-related artery recanalization after thrombolytic therapy have a poor clinical outcome. These patients have been considered for rescue angioplasty 90 min after thrombolytic therapy at the time of emergency catheterization in the course of five Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) trials. The outcome of 776 patients with patent infarct-related vessels after emergency catheterization was analyzed--607 with thrombolysis-mediated patency of the infarct-related vessel and 169 with patency achieved by angioplasty. Baseline characteristics of the thrombolysis and angioplasty patency groups were similar except for a higher acute left ventricular ejection fraction (51.3% versus 48.2%) in the thrombolysis group (p = 0.003). Seven to 10 day left ventricular ejection fraction was higher (52.3% versus 48.1%), infarct zone functional recovery was greater (0.44 versus 0.21 standard deviation/chord, or 18% versus 7%, p = 0.001) and reocclusion was less (11% versus 21%) in the thrombolysis compared with the angioplasty group. Despite these differences, angioplasty patency was associated with the same low in-hospital mortality rate (5.9% versus 4.6%) and long-term mortality rate (3% versus 2%) as thrombolysis patency. Reocclusion adversely affected the mortality rate and ventricular functional recovery. Technical failure of rescue angioplasty was associated with a much higher mortality rate than was technical success (39.1% versus 5.9%). Thrombolysis patency was preferable to angioplasty patency after thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction, but both were associated with the same low in-hospital and long-term mortality rates, suggesting that rescue angioplasty is beneficial in some patients with failure of infarct-related artery recanalization after thrombolytic therapy. 
Cerebral ischemic events associated with endocarditis, retinal vascular disease, and lupus anticoagulant. PURPOSE: A group of young patients presenting with cerebral ischemic events, endocardial lesions, and lupus anticoagulant is described in order to highlight the common clinical laboratory features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients (10 females, age range 17 to 53 years [mean 38 years]) at onset of symptoms of cerebral ischemia who had evidence of the lupus anticoagulant syndrome and were being followed prospectively are reviewed. All patients had abnormal phospholipid-dependent coagulation test results, and most had anticardiolipin antibody at the time of presentation. Three of 14 had four or more American Rheumatism Association criteria for definite systemic lupus erythematosus and the remaining patients were considered to have primary lupus anticoagulant syndrome. RESULTS: The common features among these patients included at least one cerebral ischemic event at presentation (stroke or transient ischemic attack), or recurrent episodes suggesting cerebral ischemia (amaurosis fugax, recurrent severe migraine headaches), livedo reticularis, endocardial valvular lesions noted on echocardiography (11 mitral, two aortic valve) that were often associated with discrete vegetations, retinal vascular lesions, and computed tomographic/magnetic resonance imaging scanning or angiographic evidence of multiple cerebral infarction. Venous thromboembolic events were uncommon (three of 14). Common laboratory studies included thrombocytopenia (10 of 14), positive direct Coombs' test result (11 of 14), and hypocomplementemia (11 of 14). Follow-up after initial treatment with either salicylates or anticoagulant therapy (warfarin) for up to 10 years indicated that while many patients had recurrent symptoms suggesting cerebral ischemia, major stroke syndromes did not recur nor new episodes emerge. CONCLUSION: The combination of multiple cerebral ischemic lesions and endocardial lesions, including valvular vegetations, suggests that these cerebral ischemic events represent cerebral emboli, and that these cerebral embolic events originate from vegetative lesions on the mitral or, less commonly, aortic valve, in association with lupus anticoagulant. 
Admission alcohol level: a predictor of the course of alcohol withdrawal. BACKGROUND. Little is known about how to predict the course of alcohol withdrawal. This study explores relationships between alcohol levels at admission to a detoxification unit and the severity and outcome of alcohol withdrawal. METHODS. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in two institutions, the Mid-Missouri Mental Health Center (MMMHC) and the Harry S Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital (HSTMVH), of individuals admitted during 1 year. RESULTS. The alcohol levels at admission of the 86 clients at the Mental Health Center and the 99 patients at the HSTMVH, correlated with withdrawal severity over the first 48 hours after admission (R2 = .26 at MMMHC, .41 at HSTMVH, P less than .0001 for both), and remained significantly associated even after adjustment for other variables. Furthermore, individuals who had lower alcohol levels at the time of admission were more likely to stay for rehabilitation following detoxification (P less than .001 for both institutions). CONCLUSIONS. A patient's alcohol level at the time of admission to a detoxification unit may help predict the severity of withdrawal and the treatment outcome. 
Electrode system influence on biphasic waveform defibrillation efficacy in humans. BACKGROUND. Several clinical studies have demonstrated a general superiority of biphasic waveform defibrillation compared with monophasic waveform defibrillation using epicardial lead systems. To test the breadth of utility of biphasic waveforms in humans, a prospective, randomized evaluation of defibrillation efficacy of monophasic and single capacitor biphasic waveform pulses was performed for two distinct nonthoracotomy lead systems as well as for an epicardial electrode system in 51 cardiac arrest survivors undergoing automatic defibrillator implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS. The configurations tested consisted of a right ventricular-left ventricular (RV-LV) epicardial patch-patch system, an RV catheter-chest patch (CP) nonthoracotomy system, and a coronary sinus (CS) catheter-RV catheter nonthoracotomy system. For each configuration, the defibrillation current and voltage waveforms were recorded via a digital oscilloscope to measure defibrillation threshold voltage, current, resistance, and stored energy. Biphasic waveform defibrillation proved more efficient than monophasic waveform defibrillation for the epicardial RV-LV system (4.8 +/- 4.1 versus 6.7 +/- 4.9 J, p = 0.047) and the nonthoracotomy RV-CP system (23.4 +/- 11.1 versus 34.3 +/- 10.4 J, p = 0.0042). Biphasic waveform defibrillation thresholds were not significantly lower than monophasic waveform defibrillation thresholds for the CS-RV nonthoracotomy system (15.6 +/- 7.2 versus 20.0 +/- 11.5 J, p = 0.11). Biphasic waveform defibrillation proved more efficacious than monophasic waveform defibrillation in 13 of 20 patients (65%) with RV-LV epicardial patches, 10 of 15 patients (67%) with an RV-CP nonthoracotomy system, and nine of 16 patients (56%) with an RV-CS nonthoracotomy system. CONCLUSIONS. Biphasic pulsing was useful with nonthoracotomy lead systems as well as with epicardial lead systems. However, the degree of biphasic waveform defibrillation superiority appeared to be electrode system dependent. Furthermore, for a few individuals, biphasic waveform defibrillation proved less efficient than monophasic waveform defibrillation, regardless of the lead system used. 
Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection in Zimbabwe. We studied the clinical features and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology of 32 consecutive adults with inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (IDP) admitted to the teaching hospitals in Harare, Zimbabwe. Twenty-nine of the IDP patients had Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and the other three had chronic IDP. Sixteen of 29 (55%) GBS patients were HIV-seropositive, a higher frequency of HIV infection than in blood donors drawn from the population served by these hospitals. All three chronic IDP patients were HIV-seronegative. In all HIV-seropositive patients, GBS was the initial illness that brought the patient to medical attention and led to the diagnosis of HIV infection. Compared with seronegative patients, the HIV-seropositive GBS patients were more likely to have generalized lymphadenopathy, CSF pleocytosis, coexistent CNS disturbance, and prior sexually transmitted disease. GBS in this region of Africa is frequently associated with HIV infection. 
Composition of atherosclerotic plaques in the four major epicardial coronary arteries in patients greater than or equal to 90 years of age. The composition of atherosclerotic plaques in 733 five-mm segments of the 4 major (left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex and right) epicardial coronary arteries of 18 patients greater than or equal to 90 years of age was determined by computerized planimetric analysis. By analysis of all coronary segments of all patients greater than 90, the plaques consisted primarily of fibrous tissue (87 +/- 8%) with calcific deposits (7 +/- 6%), pultaceous debris (5 +/- 4%) and foam cells (1 +/- 1%) occupying a much smaller percentage of plaque area. Analysis of composition according to the 4 degrees of luminal cross-sectional area narrowing revealed marked step-wise increases in pultaceous debris (from 0 +/- 0% at 0 to 25% narrowing to 18 +/- 22% at 76 to 100% narrowing, p = 0.0001) and calcific deposits (from 0 +/- 0 to 10 +/- 15%, p = 0.002), and decreases in fibrous tissue (from 99 +/- 3 to 71 +/- 23%, p = 0.0001) and area occupied by the media (from 35 +/- 8 to 16 +/- 8%, p = 0.0001). When the analysis was restricted to sections narrowed greater than 75%, no significant differences were found in plaque components or medial area between patients with (11 patients) and without (7 patients) myocardial infarcts at necropsy. 
Mortality among petrochemical science and engineering employees. This is a study of a dynamic cohort of 13 250 commercial research and development personnel for whom information on occupational and educational background and smoking was available. Their age-, sex-, race-, and period-adjusted death rates were compared with New Jersey rates and with an internal comparison population. The overall results were favorable. The study groups had significantly fewer deaths from most major disease categories compared with other New Jersey residents. Among white male scientists and engineers, age-adjusted overall mortality and ischemic heart disease mortality were comparable to white male managers and support staff studied, whereas mortality from leukemia and lymphatic cancer was significantly elevated. Mechanics, however, had a significantly lower leukemia and lymphatic cancer mortality rate than did the comparison group. In a Poisson regression model in which white males and females from the study population were used, and for which the effects of age, smoking, college education category, period of hire, and years employed were controlled, scientists, engineers, and research technicians had elevated (nonsignificantly) mortality rates for leukemia and lymphatic cancer compared with managers and support staff. Smoking was an independent risk factor for leukemia and lymphatic cancer. Further work is needed to assess if specific environmental factors, such as benzene, other aromatics, radiation, medical treatment, and smoking habits, might have contributed to the above findings. 
Extracolonic manifestations of the familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes. The classic prototypes of the gastrointestinal polyposis syndromes are familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome. Extracolonic manifestations have been described in both diseases, and the distinction between them has become less clear. In fact, some authorities have suggested that familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome may represent a spectrum of the same disease. In both conditions, extracolonic expressions are the rule rather than the exception, and familiarity with them is essential for accurate diagnosis and correct patient management. In this pictorial essay, we discuss familial polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome together under the heading familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes. The colonic characteristics of these syndromes will be reviewed briefly, followed by examples of the most common extracolonic manifestations. 
Electrophysiological improvement following decompression surgery in tarsal tunnel syndrome. Plantar nerve conduction studies 14 months to 3.5 years after decompression surgery in 3 cases of tarsal tunnel syndrome showed an improvement in motor conduction as well as in sensory nerve conduction. This electrophysiological improvement was associated with clinical improvement. However, minor abnormalities still existed in sensory nerve conduction in all 3 cases. 
SWIFT trial of delayed elective intervention v conservative treatment after thrombolysis with anistreplase in acute myocardial infarction. SWIFT (Should We Intervene Following Thrombolysis?) Trial Study Group. OBJECTIVE--To see whether early elective angiography with a view to coronary angioplasty or bypass grafting of a stenosed infarct related vessel would improve outcome in acute myocardial infarction treated by thrombolysis with anistreplase. DESIGN--Randomised study of two treatment strategies with analysis of results over 12 months. SETTING--21 district hospitals and regional cardiac centres in Britain and Ireland. SUBJECTS--800 of 993 patients presenting with clinical and electrocardiographic features of acute myocardial infarction up to three hours after the onset of major symptoms. TREATMENT STRATEGIES--Intravenous anistreplase 30 units followed by a standard regimen of heparin, warfarin, and timolol and (in patients so randomised) early angiography plus appropriate intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death or reinfarction within 12 months. RESULTS--397 patients were randomised to receive early angiography plus appropriate intervention (coronary angioplasty in 169 cases, coronary grafting in 59) and 403 patients to receive conservative care (of these, 12 had angioplasty and seven bypass grafting during the initial admission). By 12 months mortality (5.8% (23 patients) in the intervention group v 5.0% (20) in the conservative care group; p = 0.6) and rates of reinfarction (15.1% (60 patients) v 12.9% (52); p = 0.4) were similar in the two groups. No significant differences in rates of angina or rest pain were found at 12 months. Left ventricular ejection fraction at three and 12 months was the same in both groups. Median hospital stay was longer in the intervention group (11 days v 10 days; p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSION--For most patients given thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction a strategy of angiography and intervention is appropriate only when required for clinical indications. 
Calcium for resuscitation? Calcium ions are essential for myocardial excitation-contraction coupling and for increasing contractility of the heart. Because of these physiological effects, use of calcium has been recommended in the treatment of electromechanical dissociation, asystole and ventricular fibrillation. Recently, however, the use of calcium during cardiac arrest has come into dispute, as there are no controlled clinical trials supporting a favourable haemodynamic effect. It has rather been suggested that, in resuscitation, calcium may have detrimental effects. In order to evaluate the role of calcium in cardiopulmonary resuscitation, it is important to know the serum concentrations of calcium and the haemodynamic effects in this situation. Measurements in some patients with cardiac arrest have demonstrated that severe hypocalcaemia may not be uncommon. In these patients, calcium may augment myocardial contractility, decrease intracardiac filling pressures and increase mean arterial pressure. At present, the more or less established indications for use of calcium during cardiopulmonary resuscitation are in treating patients with proven hypocalcaemia, hyperkalaemia, calcium channel blocker overdose and, possibly, electromechanical dissociation combined with a wide QRS complex. There is no good evidence supporting the routine use of calcium in resuscitation. 
Natural course of Graves' disease after subtotal thyroidectomy and management of patients with postoperative thyroid dysfunction. The Natural course of Graves' disease after subtotal thyroidectomy was studied in 67 patients who had subtotal thyroidectomy for Graves' disease and did not receive any medical treatment for 8 to 12 years after surgery. Postoperative thyroid status was determined by serum free thyroxine (T4), free triiodothyronine (T3), and thyrotropin (TSH) levels in the first period (1 year after surgery), second period (3.9 +/- 1.0 years), and third period (8.8 +/- 1.5 years). Serum thyroid stimulating antibody (TSAb) and TSH binding inhibitor immunoglobulin (TBII) activities were also measured. A total of 53 patients (79%) changed thyroid status during the observation period. One year after surgery, 50 percent of euthyroid subjects developed abnormal thyroid function in the next period. Reversible latent hypothyroidism was the most common type of thyroid dysfunction seen in up to 46% of patients. Interestingly, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism that developed in the postoperative period were temporary disorders in most cases. Serum TSAb and TBII activities did not help predict the postoperative changes of thyroid status. Our study indicates that the instability of the thyroid function is common after subtotal thyroidectomy. 
Plasma prostanoids in neonates with pulmonary hypertension treated with conventional therapy and with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Thromboxane may be a mediator of pulmonary hypertension in the neonate. Acute thromboxane-mediated pulmonary hypertension has been described in sheep receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which raises concerns about a potential thromboxane-mediated exacerbation of pulmonary hypertension in human neonates with severe pulmonary hypertension who are treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We measured plasma levels of thromboxane, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in infants with pulmonary hypertension, some of whom were treated medically and some of whom were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Plasma levels of all three prostanoids were elevated in infants with pulmonary hypertension and decreased with time, whether the neonates were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or with medical management alone. In infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, we collected samples simultaneously from preoxygenator sites, postoxygenator sites, and umbilical artery catheter. We could demonstrate no significant difference in plasma prostanoid levels across the oxygenator. In two patients, plasma thromboxane and prostaglandin F2 alpha levels measured shortly after a platelet transfusion were distinctly higher in the umbilical artery catheter than in venous samples. 
Median and ulnar neuropathy after streptokinase infusion. In a patient treated with intravenous streptokinase, inflammation developed at the infusion site followed by permanent ulnar and median neuropathy. Although adverse streptokinase infusion site reactions have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration, no other cases have been reported in the medical literature. We suggest that extravasated streptokinase may produce permanent ulnar and median neuropathy. 
Ki-1-positive large cell lymphomas, a heterogenous group of neoplasms. Morphologic, immunophenotypic, genotypic, and clinical features of 24 cases. Clinical and pathologic features of 24 patients with large cell lymphomas that expressed the activation antigen Ki-1 are described. Phenotypic and/or genotypic studies characterized these neoplasms as T-cell (16 cases), B-cell (six cases), or null cell (two cases) type. Males predominantly were affected. Age of patients ranged from 19 to 73 years, with a bimodal distribution, with peaks in the third and seventh decades. Lymphadenopathy was present in nearly all patients. Extranodal involvement, including skin, soft tissue, bone, central nervous system, lung, or small intestine was observed in a total of 54% of the patients, either at presentation or during the course of disease. "Prototypic" features of large cell anaplastic lymphomas were observed for eight T-cell lymphomas, with morphologic heterogeneity noted for the remainder. Eight patients, all with T-cell neoplasms (only one with prototypic morphology), have died of lymphoma (median survival, 5 months). An antecedent history of a lymphoproliferative disorder (mycosis fungoides, B-cell lymphoma, immunoblastic lymphadenopathy) was apparent in seven patients. An 8-year history of Crohn's disease occurred in one patient with a T-cell lymphoma involving small intestine. Phenotypically, loss of one or more markers was typically noted for T-cell neoplasms. Leukocyte common antigen was detected in all cases, although partial loss of immunoreactivity was noticed in some cases. Nearly all cases evaluated for Ia antigen or alpha-1-antichymotrysin were reactive. Eleven of 16 T-cell, two of six B-cell, and two null cell lymphomas expressed epithelial membrane antigen. Ki-1-positive large cell lymphomas are characterized by clinical, morphologic, and immunophenotypic heterogeneity. 
Isoflurane anesthesia and myocardial ischemia: comparative risk versus sufentanil anesthesia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The SPI (Study of Perioperative Ischemia) Research Group. Whether isoflurane has the potential to produce coronary artery steal and associated myocardial ischemia is still controversial. Previous studies addressing this issue in humans did not purposefully control hemodynamics or use continuous measures of myocardial ischemia. The authors used transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and continuous Holter electrocardiography (ECG) to study the relative risk of myocardial ischemia during isoflurane or sufentanil anesthesia under strict control of hemodynamics in 186 high-risk patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Overall, hemodynamics were well controlled (increased heart rate = 9.8%; increased systolic blood pressure = 7.1%; decreased systolic blood pressure = 10.8% of total prebypass time compared with preoperative baseline values), with no difference between the two anesthetics. In the 162 patients with interpretable TEE recordings, moderate to severe TEE ischemic episodes (grade change greater than or equal to 2) developed in 33 (21%) during the prebypass period, with no difference between isoflurane (12 of 56 = 21%) and sufentanil (21 of 106 = 20%) (P = 0.97). The duration and severity of TEE episodes were not significantly different between the two groups. No correlation was observed between TEE ischemic episodes and isoflurane concentrations (range 0.47-1.75%). In the 181 patients with interpretable ECG recordings, ECG evidence of ischemia developed in 34 (19%) during the prebypass period, with no difference between isoflurane (12 of 59 = 20%) and sufentanil (22 of 122 = 18%) (P = 0.87). The duration and severity of electrocardiographic ischemic episodes were also similar in patients receiving either isoflurane or sufentanil. Four of the 62 patients (6%) who received isoflurane had an adverse cardiac outcome versus 15 of 124 patients (12%) who received sufentanil (P = 0.34). The authors' findings demonstrate that, when hemodynamics are controlled, the incidence of myocardial ischemia (TEE or ECG) during isoflurane and sufentanil anesthesia is similar. 
Multisystem failure and hepatic microvesicular fatty metamorphosis associated with tolmetin ingestion. Multisystem toxicity including both renal and hepatic failure has been reported with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We report a fatal case of multisystem failure associated with tolmetin ingestion in a 15-year-old girl. Microvesicular fatty change was found in the liver at autopsy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated multisystem failure to have this histopathologic finding. 
Effect of antitumor surgery on soluble interleukin-2 receptor serum levels. Surgically induced immunosuppression may play a role in cancer, because of the possible existence of micrometastases at the time of surgical removal of tumors. Antitumor immune reactions are mediated by interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 acts on a specific IL-2 cell surface receptor; moreover, a soluble form of IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) can be released in the blood. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of surgery on sIL-2R serum levels in patients with operable solid tumors. A total of 48 patients with cancer and 11 controls who underwent major surgery for non-neoplastic disease were evaluated before and 7 days after surgery. Serum mean levels of sIL-2R were significantly higher after than before surgery in both the cancer and control groups. No correlation was seen between surgery-induced changes in sIL-2R and in T lymphocyte subsets. Because of its capacity of binding to IL-2, the increased blood concentrations of sIL-2R could reduce the IL-2 availability and negatively affect antitumor immune reactions. 
Computed tomography for patient management in coronary artery disease. Computed tomography (CT) represents the optimum theoretical approach to x-ray imaging. This conclusion results from an awareness of CT's capacity to solve the fundamental limitation of all forms of x-ray imaging--the superimposition of anatomic structures. Because CT is potentially a fully three-dimensional method, this problem is addressed in a manner not subject to the risks, complications, and technical limitations of selective angiography, subtraction angiography, tomography, and other techniques. Ultrafast CT provides a broad spectrum of useful quantitative cardiac data during one minimally invasive procedure. Therefore, the optimism for cine CT imaging of the heart is well founded. Apart from the demonstration of anatomic structures in any reconstructed plane and in movie format, without the need for any form of electrocardiographic gating, this new generation of millisecond CT scanners offers a unique potential for measuring myocardial mechanics and perfusion. Myocardial integrity can be evaluated by measuring myocardial wall thickening, which is a sensitive indicator of blood flow. It can also be assessed by time-density changes derived from analyzing the passage of contrast medium through thin slices of myocardium. Feasibility studies have demonstrated that this should be possible in the clinical setting by use of fast CT scanning. The radiation exposure to the patient with cine CT is low and comparable to, or less than, that of conventional CT and 10-15% of that received during angiocardiography; therefore, it is not a practical limitation. Further clinical and research studies are needed to determine the future role of this exciting new modality in the diagnosis and management of patients with heart disease. 
Propranolol in the management of recurrent migraine: a meta-analytic review. We used meta-analytic statistical techniques to synthesize findings from studies that evaluated propranolol HCI for the prevention of recurrent migraine (2,403 treated patients). The modal migraine sufferer treated in these studies was a female, about 37 years of age, who suffered from common (rather than classical) migraines and reported a 17-year history of problem migraines. The modal treatment was 160 mg. propranolol per day. Meta-analysis revealed that, on average, propranolol yielded a 44% reduction in migraine activity when daily headache recordings were used to assess treatment outcome, and a 65% reduction in migraine activity when less conservative measures (e.g., clinical ratings of improvement, global patient reports) were used. Meta-analysis thus revealed substantial support for short-term effectiveness of propranolol. However, little information was available concerning the long-term effectiveness of propranolol. 
Large vessel vasculitis of the central nervous system in systemic lupus erythematosus: report and review of the literature. Large vessel vasculitis rarely involves the central nervous system in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe an exemplary case, along with its dramatic cerebral angiogram, and review the literature on this unusual entity. 
Squamous cell carcinoma occurring in the wall of a chronic aspergilloma. An aspergilloma that occurred within an area of bronchiectasis in a 52 year old man persisted for 12 years despite medical and surgical treatment. A squamous cell carcinoma developed in the wall of the cavity. 
DNA ploidy patterns of tumors diagnosed as metachronous or recurrent lung cancers. The relationship between the first tumor and the second tumor resected in 8 patients with non-small cell lung cancer was analyzed using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) flow cytometry. Of the 8 patients, 6 were clinically diagnosed as having metachronous lung cancers and 2, local recurrent tumors. The mean interval between operations in patients with metachronous lung cancers was 62 months (range, 15 to 128 months). Both tumors showed the same histology in 4 patients and a different histology in 2. In the 2 patients with local recurrent tumors, the interval between operations was 9 months and 39 months. In the analysis of DNA flow cytometry of the first and second tumors in the same patient, the tumors were defined as independent of each other when one tumor showed diploidy and the other, aneuploidy, or when each DNA index of abnormal clones between two aneuploid tumors was different. When both tumors showed diploidy or when at least one DNA index of abnormal clones between two aneuploid tumors was identical, the tumors were defined to be related to each other. According to these criteria, in 5 (83%) of the 6 patients clinically diagnosed as having metachronous lung cancers, the second tumor was classified as independent of the first tumor. On the other hand, in the 2 patients clinically diagnosed as having recurrent tumors, the second tumor was judged to be related to the first tumor. These data suggest that DNA flow cytometric analysis of tumors may be of value in the diagnosis of metachronous lung cancers. 
Intravenous nitroglycerine in the management of posttreatment hypertension during electroconvulsive therapy. Intravenous nitroglycerine is not described in the psychiatric literature for management of the inevitable and potentially dangerous pressor response encountered in electroconvulsive treatment. However, the anesthesia literature has documented the use of nitroglycerine for the management of similar catecholamine-based hypertension. Unlike other approaches, nitroglycerine creates a controlled, significant, brief vasodilatation after convulsive treatment accompanied by desirable coronary vasodilatation without increased cardiac stress. A review of a series of treatments in which this technique was used confirms the clinical efficacy and safety of this approach. 
Raised exercise diastolic blood pressure as indicator of ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction. 91 (16.8%) of 541 consecutive patients investigated for chest pain or after recent uncomplicated myocardial infarction had a rise in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of more than 15 mm Hg during a symptom-limited treadmill test. 63 also had electrocardiographic evidence of ischaemia, but 28 did not have 1 mm ST segment depression, of whom 24 had angiographic evidence of more than 70% stenosis of two or more major coronary arteries. 55 of these 91 patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery; repeat angiography in 22 at 12 months showed an improved left ventricular ejection fraction in 18 who had a normal postoperative DBP response, but no change in ejection fraction in the 4 who still had an abnormal rise in DBP on exercise. Exercise-induced ischaemia may cause a reversible fall in cardiac output that sometimes leads to reflex vasoconstriction and a rise in DBP before a fall in systolic blood pressure or ECG evidence of ST segment depression. An abnormal DBP response to exercise may identify some patients at high risk of myocardial infarction who might otherwise have false-negative exercise tests. 
The lack of relationship between hepatotoxicity and lithocholic-acid sulfation in biliary bile acids during chenodiol therapy in the National Cooperative Gallstone Study. To test whether hepatotoxicity occurring in National Cooperative Gallstone Study patients was caused by a toxic effect of chenodiol per se or of lithocholate caused by defective sulfation, bile samples were analyzed using a new high-performance liquid chromatography method that measures the proportions of the four individual lithocholate amidates (sulfated and unsulfated lithocholylglycine and lithocholyltaurine) and all common bile acid amidates. Samples were obtained from National Cooperative Gallstone Study patients (n = 17) with abnormal light microscopic liver biopsy results or major aminotransferase elevations and from a matched control group of patients (n = 14) who received similar chenodiol doses but had no evidence of liver injury. Bile samples from 45 healthy subjects were also analyzed. The analytical method was validated by showing that the percentage of chenodiol and cholic and deoxycholic acid obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography correlated highly (r greater than 0.94) with previous gas-liquid chromatography analyses of these samples by the National Cooperative Gallstone Study Reference Laboratory. No significant differences were seen between gallstone patients with and without evidence of liver injury for percent total lithocholate amidates, percent sulfated or unsulfated lithocholate amidates or percent chenodiol amidates. Lithocholate was partially sulfated in all bile samples (52% +/- 17% [mean +/- S.D., n = 50]), but the extent of sulfation varied widely between and within patients during the course of therapy. Mean values of healthy subjects were similar and also showed a wide range in the extent of lithocholate sulfation. It is concluded that (a) liver injury caused by these doses of chenodiol could not be attributed to the accumulation of unsulfated lithocholate per se in circulating bile acids; (b) liver injury appeared to be, directly or indirectly, caused by enrichment in circulating bile acids with chenodiol or chenodiol together with lithocholate, suggesting that the hepatocytes of those patients with hepatotoxicity were injured by the change induced in bile-acid metabolism by the feeding of chenodiol; and (c) about half of lithocholate amidates in bile samples were sulfated, but the extent of sulfation was highly variable both in gallstone patients and healthy subjects. 
Effects of rigidity of an internal fixation device. A comprehensive biomechanical investigation. Internal fixation with instrumentation often accompanies surgical fusion to augment spinal stability, provide temporary fixation while the surgical fusion mass unites, and enhance postoperative mobilization of a patient. Some surgeons, however, feel that the existing plate-screw designs are too rigid and are the primary cause of "iatrogenic" adverse effects clinically observed. A three-part study, involving in vitro experimental protocol, analytical finite-element-based models, and an in vivo canine investigation, was undertaken to study the role of decreasing rigidity of a device on the biomechanical response of the stabilized segments. Two alternatives--the use of one variable screw placement (Steffee plate [unilateral, 1VSP model]) as opposed to two VSP plates (bilateral, 2VSP model) and two VSP plates with polymer washers placed in between the integral nut and plate (2MVSP model)--were considered for achieving a reduction in the rigidity of the conventional VSP system. The load-displacement data obtained from the in vitro experiments and the stress distributions within the stabilized and intact models predicted by the finite-element models revealed that the unilateral VSP system is less rigid and is likely to reduce stress shielding of the vertebral bodies compared with the 2VSP model. The undesirable effects associated with the use of the 1VSP plate system are the presence of coupled motions due to the inherent asymmetry and the likely inability to provide enough rigidity for decompression procedures requiring a complete excision of the disc. The use of two MVSP plates overcomes these deficiencies. 
Natural history of acquired renal cystic disease in dialysis patients: a prospective longitudinal CT study. Patients with end-stage kidney disease, particularly those treated with dialysis, develop proliferative processes in their native kidneys that result in the formation of multiple acquired renal cysts, renal adenomas, and carcinomas. Data about these abnormalities have been acquired mainly from retrospective studies. We undertook a longitudinal prospective study in which the native kidneys of 30 dialysis patients were surveyed by serial CT during a 7-year period to study the natural history of acquired renal cystic disease and the frequency of associated complications. Acquired cysts were seen in 87% of patients at the end of the study compared with 57% at the study's onset, and a significant increase was seen in mean renal volume with time. Five patients (17%) developed large hemorrhagic renal cysts and four (13%) developed large perinephric hematomas. Renal cell carcinomas developed in two patients (7%) without renal symptoms. One carcinoma invaded the renal capsule, but did not cause metastases. The other carcinoma was widely metastatic. Our findings are consistent with those of earlier studies documenting an increased prevalence of renal cell carcinoma in dialysis patients as compared with the general population. However, our conclusions are limited because the study sample is small and no control population was studied. We conclude that acquired renal cystic disease in dialysis patients is a progressive disorder often associated with cyst hemorrhage. Dialysis patients may also have an increased prevalence of renal cell carcinoma. 
Long-term nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use and Helicobacter pylori infection. This study investigates whether patients who take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are more likely to have Helicobacter pylori gastritis than age-matched individuals who do not take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and whether patients who take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs who are also infected with H. pylori are more likely to have dyspepsia, mucosal damage, or ulcers than those who are not infected. Two studies were performed, one serological and the other endoscopic, both in arthritis patients receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs chronically. The presence of H. pylori was identified with a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. One hundred eighty-three patients participated in the serological study and 75 patients in the endoscopic study. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased with age, independent of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use; the age-adjusted frequency of H. pylori infection in arthritis patients paralleled that of 351 asymptomatic individuals without arthritis. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased from 30.7% in age group 21-30 years to 73.4% in age group 61-75 years. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced mucosal injury, either hemorrhages or erosions, was more frequent in those without H. pylori infection than with infection (61% vs. 32% for hemorrhages and 57% vs. 34% for erosions for those without and with H. pylori infection; only the difference in the frequency of hemorrhages was significant, P less than 0.05). No difference was observed in the presence of dyspeptic symptoms between those with and without H. pylori infection. These data suggest that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced damage to the gastroduodenal mucosa does not increase the susceptibility to H. pylori infection. 
Prominent meningeal "tail sign" in a patient with a metastatic tumor. A prominent enhancement of the dura adjacent to meningiomas has been described as being pathognomonic of these tumors. We describe a case where a classic meningeal "tail sign" was associated with an extra-axial metastatic tumor attached to the tentorium. There was no tumor invasion of the dura. We conclude that this sign is nonspecific and can be seen with dural-based tumors other than meningiomas. 
Enhanced detection of intracardiac sources of cerebral emboli by transesophageal echocardiography. We performed transesophageal echocardiography in 50 consecutive hospitalized patients with recent transient ischemic attack or stroke of embolic origin to determine whether transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography in detection of possible intracardiac sources of embolism. Twenty-six of 50 patients with a negative transthoracic echocardiogram for potential source of emboli had a transesophageal echocardiography study that demonstrated at least one intracardiac abnormality. Abnormalities noted by transesophageal echocardiography included five of 50 patients with either a left atrial or left atrial appendage clot, four patients with a patent foramen ovale, and nine patients with spontaneous echocardiographic contrast. In 11 of 50 patients with no other source of embolism, we found highly mobile filamentous strands on the mitral valve, which have not been described previously. These mitral valve echo strands may represent a fissured surface or fibrosis that can serve as a nidus for thrombus formation. We detected no unexpected left ventricular thrombus or left atrial myxoma. Factors significantly associated with a greater likelihood of a positive transesophageal echocardiography study included left atrial enlargement, atrial fibrillation, and a calcified or thickened mitral valve. Our study suggests that transesophageal echocardiography is a valuable addition to transthoracic echocardiography in investigating potential intracardiac sources of embolism. 
Incidental microvesicular steatosis due to valproic acid anticonvulsant therapy. Valproic acid has been implicated in at least 100 cases of fatal acute liver failure. Most cases have occurred in patients less than 10 yr old; however, at least seven have involved adults. Microvesicular steatosis has been uniformly observed, but its incidence in less severe liver disease and in asymptomatic patients receiving valproate is unknown. We report two patients receiving maintenance valproate, one with resolving acute hepatitis C and the other with chronic persistent hepatitis C, with incidental microvesicular steatosis demonstrated on oil-red O stains. We conclude that microvesicular steatosis does not necessarily signify hepatotoxicity in patients on chronic valproic acid, and should not lead to discontinuation of the drug until other causes of acute or chronic liver disease have been excluded. 
Safety and efficacy of alfentanil and halothane in paediatric surgical patients. Alfentanil, a congener of the opioid fentanyl, possesses properties that make it an attractive choice for use during short operative procedures. Since the pharmacodynamic aspects of alfentanil have not been well documented in children, this study was undertaken to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and dose requirements of alfentanil when used with nitrous oxide or halothane in paediatric patients. Eighty unpremedicated patients, ASA physical status I or II and aged 2-12 yr were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. After induction of anaesthesia with nitrous oxide, oxygen, and halothane, the groups were treated as follows. In Group 1 (n = 19), after halothane was discontinued, alfentanil 50 micrograms.kg-1 was infused over 30 sec. In Group 2 (n = 20), the end-tidal halothan was maintained at 0.5% and alfentanil 25 micrograms.kg-1 was infused. In Group 3 (n = 20), the end-tidal halothane concentration was maintained at 1% and alfentanil 12.5 micrograms.kg-1 was infused. In Group 4 (n = 21), the end-tidal halothane concentration was maintained at 1.5% and no alfentanil was administered. Patients in Groups 1, 2, and 3 received bolus doses of alfentanil 12.5 micrograms.kg-1 as needed to maintain haemodynamic stability. After alfentanil administration, there were transient decreases in systolic blood pressure in Groups 1 and 2, and in heart rate in Group 2. With surgical stimulation, haemodynamic stability was well maintained except in patients in Group 1, who had an increase in systolic blood pressure. Children Group 1 were alert sooner and their tracheas were extubated earlier than those in Groups 2, 3, and 4. 
Effect of propofol on the incidence of postoperative vomiting after strabismus surgery in pediatric outpatients. Vomiting is a common problem after strabismus surgery in pediatric outpatients. We compared the effects of propofol with and without N2O and droperidol to the effects of a conventional regimen consisting of halothane-N2O-droperidol on the recovery characteristics and the incidence of postoperative emesis after strabismus surgery in 120 ASA physical status 1 or 2 children. After induction of anesthesia with halothane-N2O, patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. Group A (control) received halothane, 66% N2O, and droperidol 75 micrograms.kg-1; group B, propofol 2 mg.kg-1 bolus followed by infusion of 160 microgram.kg-1.min-1; group C, propofol (as in group B) and 66% N2O; and group D, propofol (as in group B), 66% N2O (as in group C), and droperidol 75 micrograms.kg-1. Patients in group B had more episodes of intraoperative oculocardiac reflex responses than patients in group A, but had shorter times to extubation, oral intake, ambulation, and discharge, as well as a lower incidence of postoperative emesis (P less than 0.05). The addition of N2O to the propofol anesthetic regimen (group C) was associated with an increased incidence of emesis (P less than 0.05), whereas the addition of droperidol to the propofol-N2O regimen (group D) did not affect the incidence of emesis compared to the other three groups. We conclude that maintenance of anesthesia with a total intravenous regimen using propofol results in a more rapid recovery and less postoperative emesis than with a halothane-N2O-droperidol regimen. 
Choledocholithiasis. Endoscopic sphincterotomy or common bile duct exploration. A prospective randomized trial was conducted of preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy and surgery (ES&S) or surgery alone (SA) in 52 patients with cholecystolithiasis and choledocholithiasis that were candidates for elective surgery. After ES&S 65% of patients were stone free. Eighty-eight per cent of patients with SA were stone free after surgery (p less than 0.05). Three patients in each group had residual stones at the completion of the operation. Five of these six had more than 20 common bile duct (CBD) stones. There was one episode of major hemorrhage in a patient in each group and no deaths. Costs were essentially equal for the individual patient with a successful ES as compared to SA. Societal costs of a program of preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and ES would be higher because of the cost of screening for patients with CBD stones. These results do not support preoperative ES as a technique for clearance of the CBD of stones on the basis of efficacy, morbidity rate, or cost. 
Inoperable recurrence after breast-conserving surgical treatment and radiotherapy. Factors associated with inoperable local recurrence were investigated by a clinical and pathologic review of 596 patients with Stages I and II carcinoma of the breast treated by breast-conserving operations and megavoltage radiotherapy. After a median follow-up period of 71 months, 13 of 70 local recurrences observed were anatomically unsuitable for salvage surgical treatment, affecting 2.2 per cent of patients initially treated. In most, inoperable recurrences clinically resembled primary inflammatory carcinoma of the breast. All inoperable failures occurred in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma and were associated with the presence of unfavorable prognostic features (positive nodes, histologic grade 3, negative estrogen receptor, vascular invasion and lymphocytic stromal reaction). Despite doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, prognosis after inoperable recurrence was quite poor, although survival time in excess of two years was seen in receptor positive, lower grade recurrent tumors in which treatment included hormone therapy. 
Exophytic signet-ring cell carcinoma of the colorectum Previous studies have assessed colorectal signet-ring cell carcinomas of the linitis plastica variant but not of the exophytic subtype. We retrospectively reviewed 20 cases of colorectal signet-ring cell carcinoma of the exophytic subtype (greater than 50% signet-ring cells). The patients ranged in age from 14 to 79 years (mean, 51.8 years); 10 were male; 17 were white; and three were black. Ten tumors were colonic (eight, right sided; two, left sided) and 10 were rectal; seven were stage B and 12 were stage C. One patient presented with distant metastases. Eleven of 16 tumors assessed by flow cytometry were diploid. Parenchymal hepatic metastases developed in only two patients. The overall 5-year survival rate was 36%, and matched cases did not vary significantly in survival from typical nonmucinous adenocarcinomas. There was a trend toward poorer survival for patients with advanced-stage tumor. Survival was not affected by primary site, ploidy, presence of vascular/lymphatic invasion or residual adenoma, or percentage of extracellular mucin or signet-ring cells. Our cases were somewhat lower stage than literature cases of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lintis plastica variant. 
The relationship between MMPI cluster membership and diagnostic category in headache patients. Only one study has examined MMPI cluster profiles in the headache population. The present study expanded on this previous investigation by using a large sample size (N = 485) and a greater number of diagnostic categories. The five MMPI clusters replicated previous findings in the chronic pain literature. These MMPI cluster groups were compared to 5 diagnostic categories (migraine, cluster, post-trauma, tension, mixed). No relationship was found between cluster type and headache diagnosis. While the diagnostic groups were found to differ on measures of pain severity, sex and age, cluster groups did not. It is proposed that MMPI scale types reflect a patient's response to pain and are more likely to be the result of coping resources than headache-related personality style. Future research with additional, non-pain populations and prospective studies is suggested. 
Skin acceptance of transcutaneous nitroglycerin patches: a prospective study of 33 patients. Transdermal nitroglycerin is commonly used and may induce contact dermatitis. The frequency of adverse skin reactions is controversial and may vary from 10% to 75%, according to various authors. 33 patients using transdermal nitroglycerin for more than 7 days were examined and patch tested (nitroglycerin 0.5% aq., 2% pet. and TTS in toto). 5 patients (15%) had adverse reactions. The patch tests were all negative in the 33 patients. Contact dermatitis occurs in many cases, about 15% of the cases with the newly available TTS, and even if patients respect the conditions for using TTS. These contact dermatitides are mainly irritant reactions and do not require transdermal nitroglycerin treatment to be stopped. Nevertheless, since some cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been reported, a contact dermatitis from transdermal nitroglycerin should lead to patch testing. 
Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia of superior vena cava: a rare cause of the superior vena cava syndrome. The superior vena cava syndrome associated with an intraluminal vascular proliferative lesion is extremely rare. A case of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia of the superior vena cava causing obstructive symptoms is reported that was successfully managed by surgical excision. 
Pancytopenia associated with hypothermia. This is the first report of pancytopenia associated with moderate hypothermia occurring in an elderly patient, where no other etiologic or associated factors could account for the hematologic abnormalities found. Reversible pancytopenia should be added to the list of hematologic abnormalities that can be seen in patients with hypothermia. 
The decline of mortality due to stroke: a competitive and deterministic perspective. Although stroke mortality has been declining since the first part of this century, the rate of decline increased sharply during the early 1970s. The basis for the fall in stroke mortality is often attributed to effective management of risk factors, particularly hypertension. However, some investigators have questioned whether risk factor reduction alone can adequately account for the magnitude of the recent decline in stroke mortality. When viewed from the perspective of competitive and deterministic mortality dynamics, the major force decreasing stroke mortality is the decreasing deterministic competitiveness of stroke and the increasing deterministic competitiveness of various malignant neoplasms and degenerative diseases as causes of mortality. These reciprocal trends are a natural consequence of the competitive deterministic mortality dynamics which describe these diseases in an environment that is becoming more conducive to human survival. The competitive nature of human mortality makes drawing etiopathogenic conclusions based upon single disease mortality data hazardous. 
Clinical course of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in children Previous studies in adults with dilated cardiomyopathy suggest that the presence of arrhythmia, especially ventricular tachycardia, correlates with increased mortality. We performed a retrospective analysis of 63 children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to determine the prognostic significance of arrhythmias and other findings with respect to mortality. The mean age at diagnosis of the cardiomyopathy was 4.96 +/- 5.3 years. The overall mortality rate was 16% over a 10 year follow-up period. Persistent congestive heart failure and ST-T wave changes correlated with increased mortality (p less than 0.05). No other variables affected outcome. Arrhythmias were found in 46% of the patients; of the arrhythmias, 48% were atrial arrhythmias. Ventricular tachycardia was present in six patients. Death occurred in 4 (14%) of 29 patients with known arrhythmia; 1 of the 5 died suddenly. The remaining 6 deaths in the series occurred in the 34 patients without a documented arrhythmia. It is concluded that 1) arrhythmias are frequently seen in children with dilated cardiomyopathy but are not predictive of outcome; 2) sudden death in children with this disease is rare; and 3) persistent congestive heart failure portends a poor prognosis. 
Bleeding complications following initiation of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction: a comparison of helicopter-transported and nontransported patients. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of helicopter transport of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients after initiation of thrombolysis on bleeding complications through hospital discharge. DESIGN: Prospectively identified incidence (cohort) study. SETTING: Air medical service of tertiary-care teaching hospital. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-five consecutive AMI patients transported within 12 hours of the initiation of thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator were compared with 119 nontransported AMI patients treated in a similar manner. RESULTS: The transported and nontransported populations were similar with regard to age, sex, and infarct location. Transport was well tolerated with no episodes of cardiac arrest or cardioversion occurring during transport. Hypotension requiring fluids or increased pressors occurred in 18 patients. Bleeding complications of all types occurred in 43.2% of the transported and 49.6% of the nontransported patients, respectively (relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.17). CONCLUSION: Helicopter transport of AMI patients after initiation of thrombolysis appears to be safe acutely and without a clinically significant increase in risk of bleeding complications through hospital discharge when accomplished by a highly skilled team. 
Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection and central nervous system involvement in a patient with relapsing polychondritis. Infections caused by Strongyloides stercoralis are not uncommon in the United States. Because of the many different manifestations of hyperinfection with this nematode, a high index of suspicion is essential, especially in immunocompromised patients, for whom such infections are frequently fatal. Patients originating from endemic areas and those who have traveled to such areas, even in the distant past, should have the possibility of strongyloidiasis evaluated before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. Once considered, the diagnosis is not difficult and can be accomplished using readily available techniques and methods. Although thiabendazole has a high incidence of side effects and may not always eradicate infection, it remains the drug of choice for disseminated strongyloidiasis. 
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian arteries: long-term results in 52 patients. We studied the long-term results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian artery in treating stenosis (43 patients) or occlusion (nine patients). In all 52 patients, the blood pressure before treatment in the arm on the involved side was at least 30 mm Hg lower than that in the opposite arm. Thirty-nine patients (75%) had symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency (dizziness, blurred vision, ataxia). Angioplasty was successful in 40 (93%) of 43 patients with stenosis and in five (56%) of nine patients with occlusion. In the successfully treated patients, follow-up angiograms showed absence of narrowing greater than 30% stenosis, and the blood pressure in the treated arm equaled that in the opposite arm. The patients were followed up for 6-48 months (mean, 29 months). During this time, the blood pressure in the treated arm remained normal in 41 (91%) of 45 patients. The symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency subsided in 28 (72%) of 39 patients. These results suggest that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is useful for treating subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion. 
The growth hormone, prolactin and TSH response to TRH and L-dopa in patients with hyperprolactinaemia and a normal-sized sella turcica may denote a pituitary adenoma. Forty-one patients with hyperprolactinaemia and suspected prolactinomas were studied. Growth hormone (GH) and thyrotropin (TSH) secretory patterns after thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were affected in the majority of patients. The disturbances were observed regardless of tumour size as indicated by the radiological sella size. In patients with hyperprolactinaemia and normal-sized sella turcica, an abnormal GH and TSH response to TRH can be helpful in the diagnosis of a microadenoma. The hyperprolactinaemia per se and its effect on dopaminergic hypothalamic neurones may be the cause of the GH and TSH response. By contrast, many patients with macroprolactinomas showed insufficient GH secretory capacity. 
Complications following ventilation of the middle ear using Goode T tubes. This is a 3.5-year retrospective review on the insertion of 210 Goode T tubes into 182 ears of 93 patients. Otorrhea was noted postoperatively in 35.2% of the ears treated, with chronic drainage lasting longer than 4 months developing in more than 7% of the cases. Perforations were found in 34 ears (18.7%) following removal or extrusion of the T tubes; in 13 (7.1%) of these patients, chronic perforations requiring tympanoplasties developed. The literature was screened for additional studies addressing the complications associated with tympanostomy tubes. The documented incidence of perforations between conventional tubes and Goode T tubes was emphasized, and comparisons were made. Our findings indicate that, even with the immediate placement of paper patches following removal of all Goode T tubes, the percentage of tympanic membrane perforations resulting from the use of Goode T tubes is significantly greater than previously reported. 
Gut bacterial translocation via the portal vein: a clinical perspective with major torso trauma. Animal studies implicate gut bacterial translocation via the portal vein as a major factor in the pathogenesis of postinjury multiple organ failure (MOF). We therefore inserted portal vein catheters for sequential blood sampling in the operating room, at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours, and 5 days postoperatively in 20 injured patients (13 blunt, seven penetrating; mean age, 34 years) requiring emergent laparotomy and who were at known risk for MOF. The mean Revised Trauma Score was 6.4 +/- 0.4, and the Injury Severity Score, 29.3 +/- 2.3. Twelve (60%) patients arrived in shock (SBP less than 90 torr). Eight (2%) of 212 portal blood cultures were positive; seven were presumed contaminants. The only positive systemic culture (total, 212) was a Staphylococcus aureus on day 5 in a patient with a concurrent staphyloccal pneumonia. In the first 48 hours, we could not detect endotoxin in portal or systemic blood. Additionally, simultaneous portal and systemic blood levels of complement fragment C3a, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 were nearly identical and, specifically, were not different in those patients who developed MOF. In summary, this prospective clinical study has not confirmed portal or systemic bacteremia within the first 5 days postinjury, despite an eventual 30% incidence of MOF. 
Gallbladder function and gastric liquid emptying in achalasia. Because of evidence that the abnormalities in achalasia are not restricted to the distal esophagus, we investigated gallbladder function by cholescintigraphy in the steady state and in response to CCK and the scintigraphic gastric emptying of a liquid caloric meal in 10 individuals with achalasia and 10 normal controls. No abnormalities were found during the filling phase of the gallbladder but seven of the 10 patients showed a 50% reduction in the ejection fraction (39.4% +/- 30.4 vs 80.3 +/- 8.3 of controls, mean +/- SD, P = 0.007) and a slower than normal ejection phase (9.1%/min +/- 6.6 vs 18.1 +/- 4.5, P = 0.02. In eight of the 10 patients, gastric liquid emptying was accelerated with a T1/2 of 41.5 min +/- 15.4 vs 74.7 min +/- 11.5 in the controls (P = 0.007). It is concluded that in some achalasia patients extraesophageal functional abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract may be found. Whether these findings are promoted by degenerative charges of extraesophageal nerve fibers as well as their clinical significance require further investigations. 
Detection of mediastinitis after heart transplantation by gallium-67 scintigraphy. We report the findings of a patient with post-cardiac transplant mediastinitis detected by 67Ga-citrate imaging. Fever and leukocytosis were the first clinical signs suggesting infection. The usual diagnostic modalities, including CT and ultrasound, failed to identify the site of infection. A 67Ga scan showed intense abnormal uptake behind the sternum. The site of uptake was shown by necropsy to be necrotic tissue involving cardiac sutures, pulmonary arteries, and the aorta due to infection with Haemophilus aphrophilus. 
Gallbladder and pancreatic metastases from bilateral renal carcinoma presenting with hematobilia and anemia. A case of bilateral metachronous renal cell carcinoma with gallbladder and pancreatic metastases, presenting with hematobilia and anemia is presented. The presentation of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with hematobilia and anemia is previously unreported. This case illustrates (1) the occasionally very long interval between metachronous renal carcinoma; (2) this tumor's propensity to unusual metastases and unpredictable presentation; and (3) the significant palliation which may be achieved by appropriate surgical resection of these metastases. 
Uveal melanoma: development of metastases after helium ion irradiation. Forty-two (16%) of 261 patients with ocular melanoma who were treated with helium ions between January 1978 and November 1986 have developed metastatic disease. The time between start of helium ion treatment and recognition of metastatic disease ranged from 3 to 67 months (median, 27 months). The mean pretreatment tumor height in the patients with metastases was 7.7 mm. All 42 patients who developed metastatic disease have died. The median survival after diagnosis of metastatic disease was 5 months; the longest survival was 49 months. The most common site of metastasis was the liver (n = 34). Four (10%) of the 42 patients with metastases also had local recurrence of the tumor. Multivariate analysis identified three variables that predicted independently the development of metastases and lack of survival. These variables are anterior location of tumor (P = .027), tumor height greater than 5 mm (P = .02), and tumor diameter greater than 10 mm (P = .0075). 
Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction as a predictor of restenosis after successful coronary angioplasty in patients with unstable angina pectoris. BACKGROUND. High rates of restenosis after coronary angioplasty have been reported in patients with vasospastic angina. This study was designed to determine whether the occurrence of abnormal coronary vasoconstriction, detected by means of hyperventilation testing before angioplasty, influences the risk of restenosis after successful dilation. METHODS. Hyperventilation testing was performed 0 to 4 days before coronary angioplasty in 106 consecutive patients with unstable angina and single-vessel coronary artery disease. Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction was considered present if hyperventilation-induced myocardial ischemia occurred during the recovery phase of the test. All patients had follow-up angiography 8 to 12 months after angioplasty. RESULTS. Abnormal coronary vasoconstriction was observed in 48 patients (group 1), whereas 58 patients (group 2) had either a negative response throughout the test or a positive response only during the overbreathing phase of the hyperventilation test. Angioplasty was successful in 40 patients in group 1 and 51 in group 2. Restenosis was documented in 29 patients (73 percent) in group 1 and 13 (25 percent) in group 2 (relative risk of restenosis, 2.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.69 to 4.28; P less than 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the following three characteristics were independently related to the risk of restenosis (in descending order of importance): ST-segment elevation during spontaneous ischemic attacks (P less than 0.001), hyperventilation-induced abnormal coronary vasoconstriction (P less than 0.001), and the presence of a lesion more than 10 mm long in the left anterior descending coronary artery (P less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. In patients with unstable angina and single-vessel coronary artery disease who have been selected for coronary angioplasty, the presence of hyperventilation-induced abnormal coronary vasoconstriction identifies a subgroup at high risk for restenosis. 
Somatosensory evoked potentials in intracranial hypertension: analysis of the effects of hypoxia. The loss of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP's) was investigated in a feline model of intracranial hypertension. Threshold values of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) required for maintenance of SSEP's are defined using a mathematical model. The model describes loss of amplitude of SSEP's using the form of a dose-response curve. Amplitude of the SSEP's declined to 50% of control values at a CBF of 15 ml/100 gm/min and a CPP of 20 mm Hg in the normoxic animal; in the presence of mild hypoxia (8 to 9 kPa), a significant increase in these values to 18 ml/100 gm/min and 32 mm Hg, respectively, occurred. No reliable changes in latency or central conduction time were demonstrated. It is concluded that given adequate oxygenation, evoked electrical activity is lost at too low a level of CPP for this parameter to be useful in clinical monitoring. However, even mild hypoxia, when combined with intracranial hypertension, produces a major risk to neuronal integrity. 
Intermediate-term effectiveness of balloon valvuloplasty for congenital aortic stenosis. A prospective follow-up study. BACKGROUND. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty has proven to be acutely effective in the treatment of congenital valvar aortic stenosis; however, the intermediate- and long-term effectiveness of the procedure remain to be documented. METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess the intermediate-term effectiveness of balloon valvuloplasty, repeat catheterization was performed in 27 of 30 children 1.7 +/- 0.1 years after balloon valvuloplasty for congenital aortic stenosis (AS). In 33 children the peak AS gradient was reduced acutely by 55% from 77 +/- 4 to 35 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and left ventricular systolic pressure was reduced from 176 +/- 4 to 138 +/- 4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Despite a technically adequate valvuloplasty procedure, three patients had inadequate relief of obstruction and required complex surgical intervention. Twenty-seven of the 30 patients available for late reevaluation (90%) enrolled in the follow-up study. The peak AS gradient remained significantly reduced compared with that present before valvuloplasty (29 +/- 3 versus 77 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Furthermore, there was no difference in peak AS gradient at follow-up compared with that immediately after valvuloplasty. The greatest increase in gradient at reevaluation was 14 mm Hg. Twenty of 27 patients (74%) had no change in the degree of aortic insufficiency at follow-up compared with that present before valvuloplasty. At follow-up, 16 patients had no aortic insufficiency at all, and only two had moderate-to-severe (3-4+) insufficiency. Femoral artery injury was documented in four patients, three of whom were under 12 months of age at valvuloplasty. CONCLUSIONS. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty provides safe and effective intermediate-term gradient relief without early restenosis in children and adolescents with congenital AS. 
A pilot study of fluticasone propionate in untreated coeliac disease. Although gluten withdrawal is likely to remain the mainstay of treatment for adult coeliac disease, many patients find the diet inconvenient and unpalatable and compliance among asymptomatic patients is often poor. Oral corticosteroids have been used for patients who seem to be resistant to gluten withdrawal but preparations with low systemic bioavailability might be preferable. We have given a new glucocorticoid (fluticasone propionate) to 12 adults with untreated coeliac disease for six weeks while they were on a normal diet. One patient defaulted and one suffered a relapse in a pre-existing neoplasm. Excluding these, there was an improvement of symptoms, a mean weight gain of 2 kg, and a rise in albumin of 5.4 g/l. There was a significant improvement in the lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio (p less than 0.05) and in all histological variables examined in paired biopsy specimens (surface and crypt intraepithelial lymphocyte/enterocyte and goblet cell/enterocyte ratios and enterocyte height, p less than 0.01 or better). In six paired specimens sucrase and alkaline phosphatase activity increased in all (p less than 0.05) and lactase in five of six. No appreciable side effects were observed, but two patients had suppressed cortisol values and synacthen responses at six weeks. A further three, with normal pretrial results, had a blunted tetracosactrin response at six weeks. Fluticasone propionate seems worthy of further assessment in the treatment of coeliac disease as an adjunct to gluten withdrawal. 
Fetal cardiovascular morphology of truncus arteriosus with or without truncal valve insufficiency in the rat. BACKGROUND. Recent advances in fetal echocardiography have necessitated further study on fetal in situ cardiovascular morphology of truncus arteriosus and the effects of truncal valve insufficiency. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied 55 fetal rats with truncus arteriosus among 300 fetuses from 40 virgin females treated with 200 mg fertilysin on the 10th day of pregnancy. After rapid whole-body freezing on the 21st day, the fetuses were studied by means of serial cross-sectional photographs of the frozen thorax. Thirty-five fetuses with a normal heart treated with fertilysin served as controls. Truncus arteriosus was characterized by a large ventricular septal defect, a solitary artery (truncus arteriosus) overriding the ventricular septum, the right and left pulmonary arteries originating from the truncus arteriosus with or without a common trunk (main pulmonary artery), and absent ductus arteriosus. Fetuses with truncal valve insufficiency had thick truncal valves, a large truncus arteriosus, and large ventricles. The subgroup of 12 fetuses with a large truncus (truncal diameter greater than 160% of the ascending aorta diameter in the controls) showed significantly greater values for right ventricular volume (200% of control) and mass (120% of control), left ventricular volume (170% of control) and mass (110% of control), right (120% of control) and left (110% of control) atrial volume, and pericardial fluid (140% of control) than the controls. These changes were less prominent and ventricular volumes were not increased in the remaining subgroup with a truncal diameter of 160% or less of aorta diameter in the controls. CONCLUSIONS. In fetal truncus arteriosus, truncal valve insufficiency was associated with increased ventricular volume load and incomplete cardiac compensation in rats. 
Maffucci's syndrome associated with intracranial enchondroma and aneurysm: case report. Maffucci's syndrome is a rare, congenital mesodermal dysplasia combined with dyschondroplasia and hemangiomatosis. Enchondromatous involvement of the skull bones is rare in this syndrome. A rare case of Maffucci's syndrome associated with enchondroma at the skull base, left internal carotid artery aneurysm, and goiter is reported. Two other previously reported cases of Maffucci's syndrome with associated aneurysms and the present case suggest that Maffucci's syndrome may be associated with aneurysm. 
Myotonia and neuromuscular transmission in the mouse. The role of neuromuscular transmission and acetylcholine receptors in the phenotypic expression of hereditary myotonia was reinvestigated in two mutants of the mouse, ADR (adr/adr) and MTO (adrmto/adrmto). Three neuromuscular blockers, curare, flaxedil, and alpha-bungarotoxin, did not prevent mechanical myotonia of EDL and soleus muscles from the two mutants. Furthermore, electrical myotonia was demonstrated in isolated ADR muscle fibers devoid of nerve endings. We conclude that neither release nor reception of acetylcholine are important for the mechanism of myotonia in mouse mutants. The previously described suppression of myotonic aftercontractions by high concentrations of curare (Muscle & Nerve 1987;10:293-298) could not be reproduced; rather, a prolongation of aftercontractions was found. The other drugs had no significant effect on myotonic aftercontractions. Because neuromuscular transmission is not involved in human myotonias, this result supports the use of myotonic mice as a model, at least for recessive generalized myotonia (Becker). 
Accuracy of computer-interpreted electrocardiography in selecting patients for thrombolytic therapy. MITI Project Investigators. A prehospital computer-interpreted electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained in 1,189 patients with chest pain of suspected cardiac origin during an ongoing trial of prehospital thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. Electrocardiograms were performed by paramedics 1.5 +/- 1.2 h after the onset of symptoms. Of 391 patients with evidence of acute myocardial infarction, 202 (52%) were identified as having ST segment elevation (acute injury) by the computer-interpreted ECG compared with 259 (66%) by an electrocardiographer (p less than 0.001). Of 798 patients with chest pain but no infarction, 785 (98%) were appropriately excluded by computer compared with 757 (95%) by an electrocardiographer (p less than 0.001). The positive predictive value of the computer- and physician-interpreted ECG was, respectively, 94% and 86% and the negative predictive value was 81% and 85%. Prehospital screening of possible candidates for thrombolytic therapy with the aid of a computerized ECG is feasible, highly specific and with further enhancement can speed the care of all patients with acute myocardial infarction. 
In vivo measurements of the fraction of dose of bleomycin labeled with cobalt 57 delivered to human tumors. Concentrations of bleomycin labeled with cobalt 57 (Co-bleo) over time were measured in vivo in 17 patients with 32 sites of lymphoma and 18 patients with lung tumors after administration of the same dose of bleomycin. There were marked variations in individual tumor drug concentrations even among tumors with the same histologic type, indicating that the tumor concentration of this drug in individuals cannot be predicted from the administered dose. Also, tumor concentration could not be predicted from the area under the concentration over time curve (AUC) of Co-bleo in the blood; there was no correlation (r = 0.53) between the AUC and the concentration in the tumor at any point in time between 30 minutes and 8 hours after injection. There was no significant difference in the percent of the injected dose per milliliter (%ID/ml) which was delivered to the tumor when low and high amounts of bleomycin were administered to the same patient. Also, a good correlation (r = 0.88) between the %ID/ml over time was found when injection of low and high doses of bleomycin were compared. The results indicate that using quantitative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and a labeled tracer dose it is possible to predict what fraction of the dose of a chemotherapeutic drug will concentrate in an individual patient's tumor in vivo. They also show that, for bleomycin, escalation of dose will result in a proportional increase of tumor concentration. This increase depends on individual properties of tumors which can be measured quantitatively in vivo by SPECT and are expressed as percent of %ID/ml of tumor tissue. 
Miosis and internal ophthalmoplegia as a manifestation of partial seizures. We present a patient whose only physical manifestation of a partial sensory seizure was bilateral pupillary constriction and internal ophthalmoplegia. The onset and offset of each attack corresponded distinctly with an electroencephalographic discharge of the left temporo-occipital region. We propose involvement of a cortical pupillary constrictive center in the temporal-occipital area. 
Non-Menkes-type copper deficiency with regression, lactic acidosis, and granulocytopenia. A 2-year-old girl with granulocytopenia developed fever followed by truncal ataxia and progressive neurologic regression. CT demonstrated symmetric low-density areas in the cerebral white matter. Sural nerve biopsy revealed axonal degeneration. Blood lactate levels were high, and serum levels of copper and ceruloplasmin and urinary excretion of copper were low. Cultured skin fibroblasts showed normal copper uptake. Treatment with oral copper administration normalized serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, blood lactate levels, and granulocyte count. However, copper levels in the CSF were still low, and the patient showed no clinical improvement. We speculated that copper transport across the intestinal wall and across the blood-brain barrier was impaired. 
Risk factors for candidemia in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Between 1983 and 1987 the overall incidence of candidemia at the Institut Gustave Roussy, a tertiary care referral hospital for patients with cancer, increased from 0.1% (7 of 6,801) to 0.32% (24 of 7,515) (P = .009). Because acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) was the most common underlying disease in patients with candidemia, risk factors for candidemia were analyzed in this subset of patients. A case-control study comparing the eight ALL patients who had candidemia with 18 ALL control patients revealed that previous bacteremia, prolonged neutropenia, prolonged fever, prolonged administration of antimicrobial agents, treatment with multiple antimicrobial agents, and a relatively high concentration of Candida organisms in stool were significant risk factors for candidemia. In a logistic regression analysis, however, only receipt of vancomycin and/or imipenem was identified as an independent risk factor for candidemia. Further analysis showed that administration of vancomycin promoted proliferation of Candida organisms in the gastrointestinal tract and that this proliferation was associated with an increased risk of candidemia. 
The effects of alcohol on the female brain: a neuropathological study. This quantitative neuropathological study compared the brains of seventeen alcoholic females with twenty non-alcoholic female controls. There was a significant (P less than 0.001) increase in the pericerebral space value (control 9.5; alcoholic 16.3) indicating shrinkage of the brain. Cerebral grey and white matter volumes were determined morphometrically. There was a significant decrease in the cerebral white matter volume (P less than .02) in the alcoholics. The cerebral grey matter volume was unchanged. These changes parallel those described previously in male alcoholics. Further studies will be necessary to establish the relative severity of the brain damage in males and females. 
Perirenal lipoma versus renal cell carcinoma. Pure renal and perirenal lipomas are rare. They arise from renal cortex, capsule, or perirenal tissue, and may be difficult to distinguish from renal adenocarcinomas. We report on a patient who presented with a renal mass that had the radiologic findings suggestive of a renal cell carcinoma, but proved to be a simple lipoma. 
Natural history of recurrent urinary tract infections in women. To evaluate the natural history of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women, we observed 51 infection-prone women in a standardized fashion for a median of 9 years. During intervals when patients were not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis, infections occurred at an average rate of 2.6 per patient-year, but the rate varied widely from patient to patient (range 0.3-7.6 episodes per year). Seventy-three percent of the observed episodes were symptomatic, with an 18:1 ratio of cystitis to pyelonephritis episodes. Infectious episodes were strikingly clustered, and rates of infection decreased in the winter months. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was highly effective in preventing acute cystitis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and acute pyelonephritis, even when used for as long as 5 years. The proportions of infecting strains resistant in vitro to ampicillin (19%-32%) and nitrofurantoin (5%-18%) were unchanged over the 15-year observation period, while resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increased in the last 5 years of the study. 
Effect of enalapril on survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions and congestive heart failure. The SOLVD Investigators BACKGROUND. Patients with congestive heart failure have a high mortality rate and are also hospitalized frequently. We studied the effect of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on mortality and hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure and ejection fractions less than or equal to 0.35. METHODS. Patients receiving conventional treatment for heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 1284) or enalapril (n = 1285) at doses of 2.5 to 20 mg per day in a double-bind trial. Approximately 90 percent of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional classes II and III. The follow-up averaged 41.4 months. RESULTS. There were 510 deaths in the placebo group (39.7 percent), as compared with 452 in the enalapril group (35.2 percent) (reduction in risk, 16 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 26 percent; P = 0.0036). Although reductions in mortality were observed in several categories of cardiac deaths, the largest reduction occurred among the deaths attributed to progressive heart failure (251 in the placebo group vs. 209 in the enalapril group; reduction in risk, 22 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 35 percent). There was little apparent effect of treatment on deaths classified as due to arrhythmia without pump failure. Fewer patients died or were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (736 in the placebo group and 613 in the enalapril group; risk reduction, 26 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 18 to 34 percent; P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. The addition of enalapril to conventional therapy significantly reduced mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and reduced ejection fractions. 
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the elderly: early and long-term results. The immediate and long-term efficacy of coronary angioplasty in the elderly was determined by studying 752 patients greater than or equal to 65 years old and comparing patients greater than or equal to 75 years old with those 65 to 74 years old. The oldest patients were more highly symptomatic, were more likely to be in heart failure, had more multivessel disease and were more likely to undergo multivessel dilation. The immediate success rate of angioplasty was higher in the oldest patients (92.8% versus 82%) (p = 0.0003). The hospital mortality rate was also higher (6.2% versus 1.6%) (p less than 0.001). Long-term overall survival was high. However, long-term event-free survival was lowest in the oldest patients, and recurrent severe angina was particularly common. Thus, in very elderly patients, coronary angioplasty is usually successful, but extra caution is warranted; also, long-term relief from angina is less common than in younger patients. 
Patients with a high defibrillation threshold: clinical characteristics, management, and outcome. Of 125 patients prepared to receive implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) with the patch-patch configuration of the difibrillating electrodes, 23 (18%) had high (greater than or equal to 25 joules) defibrillation thresholds (DFTs). These patients had lower left ventricular ejection fractions (27 +/- 12 vs 34 +/- 13; p less than 0.03) and a higher incidence of previous heart surgery (47% vs 19%; p less than 0.01) than patients with normal DFTs but did not differ in age, type of heart disease, incidence of concomitant heart surgery, or use of antiarrhythmic medication. Defibrillators were implanted in 18 of these 23 patients, 12 during the initial surgery and six after repeat DFT testing 2 weeks later. After 22 +/- 11 months of follow-up, four patients with ICDs died (two suddenly, and two of nonsudden cardiac causes). Two patients without ICDs died of nonsudden cardiac causes. Appropriate shocks were received by five patients (29%) including both who died suddenly later. A high DFT may be more common than previously stated. It is associated with poor ventricular function and previous heart surgery. Repeated DFT testing may be useful in some patients. A high DFT does not preclude successful ICD shocks, but other therapies may provide better results. 
Calcium oxalate microcalcifications in the breast. Calcium oxalate calcifications can be difficult to detect with routine histologic procedures. In the reported case, microcalcifications that were evident with radiography of the specimen and of the paraffin blocks could not be detected with light microscopy. Polarized light microscopy, however, revealed the calcifications to be calcium oxalate crystals. Use of polarized light microscopy may resolve radiologic-pathologic discrepancies in such cases. 
Effect of a new monoclonal antibody, TA-2, that inhibits lymphocyte adherence to cytokine stimulated endothelium in the rat. An important event in the migration of lymphocytes out of the blood is their adherence to endothelial cells (EC). In inflammatory sites cytokines activate EC and promote lymphocyte EC adherence and migration. Small peritoneal exudate lymphocytes (sPEL) preferentially migrate from the blood to cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and to sites injected with IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha/beta, and TNF-alpha, rather than to peripheral lymph nodes. The basis of this migration is sPEL adherence to cytokine-activated EC. To study this adhesion mAb to rat sPEL were screened for inhibition of sPEL adherence to IFN-gamma-stimulated EC. One mAb, TA-2, inhibited IFN-gamma-stimulated adherence to EC by 60%. This antibody had no effect on the baseline adherence of sPEL to unstimulated EC. Treatment of sPEL, but not EC, with TA-2-inhibited adhesion. TA-2 also inhibited adhesion to EC activated with mIL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and LPS, and the adhesion of spleen T cells to activated EC. The TA-2 Ag was expressed on virtually all lymph node, spleen, and sPEL lymphocytes but sPEL expressed two to three times higher levels than lymph node lymphocytes, and the highest levels were found on CD4+ and CD45R- memory T cells. TA-2 immunoprecipitated a group of four polypeptides with molecular mass of 150, 130, 83, and 66 kDa. Finally, TA-2 inhibited sPEL adhesion to TNF-alpha and IL-1 stimulated human umbilical vein EC to the same extent as an anti-human VCAM-1 mAb, and combinations of TA-2 and anti-VCAM-1 were not different from treatment with either antibody alone. Thus, TA-2 appears to recognize rat VLA-4 based on immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and lymphocyte EC studies. VLA-4 mediates the adhesion of rat lymphocytes to rat microvascular EC stimulated with IFN-gamma, mIL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and LPS. VLA-4 is important in the increased adhesion of sPEL to EC and the enhanced sPEL migration to inflammation may in part be explained by increased expression of VLA-4 on these cells. 
The significance of circulating cells carrying t(14;18) in long remission from follicular lymphoma Peripheral blood mononuclear cell fractions from 15 patients in continuous clinical remission from follicular lymphoma for longer than 10 years were examined for cells carrying the t(14;18) translocation using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The assay used was able to detect one positive cell in approximately 5 x 10(5) cells (a single 14q+ molecule in 2.5 micrograms DNA). Cells positive for t(14;18) were found in six of eight patients initially presenting with stage III or IV disease, compared with zero of seven of those with stage I or II disease (P less than .05). In two cases 14q+ junction regions were also successfully amplified from formalin-fixed biopsy material obtained at presentation 12 and 17 years previously. In both, sequence analysis demonstrated that the cells circulating in remission belonged to the original clone. These results indicate that cells bearing t(14;18) frequently persist in the peripheral blood in long remission of advanced follicular lymphoma and question the value of their presence as a predictor of relapse. 
Prevention of adult heart disease beginning in childhood: intervention programs. Multiple strategies are available to affect children's cardiovascular health. From clinic-based high-risk counseling to broad-based school or community programs, intervention strategies are being developed and tested to find the most effective means of changing the risk factors of youth to assure a healthier future for our children. Since adoption of new behaviors is improved by consistent messages from multiple sources, a concerted effort is needed. The involvement of health professionals, educators, community organizations, industry, and government together will be important to support the adoption of healthy lifestyles for succeeding generations. Intervention through cardiovascular health promotion for school children may well be the future direction for preventive cardiology. 
A new surgical classification system for shoulder-girdle resections. Analysis of 38 patients. A new, six-stage surgical classification system is described for shoulder-girdle resections for patients being treated by limb-sparing procedures for bone and soft-tissue tumors. The classification is based upon current concepts of oncological surgery, the structures removed, the type of resection performed, and the relationship of the resection to the glenohumeral joint, and it indicates the increasing surgical magnitude of the procedure. Data from 38 patients with an average follow-up period of 4.6 years (range, two to 8.4 years) were analyzed. Thirty-two tumors were in bone and six in soft tissue. Eighty-seven percent (33 of the 38 tumors) were malignant. Twenty-four lesions were located in the proximal humerus and 14 in the scapula. The system permitted classification of all shoulder girdle resections done in this study's institutions. The classification is proposed as a means of establishing a uniform terminology in the comparison of such data. 
Antibiotic prophylaxis of wound infections in skin surgery A controlled prospective study of 2165 outpatients undergoing skin surgery was performed to evaluate the utility and the effects of several antibiotic schedules for prophylaxis of wound infections. The patients were divided into four groups. Twenty-three of the 541 group A patients, given no antibiotics, had wound infections. Eight of the 542 group B patients, given systemic antibiotics from immediately after surgery until the third day, had wound infections. Four of the 540 group C patients, treated only with local sterile antibiotic powder sprinkled into the wound during surgery, had wound infections develop, and only one infection occurred in the 542 group D patients given systemic antibiotics from 2 days before surgery until the second day after surgery. This last schedule was the best for prophylaxis of wound infections in contamination-prone regions. Local antibiotic administration is a simple method for prevention of infections in routine skin surgery. 
Coexistent hemangioblastoma and arteriovenous malformation of the cerebellum. Case report. A case of cerebellar hemangioblastoma and coexistent arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is presented. Angiography displayed the AVM, but histological examination revealed a coexisting hemangioblastoma. Various theories concerning the etiology of this condition are discussed. 
PET study of carbon-11-PK 11195 binding to peripheral type benzodiazepine sites in glioblastoma: a case report. The utility of the peripheral type benzodiazepine site ligand 11C-PK 11195, for imaging human glioma in conjunction with Positron Emission Tomography, relies on a high specific binding of the tracer to tumoral peripheral type benzodiazepines sites. In a patient with glioblastoma, we found that 11C-PK 11195 binding was two-fold higher in the tumor than in normal gray matter and that 30% of tumoral binding could be displaced by a large excess of unlabeled drug. These findings suggest that tumoral retention of the ligand is due, in part, to specific binding. 
Myocardial lactate dehydrogenase and its isoenzyme activities in transplanted human hearts. Lactate dehydrogenase and its heart (H) and muscle (M) subunit activities were studied in right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from eight transplanted human hearts and compared with five chronically failing hearts and six normal human hearts from brain-dead liver/kidney donors. Of the 17 transplant biopsies (taken 5-95 weeks postoperatively), only two showed histologic signs of chronic rejection: They were excluded from the group analysis. A higher proportion of the M subunit of lactate dehydrogenase (M%) was found in the transplanted and the chronically failing hearts than in the normal hearts, presumably reflecting increased myocardial anaerobic glycolytic stress. In the early post-transplantation period, M% was higher in the transplanted than in the chronically failing hearts. Thereafter M% gradually fell, but had not reached normal levels 1-2 years after transplantation. During that time it was similar to the values in the chronic-failure hearts. In the two biopsies with chronic rejection, M% was nearly twice as high as in contemporaneous biopsies showing mild or no rejection. Monitoring of enzymatic adaptation from endomyocardial biopsies may be of clinical interest. 
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation decreases lower esophageal sphincter pressure in patients with achalasia. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is believed to be an inhibitory neurotransmitter responsible for lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation. In patients with achalasia the concentration of VIP and the number of VIP-containing nerve fibers are reduced or absent. It has been suggested that the response to low-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may be mediated by a nonadrenergic noncholinergic pathway in which the release of VIP is responsible for the smooth muscle relaxation. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of TENS on LES pressure and on VIP plasma concentrations in six patients with achalasia (five female, one male). TENS was performed daily during one week for 45-min sessions with a pocket stimulator that delivered low-frequency pulses (6.5 Hz), at 10 pulses/sec of 0.1-msec duration at intensities of 10-20 mA until rhythmic flexion of the fingers was obtained without producing pain. LES pressure and VIP levels were obtained before TENS, after the first 45-min session, and after a week of daily stimulation. After 45-min, TENS produced a significant reduction (P less than 0.01) in LES resting pressure from the mean value 56 +/- 6.4 mm Hg to 42.3 +/- 6.4 mm Hg; with LES relaxation improvement from 50.6 +/- 3% to 63.1 +/- 3.2% (P less than 0.01). After one week of daily TENS, an additional reduction in LES resting pressure (40.3 +/- 4 mm Hg) was observed (P less than 0.01). 
Epibulbar choristoma and microphthalmia: a report of two cases. The simultaneous ipsilateral presence of an epibulbar choristoma and microphthalmia has rarely been reported. We present two such cases, one of which is associated with bone formation, and we consider a possible pathogenetic mechanism. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor of the choroid plexus in Sjogren's disease. We report an unusual case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the choroid plexus of the right lateral ventricle, manifesting as an intraventricular mass and causing unilateral hydrocephalus in a 48-year-old man who suffered from Sjogren's disease and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. The lesion obliterated the normal choroidal architecture by a mixed chronic inflammatory process that was associated with reactive connective tissue changes. Immunohistochemical studies showed no light-chain restriction in the cells, and residual islands of transthyretin-positive epithelial cells were identified, implicating the choroid plexus origin of the mass. 
An economic evaluation of lovastatin for cholesterol lowering and coronary artery disease reduction. The costs and benefits of cholesterol lowering in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) were considered using lifetime lovastatin therapy as the intervention model for adults between 35 and 55 years of age. The analysis projected the benefits of CAD risk reduction using estimates from the Framingham Heart Study. The chosen analytic perspective was that of the patient. For average-risk men with total serum cholesterol levels between 5.69 and 9.83 mmol/liter (220 and 380 mg/dl), the cost per life-year saved ranged from $9,000 to $106,000, whereas for average-risk women, the cost ranged from $35,000 to $297,000 (1989 U.S. dollars). In high-risk men (with smoking habit and hypertension), the cost per life-year saved values ranged from 6,000 to $53,000, whereas in high-risk women the cost per life-year saved values ranged from $19,000 to $160,000. The results were more favorable than those found in previous studies of alternate medication therapies for hypercholesterolemia. Even using conservative parameter assumptions, at least 800,000 Americans aged 35 to 55 years are at sufficiently high risk for CAD, so that the net cost of lovastatin therapy can be favorably compared with other widely used medical interventions. 
Effect of age on use of thrombolytic therapy and mortality in acute myocardial infarction. The MITI Project Group. The findings in 3,256 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction were tabulated to assess the history, treatments and outcome in the elderly; 1,848 patients (56%) were greater than 65 years of age, including 28% who were aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The incidence of prior angina, hypertension and heart failure (only 3% of patients less than 55 years of age had a history of heart failure compared with 24% greater than or equal to 75 years old) was found to increase with age. Twenty-nine percent of patients less than 75 years of age were treated with a systemic thrombolytic drug compared with only 5% of patients older than 75 years. Mortality rates increased strikingly with advanced age (less than 2% in patients less than or equal to 55, 4.6% in those 55 to 64, 12.3% in those 65 to 74 and 17.8% in those greater than or equal to 75 years). Both the incidence of complicating illness and a nondiagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) increased with age. In a multivariate analysis of outcome in older patients (greater than or equal to 65 years), adverse events were related to both prior history of heart failure (odds ratio 3.9) and increasing age (odds ratio 1.4 per each decade of age). Outcome was not improved by treatment with thrombolytic drugs, but these agents were prescribed to only 12% of patients greater than 65 years of age, thereby reducing the power for detecting such an effect. 
Resection of intrinsic tumors from nondominant face motor cortex using stimulation mapping: report of two cases. We report two right-handed patients who underwent resection of intrinsic glial tumors from the nondominant hemisphere, face motor cortex. Both patients underwent preoperative assessment with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging localizing the tumor in the inferior region of the Rolandic cortex. With the patients under general anesthesia and without muscular paralysis, the tumor volume was determined by intraoperative ultrasound and resective surgery accomplished with the aid of cortical and subcortical stimulation mapping techniques. Radical resection of the tumor from the face motor cortex was achieved in both patients. A transient contralateral facial weakness and apraxia were noted in each patient, and this resolved within 6 to 8 weeks following surgery. Removal of intrinsic tumors involving the nondominant face motor cortex may be safely achieved using brain mapping techniques to localize inferior Rolandic cortex and avoid resection of the hand motor cortex and descending subcortical motor pathways. Permanent disability will be prevented due to the bilateral representation of face motor function at the neocortical level. However, due to language localization in cortical zones contiguous with the dominant hemisphere, face motor cortex, we do not recommend resection of this region. 
Transfusion-related chronic liver disease in sickle cell anemia. The medical records and liver biopsies of nine sickle cell patients with chronically elevated liver function tests were retrospectively reviewed to determine the etiology of chronic liver disease. There were eight women and one man with a mean age of 30 yr. All patients had hemoglobin SS. Eight patients were referred for elevated aminotransferases and one for an elevated alkaline phosphatase. Hemosiderosis was present in all of the biopsies. Two patients had cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis was noted in two patients, and five patients had cholestasis. Two patients had serologic markers demonstrating HBV exposure but no patients were HBsAg positive. Erythrophagocytosis, sinusoidal dilatation, and Kupffer cell hyperplasia were present in all of the liver biopsies. Transfusion-related causes were the most common significant pathologic findings in our patients, and appeared to be the etiologies of chronic liver disease in sickle cell patients. 
Sinus bradycardia related to temporomandibular joint surgery. The carotid artery lies in close relationship to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Manipulation of the mandible during TMJ surgery has been observed in several cases to be directly associated with the development of sinus bradycardia as the joint is distracted during arthrotomy and arthroplasty procedures. We report several cases and discuss differential diagnosis of sinus bradycardia associated with positional changes of the TMJ. This report emphasizes the importance to the surgeon and to the anesthesiologist of recognition of this cardiac phenomenon, mediated through the trigeminovagal reflex, to appropriately manage the patients during TMJ surgery. 
Resection of the inferior vena cava or intraluminal vena caval tumor thrombectomy during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for metastatic germ cell cancer: indications and results. A total of 42 patients underwent inferior vena caval resection (40) or intraluminal tumor thrombectomy (2) during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for bulky abdominal metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell cancer (7% of all post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection cases). The 3 indications for vena caval resection included tumor clearance (38%), vena caval scar occlusion (14%) and vena caval tumor thrombus (48%). En bloc vena caval resection to achieve tumor clearance was justified by subsequent nodal pathology (cancer in 63% of the specimens and teratoma in 31%). Vena caval resection in the presence of scar occlusion was de facto required by virtue of its incorporation in the specimen. Vena caval resection or thrombectomy is indicated for intraluminal tumor thrombus because thrombus pathology (cancer 35%, teratoma 45% and fibrosis 20%) reflected nodal pathology in 71% of the patients with cancer, 78% with teratoma and 100% with fibrosis. The complications of vena caval resection were generally transitory. The 71% survival rate justifies this intensive surgical approach because these patients had exhausted all chemotherapy options. 
Effects of embolus size on hemodynamics and gas exchange in canine embolic pulmonary hypertension. We examined the effects of different-sized glass-bead embolization on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange in 12 intact anesthetized dogs. Pulmonary hemodynamics were evaluated by multipoint pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa)/cardiac output (Q) plots before and 60 min after sufficient amounts of 100-microns (n = 6 dogs) or 1,000-microns (n = 6 dogs) glass beads to triple baseline Ppa were given and again 20 min after 5 mg/kg hydralazine in all the animals. Gas exchange was assessed using the multiple inert gas elimination technique in each of these experimental conditions. Embolization increased both the extrapolated pressure intercepts (by 6 mmHg) and the slopes (by 5 mmHg.l-1.min.m2) of the linear Ppa/Q plots, together with an 80% angiographic pulmonary vascular obstruction. These changes were not significantly different in the two subgroups of dogs. However, arterial PO2 was most decreased after the 100-microns beads, and arterial PCO2 was most increased after the 1,000-microns beads. Both bead sizes deteriorated the distribution of ventilation (VA)/perfusion (Q) ratios, with development of lung units with higher as well as with lower than normal VA/Q. Only 100-microns beads generated a shunt. Only 1,000-microns beads generated a high VA/Q mode and increased inert gas dead space. Hydralazine increased the shunt and decreased the slope of the Ppa/Q plots after 100-microns beads and had no effect after 1,000-microns beads. We conclude that in embolic pulmonary hypertension, Ppa/Q characteristics are unaffected by embolus size up to 1,000 microns. 
Anterograde amnesia with fornix damage following removal of IIIrd ventricle colloid cyst. Two patients developed anterograde amnesia following the apparently uncomplicated transcallosal-transventricular removal of a colloid cyst. Damage to the fornical columns was demonstrated on CT and MRI scans, whilst other memory related structures were entirely normal. Longitudinal neuropsychological evaluation, over 12-24 months, has revealed a very similar pattern of deficit in the two cases: verbal memory has remained persistently impaired whilst nonverbal anterograde memory has improved to some degree. Formal tests of remote public (famous faces and events) and personal autobiographical memory have supported the clinical impression that neither patient has a temporally extensive retrograde amnesia. These findings address the role of the fornix, and the dissociation of memory processes in humans. 
Hypertension in blacks: clinical overview. Although the decline in stroke and other cardiovascular morbid and mortal events has been occurring since the 1940s, the steeper decline since 1968 has been attributed to improved hypertension awareness, treatment, and control. However, in spite of this encouraging trend from the population in general, surveys from the 1970s and our more recent survey from the Maryland Hypertension Program indicate that hypertension control among blacks remains unacceptably poor, particularly in view of the high prevalence. Of special concern are black men, who have the highest prevalence of any group and the poorest control rate (see Tables 6-1 through 6-4). According to Gillum and Gillum, "High rates of non-compliance with follow-up and drug therapy seriously compromised the efforts of community-wide programs. Indeed, non-compliance with therapeutic or preventive health advice is now the major barrier to effective hypertension control in the United States." Impediments to ideal hypertension control in black communities can be divided into three categories 1. Severity of hypertension in blacks. 2. Barriers related to the medical care system, including inadequate financial resources (see also Chapter 5), inconveniently located health care facilities, long waiting times, and inaccessibility to health education, specifically as it relates to hypertension. 3. Barriers related to the social, psychosocial, and sociopolitical environment, which include problems of underemployment, unemployment, racism, and strained racial relationships. In summary, one could say that, in spite of generally improved hypertension control in the United States, the group that has the worse problems (blacks, especially males) is not benefiting as much as the general population. The strategy for treating black patients with hypertension is little different from that applied to all other patients. However, consideration must be given to the patients' lifestyle. The cultural differences in diet especially must be taken into account. Finally, economic considerations must always be an important component in managing black hypertensive patients. For a detailed discussion of treatment alternatives, see Chapter 11. 
Increase in atherosclerosis and adventitial mast cells in cocaine abusers: an alternative mechanism of cocaine-associated coronary vasospasm and thrombosis. Coronary vasospasm has been implicated as a cause of myocardial ischemia and sudden cardiac death in cocaine abusers. However, the mechanism or mechanisms remain unknown. Autopsy records (n = 5,871) from the medical examiner's files at Baltimore, Maryland and northern Virginia were examined and 495 persons (8.4%) were identified with positive toxicologic findings for cocaine. Of these, six subjects (1.2%) had total thrombotic occlusion, involving primarily the left anterior descending coronary artery. The mean number of adventitial mast cells per coronary segment and the degree of atherosclerosis were determined. These observations were compared with findings in age- and gender-matched subjects who died from cocaine overdose and in patients who had sudden cardiac death (acute thrombosis) without a history of illicit drug abuse. There were significantly more mast cells in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis than in the other groups. The number of mast cells showed a significant correlation with the degree of cross-sectional luminal narrowing (r = 0.68) in subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis but not in subjects with sudden death due to thrombosis (r = 0.34, p less than 0.03). Subjects with cocaine-associated thrombosis also had significant coronary atherosclerosis without plaque hemorrhage (five had one or more vessels with greater than 75% cross-sectional area luminal narrowing) despite a mean age of 29 +/- 2 years. These findings suggest that adventitial mast cells may potentiate atherosclerosis and vasospasm, thrombosis and premature sudden death in long-term cocaine abusers.
