5	Saltpeter ingestion. A 37-year-old man presented to the emergency department after an attempt to self-treat his priapism with saltpeter (K+NO3). Initially he had a potassium of 7.6 with electrocardiographic changes and a markedly elevated CO2. The potassium and carbon dioxide normalized in less than 24 hours with standard treatment for hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia is expected with large oral potassium ingestion; and the elevated CO2 was spurious, caused by the misreading of serum nitrates by the Ektachrom 700 system. Ingestion of K+NO3 should be added to the differential of hyperkalemia with a markedly elevated CO2. 
4	No effect of experimental noise exposure on human pregnancy. The effect of experimental noise exposure (15 minutes of 90-dB white noise via headphones) was examined on systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures; heart rate; and stress hormones (ACTH, cortisol, prolactin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine) in normotensive and hypertensive pregnant women. No significant effects induced by noise exposure could be registered in these variables. Fetal and uterine blood circulation was also examined with a duplex pulsed Doppler system. No changes were seen on the fetal side as measured from the descending aorta in blood flow velocity (cm/second) or pulsatility or resistance indexes in either normotensive or hypertensive pregnancy. The only change observed was an increase in fetal heart rate in normotensive pregnancy. However, this increase could not be confirmed by cardiotocographic registration and is not clinically important. Uterine blood circulation was recorded from the proximal uterine artery on the placental side, and no effect of exposure was seen on pulsatility or resistance indexes. 
5	Amoxicillin or myringotomy or both for acute otitis media: results of a randomized clinical trial. A total of 536 infants and children with acute otitis media were randomly assigned to one of six consistent year-long regimens involving the treatment of nonsevere episodes with either amoxicillin or placebo, and severe episodes with either amoxicillin, amoxicillin and myringotomy, or, in children aged 2 years or older, placebo and myringotomy. Nonsevere episodes had more favorable outcomes in subjects assigned to treatment with amoxicillin than with placebo, as measured by the proportions that resulted in initial treatment failure (3.9% vs 7.7%, P = .009) and the proportions in which middle-ear effusion was present at 2 and 6 weeks after onset (46.9% vs 62.5%, P less than .001; and 45.9% vs 51.5%, P = .09, respectively). In subjects whose entry episode was non-severe, those assigned to amoxicillin treatment had less average time with effusion during the succeeding year than those assigned to placebo treatment (36.0% vs 44.4%, P = .004), but recurrence rates of acute otitis media in the two groups were similar. In the 2-year-and-older age group, severe episodes resulted in more initial treatment failures in subjects assigned to receive myringotomy alone than in subjects assigned to receive amoxicillin with, or without, myringotomy (23.5% vs 3.1% vs 4.1%, P = .006). In the study population as a whole, severe episodes in subjects assigned to receive amoxicillin alone, and amoxicillin with myringotomy, had comparable outcomes. It is concluded that children with acute otitis media should routinely be treated with amoxicillin (or an equivalent antimicrobial drug). The data provide no support for the routine use of myringotomy either alone or adjunctively. 
4	Prolonged extracorporeal life support of pediatric and adolescent cardiac transplant patients. Options for mechanical support of pediatric patients with severe heart failure who are awaiting transplantation or have undergone transplantation are limited. This report examines 3 patients placed on extracorporeal life support (ECLS) while awaiting transplantation and 3 patients who underwent transplantation and suffered subsequent heart failure due to rejection or postoperative myocardial dysfunction. The overall survival rate was 2 of 6. The 2 surviving patients had a failing transplanted heart. There were no survivors among the patients placed on ECLS as a bridge to transplantation. In each case a contraindication to transplantation developed before a donor heart could be obtained. The mean time of ECLS support was 147.5 hours (range, 70 to 370 hours). The ECLS circuit did not affect cyclosporin levels or antirejection therapy. Extracorporeal life support can be used to support pediatric cardiac transplant patients with biventricular failure due to acute rejection or postoperative dysfunction. Although the results have been discouraging, ECLS may still have a role as a bridge to transplantation. However, complications can develop during ECLS that may preclude transplantation. 
1	Value of four models for selecting patients for local excision of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva. For 75 women with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva who underwent radical vulvectomy and inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy, the authors assessed the efficacy of four models for selecting patients who could have been treated adequately with local excision of the tumor. Each of the three models proposed by Andreasson and Nyboe covered 25% of the patients, none of whom had groin metastases or died of cancer. Local recurrence in the vulva occurred in 10%. A model suggested by the International Society for the Study of Vulvar Disease covered almost 10% of the patients. One of seven patients had groin metastases, none died of cancer, and one of seven developed local recurrence in the vulva. The criteria of the clinically best suited model are tumor not situated on the clitoris and less than 4 cm in diameter, with only slight hyperchromasia. This model ought to be tested in a randomized study. 
1	The origin of epidermal melanocytes. Implications for the histogenesis of nevi and melanomas. Among the most venerable concepts in dermatopathology is Unna's 19th century notion of Abtropfung, ie, that melanocytes drop off from the epidermis to the dermis during the histogenesis of melanocytic tumors. Paradoxically, however, Unna's basic premise of an epidermal origin for melanocytes has been seriously questioned for over 40 years, based on experimental evidence favoring a neural crest origin for melanocytes. Recent work has strengthened the evidence for a neural crest origin of epidermal melanocytes, and it has been suggested that the concept of Abtropfung be replaced by the concept of Hochsteigerung. The concept of Hochsteigerung holds that melanocytes migrate up from the dermis into the epidermis-not only in normal development, but also during normal tissue maintenance. It now seems likely that the precursor of melanocytes, in both normal and abnormal differentiation, may not be a melanoblast (a primitive cell committed to melanocytic differentiation) but rather a pluripotential cell. Although axon-investing Schwann cells have been the traditional focus as the closest relative of the epidermal melanocyte, recent studies suggest that another nerve sheath cell, the perineural cell, might be a better candidate. These concepts have profound implications for the histogenesis of melanocytic nevi and melanomas. 
3	Emergency department approach to managing seizures in pregnancy. Seizures in pregnancy pose risks for both the mother and the fetus and must be managed aggressively. Antiepileptic drugs have some teratogenic potential, but the risks are not as profound as reported in earlier literature. There is definitely less risk to the fetus from anticonvulsant exposure than from uncontrolled seizures. The evaluation of a pregnant woman with new-onset seizures is the same as for the nonpregnant patient, including head computed tomography with appropriate abdominal shielding. Status epilepticus management is based on IV benzodiazepines, phenytoin, or phenobarbital. Good fetal outcome is dependent on rapid seizure control. Management of eclampsia is controversial. There is little evidence that magnesium sulfate has anticonvulsant properties, and its use as such will probably decline steadily in the future. At present, it is reasonable to manage eclamptic seizures in the same way that status epilepticus is managed. 
1	Historical review of pancreaticoduodenectomy. The performance of pancreaticoduodenectomy by Whipple in 1935 demonstrated that the operation was feasible technically and compatible with reasonable function after recovery. From the mid- to late 1940s until the last 10 years, the procedure was condemned by many because of its associated mortality and morbidity. For reasons that are not clear, the risk of pancreaticoduodenectomy in the last 10 years has fallen to less than 10% and in several centers, less than 5%. Postoperative complications have been reduced and blood transfusions are unnecessary in an increasing number of patients. Furthermore, a normal productive life without the need for medication and with no digestive disorder is expected. Seventy-one percent of patients are able to return to their preoperative occupation. 
5	Monocortical miniplate fixation of mandibular angle fractures. Noncompression monocortical miniplate fixation of mandibular fractures has become a reliable method of providing rigid fixation and eliminating the need for intermaxillary fixation. Recent studies, using a variety of internal fixation techniques, have described high complication rates at the mandibular angle. This article compares the use of one miniplate vs two miniplates in treatment of angle fractures. Since September 1985, 61 patients with 63 mandibular angle fractures have been treated with miniplates. Forty-four fractures were fixed with two miniplates. Six complications (3.1%) occurred, five of which were in the one-miniplate group. The complication rate in the double-miniplate group is the lowest reported of any plating technique. The use of two miniplates has proved to be an effective method of treating mandibular angle fractures. 
1	Cystic dilatation of the cystic duct: a new type of biliary cyst. A case of a patient with a congenital cyst that was localized solely to the cystic duct is presented. We propose including this anomaly in the biliary cyst classifications, which currently include choledochal and intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary cysts. The diagnosis and management of this new type of cyst in addition to other types of biliary cysts are discussed. 
5	Isolated calf venous thrombosis: diagnosis with compression US. Compression ultrasound (US) is an excellent means of evaluating the femoral and popliteal veins but is generally regarded as inadequate for the diagnosis of calf vein thrombosis. This prospective study evaluated compression sonography of the calf veins in 45 symptomatic patients with normal femoral and popliteal veins. All patients underwent correlative venography. Compression US enabled identification of 15 of 17 patients with calf vein thrombosis (sensitivity, 88%). The two false-negative results were in patients with small isolated thrombi. Compression US results were true-negative in 26 of 27 patients with normal venograms (specificity, 96%). If these results can be duplicated by other investigators in larger series of patients, compression US will be an adequate screening modality for calf vein thrombosis. 
1	Serum tumor markers and patient allocation to good-risk and poor-risk clinical trials in patients with germ cell tumors. The allocation of patients with advanced germ cell tumors (GCT) to different treatment programs based on clinical characteristics is standard in the design of clinical trials today. Studies have shown that substantial differences exist between entry criteria and that these differences could influence the outcome of clinical trials. The factors contributing to these differences are not clear due to patient selection biases. Two hundred five unselected and consecutive patients allocated to and treated in good-risk and poor-risk treatment programs at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were reassigned risk status by the Indiana University (IU) Classification. The results were compared with those of the Southeastern Cancer Study Group (SECSG). The results using both criteria indicated substantial agreement in total end results and the identification of good-risk patients. The results in poor-risk patients differed substantially, with 39 patients (19%) classified as poor-risk by MSKCC criteria and 66 (32%) by Indiana criteria. The major discrepancy occurred in IU Stage 7, in which 26 of 32 patients (81%) achieved a complete response. The major factor contributing to this difference in risk assignment was the use of serum tumor markers. Serum tumor markers must be incorporated into risk assignment criteria for GCT clinical trials to minimize the number of good-risk GCT patients in poor-risk trials. 
1	Melanocytic hyperplasia of the oral mucosa. Lesions that exhibit melanocytic hyperplasia are uncommon in the oral mucosa. They are even more rare than the various morphologic types of nevomelanocytic lesions. This article reports the clinicopathologic features of oral lesions diagnosed as lentigo simplex, junctional lentigo ("jentigo"), atypical melanocytic hyperplasia (melanoma in situ), and melanocanthoma. The proper terminology for these lesions is also discussed. 
5	Bismuth subsalicylate in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children: a clinical study. Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) and placebo were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study as adjunct to rehydration therapy in 123 children, aged 4 to 28 months, hospitalized with acute diarrhea. The dosing regimen was 20 mg/kg five times daily for 5 days. Significant benefits were noted in the BSS group compared with placebo as manifested by decreases in stool frequency and stool weights and an improvement in stool consistency, significant improvement in clinical well-being, and shortening of the disease duration. Patients treated with BSS had a significant reduction in duration of hospital stay (6.9 days) compared with placebo-treated patients (8.5 days). Also, intravenous fluid requirements decreased significantly more rapidly and to a greater degree in the BSS-treated group. Bismuth subsalicylate was associated with clearance of pathogenic Escherichia coli from the stools in 100% of cases but was not different from placebo in rotavirus elimination. Bismuth subsalicylate was well tolerated with no reported adverse effects. Blood bismuth and serum salicylate levels were well below levels considered toxic. In this study, BSS provided effective adjunctive therapy for acute diarrhea, allowing children to get well sooner with less demand on the nursing and hospital staff. 
3	Flow cytometric DNA content of adenoid cystic carcinoma of submandibular gland. Correlation of histologic features and prognosis. Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content was performed in 26 adenoid cystic carcinomas of the submandibular gland using archived, paraffin-embedded tissues. The DNA content was compared with multiple histologic parameters and clinical course. Ten carcinomas (38%) were aneuploid and 16 (62%) diploid. Aneuploid carcinomas demonstrated a higher frequency of solid cytoarchitecture, lymph node metastases, and advanced clinical stage, as compared with diploid carcinomas. Other histologic features predicting aggressive clinical behavior also correlated with abnormal DNA content and included invasion of nerves larger than 0.25 mm and intravascular extension. Our data suggest that DNA content analysis can be an effective objective parameter in the clinicopathologic assessment of adenoid cystic carcinoma. 
5	Blood conservation in cardiac surgery. We reviewed current blood conservation techniques and their use in cardiac surgery. Avoidance of aspirin preoperatively is an important blood conservation measure. Patients scheduled for an elective operation should participate in autologous predonation programs. With careful monitoring, patients with major coronary artery disease can safely donate blood preoperatively. Intraoperative processing of blood withdrawn before cardiopulmonary bypass provides autologous platelet-rich plasma for infusion after reversal of heparin sodium. Blood collected from the field during operation and blood remaining in the oxygenator after bypass can also be processed to yield washed and concentrated red blood cells for reinfusion. Randomized, prospective studies document that postoperative autotransfusion is both safe and effective in reducing homologous blood use. Aprotinin reduces plasma protein activation and platelet damage during bypass. The integration of available blood conservation techniques into a comprehensive program combined with careful consideration of the indications for transfusion may allow more patients to avoid transfusion entirely. 
3	A videofluoroscopy chair for the evaluation of dysphagia in patients with severe neuromotor disease. Due to the difficulties encountered in positioning severely neurologically impaired individuals for videofluoroscopic studies, the Rehab Tech Video FluoroChair was developed. The purpose of the chair is to provide the severely disabled patient with safe, stable postural support in an upright position for videofluoroscopic studies, with anterior-posterior, lateral, and rotational views easily performed. The chair features a removable headrest, a full back support, armrests, lateral truncal supports, and a patented base which is clamped to the footboard of the radiology table and allows for 200 degrees rotation of the patient. Two case studies illustrate the practical use and versatility of the Rehab Tech Video FluoroChair. 
5	Infectious mononucleosis in older adults. Infectious mononucleosis as a manifestation of primary Epstein-Barr virus infection occurs uncommonly in adults over age 40. While fever is almost universal, older patients with the disease often present without lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, splenomegaly, lymphocytosis or atypical lymphocytes. Jaundice and hepatomegaly occur more commonly in older patients than in adolescents and create diagnostic confusion. Often, infectious mononucleosis in this age group is confused with lymphoma, leukemia or biliary obstruction, or is classified as "fever of unknown origin.". 
2	Effects of treadmill exercise on fuel metabolism in hepatic cirrhosis. We studied whole body and regional fuel metabolism before, during, and after 90 min of treadmill exercise at 50% of maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) in four subjects with hepatic cirrhosis and in four normal volunteers. Rates of endogenous glucose production (EGP) were measured using D-[6-3H]glucose infusions and fuel oxidation using indirect calorimetry. In the basal state, cirrhotic subjects had similar rates of EGP compared with controls. Forearm release of alanine and lactate was significantly greater in cirrhotic subjects (P less than 0.05), suggesting increased basal rates of gluconeogenesis. During exercise, EGP increased 2- to 2.5-fold in control subjects (P less than 0.01) but did not increase in cirrhotic subjects. Despite lower glucose concentrations in cirrhotic subjects, progressive hypoglycemia did not occur during exercise, probably because cirrhotic subjects demonstrated increased plasma concentrations of fat-derived substrates and derived a greater percentage of total energy requirement from fat oxidation than did controls (P less than 0.05) and because forearm muscle glucose extraction was significantly lower in cirrhotic subjects compared with controls (0.5 vs. 3.6%, respectively; P less than 0.05). During recovery, control subjects demonstrated significant increases in EGP rates compared with both the basal and exercise periods, but cirrhotic subjects showed no increase. In conclusion, cirrhotic subjects failed to demonstrate the normal increase in EGP during and after exercise. Significant hypoglycemia during exercise did not occur, possibly because of the increased availability of fat-derived fuels, which may spare the requirement for circulating glucose as an oxidative fuel for exercising muscle tissues. 
1	Amplification of oncogenes in mammary carcinoma shown by fine-needle biopsy. A procedure that measures the amplification of oncogenes in human cancer cells is described. The cells were obtained by fine-needle biopsy to allow repeated sampling from individual metastases. A drawback was the low number of cells obtained, but this could be overcome by using a slot-blot hybridization technique to measure gene amplification. Two patients with mammary cancer (primary tumors or metastases), analyzed for the levels of amplification of the oncogene erb-B2, are described in detail. This technique is suitable for analyzing alterations occurring during cancer progression and for identifying subgroups of mammary cancer with different characteristics. 
5	Delta sleep ratio. A biological correlate of early recurrence in unipolar affective disorder. Slow wave sleep abnormalities have long been described in depression but were considered to be nonspecific indicators of psychopathology. Computerized techniques, including amplitude frequency measures and spectral analyses, are permitting new approaches to the examination of delta sleep. Early studies suggested that many depressed patients demonstrate lower delta wave intensity during the first non-rapid eye movement period than the second one. This finding, prominent in middle-aged depressed patients, has led to an examination of the ratio between the first and second non-rapid eye movement periods. This delta sleep measure seems to be a more robust predictor of recurrence than rapid eye movement latency. Analysis of data on 74 patients in a long-term maintenance treatment study for a minimum of 24 months demonstrates that the delta sleep ratio can predict survival time following discontinuation of drug treatment. Individuals with a high delta sleep ratio remain clinically remitted five times longer than those with a low delta sleep ratio. 
4	The frequency-dependent behavior of cerebral autoregulation. Cerebral autoregulation is a complex physiological process composed of both fast and slow components that may respond differently to different rates and patterns of blood pressure variation. To assess the temporal nature of autoregulation, transcranial Doppler velocity recordings of the middle cerebral artery obtained over prolonged periods were compared with blood pressure recordings in 5 patients without cerebral disease and in 13 patients with intracranial pathological changes. Correlations between the velocity and pressure wave forms at various frequencies of variation were measured with systems analysis techniques. Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage had high correlations indicating pressure-dependent flow and impaired autoregulation. Patients without cerebral disease had significantly lower correlations (P less than 0.01), indicating intact autoregulation. Examples of increasing correlations and correlations at new frequencies emerging as the clinical condition worsened are given. These preliminary examples suggest that the application of systems analysis techniques to velocity and pressure data allow measurement of the temporal nature of cerebral autoregulation. 
5	Neurologic complications of cardiac transplantation. Between 1984 and 1989, orthotopic cardiac transplantations were done in 90 patients from 10 to 65 years of age for end-stage, refractory congestive cardiomyopathy. Two patients had had ischemic strokes 5 months and 18 years, respectively, before transplantation. Six patients (7%) suffered acute neurologic events perioperatively. Three patients suffered cerebral infarctions. In 1 case this occurred 10 days before transplantation--probably as a result of systemic hypoperfusion--with the placement of ventricular assist devices. Two others suffered infarctions 5 and 21 days, respectively, after transplantation, each of probable embolic origin. Two patients had an acute intracerebral hemorrhage 21 and 36 days, respectively, after transplantation; both were located within the basal ganglia and subcortical regions. Both patients had moderate to severe hypertension, and in 1, renal failure and a coagulopathy developed before hemorrhage. Tremor, seizures, and an altered level of consciousness developed in 1 patient as an apparent toxic reaction to cyclosporine treatment. Only 1 patient died as a result of the neurologic complication--of an acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Three patients recovered fully, 2 partially. Only the case of drug toxicity could be directly attributed to the transplantation procedure itself. We conclude that the risk of an acute neurologic insult with orthotopic cardiac transplantation is low but may result from drug toxicity, cerebral ischemia, or hemorrhagic mechanisms. 
2	Primary solid neoplasms of the greater omentum. Primary solid tumors of the greater omentum are rare, with only 42 reported cases. Malignant hemangiopericytomas constitute only three of these cases. The 40-year-old patient described in this report had abdominal pain, a palpable abdominal mass, early satiety, and weight loss. At laparotomy a large omental hemangiopericytoma was excised, and no other evidence of disease was grossly evident. Eighteen months after initial laparotomy, the patient had widespread progression of the tumor and, despite chemotherapy, died 2 months later. A review of reported cases shows that abdominal discomfort (56%) and mass (35%) are the most common clinical characteristics of a primary omental tumor. Weight loss, ascites, and peritoneal implants usually indicate malignancy. Rare long-term follow-up prevents definitive conclusions regarding therapy and prognosis. At present, surgical excision alone appears to be the treatment of choice, with no demonstrable benefit from either chemotherapy or radiation. 
5	Acute limb ischaemia: the place of intravenous streptokinase. Intravenous streptokinase infusions (100,000 units/h) have been used to treat 48 patients, with 50 episodes of acute limb ischaemia who were unlikely to benefit from a surgical approach. These included 17 acute thromboses, 14 late or distal emboli and 19 bypass graft occlusions. Overall, 17 (34 per cent) instances had complete lysis with reappearance of distal pulses and a further 28 per cent had clinical improvement without change in pulse status. Final outcome after 30 days was limb salvage in 60 per cent, amputation in 24 per cent and death in 16 per cent, but this was achieved after eight patients without lysis had vascular reconstructive surgery. Serious complications were infrequent, but included a fatal stroke, a haematemesis and two episodes of distal embolization. The outcome was not related to the duration of ischaemia or the site of occlusion. Lysis was more frequent with emboli (50 per cent) and graft occlusions (47 per cent) than arterial thromboses (6 per cent). Limb salvage was more likely in patients with no neurological deficit in the limb (70 per cent) than if a deficit was present (37 per cent). In conclusion, intravenous streptokinase produced a moderate benefit with low morbidity and has a role in acute limb ischaemia if surgery is inappropriate and intra-arterial lysis unavailable. In particular, selected patients with emboli or graft occlusions without a neurological deficit may be most suitable. 
5	Simultaneous operative repair of multilevel lower extremity occlusive disease. Sixty-two patients (39 men (63%), 23 women (27%), mean age 68 years) with multilevel lower extremity arterial occlusive disease underwent simultaneous inflow and outflow operative arterial repair consisting of aortofemoral bypass in 22 (35%), axillofemoral bypass in 17 (28%), femorofemoral bypass in 15 (24%), iliac endarterectomy in 7 (11%), and unilateral aortoiliac bypass in 1 (2%), combined with 69 outflow procedures (unilateral in 55 patients, 89%), including above-knee femoropopliteal in 12 (17%), below-knee femoropopliteal in 35 (51%), femoroinfrapopliteal in 20 (29%), popliteal tibial in 1 (1%), and femoropedal bypass in 1 (1%). Multiple criteria were used to identify patients with multilevel disease likely to benefit from multilevel procedures. The operations were performed by two operating teams in a median time of 240 minutes. Prosthetic grafts were used for eight (13%) distal bypasses, the remainder were autogenous vein. There was one operative death (1.8%). The mortality rate, morbidity rate, and operative time were not significantly different from a group of patients who underwent concurrent, isolated inflow operations (aortofemoral, axillobifemoral, femorofemoral bypass or iliac endarterectomy). Mean follow-up was 14.9 months (range, 0 to 120). The life-table primary patency for the inflow procedures was 92.6% at 24 months, the outflow was 94.9% at 24 months. Cumulative limb salvage was 90.9% at 48-month follow-up. All patients with claudication were relieved of their symptoms. We conclude that complete correction of multilevel disease can be accomplished with operative time, morbidity rate, and patency equal to that of single level repair. Multilevel procedures provide complete relief of symptoms in a higher percentage of patients than has been reported after single level repair. 
4	Results of coronary surgery after failed elective coronary angioplasty in patients with prior coronary surgery The results of coronary artery bypass surgery after failed elective coronary angioplasty in patients who have undergone prior coronary surgery are unknown. Coronary angioplasty may be performed to relieve angina after surgery either to the native coronary vessels or to grafts. Failure of attempted coronary angioplasty may mandate repeat coronary surgery, often in the setting of acute ischemia. From 1980 to 1989, 1,263 patients with prior coronary bypass surgery underwent angioplasty; of these patients, 46 (3.6%) underwent reoperation for failed angioplasty during the same hospital stay. Of the 46 patients who underwent reoperation, 33 had and 13 did not have acute ischemia. In the group with ischemia, 3 patients (9.1%) died and 14 (42.4%) died or had a Q wave myocardial infarction in the hospital compared with no deaths (p = NS) and no deaths or Q wave myocardial infarction (p = 0.005) in the group without ischemia. At 3 years, the actuarial survival rate was 88 +/- 6% in the group with ischemia, whereas there were no deaths in the group without ischemia (p = NS), and freedom from death or myocardial infarction was 51 +/- 10% in the group with ischemia, versus no events in the group without ischemia (p = 0.006). In most patients with prior coronary bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty was performed without the need for repeat coronary bypass surgery. Should coronary angioplasty fail, reoperation in patients without acute ischemia can be performed with overall patient survival comparable to that of elective reoperative coronary bypass without coronary angioplasty. 
2	Human hepatic regenerative stimulator substance: partial purification and biological characterization of hepatic stimulator substance from human fetal liver cells. Current support or replacement therapies for fulminant acute hepatic failure are frequently very disappointing. In this study, human hepatic stimulator substance--a liver-specific growth factor--was partially purified from human fetal liver cells and characterized by its biological effects. Almost 70-fold protein content was purified with an approximately 80-fold increase in specific growth stimulator activity. Human hepatic stimulator substance proved to be heat-stable, protease-sensitive, organ-specific and species-nonspecific. Human hepatic stimulator substance produced a two- to threefold increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA when injected intraperitoneally into growing weanling mice (nonhepatectomized) or regenerating rats (34% hepatectomy). The effects of hHSS in reversing the lethality of D-galactosamine (1.6 gm/kg body weight)-induced hepatic necrosis in rats were further evaluated. A survival rate of 4% (n = 24), 41% (n = 12, p less than 0.05), 33% (n = 12, p less than 0.05), 31% (n = 13, p less than 0.05) and 18% (n = 11, p greater than 0.05) was observed when the rats were injected with 4 ml of saline intraperitoneally, 4 ml of human intact fetal hepatocytes (2.4 x 10(8] intraperitoneally, 4 ml of human hepatic stimulator substance intraperitoneally, 2 ml of twofold concentrated human hepatic stimulator substance intravenously and 1 ml of fourfold human hepatic stimulator substance intramuscularly, respectively, 20 hr after poisoning. 
5	HLA-D locus associations in alopecia areata. DRw52a may confer disease resistance. Because predisposition to autoimmunity has been associated with HLA-D alleles and alopecia areata is hypothesized to be a T-cell mediated autoimmune hair loss, we determined DR and DQ alleles in 88 white and 10 American black patients with alopecia areata as well as controls with the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism typing with cDNA probes. White patients with alopecia areata have an increase in the phenotype frequencies of DR4 and DQw8 and an increase in genotype frequencies of DR4 and DR5 (now DRw11[5]). These associations are in agreement with those reported in two other studies but are not significant when corrected by the number of HLA antigens tested. Sixty-one percent of all patients with AA have DR4 and/or DRw11(5) specificities vs 40% of controls, with more DR4,DRw11(5) and DQw7(w3), DQw8(w3) heterozygotes among patients. DQw6(w1) phenotype frequencies and DRw52a phenotype and genotype frequencies are significantly decreased in patients with alopecia areata relative to controls. This highly significant negative association with the HLA DRB3 allele DRw52a in whites persisted even when DR4- or DRw11(5)-positive individuals were excluded from the patient and control groups. These data suggest that HLA-DR4 and DRw11(5) with their associated DQw7(w3) and DQw8(w3) specificities may confer susceptibility to alopecia areata, while DRw52a may confer resistance. 
5	Outcome of patients with chronic affective disorder: a five-year follow-up. Patients with major depression, mania, or schizo-affective disorder that had been present without remission for 2 years or more at intake (N = 129) were followed prospectively for 5 years, as were 580 patients who had been ill for shorter periods at intake. Despite very substantial durations of episode, three-quarters of the chronic patients recovered, although recovery occurred much later in the follow-up period than it did among the nonchronic patients. Factors associated with recovery were less severe illness at intake, lack of psychotic features, good friendship patterns in adolescence, and, most important, a relatively high maximum level of functioning in the 5 years preceding intake. 
1	Primary invasive carcinoma of the vagina. A retrospective review was conducted of 53 women with invasive carcinoma of the vagina and without documented exposure to diethylstilbestrol who were seen at the University of California Irvine Medical Center, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, and Saddleback Memorial Medical Center from 1976-1988. Forty-seven (89%) had squamous cell carcinoma and six (11%) adenocarcinoma. Thirty-seven (70%) were treated with whole-pelvis irradiation and brachytherapy, nine with surgery alone, and the other seven with a combination of treatments. The crude and corrected 2-year survival rates for the entire group were 47 and 69%, respectively. Those with previous pelvic surgery were more likely to develop serious treatment-related complications. There was a statistically significant correlation between previous hysterectomy and the diagnosis of primary invasive carcinoma of the vagina after the onset of symptoms. Women diagnosed during routine examination, before symptom onset, tended to have a survival advantage. All women, including those who have had hysterectomy, should be counseled to continue gynecologic cancer surveillance regardless of age. 
1	Frequent mutation of the p53 gene in human esophageal cancer. Sequence alterations in the p53 gene have been detected in human tumors of the brain, breast, lung, and colon, and it has been proposed that p53 mutations spanning a major portion of the coding region inactivate the tumor suppressor function of this gene. To our knowledge, neither transforming mutations in oncogenes nor mutations in tumor suppressor genes have been reported in human esophageal tumors. We examined four human esophageal carcinoma cell lines and 14 human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing for the presence of p53 mutations in exons 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Two cell lines and five of the tumor specimens contained a mutated allele (one frameshift and six missense mutations). All missense mutations detected occurred at G.C base pairs in codons at or adjacent to mutations previously reported in other cancers. The identification of aberrant p53 gene alleles in one-third of the tumors we tested suggests that mutations at this locus are common genetic events in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus. 
1	Adenocarcinoma arising in a foregut cyst of the mediastinum. A case of malignant transformation in a mediastinal cyst of the esophageal reduplication type is presented. The cyst had been recognized 39 years previously, but remained asymptomatic until sudden growth occurred. It was resected totally from the esophagus and the patient recovered well. A review of the literature showed that malignancy in mediastinal foregut cysts is extremely rare. 
5	Methylation-sensitive sequence-specific DNA binding by the c-Myc basic region. The function of the c-Myc oncoprotein and its role in cell growth control is unclear. A basic region of c-Myc is structurally related to the basic motifs of helix-loop-helix (HLH) and leucine zipper proteins, which provide sequence-specific DNA binding function. The c-Myc basic region was tested for its ability to bind DNA by attaching it to the HLH dimerization interface of the E12 enhancer binding factor. Dimers of the chimeric protein, termed E6, specifically bound an E box element (GGCCACGTGACC) recognized by other HLH proteins in a manner dependent on the integrity of the c-Myc basic motif. Methylation of the core CpG in the E box recognition site specifically inhibited binding by E6, but not by two other HLH proteins. Expression of E6 (but not an E6 DNA binding mutant) suppressed the ability of c-myc to cooperate with H-ras in a rat embryo fibroblast transformation assay, suggesting that the DNA recognition specificity of E6 is related to that of c-Myc in vivo. 
4	Atrial activation sequence during atrial flutter in the canine pericarditis model and its effects on the polarity of the flutter wave in the electrocardiogram. Stable atrial flutter induced in both conscious and open chest states was studied in 30 mongrel dogs after production of sterile pericarditis. During the conscious state studies, induced atrial flutter (mean cycle length 128 +/- 15 ms) was always sustained greater than 15 min and was stable. Three types of flutter wave polarity were noted in electrocardiogram (ECG) lead II: positive in 16 dogs, negative in 3 and flat or slightly positive in 11. Sequential site atrial mapping during atrial flutter (mean cycle length 133 +/- 18 ms) in the open chest state showed either clockwise (18 dogs) or counterclockwise (12 dogs) circus movement in the right atrium. In 19 of 30 dogs, the circus movement clearly did not require any naturally existing anatomic obstacle; in 11, the orifice of the superior vena cava probably was also involved. Double potentials were recorded from the center of the reentrant circuit during atrial flutter, and fractionated electrograms were recorded from a pivot point of the reentrant wave front. A positive flutter wave in ECG lead II (12 dogs with counterclockwise circus movement) was associated with early activation of the Bachmann's bundle region compared with the posteroinferior left atrium and activation of the left atrium mainly in a superoinferior direction. A negative flutter was associated with the early activation of the posteroinferior left atrium compared with Bachmann's bundle and activation of a considerable portion of the left atrium in an inferosuperior direction. A flat or slightly positive flutter wave (14 of 18 with clockwise circus movement) was associated with activation of the left atrium almost simultaneously by two wave fronts coming from both these sites. In conclusion, atrial flutter in this dog model is due to circus movement in the right atrium, the center of which does not necessarily require an anatomic obstacle. Although atrial flutter is generated by circus movement in the right atrium, the flutter wave polarity in the ECG is determined primarily by the activation sequence of the left atrium. 
4	Epidemiologic studies demonstrating increased morning incidence of sudden cardiac death. To determine if sudden cardiac death shows a circadian variation, the mortality records of the Massachusetts population and the Framingham Heart Study were analyzed. The Massachusetts mortality data analysis revealed an increased morning incidence for out-of-hospital cardiac deaths similar to that previously described for nonfatal myocardial infarction. The records of the Framingham Heart Study allowed more comprehensive analysis of the time of sudden cardiac death. In this study, a prominent circadian variation was also identified in which frequency of sudden cardiac death increased sharply between 6 A.M. and 9 P.M.; distribution was fairly even throughout the rest of the day. This circadian pattern may be explained in part by physiologic changes that increase the likelihood of ventricular fibrillation or increase the risk of thrombosis in the morning hours. The possible role of the morning increase in physical and mental activity as a trigger of sudden cardiac death requires further investigation. 
2	Prune belly syndrome in females: a triad of abdominal musculature deficiency and anomalies of the urinary and genital systems. We describe seven female patients with deficient abdominal wall musculature and urinary tract and genital anomalies that represent the female equivalent of the prune belly syndrome. Urethral atresia, uterine duplication, and anorectal anomalies occurred frequently. The perinatal mortality rate was high; of the four surviving patients, renal failure developed in two and renal transplantation was required. The analysis of these cases suggests that urethral obstruction is an important factor contributing to the development of the prune belly syndrome in females. 
1	Marijuana smoking as a possible cause of tongue carcinoma in young patients. A case of T1N0M0 carcinoma of the tongue in a male 23-year-old 'regular' marijuana smoker is described. Hemiglossectomy and complete bilateral neck dissection were carried out. No post-operative radiotherapy was given as the resection margins were histologically negative. The tumour recurred one year later in the left cervical region involving the mandible and surgery was again performed, but after three months, neck disease was still evident. The case described case implies the introduction of marijuana as a possible new risk factor in the development of oral cavity tumours. Resection of the primary lesion has to be as wide as possible even in T1 cases, due to the aggressive biological behaviour of such tumours in young subjects. 
1	Oral zidovudine, continuous-infusion fluorouracil, and oral leucovorin calcium: a phase I study. A phase I clinical, pharmacologic, and biochemical evaluation of escalating oral zidovudine (AZT) given over 2 days with a fixed dose of continuous-infusion fluorouracil (800 mg/m2 per day X 3 days) and oral leucovorin calcium was performed. Eighteen patients were treated with doses of AZT ranging from 1.0 to 9.0 g/m2 per day. Nausea and vomiting were dose limiting, with a maximally tolerated dose of 7.5 g/m2 per day. Rash and mucositis occurred but were not dose limiting. A dose-related increase in peak plasma levels of AZT was observed, and the alpha half-life of AZT in plasma (75 min) was unaffected by these high doses. At doses above 4.0 g/m2 per day, trough levels significantly increased, perhaps reflecting prolonged absorption from the gut. No responses were observed; however, a significant increase in DNA single-strand breaks was observed in peripheral blood cells after a threshold dose of 4.0 g/m2 per day, confirming a biological effect of AZT in this regimen. Further trials with an intravenous formulation capable of maintaining plasma levels and circumventing dose-limiting toxicity are warranted. 
5	Ultrasonographic detection of the second-trimester fetus with trisomy 18 and trisomy 21. Biparietal diameter/femur length ratio and nuchal thickness were found to be sensitive indicators for the prenatal detection of trisomy 18 and trisomy 21. A biparietal diameter/femur length ratio greater than 1.5 SD above the control mean correctly identified 5 of 11 (46%) fetuses with trisomy 21 and 3 of 4 (75%) fetuses with trisomy 18. Nuchal thickening (6 mm or more) correctly identified 5 of 12 (41%) fetuses with trisomy 21 and 2 of 4 (50%) fetuses with trisomy 18. The sensitivity and specificity of the biparietal diameter/femur length ratio in detecting either aneuploidy was 53% and 93%, respectively, whereas a thickened nuchal fold had a sensitivity of 44% and a specificity of 100%. The combined use of the two ultrasonographic measurements had an overall sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 93%. Prospective ascertainment of these two trisomies appears warranted in low-risk populations. 
2	Esophageal adenocarcinoma in a patient with surgically treated achalasia. Although squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus occurs with increased incidence in primary achalasia, esophageal adenocarcinoma has been considered rare in this condition. We report a patient with long-standing achalasia in whom adenocarcinoma of the esophagus occurred many years after Heller esophagomyotomy, presumably related to Barrett's esophagus complicating gastro-esophageal reflux disease. 
5	Rupture of atheromatous plaque as a cause of thrombotic occlusion of stenotic internal carotid artery. We analyzed the clinical profiles and autopsy findings of five patients who died shortly after developing cerebral infarction following thrombotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery. In all five cases, thrombotic occlusion was caused by rupture of the fibrous lining over the gruel of atheroma at the origin of the internal carotid artery showing tight stenosis of the lumen. The mean +/- SD shorter diameter of the lumen at the site of occlusion was 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm. Our results show that an internal carotid artery with tight stenosis of the lumen by atheroma containing gruel harbors a risk of thrombotic occlusion, which may give rise to cerebral infarction by artery-to-artery embolism or by reduced cerebral perfusion. 
1	Psychoneuroimmunology. Implications for oncology? Accumulating evidence indicates that the central nervous system (CNS) may regulate the activity of the immune system. Although the overall significance of the immune system in cancer remains controversial, psychosocial influences on immune function could potentially provide a mechanism to account for some of the reports of an association between psychosocial factors and cancer prognosis. 
4	Coronary collateral recruitment: functional significance and relation to rate of vessel closure. Studies in animals and humans have demonstrated the anatomic presence and functional significance of coronary collaterals. The extent of collateralization varies among species and among individuals. Collateral vessels are usually adequate for preserving resting regional and global ventricular function in the face of coronary obstruction. During stress, however, collateral supply may be inadequate. Collateral development is a time-dependent process during both the initial occlusion and following transient reflow and reclosure. Therefore when a previously collateralized coronary occlusion is recanalized and then recloses, the extent of the resulting collateral recruitment will depend, at least in part, upon the period of reflow between the two occlusions. The longer the reflow period, the less enhanced will be the collateralization. This is illustrated in the cases presented and has also been demonstrated in animal studies. The exact mechanisms for this recurrent collateral recruitment need further study. 
2	Immunochemical studies of ferrochelatase protein: characterization of the normal and mutant protein in bovine and human protoporphyria. Protoporphyria is a hereditary disorder characterized by a marked decrease in the activity of ferrochelatase, the terminal enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. We have prepared specific polyvalent antibodies against bovine ferrochelatase in rabbits. The specificity of the antibody preparation against ferrochelatase was demonstrated by western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation of ferrochelatase activity. The antibody also cross-reacted weakly with ferrochelatase from human mitochondria. To quantify immunoreactive ferrochelatase in tissue samples, a kinetic-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (k-ELISA) was developed. Ferrochelatase activity and the level of immunoreactive protein were measured in hepatic mitochondria isolated from six normal and nine protoporphyric (homozygous) cattle. Ferrochelatase activity was less than 10% of normal in mitochondria from protoporphyric animals; the amount of immunoreactive material was equivalent to that from normal animals. Similar studies were performed with samples from three normal and two protoporphyric (heterozygous) humans. Ferrochelatase activity was decreased in protoporphyric samples (about 17% of normal, but there was no concomitant decrease in immunoreactive material. These data demonstrate that a normal amount of ferrochelatase protein is present and suggest that bovine and human protoporphyria result from point mutations in the gene encoding ferrochelatase. 
4	Physiology and pharmacology of cardiovascular catecholamine receptors: implications for treatment of chronic heart failure. In the sympathetic nervous system the physiologic effects of the endogenous catecholamines noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) are mediated by alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors (ARs). Both AR-types can be subdivided into two major subtypes: alpha-ARs into alpha-1 (predominant effect: vasoconstriction) and alpha-2 (presynaptic: inhibition of NA-release; postsynaptic: vasoconstriction), beta-ARs into beta-1 (cardiac effects, renal renin release, and lipolysis) and beta-2 (presynaptic: facilitation of NA-release; postsynaptic: vascular, bronchial, and uterine smooth muscle relaxation, glycogenolysis and possibly part of the A-mediated cardiac effects). During the last 30 years growing evidence has accumulated that dopamine (DA), the third endogenous catecholamine and the immediate precursor of NA, may also cause peripheral effects through stimulation of specific DA-receptors, in addition to its known action at alpha- and beta-ARs. It is now well accepted that at least two different DA-receptors are present in many peripheral tissues (DA1 and DA2), including those of the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous system. They seem to be involved in dilation of certain vascular beds, inhibition of NA-release during nerve stimulation, natriuresis, and aldosterone release. In chronic heart failure cardiac beta-AR function decreases (presumably due to endogenous "down-regulation" by the elevated catecholamines), and this decrease is related to the severity of heart failure (judged clinically by New York Heart Association functional class). The human heart contains both functional beta-1 and beta-2 ARs; cardiac beta-1 and beta-2 ARs seem to be differentially affected by different kinds of heart failure; in end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy beta-1 ARs are selectively reduced, whereas beta-2 ARs are nearly normal. 
2	Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in relation to previous use of analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Catalan Countries Study on Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding To assess the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the use of individual non-narcotic analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), a multicentre study of 875 cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and 2682 hospital controls was done. With control for confounding factors, the overall odds ratio estimate for aspirin taken at least once during the week before the first symptom was 7.2 (95% confidence interval 5.4-9.6). Non-aspirin NSAIDs associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding were diclofenac (7.9 [4.3-14.6]), indomethacin (4.9 [2.0-12.2]), naproxen (6.5 [2.2-19.6]), and piroxicam (19.1 [8.2-44.3]). Paracetamol, propyphenazone, and dipyrone did not increase the risk. A previous history of gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer did not greatly affect odds ratio estimates, which differed according to sex and were higher for younger than for older patients. However, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was higher among the elderly. 
4	Catheterization of coronary artery bypass graft from the descending aorta. The increasing frequency of reoperation for coronary artery disease has led to the use of a variety of grafts. This report describes the catheter technique for selective opacification of a saphenous vein graft from the descending thoracic aorta to the posterior coronary circulation. 
5	Percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted balloon angioplasty: initial clinical and quantitative angiographic results in 50 patients. The initial clinical experience and quantitative angiographic results of percutaneous coronary excimer laser-assisted balloon angioplasty are described for 55 lesions in 50 patients. With use of a xenon chloride (308 nm) excimer laser generator and 1.5 to 1.75 mm catheters, excimer laser angioplasty was attempted at 135 ns pulse width, 25 to 40 Hz repetition rate, 2 to 5 s laser delivery time and 30 to 60 mJ/mm2 energy fluence. Laser success (greater than 20% reduction in absolute percent diameter stenosis) was achieved in 41 (75%) of 55 lesions, with 100% subsequent balloon angioplasty success (less than 50% residual stenosis). By quantitative digital caliper technique, the percent diameter stenosis (mean +/- SE) was reduced from 81 +/- 1% to 50 +/- 3% after excimer laser angioplasty (p less than 0.001) and to 20 +/- 1% after balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001); minimal luminal diameter increased from 0.56 +/- 0.04 to 1.46 +/- 0.08 mm (p less than 0.001) and 2.03 +/- 0.07 mm (p less than 0.001), respectively. By videodensitometric techniques, the percent area stenosis decreased from 86 +/- 2% to 54 +/- 3% after excimer angioplasty (p less than 0.001) and to 26 +/- 3% after balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001). There were no perforations, need for emergency bypass surgery or deaths. The overall incidence of abrupt closure (3.6%), dissection (1.8%), embolization (1.8%), filling defect (6%), myocardial infarction (5.5%), side branch occlusion (3.6%) or spasm (3.6%) was infrequent and more related to subsequent balloon angioplasty than to the laser procedure. 
1	Immediate postoperative mammogram for failed surgical excision of breast lesions In a series of 200 consecutive preoperative needle localizations of non-palpable breast lesions, 128 lesions (64%) were calcified and 72 lesions (36%) were noncalcified on preoperative mammograms. Radiographs of the surgical specimen failed to confirm excision of 11 lesions (5.5%), seven calcified and four noncalcified. These 11 patients were taken directly from the surgical suite to the radiology suite, where an immediate postoperative mammogram was obtained. In five patients (2.5%), immediate postoperative mammograms showed surgical failure with the lesion still present. In six patients (3.0%), immediate postoperative mammograms showed that the lesion had been removed, even though the lesion had not been identified on surgical-specimen radiographs. No errors occurred in the interpretation of immediate postoperative mammograms, a fact corroborated by examination of surgical specimens obtained at repeat surgery in three patients and identification of skin calcifications in two patients, and with follow-up mammograms in six patients. Whenever a discrepancy between preoperative localization radiographs and surgical-specimen radiographs exists, the authors suggest immediate postoperative mammography to improve the diagnostic process. 
2	Early antibiotic treatment of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infections: clinical and serological study. OBJECTIVE--To find out whether a 10-14 days' course of antibiotics early in the course of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infections could reduce the severity and duration of the disease and whether the antibody response in patients with reactive arthritis associated with yersinia infection differed between those treated and those not treated with the antibiotics. DESIGN--Prospective multicentre trial in which patients were randomised to treatment or no treatment with antibiotics. Patients were seen at three and six weeks and three, six, nine, 12, and 18 months after their first visit. SETTING--Departments of infectious diseases in three hospitals in Linkoping, Malmo, and Stockholm, Sweden. PATIENTS--40 Consecutive patients who had had symptoms of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infection for less than four weeks. INTERVENTIONS--20 Patients were allocated to treatment with antibiotics and 20 patients did not receive antibiotics. All patients received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and four also received intra-articular steroid injections after at least six weeks' observation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Arthritic symptoms assessed clinically and by using Ritchies' index; blood measurements reflecting inflammatory activity; serum IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody titres; HLA tissue type. RESULTS--No difference was observed concerning duration of arthritis, grade of inflammation, and number of joints affected between patients treated and those not treated with antibiotics. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the two groups in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and haptoglobin, IgG, and IgA concentrations. All values had returned to normal within three months. No patient developed chronic arthritis, but sustained slight arthralgia occurred in three patients. The HLA-B27 antigen was found in 23 (58%) of the patients, and its presence did not affect clinical outcome. The IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody responses were similar in patients treated with antibiotics and those not treated. CONCLUSION--Short term antibiotic treatment has no beneficial effect on the clinical outcome of reactive arthritis associated with enteric infection. 
4	Sensitivity of a set of myocardial infarction screening criteria in patients with anatomically documented single and multiple infarcts. A subset of 3 screening criteria (Q wave greater than or equal to 30 ms in lead aVF, any Q or R wave less than or equal to 10 ms and less than or equal to 0.1 mV in lead V2, and R wave greater than or equal to 40 ms in V1) has been proposed to identify single nonacute myocardial infarcts. Cumulatively, these 3 criteria achieved 95% specificity, and 84 and 77% sensitivities for inferior and anterior myocardial infarcts, respectively, among patients identified by coronary angiography and left ventriculography. This study establishes the true sensitivities of the set of screening criteria in 71 patients with anatomically proven single myocardial infarcts and 32 patients with multiple myocardial infarcts. In the single inferior infarct group, the aVF criterion was 90% sensitive. The V2 criterion (any Q or R wave less than or equal to 10 ms and less than or equal to 0.1 mV) was 67% sensitive in the single anterior infarct group. No single criterion proved sensitive in identifying a posterolateral infarct. The set of screening criteria performed just as well for multiple infarcts as it did for single infarcts, with a cumulative sensitivity of 72%. The overall sensitivity of the screening set in the 103 patients in all groups was 71%. 
4	Computed tomography in the evaluation of the aorta in patients sustaining blunt chest trauma. Computed tomography is used with increasing frequency to evaluate blunt chest trauma. Since traumatic aortic rupture (TAR) is a rapidly lethal condition, unnecessary CT scanning may not be justified. To determine the accuracy of chest CT scanning for TAR, we reviewed 17 patients who underwent both chest CT scanning and aortography. Five patients had TAR by aortography. CT scanning yielded three true positives and two false negatives. In 12 patients with a negative aortogram, CT scanning recorded four false positives and eight true negatives. The specificity was 23% and the sensitivity was 83% compared with aortography. The overall accuracy for CT scanning was 53%. From these data we conclude that in the presence of an unstable patient or where there is a strong clinical suspicion of TAR the patient should proceed directly to aortography. 
4	Lung thallium-201 uptake during exercise emission computed tomography. To test whether the analysis of lung uptake is worth adding to the interpretation of exercise thallium-201 (201TI) emission computed tomography (ECT), a lung/heart ratio of 201TI uptake was measured from an anterior image during ECT in 25 clinically normal (Group 1), 91 angiographically normal (Group 2), and 265 subjects with coronary artery disease (Group 3). The mean +2 s.d. of ratios in Groups 1 and 2 were the same (0.37). In Group 3, 80 subjects (30%) with increased ratios (greater than 0.37) had higher frequencies of prior infarction and multi-vessel disease, more severe left ventricular dysfunction, and 201TI defects than 185 subjects with normal ratios. Subjects with markedly increased ratios (greater than 0.45) had three-vessel disease more frequently than those with slightly or moderately increased ratios (67% versus 14% or 35%). Thus the measurement of lung/heart ratios may provide information regarding the severity of coronary artery disease and should be added to the routine interpretation of exercise ECT. 
1	Transferrin receptor activity as a marker in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. An immunohistochemical staining method was used to study transferrin receptors (TFR) in bladder tissue from 10 patients with benign conditions and 33 with bladder cancer. All patients with bladder cancer were followed up by cystoscopy at intervals of 3 months (mean follow-up period 11 months). The relationship between TFR activity and recurrence rates was investigated. It was not possible to demonstrate TFR in normal bladder mucosa except for the proliferating cells of the basal layer. TFR activity in malignant tissue correlated well with the histological grade and pathological stage of the tumour. Patients with low grade superficial tumours showing TFR activity had a higher recurrence rate than those with no TFR activity. It was concluded that TFR activity in low grade superficial bladder tumours is a useful marker for predicting the recurrence rate. 
5	Plasma neurotransmitters and cortisol in duodenal ulcer patients. Role of stress. Levels of noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, free serotonin, platelet serotonin, and cortisol were measured in the plasma of duodenal ulcer patients and controls. All subjects received antacids, and these substances were also measured. During relapse, all patients showed raised noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, free serotonin, and cortisol values. In contrast, platelet serotonin showed very low values, which correlated negatively with all the former, except free serotonin. No correlations were found in parameters of the controls. After healing, significant reductions of noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, free serotonin, and cortisol and significant increases of platelet serotonin values were observed. However, only dopamine, free serotonin, and cortisol reached normal values. Noradrenaline and adrenaline remained higher and platelet serotonin lower, both significantly more so than normals. These still-altered parameters showed similar correlations to those found during relapses. The present results demonstrate that some baseline autonomic system imbalance exists in patients, amplified and accentuated during relapse. We discuss the possibility that stress plays some role in triggering duodenal ulcer relapse. 
1	Regulation of gene expression with double-stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. Alteration of gene transcription by inhibition of specific transcriptional regulatory proteins is necessary for determining how these factors participate in cellular differentiation. The functions of these proteins can be antagonized by several methods, each with specific limitations. Inhibition of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins was achieved with double-stranded (ds) phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained octamer or kappa B consensus sequences. The phosphorothioate oligonucleotides specifically bound either octamer transcription factor or nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. The modified oligonucleotides accumulated in cells more effectively than standard ds oligonucleotides and modulated gene expression in a specific manner. Octamer-dependent activation of a reporter plasmid or NF-kappa B-dependent activation of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enhancer was inhibited when the appropriate phosphorothioate oligonucleotide was added to a transiently transfected B cell line. Addition of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides that contained the octamer consensus to Jurkat T leukemia cells inhibited interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion to a degree similar to that observed with a mutated octamer site in the IL-2 enhancer. The ds phosphorothioate oligonucleotides probably compete for binding of specific transcription factors and may provide anti-viral, immunosuppressive, or other therapeutic effects. 
5	The painful shoulder: Part II. Intrinsic disorders and impingement syndrome. Intrinsic disorders that can cause shoulder pain include arthritis, gout, pseudogout and osteonecrosis. In its mildest form, impingement syndrome may cause only minimal discomfort. At its worst, impingement syndrome may lead to rotator cuff tear. Bicipital tendinitis and rupture of the biceps tendon may also be associated with impingement. Early rehabilitative intervention is important. Physical therapy is directed toward restoring range of motion and muscle strength. 
5	Ultrasound for the detection of foreign bodies. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of an emergency physician to detect a variety of foreign bodies in an experimental model using a portable ultrasound device. DESIGN: Ten pieces of beef were sliced into cubes approximately 6 cm on each side. Six different groups of foreign bodies were examined: gravel, cactus spine, glass, metal, wood, and plastic. An independent observer placed the objects in a random fashion into the beef cubes. One hundred twenty observations were made using sets of ten beef cubes at a time. Five foreign bodies were placed into each set of ten beef cubes. INTERVENTIONS: A blinded emergency physician used a portable ultrasound with a 7.5-MHz transducer to determine the presence or absence of a foreign body in each cube. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ultrasound detected 59 of 60 foreign bodies, including all cubes of meat embedded with gravel, cactus spine, plastic, metal, and wood. Glass was detected nine of ten times. Of the 60 cubes of meat with no foreign bodies, one false-positive was recorded. This yielded sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 98%. Positive determinations by ultrasound were significantly greater in the meat cubes with foreign bodies compared with the control group with no foreign bodies (P less than .001 by chi 2). Although the subset of glass foreign bodies had one false-positive and one false-negative, it was not significantly different in comparison with the other groups (P greater than .05 by chi 2). CONCLUSION: Ultrasound has promise as a diagnostic tool for the detection of a variety of foreign bodies. Further clinical studies using ultrasound for the detection of foreign bodies are warranted. 
2	Computed tomographic and ultrasonographic findings in women with acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is associated with complications that can influence antepartum management and necessitate delivery. To date, liver biopsy has been regarded as the "gold standard" for diagnosis. Radiologic evaluation of the liver has been suggested as a less invasive means of diagnosing this entity. Five patients with acute fatty liver of pregnancy underwent ultrasonography; three underwent concomitant computed tomography (CT) of the liver. The liver appeared to be normal in all the patients undergoing CT evaluation and all undergoing ultrasonography except one. Normal liver examinations are not unusual findings in patients with acute fatty liver of pregnancy. 
4	Histologic investigation of vascular malformations of the face after transarterial embolization with ethibloc and other agents. Twenty-one vascular malformations located in the facial area, 11 high-flow arteriovenous malformations and 10 slow-flow malformations, underwent combined treatment by embolization and later surgery. Embolization was performed simultaneously with superselective angiography of the branches of the external carotid artery. The new biodegradable fibrosing agent Ethibloc was used in 16 cases. Histologic examination of the surgical specimens confirmed the good target orientation by the transarterial injection of Ethibloc. Limitations of this technique are discussed. The agent proved to have thrombogenic and fibrogenic properties. Some of the vascular walls degenerated and ruptured following the embolization, but there were no instances of necrosis of interstitial tissue or skin. Embolization treatment of vascular malformations of the face was not curative, but it facilitated subsequent surgery in all examined cases. 
5	Malnutrition and acute respiratory tract infections in Filipino children. The impact of malnutrition on morbidity and mortality associated with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) was studied in Filipino children less than 5 years old. Malnutrition measured by weight-for-age Z-scores of less than -3 SD and less than -2 SD from the National Center for Health Statistics median reference population was associated with the following significant relative risks of morbidity: 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.14, 1.34) and 1.14 (95% CI = 1.08, 1.19), respectively, for ARI; and 1.9 (95% CI = 1.46, 2.39) and 1.2 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.47), respectively, for acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI). These risk ratios remained significant when adjusted for age, crowding, and parental smoking. Malnourished children with severe ALRI also had a mortality risk two to three times higher than that of healthy children. This risk remained significant even when adjusted for significant predictors of mortality, including clinical complications, concurrent measles, severe infections, and female gender; and for clinical factors, including extent of pneumonic infiltrates, dehydration, and hepatic enlargement. These findings underscore the importance of nutritional intervention in the control of morbidity and mortality among patients with ARI. 
3	Modifying the translabyrinthine approach to preserve hearing during acoustic tumour surgery. Removing an acoustic schwannoma using the translabyrinthine approach has previously been considered incompatible with hearing preservation. By modifying the approach and preventing the loss of endolymph, we have successfully removed an intracanalicular acoustic schwannoma, which originated from the inferior vestibular nerve, and preserved hearing in the operated ear. This report represents the preliminary findings using this particular technique in the management of an intracanalicular acoustic tumour. 
4	The fat embolism syndrome. A review. While fat embolism occurs in most (more than 90%) patients with traumatic injury, the fat embolism syndrome (FES) occurs in only 3%-4% of patients with long-bone fractures. FES involves multiple organ systems and can cause a devastating clinical deterioration within hours. The major clinical features of FES include hypoxia, pulmonary edema, central nervous system depression, and axillary or subconjunctive petechiae. Improvements have been made in supporting the respiratory compromise and adult respiratory distress syndrome that these patients develop. Aggressive measures to improve the pulmonary function, i.e., positive pressure ventilation and effective fluid management, are important and expedite fixation of bone fractures. 
5	Management of urinary tract infections in children. Urinary tract infection is common in children. The presentation varies with age. Younger children exhibit protean signs. Diagnosis is dependent on the demonstration of significant bacteriuria in a properly collected and handled urine sample. The approach to treatment depends on the degree of illness at presentation, the presence of structural urinary tract abnormalities, and the age of the patient. Pathophysiology of urinary tract infection is dependent on interactive factors of the host and of the invading microorganism. Urinary tract abnormalities have significant impact on the management of children with urinary tract infections, both medically and surgically. Of particular importance is the observation that renal damage usually occurs within the first 5 years of life, and treatment delay in some young patients may have significant consequences. The overall prognosis in children with urinary tract infection is favorable. 
4	Cardiac Arrest in Seattle: Conventional Versus Amiodarone Drug Evaluation (the CASCADE study). This randomized study evaluates survivors of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) not associated with a Q-wave acute myocardial infarction who are deemed to be at a high risk of recurrence of VF. It compares the outcome of treatment with empirically administered amiodarone with the outcome of treatment with other antiarrhythmic agents guided by electrophysiologic testing or Holter recording, or both. The goal of therapy guided by electrophysiologic testing is to suppress inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) or VF. Holter recording is used as the primary means of adjusting therapy only if patients are noninducible at the baseline electrophysiologic study. Patients are stratified according to cardiac diagnosis, ejection fraction, and whether they had previously received an antiarrhythmic agent that failed to suppress their arrhythmias. The primary end point of the study is total cardiac mortality. The first patient was enrolled in a pilot study on April 26, 1984. By October 1988, 142 patients had been enrolled in the full study and, as of May 1990, 199 patients have been enrolled. Compliance with therapy has been good, with no patients lost to follow-up and 8% of patients, equal in both drug groups, crossing over to alternate therapy. Baseline clinical characteristics remain similar in amiodarone and conventional drug groups. Pulmonary toxicity with amiodarone is 7% at 1 year, with no patients dying of pulmonary toxicity. In the first 142 patients, the overall 1-year cardiac mortality was 19%, with a 17% arrhythmic mortality (either VF or presumed arrhythmic death). 
4	Sports-related and non-sports-related sudden cardiac death in young adults. Sports-related sudden cardiac deaths were compared with non-sports-related sudden cardiac death in individuals (14 to 40 years old) who were autopsied from 1981 to 1988 at the Maryland Medical Examiner's Office. Thirty-four of 690 total cases of sudden cardiac death were sports-related, which represents 5% of sudden cardiac death in this age group. Causes of death were severe atherosclerosis (nine), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with asymmetry (eight), coronary artery anomalies (four), idiopathic concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (three), myocarditis (two), arrhythmogenic right ventricle (one), Kawasaki disease (one), and unknown (six); two of the cases with unknown causes had tunnel arteries. Exercise-related deaths were more likely due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.0007) compared with 102 age-, sex-, and race-matched controls in the non-exercise group; there was no difference in the incidence of severe atherosclerosis (p = 0.4). The mean age of individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with asymmetry was less than that of those with severe atherosclerosis (24 vs 32 years, p = 0.03). Thus exercise precipitates sudden cardiac death in younger individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
4	Thyrotoxicosis induced by topical iodine application. We describe an elderly man who was admitted with congestive cardiac failure and found to have thyrotoxicosis. He did not have goiter, and he had normal radioiodine uptake in his neck. Serum iodine levels were elevated, explaining the lack of increase in radioiodine uptake in the thyroid gland. He had multiple pressure sores, which were treated with povidone-iodine (Betadine) soaks. Biochemical data were consistent with Graves' disease unmasked by topical iodine application. Povidone-iodine soaks are commonly used in decubitus ulcer care and warrant special attention in patients with preexisting thyroid disorders. We have reviewed the literature on this unusual complication. 
4	Recovery of retrograde fast pathway excitability in the atrioventricular node reentrant circuit after concealed anterograde impulse penetration. The recovery of the retrograde fast pathway excitability in atrioventricular (AV) node reentry has been difficult to assess with ventricular extrastimulation because of difficulty in achieving sufficiently short intranodal coupling intervals and the potential interposition of "lower common pathway" nodal tissue. To circumvent these methodologic obstacles in 10 patients with inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia, a fixed atrial extrastimulus (A2) coupled to a basic atrial drive (A1) at a cycle length of 500 ms was utilized to reproducibly initiate AV node reentrant echoes. A ventricular extrastimulus (V3) was then introduced after A2 at progressively shorter coupling intervals (A2V3) in an attempt to pre-excite the retrograde fast pathway after concealed anterograde penetration by A2. In six patients, retrograde fast pathway pre-excitation was achieved at critical A2V3 intervals, as evidenced by the appearance of A3 by up to 28 +/- 6 ms in advance of the expected first AV node reentrant echo. In five of the six cases, the V3A3 interval was virtually unaltered (less than or equal to 5 ms decrease) when A2 was omitted. In seven patients, at a critically short A2V3 coupling interval (195 +/- 27 ms ), V3 abruptly failed to elicit A3 and concomitantly abolished all AV node echoes; yet when A2 was omitted, an A3 response returned, with V3A3 identical to previous values. 
2	Hepatic histological findings after transplantation for chronic hepatitis B virus infection, including a unique pattern of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Long-term follow-up of 27 patients with hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver disease treated by transplantation showed that 23 had hepatitis B virus recurrence. In 13 patients late changes in the grafts were similar to those described in other series: minor abnormalities in five cases, chronic active hepatitis in five cases and non-hepatitis B virus-related graft dysfunction in three cases. Three patients had incomplete histological follow-up. Analysis of the histological changes and viral antigen expression in six cases revealed a distinct and novel pattern termed fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Development of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis was associated with rapidly progressive graft dysfunction. It is postulated that this pattern of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis develops because of a high cytoplasmic expression of viral antigens, including HBsAg. The remaining case had some features of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. The main histological features of this unique syndrome include thin, perisinusoidal bands of fibrosis extending from portal tracts to surround plates of ductular-type epithelium; prominent cholestasis; ground-glass transformation; and ballooning of hepatocytes with cell loss and mild mixed inflammatory reaction. 
1	Stress response protein (srp-27) determination in primary human breast carcinomas: clinical, histologic, and prognostic correlations Expression of an estrogen-regulated protein known as the 27,000-d heat-shock or stress-response protein (srp-27) was evaluated in human breast carcinomas and established breast cancer cell lines. Results obtained by Northern and Western blot analyses and immunohistochemical methods were concordant. Immunohistochemical assessment of srp-27 expression in 300 breast carcinomas (with median patient follow-up of 8 years) was performed. Twenty-six percent of lymph node-negative and 45% of lymph node-positive tumors were overexpressors. Univariate analysis demonstrated significant correlations between srp-27 overexpression and estrogen receptor (ER) content, pS2 protein expression, nodal metastases, advanced T stage, lymphatic/vascular invasion, and a shorter disease-free survival period (but not a shorter overall survival) for the study population as a whole. Regression tree analysis showed that srp-27 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for disease-free survival only in patients with one to three positive lymph nodes. The Cox proportional hazards model confirmed the independent prognostic significance of nodal involvement, T stage, and ER content but failed to recognize srp-27 overexpression as a significant independent parameter predictive of patient outcome in the patient population as a whole. The observed associations between srp-27 overexpression and more aggressive tumors suggest a biologic role for srp-27 in human breast carcinomas. 
2	Acquired benign esophagorespiratory fistula: report of 16 consecutive cases. Sixteen cases of acquired benign esophagorespiratory fistula were treated in a 20-year period. A delay in diagnosis was usual, and most patients were first seen with a pulmonary infection already developed. Contrast esophageal x-ray studies established the diagnosis in all patients. There were seven esophagotracheal and nine esophagobronchial fistulas. A fistula between the esophageal diverticulum and a bronchus considered to be of inflammatory origin developed in 7 patients. A fistula as the consequence of trauma developed in 9 patients, and these fistulas were situated at a higher level of the respiratory tree. All patients underwent surgical treatment; in 12 it was definitive, and in 4 temporary gastrostomy was performed to improve nutrition before definite repair. The definitive repair consisted of eventual diverticulectomy, division of the fistula, and suture of both esophageal and respiratory defects. Two patients required esophageal resection and later reconstruction with colon interposition. One patient died, creating an operative mortality of 8.3% in the definitive-repair group. The remaining 11 patients had a gratifying long-term result. There were two deaths in the gastrostomy group due to an extremely poor condition of patients and debilitating pulmonary infection. Early diagnosis of this rare condition is necessary if severe pulmonary complications are to be avoided. Early direct repair gives excellent results. 
2	Epidural morphine for analgesia after caesarean section: a report of 4880 patients This retrospective study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of epidural morphine in providing analgesia following Caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia. The morphine was administered as a single bolus, following delivery, in doses ranging from 2 to 5 mg. The charts of 4880 Caesarean sections, performed on 4500 patients, were reviewed. The duration of analgesia and the occurrence of any symptoms which might be side-effects of the epidural morphine were recorded. The duration of analgesia was 22.9 +/- 10.1 hr and was not correlated with the dose of epidural morphine. Eleven per cent of the patients required no supplemental analgesia during the first 48 hr. Twelve patients (0.25 per cent) had respiratory rates less than 10 breaths per minute, on at least one occasion. No serious sequelae resulted from these periods of bradypnoea. Pruritus occurred in 58 per cent of patients, nausea and vomiting in 39.9 per cent and dizziness in ten per cent. Herpes simplex labialis was recorded in 3.5 per cent of patients. Epidural morphine is thus confirmed as an effective analgesic technique post-Caesarean section with 3 mg being the optimal dose. Even in this young healthy patient population, clinically detectable respiratory depression occurs so clinical respiratory monitoring is indicated. 
1	Castanospermine vs. its 6-O-butanoyl analog: a comparison of toxicity and antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. Inhibitors of glycoprotein processing, such as castanospermine (1,6,7,8-tetrahydroxyoctahydroindolizine), have been shown previously to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with acceptable toxicity in cultured human cells. In prior experiments, we have tested the toxicity and antiviral efficacy of castanospermine in mice infected with the Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV). When compared with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT, zidovudine), castanospermine was less effective and more toxic. Since the 6-O-butanoyl analog of castanospermine was previously found to have a more favorable activity profile than the parent compound against HIV-1 in cultured cells, we compared the antiviral efficacy of both compounds in parallel in vitro and in vivo in the RLV system. Plaque formation in the XC assay was inhibited with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.4 microM for the 6-O-butanoyl analog of castanospermine, as compared to 9 microM for castanospermine. For both compounds, concentrations resulting in significant cytotoxicity were about ten times higher. Both compounds significantly decreased HIV-1 env-induced syncytium formation in a novel in vitro assay. In RLV-exposed mice, the 6-O-butanoyl analog showed no advantage over the parent compound: both curves for toxicity as well as antiviral efficacy were super-imposable. We conclude that the 6-O-butanoyl analog of castanospermine as well as castanospermine itself are active antiviral agents in mice and that prolonged oral administration is tolerable. However, in comparison to AZT, their antiviral activity profiles are less favorable. 
5	The effects of tartar-control toothpaste on the oral soft tissues. Ninety-two dental and dental hygiene students completed a double-blind, controlled clinical trial. The purpose of the trial was to evaluate the effects of toothpastes, in varying concentrations of flavor and tartar-control agents. Four formulations of toothpastes were assessed: (A) control-low flavor with no tartar control; (B) medium flavoring with medium tartar control; (C) high flavoring with medium tartar control; and (D) medium flavoring with no tartar control. Soft tissue reactions were assessed objectively and independently by three examiners. Subjective perceptions about each toothpaste were gathered by a structured, open-ended questionnaire. The "tartar control" toothpastes, B and C, resulted in statistically significant (p less than 0.005) higher rates of mucosal reactions (e.g., ulceration, sloughing, erythema, migratory glossitis) than the "non-tartar control" toothpastes A and D. When the oral mucosal reaction rates were adjusted for multiple clinical observations within each subject at the same point in time there was no statistically significant (p greater than 0.05) difference between male (0.25) and female (0.28) subjects. In this study population, the order of preference was observed as toothpaste A greater than D greater than B greater than C. The major reasons for disfavor were burning sensation in toothpastes C (2.4%) and B (4%). 
1	Rupture of a benign mediastinal teratoma into the right pleural cavity. A 27-year-old woman with a ruptured mediastinal cystic teratoma had high levels of amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen in cystic fluid. The activity of the amylase is thought to be the most likely cause of the rupture. High levels of carcinoembryonic antigen in pleural fluid are not necessarily indicative of a malignant lesion but may suggest the presence of a ruptured teratoma in patients with mediastinal tumors. 
4	Coronary artery dissection--a case report. Coronary artery dissection, both spontaneous and catheter-induced, is associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. The authors present a case of a middle-aged woman with spontaneous right coronary artery dissection causing inferior wall myocardial infarction and left coronary artery dissection at the time of coronary arteriography. It is suggested that emergency aortocoronary bypass surgery be performed preceded by insertion of an intra-aortic balloon in acute evolving cases where coronary anatomy is favorable to limit infarction and avert loss of life. 
1	Adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in persons under 40 years old. A population-based study. Data collected by nine population-based tumor registries participating in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute were analyzed to characterize the epidemiology of noncarcinoid adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in young adults. Tumors diagnosed in persons under 40 years old between 1973 and 1984 (n = 1736) were compared with those in persons 40 years and older (n = 106,760). This first large U.S. population-based study of colorectal adenocarcinomas in the young shows a higher incidence in blacks than whites and later detection in black males. It also shows a higher proportion of tumors of mucinous and signet ring histological type than in older age groups. Among the younger group, the average annual age-adjusted incidence rate was 34% higher in black males than in white males (12.6 vs. 9.4 per million persons) and 46% higher in black females than in white females (13.0 vs 8.9 per million persons). The proportion of tumors that were right-sided varied by age: 0-29 years, 30%; 30-39 years, 26%; 40-49 years, 22%; 50-59 years, 21%; 60-69 years, 24%; 70-79 years, 30%; and 80+ years, 35%. Males under age 40 were less likely to present with localized disease (whites, 27%; blacks, 21%) than were those aged 40 and older (whites, 39%; blacks, 36%). The proportion of tumors classified as mucinous decreased with age, from 28% among those aged 0-19 years to 5% among those 40 years and older. A similar trend was observed for signet ring tumors. Although this latter type accounted for 10% of large-bowel tumors among subjects aged 0-19 years, this proportion decreased with age to 0.2% in those 40 years and older. 
5	Botulinum toxin therapy. Botulinum toxin therapy has emerged as a treatment modality for a variety of spastic- or contracture-related muscle diseases. Its safety has been proven for long-term use in the treatment of benign essential blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, and certain types of strabismus. Recent approval from the Federal Drug Administration should make botulinum toxin available for use in a greater number of patients. 
5	Diffuse axonal injury: analysis of 100 patients with radiological signs. One hundred patients with head injuries who showed diffuse axonal injury on computed tomographic scans are reported. Evaluation of the Glasgow Coma Score, pupillary signs, and computed tomographic findings on admission led to an improved ability to forecast outcomes. Our relatively good results as compared with other series, can be explained by the high proportion of children and by the liberal use of computed tomography to evaluate head injuries, thus revealing that concussion may sometimes be regarded as an early form of diffuse axonal injury. 
3	Hospital admissions from the Surgical Day Care Centre of Vancouver General Hospital 1977-1987. The admissions to Vancouver General Hospital from its Surgical Day Care Centre were reviewed for the period 1977 to 1987. The overall mean rate of admission for the period was 0.28 per cent, for surgically-related admissions 0.22 per cent and for anaesthesia-related admissions 0.07 per cent. The principal reasons for surgery-related admissions were postoperative bleeding, complications, the need for further surgery, the requirement for prolonged postoperative care, and pain. Urology had a particularly high percentage of admissions compared with its workload, because of the diagnostic nature of much of the work. Anaesthesia-related admissions included "syncope," lack of an accompanying adult, aspiration pneumonitis and coincident acute disease. Twelve of the 14 patients admitted with syncope had surgery in the afternoon and had received less than ideal amounts of intravenous fluid. Seven of the 12 ASA physical status II patients admitted had an admission diagnosis related to the coincident disease. 
4	Reduction of post-traumatic swelling and compartment pressure by impulse compression of the foot. Following the discovery of a powerful venous pump in the foot that is activated by weight-bearing independently of muscular action, a pneumatic impulse device was developed to actuate this pump artificially. In a multicentre international trial the device was shown to reduce post-traumatic and postoperative swelling; pain also was alleviated. Evidence is also presented that dangerously high compartment pressures may be reduced to acceptable levels and fasciotomy avoided. We present an explanation of the clinical effects of activation of the venous footpump, based on recent improved understanding of the physiology of the microcirculation. The hyperaemic response that follows the liberation of endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) by sudden changes of pressure after weight-bearing or impulse compression is particularly important. 
4	A clinically applicable method for long-term salvage of postischemic skeletal muscle. The clinical significance and applicability of interventions aimed at reducing reperfusion injury in postischemic skeletal muscle remain unproven, since long-term muscle salvage has not been demonstrated by most treatment protocols that attenuate early reperfusion injury. We have shown that reperfusion of ischemic skeletal muscle results in an early and prolonged sequestration of white blood cells and activation of the alternative complement cascade. The purpose of this study was to determine if 40 minutes of reperfusion with blood depleted of white blood cells and complement proteins, followed by 2 days of normal perfusion, would reduce muscle necrosis after 5 hours of ischemia. The isolated paired canine gracilis muscle model was used. The treatment muscle was initially reperfused with arterial blood that had been spun, washed, passed through a leukocyte removal filter, and resuspended in hydroxyethyl starch (greater than 99.9% removal of white blood cells and the complement proteins factor B and C4). The contralateral control muscle was subjected to unaltered reperfusion. Blood flow (ml/min/100 gm) was measured by timed collection of gracilis venous blood. Myeloperoxidase activity (absorbance at 655 nm/min/mg tissue protein) in muscle biopsies was used to monitor white blood cell sequestration. After 48 hours of reperfusion in vivo, necrosis was quantified by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. Initial reperfusion with white blood cell and complement depleted blood significantly reduced muscle necrosis (53% +/- 3% vs 29% +/- 8%, p less than 0.0025, paired t test). Early blood flow was improved, (p = 0.0025, repeated measure-ANOVA), but subsequent white blood cell sequestration was not altered (p = 0.33, repeated measure-ANOVA). This suggests that a significant amount of white blood cell mediated injury occurs during the first 40 minutes of reperfusion. Preventing early complement activation and white blood cell mediated reperfusion injury is an intervention that is feasible during surgery and may result in clinically significant salvage of postischemic skeletal muscle. 
3	Radiation-induced optic neuropathy: a magnetic resonance imaging study. Optic neuropathy induced by radiation is an infrequent cause of delayed visual loss that may at times be difficult to differentiate from compression of the visual pathways by recurrent neoplasm. The authors describe six patients with this disorder who experienced loss of vision 6 to 36 months after neurological surgery and radiation therapy. Of the six patients in the series, two had a pituitary adenoma and one each had a metastatic melanoma, multiple myeloma, craniopharyngioma, and lymphoepithelioma. Visual acuity in the affected eyes ranged from 20/25 to no light perception. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed sellar and parasellar recurrence of both pituitary adenomas, but the intrinsic lesions of the optic nerves and optic chiasm induced by radiation were enhanced after gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (DTPA) administration and were clearly distinguishable from the suprasellar compression of tumor. Repeated MR imaging showed spontaneous resolution of gadolinium-DTPA enhancement of the optic nerve in a patient who was initially suspected of harboring recurrence of a metastatic malignant melanoma as the cause of visual loss. The authors found the presumptive diagnosis of radiation-induced optic neuropathy facilitated by MR imaging with gadolinium-DTPA. This neuro-imaging procedure may help avert exploratory surgery in some patients with recurrent neoplasm in whom the etiology of visual loss is uncertain. 
3	Neuroanatomic differences between dyslexic and normal readers on magnetic resonance imaging scans. The areas of six bilateral brain segments in the right and left hemispheres, on a horizontal brain section, and the area of subdivisions of the corpus callosum, on a midsagittal brain section, were measured on magnetic resonance images obtained from 21 dyslexic and 29 control subjects. In the entire group, the frontal half of the horizontal brain section showed asymmetry, with the right side being larger, whereas posteriorly only the occipital polar segment was asymmetrical, with the left side being larger. Dyslexic subjects exhibited asymmetry, with the right side greater than the left side, in contrast to the relatively symmetrical pattern that is normally observed in the midposterior segment that corresponds to the angular gyrus. In the corpus callosum, dyslexic subjects were found to have a larger splenium than nondyslexic subjects, and dyslexic female subjects were found to have a larger splenium than dyslexic male subjects. Because transcallosal pathways connecting the left and right angular gyrus regions traverse through the splenium of the corpus callosum, the above findings in dyslexic subjects suggest an anatomic abnormality in the angular gyrus region. 
4	Morphological and histopathological aspects of aneurysms after patch aortoplasty for coarctation. Repair of coarctation of the aorta by synthetic patch grafting has been complicated by late aneurysm formation. These aneurysms differ macroscopically from atherosclerotic thoracic aortic dilatations. Specimens for microscopic examination were taken from 14 of 20 patients undergoing aneurysm resection. Histological analysis of the specimens showed medionecrosis in 13 patients of the specimens showed medionecrosis in 13 patients (93%), foreign body reaction in 11 patients (78%), and intimal thickening in 3 patients (21%). The three layers of the aortic wall could be identified in the aneurysms. On the basis of these results, we discuss the etiologic factors and pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the development of these aneurysms. 
4	Effects of prolonged infusion of human alpha calcitonin gene-related peptide on hemodynamics, renal blood flow and hormone levels in congestive heart failure. We have previously demonstrated that short-term infusion of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has beneficial effects in congestive heart failure. The effects of prolonged infusion of CGRP on hemodynamic functions, plasma hormones and renal blood flow were studied in 9 patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV, ejection fraction less than 35%). Hemodynamic variables were measured at 30-minute intervals for 8 hours during CGRP infusion (8 ng/kg/min) and for 2 hours after discontinuation. CGRP caused a decrease in right atrial (28%, p less than 0.05), pulmonary artery (22%, p less than 0.02), pulmonary artery wedge (37%, p less than 0.001) and systemic arterial (18%, p less than 0.05) pressures. Systemic vascular resistance decreased more than pulmonary vascular resistance. Cardiac output (72%, p less than 0.001) and stroke volume (60%, p less than 0.02) increased. Heart rate did not change. There was no evidence of tolerance throughout the infusion. The hemodynamic effects were lost within 30 minutes of stopping CGRP. Renal blood flow (34%, p less than 0.01) and glomerular filtration rate (43%, p less than 0.01) increased. Atrial natriuretic peptide decreased (p less than 0.05), while plasma cortisol (p less than 0.02) increased. Plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, renin activity, aldosterone and growth hormone were unchanged. It is concluded that in patients with severe congestive heart failure, CGRP has sustained beneficial effects on hemodynamic functions and has no adverse effects on hormones. Unlike many other vasodilators, CGRP also increases renal blood flow and glomerular filtration. 
5	Parascapular free flaps for head and neck reconstruction. We report our experience with single-stage, primary reconstruction of the head and neck in 29 consecutive patients using parascapular free flaps. The commonest indications were for craniofacial defects (9), oropharyngeal soft tissue defects (10), and combined mandibular and soft tissue losses (4). Ablative surgery was performed for squamous carcinoma (22), melanoma (2), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (2). Seven patients died of recurrent disease during a 3 1/2 year follow-up. Seven patients are alive with recurrence. Flap complications included total loss (2) due to unsalvageable microvascular thrombosis, wound breakdown with oropharyngeal fistula (2), mandibular osteomyelitis (1), trismus (2), neck contracture (1), and donor site wound dehiscence (1). The overall success of this reconstruction was 93%. Primary wound healing was the general rule with lower morbidity than with other reconstructive techniques. The flap is thin, pliable, and conforms well to three-dimensional defects. The lateral border of the scapula can be incorporated on the same vascular pedicle for single-stage mandibular reconstruction. No muscle is sacrificed, and the posterior donor defect is an added advantage. The parascapular flap is our first choice for reconstruction of major defects in the head and neck. 
2	Supportive evidence for the validity of the epidemiologic necropsy for gallstones OBJECTIVE: The epidemiologic necropsy measures the occurrence of unsuspected disease through the examination of necropsy records of patients who died for other reasons. The estimates of unsuspected disease derived from the epidemiologic necropsy should approximate what actually occurs in the living population. DESIGN/SETTING: To test this hypothesis, all necropsy records of adult patients at the University of Kansas Medical Center from 1950 to 1984 were examined for the presence of gallstones. Patients with previous cholecystectomy or whose gallstones were diagnosed during life were excluded. The data were stratified by age and race and compared with those of a screening survey from Canada, a surgical series from New York, two screening surveys from Italy, and one from Denmark. The crude necropsy detection rates and the rates from the screening surveys were standardized to the 1970 federal census for Kansas City. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The standardized occurrence rates were similar and suggest that the epidemiologic necropsy accurately assesses the occurrence of asymptomatic gallstones in the living population, thus strengthening its validity as a research tool. 
5	The value of indium 111 leukocyte scanning in the evaluation of painful or infected total knee arthroplasties. Evaluation of painful total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) for infection can be difficult. Indium 111 (111In) leukocyte bone scanning provides a minimally invasive technique for evaluation of possible infection. Thirty-eight patients with a painful TKA who had surgical exploration after 111In leukocyte scanning were reviewed. The scan had an accuracy of 84%, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of 85%. The 111In leukocyte scans must be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical evaluation of the patient because they are less accurate for study of TKAs than of total hip arthroplasties. 
1	Colonic polyamine content and ornithine decarboxylase activity as markers for adenomas. Polyamine content (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) or ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity was measured in normal-appearing colonic mucosa from patients undergoing colonoscopy. Comparisons were made between those with and those without adenomatous polyps. Colonic mucosal polyamine content was measured in 44 persons. Mean putrescine content was 1.25 +/- 0.26 (SE) nmol/mg protein in 22 patients with adenomatous polyps compared with 0.53 +/- 0.12 nmol/mg protein in patients without polyps (P less than 0.02). Tissue content of spermidine and spermine did not differ between these two groups. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was measured in tissue from 45 patients. Mean ODC activity was 2.84 +/- 0.73 pmol/hr/mg protein in 23 persons with adenomatous polyps compared with 1.15 +/- 0.18 pmol/hr/mg protein in persons without polyps (P less than 0.05). Mucosal putrescine and ODC activity are elevated in patients with adenomatous polyps compared with patients without polyps. These biochemical markers may prove helpful in improving surveillance methods for colorectal cancer and premalignant adenomatous polyps. 
4	Azathioprine. An effective, corticosteroid-sparing therapy for patients with recalcitrant cutaneous lupus erythematosus or with recalcitrant cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Azathioprine sodium has been reported to be effective therapy for chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE) but rarely for chronic cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LV). We used azathioprine in the treatment of six patients with cutaneous LE, four of whom had subacute cutaneous (nonscarring) LE and two of whom had chronic cutaneous (scarring, discoid) LE, and six patients with chronic cutaneous LV. The conditions of all patients had been resistant to conventional therapy, and they required long-term oral corticosteroid therapy for control of their disease. Two of the patients with LE had prominent palmar and/or plantar involvement. Three patients with LE had an excellent response to azathioprine, with near complete clearing of the skin lesions, allowing a decrease in prednisone dosage. One patient with LE initially demonstrated significant improvement, but azathioprine therapy had to be discontinued because of pancreatitis. The treatment failed in two patients with LE; one had nausea and the other repeatedly developed a drug-induced fever. Five of the six patients with LV had improved conditions, with complete control of the disease occurring in two patients and partial control in three patients. Azathioprine is effective for some patients with cutaneous LE and chronic cutaneous LV, but it should be reserved for patients with severe disease in whom more conventional treatment fails. 
2	Severe hemorrhagic radiation proctitis advancing to gradual cessation with hyperbaric oxygen. We report a case of a male patient suffering from a severe hemorrhagic radiation proctitis which gradually ceased with hyperbaric oxygen. We discuss the mechanisms of chronic radiation injury and the effect of the hyperbaric oxygen. This therapy is proposed as an alternative to surgical intervention for this abnormality. 
2	Evaluation of the pre-S (pre-S(1)Ag/pre-S(2)Ab) system in hepatitis B virus infection. The diagnostic and prognostic value of pre-S(1)Ag and pre-S(2)Ab was investigated in 69 HBsAg surface antigen positive patients--14 with acute hepatitis B, 30 with chronic liver disease (six chronic persistent hepatitis, 14 chronic active hepatitis, 10 with cirrhosis) and in 25 asymptomatic carriers. Pre-S(1)Ag was found in all patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection regardless of viral replication. In contrast, pre-S(2)Ab was not detected in any patients. Acute hepatitis was studied sequentially with periodic controls at 20 day intervals. Pre-S(1)Ag cleared before HBsAg in six of 14 (43%) patients who progressed favourably, and the two antigens cleared simultaneously in eight of 14 (57%) cases. Patients with early clearance of pre-S(1)Ag progressed favourably, thus indicating the prognostic value of this test, which, however, is still of limited practical application given the small temporal difference between the moment of clearance of the two antigens. The first markers to clear, however, were HBeAg and DNA-HBV, which showed significant differences with respect to the clearance of HBsAg. Moreover, pre-S(2)Ab appeared before HBsAb in 57.1% of our patients and was found in some patients before pre-S(1)Ag and HBsAg had cleared (42.8%), thus allowing complete viral clearance and acute HBV infection to be predicted earlier. 
4	Everted cervical vein for carotid patch angioplasty. Because of the theoretic benefits of autologous vein we undertook an investigation to evaluate cervical veins (facial, external jugular) as patch material after carotid endarterectomy. A device that stimulated both circumferential fixation by sutures and radial tension exerted on in vivo patches was constructed to measure burst strength of tissue. Mean bursting pressure for groin saphenous vein (n = 10) was 94.5 +/- 15.1 pounds per square inch (psi), 75.5 +/- 8.9 psi for ankle saphenous vein (n = 10), 83.3 +/- 14.5 psi for everted (double layer) cervical vein (n = 5) and 10 +/- 3.3 psi for single layer cervical vein (n = 5). No significant differences between saphenous vein at any level and everted (double layer) cervical vein, but all were significantly different from single layer cervical vein (p less than 0.05). From June 1987 through November 1989, 19 patients underwent 21 carotid endarterectomies complemented with adjunctive everted cervical vein patch angioplasty. Indications for surgery were asymptomatic stenosis (53%), transient ischemic attack (29%), and cerebrovascular accident with recovery (18%). All patients were studied after surgery with duplex scanning. Asymptomatic recurrent stenosis was observed in one patient. Transient hypoglossal nerve dysfunction occurred in one other patient. One postoperative death occurred as a result of massive aspiration. These results indicate that everted cervical vein is comparable to the saphenous vein in resistance to bursting and can yield similar results as patch material after carotid endarterectomy. Accordingly, saphenous vein can be spared and lower extremity incisions avoided. 
5	Treatment of chronic liver disease caused by 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase deficiency with chenodeoxycholic acid. Deficiency of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase, the second enzyme in the sequence that catalyses the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, leads to chronic liver disease in childhood as well as to malabsorption of fat and fat soluble vitamins. A 4 year old boy with this condition has been successfully treated by oral administration of a bile acid--chenodeoxycholic acid. He had been jaundiced since birth, grew poorly because of rickets, and had severe pruritus. Plasma transaminase activities were persistently raised. Chenodeoxycholic acid 125 mg twice daily for two months, and then 125 mg daily, cured his jaundice and pruritus, returned his transaminase activities to normal, and eliminated the need for calcitriol for prevention of rickets. On this treatment he has so far remained well for two years. A diagnosis of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase deficiency should be considered in any child with unexplained chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, especially if the liver disease is accompanied by a clinically obvious malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins. A simple colorimetric test of the urine confirms the diagnosis and effective treatment can be started. 
5	Influence of hypoxia on adrenergic modulation of triggered activity in isolated adult canine myocytes. Although findings from several reports suggest that nonreentrant or focal mechanisms contribute to the genesis of arrhythmias during early ischemia, the contribution of triggered activity arising from early or delayed afterdepolarizations has not been resolved. We have previously demonstrated that beta- but not alpha-adrenergic stimulation induces afterdepolarizations and triggered activity in isolated normoxic myocytes. In the present study, the influence of the extent of cellular derangements as well as increases in [K+]o on alpha- and beta-adrenergic-mediated afterdepolarizations and triggered activity was evaluated. Adult canine myocytes were exposed to one of the following experimental conditions with simultaneous intracellular transmembrane action potential recordings: 1) low PO2 (less than 10 mm Hg, obtained using a specially designed hypoxic chamber) and low (6.8) pH; 2) low PO2, low pH, and high extracellular potassium ([K+]o) (10 mM); or 3) severe metabolic inhibition with cyanide (10(-6) M). Cells from each group were superfused with either the alpha-agonist phenylephrine (10(-5) or 10(-7) M, with 10(-5) M nadolol) or the beta-agonist isoproterenol (10(-6) M). Moderate changes in the action potentials were observed under conditions 1 and 2 (moderate hypoxia), whereas marked but reversible changes were observed with cyanide (severe metabolic inhibition). During moderate hypoxia in normal [K+]o, delayed afterdepolarizations or triggered activity were elicited by both alpha- (12 of 13 cells) and beta-adrenergic (five of five cells) stimulation. Increasing [K+]o during moderate hypoxia completely abolished the afterdepolarizations induced by alpha-adrenergic stimulation and prevented the occurrence of triggered activity. In contrast, the influence of beta-adrenergic stimulation was only attenuated by an increase in [K+]o. Exposure to cyanide completely prevented the induction of afterdepolarizations and triggered activity by both alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation. Our findings indicate that moderate hypoxia in normal [K+]o is associated with the development of adrenergic-mediated afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. In contrast, accumulation of [K+]o or severe impairment of cellular metabolism is accompanied by inhibition of adrenergic-mediated afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. 
2	Gallbladder wall thickening (congestive cholecystopathy) in chronic liver disease: a sign of portal hypertension. A thickened gallbladder wall is often seen with ultrasound in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hypoalbuminaemia is thought to be the cause since there is a strong association between bowel wall thickening and low serum albumin. To determine the role of portal hypertension in producing gallbladder wall thickening we studied 40 consecutive stable patients-37 with cirrhosis and three with portal hypertension due to primary biliary cirrhosis. Ultrasound assessment of the gallbladder wall was made after an overnight fast using a Technicare autosector. Wall thickness 4 mm or greater was considered abnormal. Twenty-seven patients had a thickened gallbladder wall and all had evidence of portal hypertension. Hypoalbuminaemia was not an important factor since it was only present in six cases with thickened walls. In two cases reduction in portal pressure with oral propranolol was associated with a decrease in gallbladder wall thickness. These results suggest that portal hypertension, not hypoalbuminaemia, is the dominant factor causing gallbladder wall thickening in cirrhosis. Ultrasound demonstration of gallbladder wall thickening in chronic liver disease should suggest the presence of portal hypertension. 
5	Patients in a persistent vegetative state attitudes and reactions of family members. Patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS) constituted approximately 3% of the population in four Milwaukee nursing homes. In order to understand family members' attitudes and reactions toward such patients, 33 (92%) of 36 family members of patients in PVS contacted were studied. The age of the patients ranged from 19 to 95 with a mean age of 73.4 +/- 17.2 years, and family members' ages ranged from 41 to 89 with a mean age of 61.8 +/- 3.3 years. The etiology of the PVS varied from dementia to cerebral trauma. The mean duration of the PVS was 54 +/- 8.4 months (range 12 to 204). Family members reported that they visited patients 260 times during the first year following the onset of the PVS and were still visiting at a rate of 209 visits yearly at the time of the interview. There was no significant correlation between the frequency of the family members visits and the duration of the PVS, the patient's or family member's age, or the family member's relationship to the patient. Ninety percent of patients were considered by family members to have some awareness of pain, light or darkness, environment, taste, verbal conversation, or the family member's presence. Most family members thought they understood the patient's medical condition, and the majority did not expect the patient to improve. Nevertheless, the majority of family members wanted the patient to undergo therapeutic interventions, including transfer to the acute hospital and surgery. 
1	Neuropeptide Y and neuron-specific enolase levels in benign and malignant pheochromocytomas. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is the isoform of enolase, a glycolytic enzyme found in the neuroendocrine system. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a peptide recently discovered in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Serum NSE and plasma NPY levels have been reported to be increased in some patients with pheochromocytoma. The authors evaluated whether the measurement of these molecules could help to discriminate between benign and malignant forms of pheochromocytoma. The NSE levels were normal in all patients with benign pheochromocytoma (n = 13) and elevated in one half of those with malignant pheochromocytoma (n = 13). Plasma NPY levels were on the average significantly higher in the malignant (177.1 +/- 38.9 pmol/l, n = 16) than in the benign forms of the disease (15.7 +/- 389 pmol/l, n = 24). However, there was no difference in the percentage of patients with elevated NPY levels. These results show that determination of serum NSE may be useful for distinguishing between malignant and benign pheochromocytoma; the measurement of plasma NPY is not useful for differentiating the two kinds of tumors. 
5	Hemodynamic and electrophysiologic evaluation of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy surviving cardiac arrest. Hemodynamic and electrophysiologic studies were performed in 30 survivors of sudden cardiac arrest with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) to determine responsible factors. Electrophysiologic abnormalities alone were present in 27 patients (90%): sinus node dysfunction in 14 (47%), delayed atrio-ventricular nodal conduction in 1 (3%), abnormal His-Purkinje conduction in 7 (23%), an inducible atrial tachycardia in 7 (23%), and inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmia in 21 (70%). Sustained ventricular arrhythmia was polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 18 patients (86%), monomorphic VT in 2 patients (7%) and ventricular fibrillation in 1 patient (3%). In 1 patient the arrhythmia recorded during an episode of cardiac arrest and induced at electrophysiologic study was polymorphic VT. VT was induced with less than or equal to 2 extra-stimuli in only 1 patient (3%) but with less than or equal to 3 extra-stimuli in 20 patients (97%). Potential causes of sudden cardiac arrest were found in all patients and were multiple in 13 patients (43%). These were (1) ventricular electrical instability in 21 patients (70%), (2) severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in 8 patients (27%), (3) bradycardia in 5 patients (17%), (4) myocardial ischemia associated with hypotension in 5 patients (17%), and (5) atrial tachycardia resulting in hypotension in 4 patients (13%). Of the 21 patients with inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmia, 17 received an implantable defibrillator device and 4 were treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Seven patients underwent left ventricular septal myectomy. 
1	Prospective evaluation of clinical and pathologic detection of axillary metastases in patients with carcinoma of the breast. Complete axillary dissection was performed in 287 patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy between 1984 and 1987 to identify patterns of axillary node metastases, as well as discontinuous axillary node ("skip") metastases. Positive pathologic findings were compared with preoperative clinical examinations in 266 patients and showed only 60 cases (22.6%) clinically suspicious for tumor, in contrast to 131 (45.6%) with pathologically confirmed positive lymph nodes. Axillary contents were classified level I, II, or III based on their relationship to the pectoralis minor muscle. An average of 24.2 nodes was resected per patient (level I, 10; level II, 8.1; and level III, 5.3). Tumors ranged in size from 0.5 to 12.0 cm (mean, 2.6 cm), and increasing tumor size was associated with an increased likelihood of positive nodes. The data on 204 patients with complete clinical and pathologic data show that of 119 patients with negative level I nodes a limited axillary dissection (level I only) would fail to identify 6 with positive level II and 2 with positive level III nodes, whereas of 85 patients with positive level I nodes limited axillary dissection would fail to identify 17 with positive level II nodes, 7 with positive level III nodes, and 27 with positive levels II and III nodes. Complete axillary dissection (levels I, II, and III) should be performed to stage patients accurately, as well as to remove tumor-involved nodes and diminish local axillary recurrences. Clinical examination of the axilla appears to be a poor means of identifying axillary metastatic cancer. 
2	Emergency center ultrasonography in the evaluation of hemoperitoneum: a prospective study. The reliability of ultrasonographic detection (US) of hemoperitoneum in blunt abdominal trauma was evaluated in a prospective study of 72 patients. Independent of the examiner, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were, respectively, 86.7%, 100%, and 97.2%. Laparotomy was indicated in 76.9% of US hemoperitoneum-positive cases. No negative laparotomies were performed in this study group. If hemoperitoneum is revealed in US and vital signs are unstable, we think laparotomy is indicated. We believe that US in an emergency center is a quick, safe screening method in the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. US might take over a great part of the role of diagnostic peritoneal lavage. 
2	Relative frequencies of portosystemic pathways and renal shunt formation through the "posterior" gastric vein: portographic study in 460 patients. Percutaneous transhepatic portography was carried out in 460 patients with portal hypertension to study various collateral routes. Besides the left gastric vein, which was the most frequent collateral route and feeder of esophageal varices, a distinct vein located between the left gastric vein and the short gastric vein constituted a major collateral route in 191 patients (42%). In terms of frequency, this vein was more significant than the short gastric (34%) and the paraumbilical vein (24%) as a collateral route. We propose that this previously anonymous vein be called the "posterior gastric" vein because it runs posterior to the stomach. This vein also formed a renal shunt, a common cause of encephalopathy, in 43 (23%) of the 191 patients; the relative frequency of renal shunt formation by this vein was significantly greater than that by the left gastric vein (12%) and the short gastric vein (18%). 
5	Myocardial epinephrine sensitization with subanesthetic concentrations of halothane in dogs. The authors investigated myocardial epinephrine sensitization by subanesthetic concentrations of halothane. The dose-response relationship for the action of halothane was examined with etomidate plus varying subanesthetic concentrations of halothane in dogs. The arrhythmogenic threshold of epinephrine was decreased in a dose-dependent manner at end-tidal concentrations of halothane between 0.1 and 0.3%. At end-tidal halothane is greater than 0.3%, and no further reduction of arrhythmogenic threshold of epinephrine occurred. The plasma concentrations of epinephrine producing four or more premature ventricular contractions in 15 s were 201.3 +/- 34.3, 98.1 +/- 13.9, 60.3 +/- 8.63, 57.9 +/- 12.8, 54.5 +/- 8.61, and 53.9 +/- 4.86 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM), at 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% of halothane at end-tidal concentrations, respectively. The results suggest that in the presence of etomidate, halothane produces myocardial sensitization to epinephrine at subanesthetic concentrations as low as 0.1%. Increasing halothane to 0.3% produces a further reduction in the arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine. 
2	Duodenogastric reflux and gastric histology after cholecystectomy with or without sphincteroplasty. Sixteen patients who had undergone cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty, 14 cholecystectomized patients and ten control patients were studied to evaluate whether differences existed in duodenogastric reflux and whether these were related to morphological damage of the gastric mucosa. Duodenogastric bile reflux during fasting was evaluated by measuring the concentration of total bile acids (by an enzymatic method) and single bile acids in the gastric juice by high performance liquid chromatography. The damage was evaluated histologically by systematic endoscopic biopsy of the antrum and body of the stomach. There was a statistically significant difference in fasting bile reflux between the three groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, P less than 0.001), and the group that underwent cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty had a significantly higher median value than the cholecystectomized group (P less than 0.05) and the control group (P less than 0.01). The distribution of chronic antral atrophic and superficial gastritis was different in the three groups (chi 2 test, P less than 0.005). Chronic atrophic gastritis was associated with cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty (P less than 0.01), while chronic superficial gastritis was more frequent in cholecystectomized patients. These results suggest that there may be more duodenogastric reflux after cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty than after cholecystectomy alone, and that there may be a correlation between the amount of duodenogastric reflux and the severity of mucosal damage. 
5	A randomized trial of cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin versus vinblastine, cisplatin, and etoposide in the treatment of advanced germ cell tumors of the testis: a Southwest Oncology Group study This is a Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) prospective randomized trial of cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB) versus vinblastine, cisplatin, and etoposide (VP-16) (VPV) in the treatment of advanced germ cell tumors of the testis. The study objective was to determine what effect the replacement of bleomycin with VP-16 has on complete response (CR), survival, and drug toxicity. One hundred sixty-nine patients were registered and randomized. Of these patients, 160 were assessable for response. All had histologically confirmed disseminated germ cell neoplasms of testicular origin. Forty-six had minimal metastatic disease, and 114 had maximal disease. Seventy-seven were randomized to PVB and 83 to VPV chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in pretreatment characteristics between the two arms with regard to tumor burden, histologic type, and overall performance status. Patients received four courses of induction chemotherapy, either PVB (cisplatin 120 mg/m2 day 3, vinblastine 12 mg/m2 day 1, bleomycin 15 U/m2 twice per week) or VPV (vinblastine 8 mg/m2 day 1, cisplatin 120 mg/m2 day 3, VP-16 50 mg/m2 days 2 to 5). Chemotherapy was given every 3 weeks. Cytoreductive surgery was done postinduction if a chemotherapy CR was not achieved. There was no difference in the percentage of patients achieving a disease-free status between PVB (77%) and VPV (73%). The mean leukocyte nadir was similar for both treatments, but the mean platelet nadir was significantly lower (P = .003) in the VPV arm. All bleomycin-related toxicities (pulmonary, mucositis, skin) were avoided in the VPV arm. We conclude that bleomycin can be replaced in first-line therapy for advanced germ cell tumors without sacrificing efficacy and with the advantage of avoiding unnecessary drug toxicity. 
1	Response rates in relapsed Wilms' tumor. A need for new effective agents. Three hundred eighty-one children with Wilms' tumor were treated in the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group WT1 Study (1982 to 1986). Seventy-one patients had relapses during or after treatment with surgery and chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, depending on stage and histologic characteristics. Forty-nine patients were evaluable for disease response to second-line chemotherapy alone. Evaluation of response to chemotherapy was impossible in the remaining patients because either surgery or radiation therapy was used at the time of relapse. With second-line combination chemotherapy (which included ifosfamide, etoposide/VM26, cisplatin/carboplatin, bleomycin, melphalan, and Thiotepa [Lederle Laboratories, Pearl River, NY]), there were five complete responses and 12 partial responses. In patients with favorable histologic findings, six of nine with Stage I, five of ten with Stage II, none of 11 with Stage III, three of 16 with Stage IV, and one of five with Stage V disease survived. Two survivors were treated with chemotherapy alone; the others received combined treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery. For those with unfavorable histologic findings of any stage, only two of 20 survived. The authors conclude that, even for patients with localized disease with favorable histologic findings, the "salvage" rate is little more than 50%, and for all other stages and histologic findings the likelihood of cure after relapse is remote. There is clearly a need for additional effective chemotherapeutic agents for these patients. 
2	Portal venous gas in a patient with Crohn's disease. Portal venous gas usually occurs in the setting of an acute abdomen. Several causes for benign portal venous gas (PVG) have been reported. We describe the finding of PVG by computed tomography in a febrile patient with Crohn's disease and discuss the clinical implications of such a finding. 
5	Treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy by enlargement of the spinal canal anteriorly, followed by arthrodesis. Thirty-seven patients who had enlargement of the spinal canal anteriorly and stabilization of the spine for cervical spondylotic myelopathy were followed for an average of forty-nine months (range, twenty-eight to seventy months). Myelography and computed tomographic myelography were performed preoperatively on all patients to determine the location and features of the areas of decompression. The canal was enlarged by discectomy; by subtotal corpectomy and removal of the anteromedial parts of the pedicles; or by removal of osteophytes or of the posterior longitudinal ligament, or both. Partial corpectomy and interbody arthrodesis was performed in nine patients; subtotal corpectomy, including removal of the posterior parts of the vertebral bodies and of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and strut bone-grafting, in fifteen patients; and subtotal corpectomy, with detachment of the remaining thin posterior parts of the vertebral bodies and of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and strut bone-grafting, in thirteen patients. Postoperatively, radiographic examinations, including myelography and computed tomographic myelography, were performed for thirty-six patients and magnetic resonance imaging, for twenty-eight. A satisfactory neurological result was obtained in twenty-nine patients. Atrophy of the spinal cord, as seen on preoperative computed-tomographic myelograms, was predictive of an unsatisfactory result of the decompression, as was weakness of the peroneal muscles. All but one of the thirty-seven patients had improved walking ability at the most recent follow-up examination: seventeen patients improved by 1 point; fourteen, by 2 points; four, by 3 points; and one, by 4 points. The remaining patient reverted to the preoperative status after an initial improvement. The ability to walk at the interim examinations was compared with that at the most recent examination; three patients had continuing improvement, while three others had deterioration. The main cause of deterioration was new spondylotic changes associated with stenosis of the spinal canal, occurring at the level of the disc just cephalad to the fused levels. We concluded that anterior decompression followed by a secure arthrodesis should be an extensive procedure for patients who have cervical spondylotic myelopathy, as determined preoperatively from a myelogram or computed tomographic myelogram. Excision of the vertebral bodies should also be wide and should include the anteromedial parts of the pedicles. The third or fourth cervical vertebra should be included in the arthrodesis prophylactically in patients who have stenosis of the spinal canal when either of these vertebrae is adjacent to the level of fusion. 
5	Cup containment and orientation in cemented total hip arthroplasties. We reviewed the radiographs of 864 Charnley and STH (Zimmer) cemented total hip arthroplasties with a mean follow-up of seven years (maximum 16 years). Survivorship analysis was used to assess the correlation between radiographic performance and the bony containment or the coronal orientation of the acetabular cup. The cup orientation and containment were interrelated; all vertically oriented cups were completely contained, whereas 25% of more horizontal cups were only partially contained. Completely contained cups had significantly lower incidences of complete cement-bone radiolucency (p = 0.02) and of wear (p = 0.09). Vertically oriented cups had a lower incidence of continuous radiolucency than neutrally oriented cups, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.25). Our results confirm the importance of complete bony containment, and also indicate that it is better to accept vertical orientation and obtain full bony coverage than to have a more horizontal orientation with partial containment. 
1	Evidence of a local immune activation in cystic brain tumors. The fluid of cystic brain tumors was characterized with regard to the protein content. In most malignant tumors, the concentrations of immunoglobulins G and M (IgG and IgM) were higher relative to other proteins in the cyst fluid than in the serum of the same patient. A markedly elevated ratio of monomeric to pentameric IgM was detected in the cyst fluid of two patients with glioblastomas. The results indicate a local immunoglobulin synthesis in malignant cystic brain tumors. It is hypothesized that higher-than-expected concentrations of IgG and IgM in cyst fluid as compared to plasma are a sign of an ongoing immune response triggered by the tumor. 
3	Epithelial cyst of the fourth ventricle. Case report. A case of epithelial cyst in the fourth ventricle of a 4-year-old child is described. A single epithelial layer with a clear basement membrane lining the cyst wall was observed. There were no prominent histological findings to suggest a pathogenesis for this cyst based on immunohistochemical or ultrastructural studies; however, the cyst fluid contained significant amounts of carcinoembryonic antigen. It is considered that the epithelial layer lining the cyst wall was possibly of endodermal origin. 
4	Caffeine and ventricular arrhythmias. An electrophysiological approach. Little information is known regarding caffeine's effect on the substrate supporting sustained ventricular arrhythmias. This prospective study evaluated the effect of coffee (275 mg of caffeine) on this substrate with programmed ventricular stimulation in 22 patients with a history of symptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation. Patients underwent electrophysiological testing before and 1 hour after coffee ingestion. Mean (+/- SEM) plasma caffeine level achieved after coffee consumption was 6.2 +/- 0.5 mg/L. Mean plasma catecholamine and potassium values were not altered significantly 1 hour following caffeine ingestion. The number of extrastimuli required to induce an arrhythmia was unchanged in 10 patients (46%), increased in six (27%), and decreased in six (27%). Rhythm severity was unchanged in 17 patients (77%), more severe in two (9%), and less severe in three (14%). In those patients with clinical ventricular arrhythmias, caffeine did not significantly alter inducibility or severity of arrhythmias, suggesting little effect on the substrate supporting ventricular arrhythmias. 
1	von Willebrand factor in head and neck cancer. Laboratory abnormalities in blood coagulation factors are common in patients with cancer but the significance is unknown. Twenty-eight patients with head and neck cancer were studied at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-five were advanced-stage (III or IV) patients. Levels of clotting factors, antithrombin III, and plasminogen were normal. Levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF), both antigenic and functional (ristocetin cofactor), were elevated. This group of patients were followed for a minimum of 41 months (median, 48 months). Fifteen patients died within the follow-up period. von Willebrand factor levels were significantly higher in these 15 than the 13 survivors. Extreme elevation of ristocetin cofactor (greater than 300 U/dl) was seen in six of the 15 patients who died and in none of the survivors. Plasma vWF is elevated in head and neck cancer and the level measured at the time of diagnosis may have prognostic and potentially therapeutic implications. 
5	Neurological phenomena during emergence from enflurane or isoflurane anaesthesia. During emergence from anaesthesia, transient neurological signs that would usually be considered pathological may appear. The objective of this randomized, patient (n = 30) and observer-blinded study was to compare prospectively the incidence and duration of post-anaesthetic neurological abnormalities in healthy patients undergoing minor elective procedures following thiopentone and succinylcholine induction, and enflurane-N2O or isoflurane-N2O anaesthesia. Patients were studied for 60 min after anaesthesia. Arousal state, muscle tone, deep tendon reflexes, plantar reflex, sustained clonus, shivering, intense muscular spasticity and temperature were assessed. Results of neurological examination were correlated with the patient's state of arousal. Transient emergent neurological abnormalities occurred more frequently following enflurane-N2O anaesthesia than isoflurane N2O anaesthesia. This was statistically significant (P less than 0.05) for quadriceps hyperreflexia, upgoing toes (positive Babinski reflex) and intense muscular spasticity. Neurological abnormalities occurred most commonly 5-20 min after anaesthesia and all abnormalities resolved within 60 min. Following enflurane anaesthesia, as patients became more alert the incidence of abnormalities declined, while the arousal state did not affect the incidence of abnormalities after isoflurane. There was no significant difference between axillary temperatures of those patients who shivered and those who did not. In conclusion, temporary emergent neurological abnormalities occurred more often following enflurane-N2O than after isoflurane-N2O anaesthesia. 
1	Vagal schwannoma. A patient with a benign encapsulated intrathoracic vagal schwannoma is presented and the literature is reviewed. The right paratracheal tumor was identified incidentally on a chest film and excised using a right thoracotomy. Although rare, vagal schwannomas should be considered for any mediastinal mass along the vagus nerves especially when the paratracheal tumor produces minimal or no respiratory symptoms suggesting a slow-growing, encapsulated process. 
1	Leucine kinetics in patients with benign disease, non-weight-losing cancer, and cancer cachexia: studies at the whole-body and tissue level and the response to nutritional support. We have performed intraoperative isotopic infusions of carbon 14-labeled leucine in 65 patients to define the abnormalities in protein metabolism at both the whole-body and tissue level in patients with weight-losing and non-weight-losing cancer. Eighteen patients had benign disease, 26 had non-weight-losing cancer, and 21 had cancer cachexia. Samples of plasma and expired breath were taken to determine rates of whole-body protein synthesis (WBPS), whole-body protein catabolism (WBPC), net protein catabolism, and albumin fractional synthetic rates. Tissue samples were taken to determine the fractional synthetic rates (FSR) of protein in muscle, liver, cancer, and the tissue in which the cancer arose. In addition, in 14 patients the effect of nutritional support on protein metabolism was assessed. In all parameters examined we were unable to detect any significant differences between patients with no cancer and the patients with non-weight-losing cancer. In contrast, patients with cancer cachexia had a significant elevation (p less than 0.005) in WBPC compared with the other two groups. WBPS was also elevated (to a lesser extent) in the patients with cancer cachexia, and the rate of net protein catabolism was increased significantly (p less than 0.05). Patients with cancer cachexia also had significantly higher values of FSR of protein in muscle (p less than 0.05), liver (p less than 0.05), and albumin (p less than 0.01) compared with the other two groups. In addition, the protein FSR in the cancer rose progressively when the values for the primary cancer were compared with those for nodal and systemic metastases. Further, although nutritional support resulted in an increase in host muscle protein synthesis (p less than 0.04), there was no promotion of FSR of protein in cancer. We conclude that patients with cancer cachexia are actively losing protein as a result of an increase in WBPC that is only partially compensated for by an increase in WBPS. There are compensatory increases in protein synthesis in muscle and liver, but these increases in host protein synthesis are insufficient to keep pace with the combined effect of the accelerated rate of protein synthesis in the cancer per se and the accelerated rate of net protein catabolism at the whole-body level. In response to nutritional support, there is a significant increase in the muscle protein synthesis, but we could not demonstrate any increase in cancer protein synthesis. 
3	Diagnostic imaging and surgical treatment of dumbbell tumors of the mediastinum. We describe the diagnostic procedures and surgical approaches employed in 5 patients with dumbbell tumors of the mediastinum. Magnetic resonance imaging accurately described the existence and longitudinal extension of the intraspinal component of the tumor and assisted in choosing the appropriate surgical approach. Both the intrathoracic and intraspinal components of the tumor were resected at one time by a thoracic and neurosurgical team. We employed the Grillo technique three times and a separate laminectomy and thoracotomy approach. Magnetic resonance imaging proved the most useful diagnostic technique for suspected dumbbell mediastinal tumors. In our experience, the extended thoracotomy proposed by Grillo and co-workers worked well for small tumors involving only one foramen in which the intraspinal extension was limited to 2 to 3 cm, and when no more than two laminectomies were required. On the other hand, thoracotomy and a longitudinal paravertebral incision are preferable for larger tumors (more than 4 cm) involving more than one foramen in which the intraspinal extension exceeds 2 to 3 cm, for tumors requiring multiple laminectomy, and when bony infiltration is present. 
4	Long-term effects of nimodipine on cerebral infarcts and outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery. A total of 213 patients with verified aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of Grades I to III (Hunt and Hess classification) were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to determine the effect of intravenous nimodipine on delayed ischemic deterioration and computerized tomography (CT)-visualized infarcts after SAH and surgery. The administration of the drug or matching placebo was started immediately after the radiological diagnosis of a ruptured aneurysm had been made. Of the 213 patients enrolled in the study, 58 were operated on early (within 72 hours after the bleed: Days 0 to 3), 69 were operated on subacutely (between Days 4 and 7), and 74 had late surgery (on Day 8 or later). Eleven patients died before surgery was undertaken and one was not operated on. A follow-up examination with CT scanning, performed 1 to 3 years after the SAH (mean 1.4 years), revealed no significant differences in the overall outcome between the groups. However, nimodipine treatment was associated with a significantly lower incidence of deaths caused by delayed cerebral ischemia (p = 0.01) and significantly lower occurrence of cerebral infarcts visualized by CT scanning in the whole population (p = 0.05), especially in patients without an associated intracerebral hemorrhage on admission CT scan (p = 0.03). 
4	The real impact of mechanical bridge strategy in patients with severe acute infarction. Results obtained in the past 3 years in patients referred with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cardiogenic shock for a mechanical bridge to urgent transplantation permit one to assess the real impact of the present strategy in clinical practice. Ten patients (mean age = 49) were admitted in serious condition (CI = 1.8 +/- 0.2 L/min/m2, PCWP = 28 +/- 6 mmHg, systolic aortic pressure = 88 +/- 20 mmHg, urine output 11 +/- 20 ml/hr) and were treated by maximal sympathomimetic support and i.v. enoximone. Two had to be implanted with a total artificial heart (TAH) and one with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for recurrent fibrillation despite hemodynamic improvement, within 8 hr. Two have received transplants and are living well after 20 months. Seven who initially improved markedly have been listed as urgent transplant candidates: two of these have been successfully transplanted, and three died suddenly after 6, 25, and 45 days, respectively. One has undergone successful coronary surgery. One patient (age 62, diabetic) was secondarily rejected for a transplant and died. This experience clearly shows that despite initial spectacular hemodynamic improvement, which was due to optimized medical management, death rate before transplant because of sudden ventricular fibrillation remains unacceptably high. This should prompt early mechanical support, with less invasive systems, in patients with AMI. 
5	Percutaneous angioscopy during coronary angioplasty using a steerable microangioscope. The feasibility of using a flexible, steerable angioscope to perform coronary angioscopy before and after percutaneous coronary angioplasty was tested. The microangioscope fits through an 8F coronary angioplasty guiding catheter and contains a multifiber viewing bundle incorporated into the body of a 4.3F balloon catheter with a central lumen for distal flushing and guide-wire passage. Angioscopy was performed without complications 45 times in 24 patients, including 6 patients with stable and 18 with unstable angina. Circumferential visualization of the target lesion was successful in 20 (83%) of the 24 patients and improved with operator experience. Excellent visualization of the target lesion was achieved in 16 (94%) of the last 17 patients. Plaque, thrombus and dissection were among the abnormal findings in the 20 patients (4 with stable, 16 with unstable angina) in whom circumferential viewing of the target lesion was achieved. In four patients with restenosis after angioplasty, the lesion morphology was distinctly different from that of lesions in arteries without prior angioplasty. In patients with stable angina, no thrombus or dissection was seen by angiography or angioscopy before angioplasty. In patients with unstable angina, thrombus was detected more frequently by angioscopy than by angiography before angioplasty (8 versus 2 of 16) and after (15 versus 2 of 16) angioplasty. Intimal dissection was also seen much more frequently by angioscopy than by angiography before angioplasty (7 versus 0 of 16) and after angioplasty (16 versus 7 of 16). It is concluded that high resolution percutaneous coronary angioscopy can be performed safely in conjunction with balloon angioplasty. Further investigation is needed before this diagnostic tool can be applied clinically. 
1	Gamma-detecting probe and autoradiographic studies of radiolabeled antibody B72.3 in CX-1 colon xenografts. Nude mice bearing CX-1 colon tumors were injected with 50 microCi 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody (MAb) B72.3. Radioactivity in tumors was studied with the gamma detecting probe (GDP) on days 1, 3, 7, and 10 after MAb injection. On each day, two mice were sacrificed and sections were examined with autoradiography (ARG), immunoperoxidase methods (IMP), and routine stains. Mean probe counts showed increasing tumor to background ratios and ARG demonstrated a progressive increase in radionuclide in the tumors. The distribution of 125I was primarily around the vascular spaces on day 1, but by day 3 and progressively it appeared in tumor gland lumina and necrotic areas. A regional correlation was shown between radionuclide in vascular spaces and its sequestration in tumor elements. 
5	Caffeine and cardiac arrhythmias. PURPOSE: To review the evidence supporting the belief that caffeine causes cardiac arrhythmias. DATA SOURCES: Studies published since 1982 identified through computerized searches of MEDLINE, TOXLINE, and Chemical Abstracts and a review of bibliographies of relevant articles on the subject of caffeine and cardiac arrhythmias. STUDY SELECTION: All clinical studies examining caffeine as a cause of cardiac arrhythmias and a selection of basic science experiments to illustrate caffeine's effects in vitro. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality was assessed and all available clinical data pertaining to caffeine as a cause of arrhythmias were summarized. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: In one electrophysiologic study, caffeine was associated with an increased susceptibility to provoked cardiac arrhythmias. In five placebo-controlled trials, caffeine in doses up to 500 mg daily (equivalent to 5 to 6 cups of coffee) did not increase the frequency or severity of ventricular arrhythmias. One large epidemiologic study reported an increase in the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles in persons consuming 9 or more cups of coffee daily. CONCLUSION: Moderate ingestion of caffeine does not increase the frequency or severity of cardiac arrhythmias in normal persons, patients with ischemic heart disease, or those with pre-existing serious ventricular ectopy. 
5	Muscle fibre type and habitual snoring. Although anatomical abnormalities of the upper airway have been recorded in some patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), a muscle tone dysregulation also seems to have an important role in this disorder. Since habitual snoring is the initial stage of OSA, the structural characteristics of upper airway muscles (medium pharyngeal constrictor muscle [MPCM]) from 13 men (9 non-snorers and 4 habitual snorers) were studied. MPCM fibre structure in non-snorers was broadly similar to that in normal limb muscles, with the exception that fibre diameters were smaller for all fibre types. Compared with limb muscles, MPCM had a smaller proportion of type IIb fibres and a higher proportion of types I and IIa fibres. MPCM in habitual snorers had an abnormal distribution of fibre types (low percentage of type I and type IIb fibres and high percentage of type IIa fibres) compared with non-snorers (p less than 0.001) and the type IIa fibres were hypertrophic. No myopathic or neurogenic changes were seen. Two possible hypotheses explain the abnormal distribution of fibre types in snorers. First, a constitutionally determined reduction of slow alpha-motor neurons induces an adaptive transformation of type IIb to type IIa fibres and a hypertrophy of type IIa fibres; or, second, motor neurons change their patterns of discharge and, hence, of activation, and modify fibre-type distribution of MPCM as an adaptation to the anatomical characteristic of upper airway and habitual snoring. 
4	Glomerular hyperfiltration indicates early target organ damage in essential hypertension In 111 patients with essential hypertension (World Health Organization stage I or II), we examined the relationship between renal hemodynamics and left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular structure was determined by two-dimensional guided M-mode echocardiography, renal blood flow by iodine I 131 aminohippuric acid clearance, and glomerular filtration rate by creatinine clearance. The glomerular filtration rate correlated with left ventricular mass (r = .52) and left ventricular cross-sectional area (r = .21). Conversely, at a similar age, body mass index, body surface area, and arterial pressure, hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy disclosed a higher glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction than those without left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas renal blood flow and renal vascular resistance measurements were not significantly different. Thus, at similar levels of arterial pressure and renal blood flow, glomerular hyperfiltration was linked to early cardiac structural changes in essential hypertension. We conclude that, in a hypertensive patient with normal renal function, a high glomerular filtration rate may be an indicator for early target organ damage in essential hypertension. 
2	A controlled trial of beclomethasone versus betamethasone enemas in distal ulcerative colitis. Steroid enemas are widely used in distal inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). They are partly absorbed and suppress adrenocortical function. Beclomethasone dipropionate (BD) is a topically active steroid that undergoes rapid first-pass inactivation in the liver and is practically devoid of systemic side effects. We treated 32 consecutive patients with active distal ulcerative colitis (40 attacks) with 0.5 mg BD and/or 5 mg betamethasone phosphate (BP) enemas for 28 days. Clinical, laboratory, sigmoidoscopic, and histologic data were recorded before, during, and after the trial. The clinical efficacy of both treatments was similar. Betamethasone was slightly more effective in relation to the histologic improvement and disappearance of blood from the stools. Clinical signs of steroid overdosage were noted in patients on BP but not in patients on BD. Mean fasting plasma cortisol at the end of the trial was 2.9 micrograms/dl in the BP group and 15.3 micrograms/dl in the BD group. The adrenocorticotropin test was markedly suppressed in the BP group but not in the BD group. The absence of systemic steroid side effects makes BD enemas a useful addition in the therapy of IBD. Its oral administration should also be considered. 
3	Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan: muscle biopsy findings in 4 patients. Muscle biopsies of 4 patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan showed lymphocytic infiltrates with occasional eosinophils largely restricted to interstitial fibrous tissue and perivascular areas. There was inflammation and fibrosis of muscle spindle capsules in 3 patients. In the 2 sickest patients, there was profound muscle atrophy, affecting both muscle fiber types. 
2	Acute urinary retention in a child with appendiceal abscess: diagnostic dilemma. Rarely do children with appendiceal abscess present with acute urinary retention as the only sign or symptom. This presentation may delay diagnosis and definitive therapy, thereby causing additional morbidity and possible mortality. We report the eighth case of acute urinary retention in a child associated with an appendiceal abscess. 
5	Secondary damage to the knee after isolated injury of the anterior cruciate ligament. Between 1978 and 1984, we examined and performed arthroscopy on 1000 consecutive patients. Ninety-eight of the 1000 had isolated ACL damage. These cases do not include patients with initial ACL injuries combined with other intraarticular damage. Diagnosis was by physical and arthroscopic examination. Examination took place an average 13.6 months after injury. Of the 98 isolated ACL injuries, 56 were complete ruptures and 42 were partial ruptures. In most cases of partial rupture, the clinical diagnosis was wrong. "Meniscal damage" was the usual diagnosis in these cases; the true diagnosis was made only by arthroscopic examination. Thirty-four of the 98 patients with isolated ACL injuries (30 men and 4 women) developed further intraarticular damage. Of these 34, 20 had complete ACL rupture and 14 had partial ACL rupture. Treatment after primary injury included physiotherapy in all patients and bracing in those whose knee was unstable during daily activities. Reconstructive surgical procedures were not performed in those patients. The time lapse from the primary to the secondary injury varied from 1 month to 20 years, with an average of 28 months. The secondary damage was caused by a secondary injury that was mild (22 cases) or developed insidiously (12 cases). Five types of secondary damage were observed: partial ACL tears that became complete--11 cases; meniscal tear--8 cases; loosening and subluxation of the anterior horn of the medial meniscus--14 cases; and fracture or damage to the articular condylar cartilage, with or without bone involvement--11 cases. It should be emphasized that the secondary damages were at times combined. 
5	Further evaluation of radical surgery following radiotherapy for advanced parotid carcinoma. A series of 30 patients who have been treated for advanced carcinoma of the parotid gland using radiotherapy followed by radical surgery is presented. Three patients deteriorated during preoperative radiotherapy and remained unfit for surgery; the remaining 27 underwent radical parotidectomy with block dissection of the neck. Twelve patients received additional radiotherapy after operation. Of those patients undergoing surgery, three have been lost to follow-up, 17 have died and seven remain alive; the period of follow-up ranges from 3 to 133 months. Fourteen patients remained free of recurrent disease at death or when last seen, and six patients developed a local recurrence at a medium period of 10.5 (range 3-36) months after surgery. For all 30 patients, the cumulative proportion surviving for 5 years was 30 per cent. 
5	Percutaneous balloon dilatation of benign biliary strictures. Percutaneous biliary dilatation is an effective alternative to surgical management of benign biliary strictures that has low morbidity and no reported mortality. Reported success rates for this procedure range from 40% to 90% depending on the size of the series, the type of patient being treated, and the length of follow-up period. The procedure is done in the fluoroscopy suite with an angioplasty balloon catheter. Transhepatic access is most common, but the procedure may be done via existing T-tube tracts or specially created jejunal loops. As the frequency of radical liver surgery such as liver transplant and radical trisegmentectomy rises, so too, the rate of biliary stricture is likely to rise, making percutaneous balloon dilatation an increasingly important tool in the interventional radiologist's armamentarium. 
4	Possible triggering of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in normal hearts by psychological stressors: a report of two cases. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was triggered by psychological stress in two patients, both of whom had normal echocardiograms and coronary angiography. Neither patient was alcoholic or had ingested ethanol in relation to the onset of atrial fibrillation and both were free of metabolic derangements. Possible mechanisms involved in the triggering of atrial fibrillation are discussed. 
2	Mechanical sutures in perforation of the thoracic esophagus as a safe procedure in patients seen late. Between 1976 and 1988, we treated 13 perforations of the thoracic esophagus, excluding ruptured carcinoma and intraoperative wounds, by mechanical sutures without exclusion. The delay between perforation and treatment ranged from eight to 168 hours, more than 24 hours in 11. The length of perforation was 0.5 to 15.0 centimeters. Suture was covered with a flap in ten instances; an antireflux procedure was associated with five instances. No digestive ostomies were performed. There was one death; a patient who was comatose upon arrival. The results of this small series suggest that myotomy exposing the mucosa and a flap are two essential elements of the technique; perforations of less than 6 centimeters, even when seen late, may be treated by primary surgical closure. 
5	Computed tomography in the assessment of the postenucleation socket syndrome. To gain a deeper insight into the cause of the postenucleation socket syndrome, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) was performed in 22 anophthalmic patients before insertion of an intraorbital implant. The anatomy of the normal and the anophthalmic orbits was compared. Computed tomographic scans were made either in the sagittal and the coronal plane or in the sagittal and transverse plane. The authors discovered a sagging and retraction of the superior muscle complex and a downward and forward redistribution of orbital fat. Finally, an upward displacement of the distal end together with a retraction of the inferior rectus muscle was found. These phenomena were measured and appear to cause a rotatory displacement of orbital contents from superior to posterior and from posterior to inferior which is best demonstrated in the sagittal plane. This redistribution of orbital contents can explain the sequelae of the anophthalmic orbit. No signs of orbital fat atrophy could be demonstrated. With this knowledge, the proper treatment of patients with a postenucleation socket syndrome is ascertained. 
3	Continuous papaveretum infusion for the control of pain in painful sickling crisis. We describe our experience of using continuous papaveretum infusions to control pain in 24 children admitted on 45 occasions with painful sickling crisis. The children were aged from 1.7 to 14.3 years. Infusion duration ranged from one to nine days (median three days), total dose from 0.3 to 21 mg/kg (median 2.4 mg/kg), with a pronounced tendency for dosage to increase with increasing age. No respiratory depression was observed. One infusion was discontinued because of cerebral toxicity. 
4	Valvular and coronary surgery in renal transplant patients. The Authors report aortic valvular replacement (AVR) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) successfully performed in two renal transplant patients. The postoperative blood urea and creatinine levels were comparable to the preoperative values. The first patient underwent isolated AVR. The second patient had an initial AVR combined with CABG followed two years later by a further AVR for prosthetic dysfunction. For many reasons, coronary artery (CAD) and valvular diseases are not uncommon in renal transplant patients. Cardiac surgery is feasible without impairment of the renal function provided some precautions are taken, ie good mean perfusion pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), adequate volume replacement, and selected use of mannitol and dopamine. 
3	Brain and spinal cord hemorrhage in long-term survivors of malignant pediatric brain tumors: a possible late effect of therapy. Three children with malignant primary CNS tumors treated with craniospinal radiotherapy developed intraparenchymal hemorrhages a median of 5 years following therapy in sites distant from the primary tumor. Radical surgical procedures disclosed fresh and old hematoma, gliosis, and necrosis in all 3 patients and an aggregation of abnormal microscopic blood vessels in two. No tumor was found. All 3 patients remain in long-term (greater than 10 years) continuous remission. 
2	Adult and pediatric peritonitis rates in a home dialysis program: comparison of continuous ambulatory and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis. We reviewed our 115-month experience with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) in adult and pediatric patients to determine whether there is a difference in the incidence of peritonitis between patients performing CAPD or CCPD. Peritonitis rates were similar in patients performing CAPD or CCPD in both the adult and pediatric age groups. The overall CAPD peritonitis rate was significantly lower in adult patients when compared with pediatric patients. There was no difference in peritonitis rates for CCPD between adult and pediatric patients. When the data are divided into 3-year subgroups, the incidence of peritonitis is significantly lower in adult patients undergoing either CAPD or CCPD when compared with pediatric patients during the years 1986 to 1988. There is significant improvement over time in the incidence of peritonitis in both adult and pediatric patients performing CCPD; similarly, there is a trend toward improvement in patients performing CAPD. Staphylococcus species organisms remain the most common bacterial cause of peritonitis, except in pediatric patients under the age of 2 years or with nephrostomies, where gram-negative rod infections were more common. Peritonitis resulted in discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis in a greater number of adult patients. These results suggest that the number of catheter manipulations is not important in determining the incidence of peritonitis. Pediatric patients are more likely than adult patients to develop peritonitis with either CAPD or CCPD. Adult patients are more likely than pediatric patients to discontinue peritoneal dialysis secondary to peritonitis. 
4	Family history fails to identify many children with severe hypercholesterolemia. Optimal strategies for identifying children with hypercholesterolemia have not been established. Several groups have advocated that testing of serum cholesterol levels be limited to those children who have family histories of hyperlipidemia or premature coronary heart disease. We studied the ability of comprehensive family histories to identify children with hyperlipidemia in a group of 114 children (mean age, 8 +/- 4 years) who were referred for treatment of hypercholesterolemia. A positive family history was defined according to guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The mean fasting total cholesterol in the children was 5.74 +/- 1.42 mmol/L (222 mg/dL). Family history was negative for hypercholesterolemia or premature coronary heart disease in 22 (22%) of 100 children with total cholesterol levels greater than the 75th percentile for their ages, in 13 (18.3%) of 71 children with total cholesterol levels greater than the 95th percentile for their ages, and in four (11.8%) of 34 children with presumed heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Of the 78 children who had both hypercholesterolemia and positive family histories, hyperlipidemia was reported in 72 families, whereas premature heart disease was reported in only 27. We conclude that in a population of children referred because of known hypercholesterolemia, a detailed family history not only fails to identify many children with mild hypercholesterolemia, but also fails to identify a significant proportion of children with markedly elevated cholesterol levels. Additionally, in families of children with hypercholesterolemia, a history of hyperlipidemia is more common than a history of premature heart disease. 
1	Retroviral transduction of protein kinase C-gamma into cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones leads to immortalization with retention of specific function. The molecular pathways that are responsible for delivering the proliferative signals from the cell surface to the nucleus in T lymphocytes are still unresolved, but recent data implicates protein kinase C (PKC) involvement in the TCR signaling pathway. To further address the role of PKC in T cell activation, the effects of high level expression of the PKC-gamma isoenzyme in murine CTL clones were examined. Unlike the parental cells that required periodic Ag stimulation for cell activation and growth, cells expressing a retrovirally transduced PKC-gamma gene propagated in culture independent of the need for Ag stimulation, although maintaining identical functional specificity to the parental CTL. Constitutive PKC-gamma expression may therefore mimic physiologic PKC activation, thereby abrogating the requirement for TCR-Ag interaction in T cell activation. 
5	Synergistic effects of INTERCEED(TC7) and heparin in reducing adhesion formation in the rabbit uterine horn model. Surgical adjuvants are commonly employed to reduce the frequency of postoperative adhesion development after reproductive pelvic surgery. The ability of indomethacin, promethazine dexamethasone, Intralipid, progesterone, and heparin to reduce adhesion formation in combination with INTERCEED(TC7) (Johnson and Johnson Medical, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ), an absorbable barrier that alone reduces adhesion formation, was examined in a rabbit uterine horn model. A significant reduction in adhesion formation was only observed with the combination of INTERCEED(TC7) plus heparin. In addition studies, heparin delivery by intraperitoneal (IP) lavage, intravenous injection, or intra-abdominal instillation failed to demonstrate efficacy. Similarly, heparin delivery with other barriers or IP instillates (carboxymethylcellulose or 32% Dextran 70) failed to reduce adhesion formation. We conclude that INTERCEED(TC7) can be efficaciously utilized as a carrier to deliver heparin to traumatized surfaces, thereby reducing adhesion formation. 
5	Marker profile of different phases in the transition of normal human ovarian epithelium to ovarian carcinomas. To investigate whether early changes in the transformation of normal ovarian epithelial cells into tumor cells can be detected with monoclonal antibodies, a comparative immunohistochemical study was performed on normal human ovarian mesothelial cells, cystomas, cystadenomas, ovarian carcinomas, as well as granulosa cell tumor. Using monoclonal antibodies against different keratin subtypes, it was shown that mesothelial cells, ovarian cysts, cystadenomas, and carcinomas all reacted positively with broad-spectrum anti-keratin monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), as well as with MAbs to keratins 7, 8, 18, and 19. Keratins 4 and 13 were not found in mesothelial cells, but positive groups of cells were identified in several cystomas, adenomas, and carcinomas. While mesothelial cells did not react with the pan-epithelial marker BW495/36, invaginating metaplastic mesothelial cells, inclusion cysts, cystomas, adenomas, and carcinomas showed an increasing reactivity with BW495/36, with an increasing degree of malignancy. The reactivity of MAbs against ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens (OV-TL 3, OC 125, MOv 18, and OV-TL 10) was limited to weak staining reaction in some mesothelial cells but were found to be positive on more than 50% of the ovarian cystadenomas and more than 90% of the ovarian carcinomas. Thecal and granulosa cells of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles all reacted positively with antibodies to the broad-spectrum keratins OV-TL 12/5 and RCK 102, and to keratins 8 and 18, but not with keratins 4, 7, 13, and 19. These keratins decreased or disappeared in granulosa cells of mature follicles (Graafian follicles), whereas granulosa cell tumors did not react with anti-keratin antibodies. The reactivity of BW 495/36 was negative or limited to traces in some granulosa cells. Ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens were not expressed in granulosa cells or granulosa cell tumors. The data indicate that mesothelial cells undergoing metaplastic changes finally resulting in ovarian cystadenomas (and carcinomas) initiate the synthesis of a 200-kd glycoprotein recognized by MAb (BW 495/36), the production of ovarian carcinoma associated antigens, in addition to focal production of keratin 4 and/or 13, as seen in several samples. The granulosa cell tumors decrease or switch off their keratin production and remain negative for the 200-kd glycoprotein and the ovarian carcinoma-associated antigens. 
5	Screening of nineteen unrelated families with generalized resistance to thyroid hormone for known point mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene and the detection of a new mutation. Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) is a syndrome characterized by impaired tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormone. Two distinct point mutations in the hormone binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta have recently been identified in two unrelated families with GRTH. One, Mf, involves a replacement of the normal glycine-345 for arginine in exon 7 and another, Mh, replaces the normal proline-453 for histidine in exon 8. To probe for the presence of the Mf and Mh defect in 19 unrelated families with GRTH, we applied separate polymerase chain reactions using allele-specific oligonucleotide primers containing the normal and each of the two mutant nucleotides at the 3'-position. A total of 24 affected subjects and 13 normal family members were studied. The mode of inheritance was dominant in 13 families, was unknown in 5 families, and was clearly recessive in 1 family in which only the consanguineous subjects were affected. Primers containing the substitutions specific for Mf and Mh amplified exons 7 and 8, respectively, only in affected members of each of the two index families. Primers containing the normal sequences amplified exons 7 and 8 of the TR beta gene in all subjects except affected members of one family. In this family with recessively inherited GRTH, neither exon could be amplified using any combinations of primers and DNA blot revealed absence of all coding exons. These results indicate a major deletion of the TR beta gene, including both DNA and hormone binding domains. Since heterozygous members of this family are not affected, the presence of a single normal allele is sufficient for normal function of the TR beta. These data also support the hypothesis that in the dominant mode of GRTH inheritance the presence of an abnormal TR beta interferes with the function of the normal TR beta. Distinct mutations are probably responsible for GRTH in unrelated families. 
1	Detection of Epstein-Barr virus DNA in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of nasopharyngeal carcinoma using polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. The polymerase chain reaction method for amplification of DNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections was used to detect Epstein-Barr virus DNA in nasopharyngeal carcinomas from Japanese patients. Thirty-one cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 8 cases of lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were studied. Detection rates of Epstein-Barr virus in various types of nasopharyngeal carcinoma according to the World Health Organization classification were as follows: 10 of 10 undifferentiated carcinomas, 8 of 13 nonkeratinizing carcinomas, and 5 of 7 keratinizing carcinomas. Eight lymph node metastases, for which the primary was positive for Epstein-Barr virus, also contained Epstein-Barr virus DNA. By in situ hybridization using a biotinylated Epstein-Barr virus probe, it was clearly demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus DNA was localized in the nuclei of the neoplastic cells. The clinical features of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with or without Epstein-Barr virus were not different. These results demonstrate that nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Japanese patients is closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, similar to nasopharyngeal carcinoma of other endemic and nonendemic areas. 
2	Spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma: a review of 172 Japanese cases. The spontaneous rupture of a primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 10% mortality of HCC patients in Japan. Because this problem occurs much less frequently in western countries, it is often difficult for clinicians practicing in such countries to decide upon the best course of action during the crisis accompanying the spontaneous rupture of a HCC. In an effort to advance the general knowledge of this disease and clarify a selection for its treatment, we review 172 cases of spontaneous rupture of a HCC reported in the Japanese literature. The chief complaint of the patients was sudden epigastralgia or right hypochondriac pain. Abdominal paracentesis was positive in 86% of the patients. Liver failure was the cause of death in 42% of the patients. Therefore, it is important to evaluate liver reserve quickly. In addition, emergency hemostatic procedures must be implemented to avoid hemorrhagic shock. Although two-stage hepatectomy was performed in only 12% of the cases, these had the highest survival rates. Consequently, this is the procedure of choice for the treatment of spontaneous rupture of a HCC. 
1	Dentofacial development in long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A comparison of three treatment modalities. Ninety-seven children who were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia before 10 years of age and treated with chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy plus 1800-cGy cranial irradiation (RT), or chemotherapy plus 2400-cGy RT were evaluated for effects of therapy on dentofacial development. All patients were seen at least 5 years postdiagnosis. Dental abnormalities were determined from panoramic radiographs, and craniofacial evaluations were made from lateral cephalometric radiographs. Ninety-one (94%) of all patients and 41 (100%) of patients younger than 5 years of age at diagnosis had abnormal dental development. The severity of these abnormalities was greater in children who received treatment before 5 years of age and in those who received RT. Observed dental abnormalities included tooth agenesis, arrested root development, microdontia, and enamel dysplasias. Craniofacial abnormalities occurred in 18 of 20 (90%) of those patients who received chemotherapy plus 2400-cGy RT before 5 years of age. Mean cephalometric values of this group showed significant deficient mandibular development. The results of this study suggest that the severity of dentofacial-developmental abnormalities secondary to antileukemia therapy are related to the age of the patient at the initiation of treatment and the use of cranial RT. 
4	Vitreous changes and macular edema in central retinal vein occlusion. The condition of the posterior vitreous was determined in 56 eyes with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Using a life-table analysis, it was studied in 56 eyes. The incidence of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in the CRVO eyes at the first vitreous examination did not differ significantly from that in 64 age-matched control eyes. However, the incidence of PVD in CRVO eyes increased from 39.3% at the first vitreous examination to 58.5% after 6 months, and to 69.6% 1 year from the examination. The incidence of PVD in CRVO eyes during follow-up was statistically higher than that of the controls (P = .009). The incidence of PVD after the first vitreous examination was significantly higher in eyes with hemorrhagic retinopathy than in eyes with venous stasis retinopathy (P = .04). In the 34 eyes with macular edema, the edema lasted significantly longer in those with vitreomacular attachment (VMA) at the first examination than in those without VMA at this time (P = .02). VMA may play an important role in the pathogenesis and chronicity of macular edema in CRVO. 
2	Rotavirus-specific antibody response in saliva of infants with rotavirus diarrhea. The reliability of saliva as an indicator of rotavirus infection was assessed among 15 infants (3-12 months) with rotaviral and 15 with nonrotaviral diarrhea. Paired salivary samples collected during acute and convalescent phases were tested for rotavirus-specific IgA and IgM by an ELISA. The sensitivity of IgA or IgM alone to predict infection was 53.3% and 46.6%, respectively; used in conjunction, the sensitivity rose to 80%. It seems that infants with rotaviral diarrhea mount mucosal antibody responses as reflected in their saliva; possibly salivary antibodies could be used to evaluate vaccine "take" in rotavirus vaccine trials. 
4	Therapy of diseased stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with nimodipine. We investigated the therapeutic effect of nimodipine or parathyroidectomy in old, diseased stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats by observing 98 male 1-year-old rats over 5 months. After stroke had occurred, the rats were divided into three groups: 1) parathyroidectomy, 2) nimodipine, and 3) controls. In the nimodipine group, the rats survived longer than those in the other groups. Blood pressure of the controls did not differ from the nimodipine-treated and parathyroidectomy animals. The increase in calcium content of brain and kidney tissues and of plasma renin activity, urea, and creatinine was attenuated by nimodipine or parathyroidectomy. The histology of the kidneys revealed widespread fibrinoid necrosis of arteries in all rats. In the nimodipine-treated or parathyroidectomy groups, healing of the lesions was detectable. Cerebral lesions were mainly characterized by fibrinoid necrosis. Nimodipine-treated as well as parathyroidectomied animals showed significantly fewer hypertensive cerebral lesions. In old, diseased stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, therapy with nimodipine or parathyroidectomy increased their survival rate. The cerebrovascular and renovascular lesions of treated animals were attenuated, and morphologic signs of healing were observed. Reduction of calcium overload by nimodipine or parathyroidectomy, even in an advanced stage of disease, had a therapeutic effect. 
5	Standard v lightweight wheelchair propulsion in spinal cord injured patients. Twenty-six male SCI subjects (six quadriplegics, eight "high paraplegics," and 12 "low paraplegics") propelled both standard and lightweight wheelchairs at a "sprint pace" (Sp) for 400 feet, and at a "duration pace" (Du) for four continuous minutes. Pulse, blood pressure and respirations were measured before and after each trial, and V was calculated. Appropriate training and rest periods were given; order of wheelchair testing was randomized. A questionnaire was later administered. Variations in pulse, systolic blood pressure, and respirations were significant between myelopathic levels (P less than 0.01), but were not affected by the type of wheelchair used. Quadriplegic V was less (P less than 0.01) than that of either paraplegic group for Sp and Du trials; for Sp, lightweight wheelchair V is faster (P less than 0.01) than standard wheelchair V for all groups. 
2	Methotrexate therapy for persistent ectopic pregnancy after conservative laparoscopic management. Persistent ectopic pregnancy is a recognized complication of conservative laparoscopic surgery. Three such cases were treated successfully with methotrexate and citrovorum factor rescue. All three patients experienced mild lower abdominal pain for a maximum of 36 hours; no other adverse effects were noted. More experience with this therapy will be necessary before subsequent fertility rates can be determined. 
5	Gentamicin iontophoresis in the treatment of bacterial otitis externa in the guinea pig model. Pseudomonas otitis externa is one of the most common infections treated by otolaryngologists. Infections induced in 30 guinea pigs appeared similar to that seen in humans. The ears were then placed into four treatment groups: group A, which received a single cleaning; group B, which received a single cleaning followed by gentamicin drops 4 times daily; group C, which received a single cleaning followed by a single gentamicin iontophoresis treatment; and group D, the control group, which received no treatment. Infections were analyzed by grading edema, purulence, and erythema. An average of 10.2 days was required for control group to return to normal appearance. Groups A, B, and C had mean resolution times of 5.9, 4.7, and 4.3 days, respectively. Gentamicin iontophoresis appears to be promising, with results as good as drop therapy in otitis externa in the guinea pig model. 
1	Granular cell tumors of the vulva. Granular cell tumor (GCT), although nearly ubiquitous, is seen infrequently in the vulva. A review of the surgical pathology files from Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, from 1983 through 1987 identified eight cases of vulvar GCT. Five of the eight patients had more than one skin and soft tissue lesion. Two of the five had biopsy-proven multicentric GCT with a unique clinical course. One of the patients was a 32-year-old woman with multiple vulvar, lingual, laryngeal, bronchial and pulmonary GCT, necessitating multiple excisions and ultimately pneumonectomy. The second patient had multiple GCTs in the vulva and inguinal area and finally in both lungs, resulting in her death at age 39. No dependable microscopic features could be identified to distinguish benign GCT from its more aggressive variant. However, Feulgen DNA histomorphometry demonstrated aneuploidy in the patient with apparent lung metastases, whereas the tumors from patients with a benign course as well as from the patient with multiorgan involvement were diploid. In three of five patients who could be interviewed there was a history of soft tissue tumors in members of the family. The multifocal nature and possible familial component of GCT need to be explored further. 
5	The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in young patients. An international survey identified 40 patients less than 20 years old who underwent surgical implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD). There was a history of aborted sudden cardiac death or sustained ventricular tachycardia in 92.5% of these patients. Twenty-two patients (55%) had structural heart disease; dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were the most common diagnoses. Eighteen patients (45%) had primary electrical abnormalities including seven with the congenital long QT syndrome. There were no perioperative deaths associated with device implantation. Concomitant drug therapy was administered to 75% of the patients. Defibrillator discharge occurred in 70% of the patients, with 17 patients (42.5%) receiving at least one appropriate shock. There were two sudden and two nonsudden deaths at 28.2 months' median follow-up. Sudden death-free survival rates by life table analysis at 12 and 33 months were 0.94 and 0.88, respectively. Total survival rates at 12 and 33 months were 0.94 and 0.82, respectively. The AICD represents an effective treatment approach for young patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. 
1	Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the lower genital tract. Correlation of mother's recall of diethylstilbestrol history with obstetrical records. The written obstetric records of maternal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) were used as a criterion standard and compared with the DES exposure history recalled by mothers of women with vaginal, cervical, or indeterminable vaginal/exocervical clear cell adenocarcinoma. Among cervical cases, the sensitivity of maternal recall was 50% (N = 2), and its specificity was 100%. Among vaginal and vaginal/exocervical cases, this sensitivity was 72%; specificity was 60%; and the majority of these mothers who said they did not take DES were DES positive by written records. Thus investigators should avoid using maternal recall alone to measure DES exposure. Among subjects for whom written maternal obstetric records were available, 88% of vaginal cases and 46% of cervical cases were DES positive. The authors conclude that few cases of vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma should occur in young women as the cohort of women exposed in utero to DES continues to age, whereas cases of cervical origin may continue to occur. 
1	A self-assembling protein kinase C inhibitor. Previous studies have described a dicationic anticarcinoma agent that can chemically assemble in situ from monocationic phosphonium salts. The chemical combination of these monocationic precursors in the micromolar concentration range, occurring after their uptake by cells, was probably responsible for their synergistic inhibition of cell growth and for their selective cytotoxicity to Ehrlich ascites murine carcinoma cells relative to untransformed epithelial cells. Here, we report that the dicationic product that forms in this assembly reaction is an in vitro inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha and beta 1 isoforms, exhibiting IC50 values of 20.4 microM and 35 microM, respectively. The monocationic precursors proved to be much weaker inhibitors of PKC (IC50 values greater than 200 microM). When PKC is exposed to combinations of the two precursors, the enzymatic activity decreases steadily as a function of time. Using dose-response data and HPLC kinetic studies, we show that when the two precursor compounds are added as a combination to PKC under these conditions, the rate of formation of the inhibitory product follows the observed time course of decline in PKC activity under identical conditions. We discuss the possibility that antiproliferative effects against carcinoma cells of the preformed dication and of the combined monocationic precursors involve inhibition of PKC. 
1	Lymphoproliferative disorders associated with carbamazepine. Carbamazepine-induced lymphoproliferative disorders are relatively rare. A 32-year-old woman developed cervical lymphadenopathy while taking carbamazepine. Histologic evaluation of the lymph node biopsy specimen demonstrated near-total effacement of the nodal architecture by a population of pleomorphic immunoblasts. The predominant cell population expressed CD3, CD2, CD5, and CD4, while results of testing for CD8 were negative. On the basis of the morphologic and immunohistologic features, a diagnosis of high-grade, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, T-cell immunoblastic type, was made. Despite the fact that aggressive behavior is usually associated with immunoblastic lymphomas, the patient has done well for 33 months after cessation of carbamazepine in the absence of chemotherapeutic treatment. The clinical features of this patient's illness, therefore, suggest that it is best regarded as a so-called pseudolymphoma. 
4	Clinical outcome of emergency repeat coronary artery bypass surgery. To determine the clinical outcome of patients requiring emergency repeat coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures, we reviewed 23 such procedures performed for ongoing myocardial ischemia refractory to medical management. The operative mortality was 17%. On follow-up, an average of 24.9 months after emergency reoperation, 14 of the 19 survivors (74%) had recurrent angina. As compared to a randomly selected group of 25 patients who underwent elective repeat CABG procedures during the same time period, the incidence of late cardiac events was significantly higher (79% in the emergency group, 30% in the elective surgery group) and fewer patients had received internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts (9% vs 52%). Emergency repeat CABG operations have considerable operative mortality and poor postoperative functional results with the majority of survivors developing recurrent ischemic syndromes within a short period of time. 
5	Systemic alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine: a diagnostic test for sympathetically maintained pain. The diagnosis of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP) is typically established by assessment of pain relief during local anesthetic blockade of the sympathetic ganglia that innervate the painful body part. To determine if systemic alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine can be used to diagnose SMP, we compared the effects on pain of local anesthetic sympathetic ganglion blocks (LASB) and phentolamine blocks (PhB) in 20 patients with chronic pain and hyperalgesia that were suspected to be sympathetically maintained. The blocks were done in random order on separate days. Patients rated the intensity of ongoing and stimulus-evoked pain every 5 min before, during, and after the LASB and PhB. Patients and the investigator assessing pain levels were blinded to the time of intravenous administration of phentolamine (total dose 25-35 mg). The pain relief achieved by LASB and PhB correlated closely (r = 0.84), and there was no significant difference in the maximum pain relief achieved with the two blocks (t = 0.19, P greater than 0.8). Nine patients experienced a greater than 50% relief of pain and hyperalgesia from both LASB and PhB and were considered to have a clinically significant component of SMP. We conclude that alpha-adrenergic blockade with intravenous phentolamine is a sensitive alternative test to identify patients with SMP. 
2	Alternate-day prednisone treatment and treatment maintenance in Crohn's disease. We have reviewed our data from 55 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) treated with alternate-day prednisone (average dose: 25 mg every other morning) between 1966 and 1989 for a mean duration of 6.6 yr. Daily divided corticosteroid doses were given to all patients with active disease that had not been responsive to supportive measures and, in almost all cases, not responsive to sulfasalazine alone. After initial remission was achieved, patients were switched to alternate-day doses. Treatment evaluations utilized global assessment and the CD activity index of Harvey and Bradshaw (CDAI-HB) shown to correlate closely with the National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study (NCCDS) activity index (CDAI). CDAI-HB scores of 0-1 indicated no or minimal activity, whereas scores of 2-15 indicated progressive activity. With the CDAI-HB and global assessments, in agreement in all cases, 33 patients (60%) showed favorable responses with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 46.8 to 73.2. Comparing the results with a literature-based 20% spontaneous long-term remission rate, the data are significant at p less than 0.01. Serious complications were gratifyingly low, with no observed instances of osteonecrosis. It is concluded that alternate-day prednisone treatment and treatment maintenance, with or without concomitant sulfasalazine, after conventional induction of remission with daily steroid doses, is a reasonable treatment option for patients with CD not responsive to sulfasalazine alone. 
1	Paraneoplastic brachial plexopathy in a patient with Hodgkin's disease. We describe a case of inflammatory brachial plexopathy that occurred in the context of a mild, diffuse sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy associated with Hodgkin's disease. Clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic studies helped distinguish this disorder from other causes of brachial plexopathy in patients with cancer. Treatment with corticosteroids seemed beneficial in this patient. We suggest that this may be another type of paraneoplastic condition associated with Hodgkin's disease. 
4	Moderate hypothermia after cardiac arrest of 17 minutes in dogs. Effect on cerebral and cardiac outcome. Moderate hypothermia (30 degrees C) induced before circulatory arrest is known to improve neurologic outcome. We explored, for the first time in a reproducible dog outcome model, moderate hypothermia induced during reperfusion after cardiac arrest (resuscitation). In three groups of six dogs each (N = 18), normothermic ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest (no blood flow) of 17 minutes was reversed by cardiopulmonary bypass--normothermic in control group I (37.5 degrees C) and hypothermic to 3 hours in groups II (32 degrees C) and III (28 degrees C). Defibrillation was achieved in less than or equal to 5 minutes and partial bypass was continued to 4 hours, controlled ventilation to 20 hours, and intensive care to 96 hours. All 18 dogs survived. Electroencephalographic activity returned significantly earlier in groups II and III. Mean +/- SD best neurologic deficit between 48 and 96 hours was 44 +/- 8% in group I, 38 +/- 12% in group II, and 35 +/- 7% in group III (differences not significant). Best overall performance category 2 (good outcome) between 48 and 96 hours was achieved in none of the six dogs in group I and in four of the 12 dogs in the combined hypothermic groups II and III (difference not significant). Mean +/- SD brain total histologic damage score was 130 +/- 22 in group I, 93 +/- 28 in group II (p = 0.05), and 80 +/- 26 in group III (p = 0.03). Gross myocardial damage was greater in groups II and III than in group I--numerically higher overall and significantly higher in group III for the right ventricle alone (p = 0.02). Moderate hypothermia after prolonged cardiac arrest may or may not improve cerebral outcome slightly and can worsen myocardial damage. 
1	Local control of auricular, periauricular, and external canal cutaneous malignancies with Mohs surgery. Three hundred ninety-seven patients with 407 cutaneous malignancies of the auricle, periauricular region, and cartilaginous external ear canal were reviewed. Tumors were most commonly located in the preauricular and postauricular regions, followed by the helix, concha, antihelix, and ear canal. All lesions were excised with Mohs microscopic control of margins. For lesions requiring lateral temporal bone resection, an adaptation of fresh-tissue microscopic control was used to analyze deep and anterior margins suspected of harboring residual tumor. Two-year minimum follow-up of 229 patients with periauricular and auricular tumors (N = 231 tumors) and 14 patients with cartilaginous ear canal tumors (N = 14 tumors) revealed recurrence rates of 6.9% and 14.3%, respectively. Recurrences were most common in cases of large tumors (greater than 2.5 cm), basal cell carcinomas with morphea elements, and multiply recurrent lesions. We conclude that Mohs surgery is comparatively effective, though not uniformly curative, and can be adapted to supplement excision of large tumors in these regions. 
4	Scatter photocoagulation restores tissue hypoxia in experimental vasoproliferative microangiopathy in miniature pigs. Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion using argon laser photocoagulation in miniature pigs induced the development of ischemic retinal territories associated with preretinal neovascularization. Preretinal partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) measurements on the ischemic territories, using O2-sensitive microelectrodes, established that the ischemic retinal areas were hypoxic. Scatter photocoagulation of these ischemic hypoxic territories restores the local PO2 to the normal values within 2 weeks. Hence, the reported inhibitory effect of photocoagulation on the development of retinal neovascularization could be due to a reversal effect on tissue hypoxia. 
3	Tongue atrophy in mixed connective tissue disease. A case is reported of tongue atrophy in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and major myositic involvement. The case highlights oropharyngeal aspects of MCTD, including inability to wear dentures, dysarthria, and dysphagia. To our knowledge this is the first report of major tongue involvement in myositis as part of MCTD. 
5	Discontinuation of neuroleptic medication in older, outpatient schizophrenics. A placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Thirty-five schizophrenic outpatients over the age of 52 who had been stable on neuroleptic medication were all switched to haloperidol. Ten patients were unable to tolerate the haloperidol and two dropped out of the study. The remaining 23 patients were randomly and blindly assigned to haloperidol or placebo and then followed for 6 months. Five patients did not complete the study due to medical or administrative reasons. Among the patients who completed the study, five of 10 randomized to placebo relapsed compared with only one of eight randomized to haloperidol. However, three of 10 patients randomized to placebo have remained stable without medication for 2.5 years. 
4	Outcome probabilities and life history after surgical mitral commissurotomy: implications for balloon commissurotomy. From 1967 to 1988, 339 patients with mitral stenosis underwent surgical commissurotomy, 103 with a closed and 236 with an open technique. The 1 month and 1, 5, 10 and 20 year overall survival rate was 99.7%, 99%, 95%, 87% and 59%, respectively, and the technique (open versus closed) was not a risk factor. Technique was also not a risk factor for a second mitral commissurotomy, subsequent mitral valve replacement, thromboembolism or poor functional status. Risk factors were older age at commissurotomy, black race, higher pulmonary vascular resistance, mitral leaflet calcification, left ventricular enlargement and postcommissurotomy mitral incompetence. The closed technique was a risk factor for mitral incompetence immediately after commissurotomy, but important incompetence developed in only 2 of the 103 patients undergoing closed commissurotomy. Mitral valve replacement was not required within 10 years in 78% of patients and within 20 years in 47%. Despite some increased prevalence of postcommissurotomy mitral incompetence and particularly in view of the considerable long-term likelihood of mitral valve replacement, initial therapy for most patients with mitral stenosis should probably be surgical closed (or percutaneous balloon) mitral commissurotomy. The equations developed in the present study can be used to predict and compare outcome probability after percutaneous balloon commissurotomy with that after surgical commissurotomy and to compare these with outcome probability after mitral valve replacement. 
5	Molecular characterization of beta-thalassemia intermedia in patients of Italian descent and identification of three novel beta-thalassemia mutations. In this study, we have defined by dot-blot analysis with allelic specific oligonucleotide probes or direct sequencing on amplified DNA the beta-thalassemia mutations in a large group of patients (23) of Italian descent with thalassemia intermedia. These patients had one parent with either the silent beta-thalassemia carrier phenotype or borderline-normal hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) levels (2.5% to 3.5%). Nearly all were genetic compounds for a severe beta-thalassemia mutation and a beta-thalassemia mutation associated with high residual output of beta-globin chains (beta + intervening sequence [IVS]-I-nt6, beta -87, beta -101), indicating that inheritance of a mild beta-thalassemia allele, even in a single dose, is the most common molecular mechanism producing thalassemia intermedia in the Italian population. In three cases, in whom we failed to define by dot-blot analysis the mutations, we sequenced the beta + globin gene and found three novel beta-thalassemia mutations, which are certainly very rare because they have been hitherto detected solely in a single patient. These mutations consist of: (1) a T-A substitution at position 2 of IVS-I, in a patient compound heterozygote for this mutation and the -87 promoter mutation; (2) a G-C substitution at position 844 of IVS-II, in a patient heterozygous for this mutation who showed normal sequences at the in trans beta-globin gene (The reason for the presence of clinical manifestations in a beta-thalassemia heterozygote has not been defined.); and (3) a deletion of one nucleotide (-T) at codon 126, resulting in a frameshift and readthrough of the 5' untranslated region and most likely producing an elongated Hb molecule of 156 amino acid residues, in a patient heterozygous for this mutation with normal beta-globin gene sequences at the other locus. 
3	Postoperative complications in patients with disabling psychiatric illnesses or intellectual handicaps. A case-controlled, retrospective analysis. The purpose of this study was to quantitate the operative risk and costs encountered in the surgical treatment of institutionalized patients. Operative complications and duration of hospitalization for 200 institutionalized patients were compared with those in a control group of patients matched for age, sex, and type of operation drawn from the general hospital population. Postoperative complications occurred in 53 (26.5%) of the patients in the study group compared with 15 (7.5%) of the patients in the control group. Elective laparotomy was followed by a complication in 48% of institutionalized patients compared with 11.6% of matched controls. Emergency celiotomy carried a 75% complication rate in the study group. Atelectasis and pneumonia accounted for 50% of the postoperative complications and occurred with greatest frequency following intra-abdominal procedures. The median hospital stay for all institutionalized patients was 3 days more than for matched controls. A strategy for postoperative treatment is presented, with particular emphasis on prevention of pulmonary complications. 
4	Persistent uptake of indium-111-antimyosin monoclonal antibody in patients with myocardial infarction. Indium-111(111In)-antimyosin scintigraphy was investigated in 27 patients with myocardial infarction. 111In-antimyosin Fab was administered intravenously, and planar and single photon emission computed tomographic images were obtained 48 hours later. Uptake of 111In-antimyosin was present in 9 of 10 patients (90%) studied within 6 days of infarction. During the second week positive scans were seen in 16 of 16 patients (100%) including 13 (81%) who had normal creatine kinase levels. The mechanism of persistent positive antimyosin images in the subacute stage of myocardial infarction remains to be clarified. 111In-antimyosin scintigraphy may be useful as a noninvasive method for the detection of myocardial injury late and early after a suspected acute myocardial infarction. 
4	Transvascular intracardiac applications of a miniaturized phased-array ultrasonic endoscope. Initial experience with intracardiac imaging in piglets. BACKGROUND. Recent advances in miniaturization of phased-array and mechanical ultrasound devices have resulted in exploration of alternative approaches to cardiac and vascular imaging in the form of transesophageal or intravascular imaging. Preliminary efforts in adapting phased-array endoscopes designed for transesophageal use to a transvascular approach have used full-sized phased-array devices introduced directly into the right atrium in open-chested animals. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a custom-made, very small phased-array endoscope for intracardiac imaging introduced intravascularly through a jugular venous approach in young piglets. METHODS AND RESULTS. Experimental atrial septal defects created in four piglets (3-4 weeks old) had been closed with a buttoned atrial septal defect closure device consisting of an occluder in the left atrium and a counteroccluder in the right atrium. Five to 15 days after atrial septal defect closure, the piglets were returned to the experimental laboratory, where a 6.3-mm, 17-element, 5-MHz phased-array probe mounted on a 4-mm endoscope was introduced through a cutdown incision of the external jugular vein and advanced to the right atrium. From the right atrium all four cardiac chambers, their inflows and outflows, and all four valves were well imaged with minimal superior and inferior rotation. High-resolution imaging of the atrial septum defined with anatomical accuracy, later verified by autopsy, the exact placement of both the occluder and counteroccluder in the left and right sides of the atrial septal defects and the absence of any shunting across the atrial septum in any of the four animals. CONCLUSIONS. Our efforts indicate that transvascular passage of small phased-array probes can be easily accomplished and is a promising technique for detailed visualization of cardiac structures. This approach may provide an alternative to transesophageal echocardiography, particularly for guiding interventional procedures such as placement of transcatheter closure devices in pediatric patients. 
2	Emergency surgical treatment for nonvariceal bleeding of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic and biochemical data were collected prospectively from 1,530 patients admitted with nonvariceal bleeding of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract between September 1985 and June 1989. Therapeutic endoscopy was done for 93 patients who underwent emergency surgical treatment for bleeding, subsequently required in 29 patients with seven postoperative fatalities. In contrast, 31 (15.7 per cent) of 198 patients (mortality rate of 9.6 per cent at 30 days) died in the hospital who had undergone emergency operation in whom therapeutic endoscopy had not been performed; data for this latter group is now presented. At admission, a greater likelihood of emergency operation was associated with a systolic blood pressure of 100 millimeters of mercury and endoscopic stigmatas of recent hemorrhage (ESRH) (p less than 0.001). Rebleeding rates for the presence of fresh blood, active spurting and oozing hemorrhage or visible vessel in an ulcer base were 26.5, 28.9 and 35.9 per cent, respectively. Endoscopic stigmatas were thus associated with an increased risk of bleeding (p less than 0.0001) and rebleeding led to a sixfold increase in the mortality rate. Congestive cardiac failure, chronic obstructive airway disease, chronic renal failure and a history of previous malignant disease were each associated with postoperative mortality rates of more than 50 per cent. An increased risk of mortality after emergency operation was related to age (p less than 0.0001), preoperative (p less than 0.002) and total (p less than 0.0001) blood transfusion requirement. Immediate operation after resuscitation and endoscopy was required in 87 patients; 11 deaths (hospital mortality rate of 12.7 per cent and 9.2 per cent at 30 days) occurred in this group compared with 20 fatalities (18.0 per cent) documented in 111 patients (9.9 per cent at 30 days) who underwent surgical treatment for rebleeding. We conclude that age, concomitant medical illness and preoperative and total transfusion requirements are each related to outcome after emergency operations. Such urgent intervention is best avoided if at all possible in patients with severe concomitant medical illness. 
5	Premenstrual syndromes defined by symptom-sets. An analysis is made of the pattern of presenting premenstrual symptoms in randomly selected general practice patients from the Wellington region, New Zealand. Participants, 1826 healthy women 16-54 years old whose characteristics were reasonably representative of the adult female population, were asked about their general, obstetrical and gynaecological health. For the 1456 women who had menstruated within the last month or so, detailed questions were asked about the last menstrual cycle. Each woman was assigned to one of seven premenstrual symptom sets. Three groups had 'pure' symptoms, ie a predominant single symptom (breast tenderness, bloating or irritability). Three groups had 'mixed' symptom-sets. The largest of the 'mixed' groups was formed by the women who reported breast tenderness, bloating and irritability together with tension and depression. Women in this group were most likely to rate their symptomatology as severe. The last group contains a large number of women with miscellaneous symptoms. Characteristics of these groups are outlined. The study highlights the importance of distinguishing among premenstrual syndromes as this can foster more effective clinical management. 
4	Short- and long-term results of catheter balloon percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy. Percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) was performed in 219 patients with symptomatic, severe rheumatic mitral stenosis. There were 59 men and 160 women, aged 19 to 76 years (mean 43). Pliable, noncalcified valves were present in 139 (group 1), and calcified valves or severe mitral subvalvular lesions, or both, in 80 patients (group 2). Atrial fibrillation was present in 133 patients (61%) and 1+ or 2+ mitral regurgitation in 59 (27%). Technical failure occurred with 3 patients in our early experience. There was no cardiac tamponade or emergency surgery. The only in-hospital death occurred 3 days after the procedure in a group 2 premoribund patient in whom last-resort PTMC created 3+ mitral regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation appeared or increased in 72 patients (33%); 3+ mitral regurgitation resulted in 12 patients (6%). There were 3 systemic embolisms. Atrial left-to-right shunts measured by oximetry developed in 33 patients (15%). Immediately after PTMC, there were significantly reduced (p = 0.0001) left atrial pressure (24.2 +/- 5.6 to 15.1 +/- 5.1 mm Hg), mean pulmonary artery pressure (39.7 +/- 13.0 to 30.6 +/- 10.9 mm Hg) and mitral valve gradient (13.0 +/- 5.1 to 5.7 +/- 2.6 mm Hg). Mitral valve area increased from 1.0 +/- 0.3 to 2.0 +/- 0.7 cm2 (p = 0.0001) and cardiac output from 4.4 +/- 1.4 to 4.7 +/- 1.2 liters/min (p less than 0.01). The results mirrored clinical improvements in 209 patients (97%). Multivariate analysis showed an echo score greater than 8, and valvular calcification and severe subvalvular lesions as independent predictors for suboptimal hemodynamic results. 
2	Tuberculous peritonitis: a study comparing cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. Tuberculous peritonitis is a rare disease, which often goes unrecognized because of the subtle clinical clues and its insidous onset. We retrospectively analyzed the records of 37 cases of tuberculous peritonitis diagnosed over a 15-year period, and compared the clinical and diagnostic features of cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. In cirrhotic patients, tuberculous peritonitis can simulate ascites from liver disease or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The diagnosis is difficult in these patients because the ascitic fluid may not be of the exudative type as a result of the low albumin level in serum, and lymphocytes do not predominate in all cases. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity in ascitic fluid was elevated (higher than 40 U/L) in all 11 patients (four patients with hepatic cirrhosis). The time required to achieve a correct diagnosis was significantly longer in cirrhotic than in noncirrhotic patients. The overall mortality was 13%, with deaths occurring exclusively among cirrhotic patients. We emphasize that tuberculous peritonitis in cirrhotic patients can present an atypical picture. A considerable element of suspicion is necessary. 
2	Refeeding of infants with acute diarrheal disease. The purpose of this study was to determine which infant formula among five would be the most efficacious for the refeeding of infants during an acute episode of diarrhea. Fifty male infants less than 12 months of age with severe diarrhea and at least 5% dehydration were admitted to a metabolic unit and studied in a prospective, single-blind protocol. Ten infants randomly received one of five types of formula: two-thirds diluted cow milk, cow milk formula (Nanon, Nestle, Inc., Sao Paulo, Brazil), Portagen, Pregestimil, or Prosobee (Mead Johnson & Co. Division, Evansville, Ind.). They continued to receive the same formula for 72 hours unless dehydration occurred. There were no associated infections, and they received no prior antibiotic treatment. Oral hydration together with intravenous fluid therapy was given to all patients during the initial treatment. During the first 72 hours of refeeding, patients fed Portagen excreted the least amount of stool and required reduced quantities of intravenous fluids or oral hydration. In contrast, patients fed diluted cow milk or any other formula had more severe diarrhea. Nine of the 10 patients fed Portagen completed the 72-hour treatment, whereas only 2 of 10 fed diluted cow milk tolerated it. Similarly, the cumulative proportions for high purging rate, dehydration, carbohydrate intolerance, and vomiting were more favorable for Portagen and least acceptable for diluted cow milk. No differences were found among the remaining three formulas tested. These data show that diluted cow milk is poorly tolerated by infants with severe diarrhea, whereas Portagen is more effective. 
4	Early diagnosis and survival of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. The hospital records of patients treated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in a recent 5-year period were reviewed to collect data on factors which may be associated with mortality. Overall mortality was 62%. Patients with intraperitoneal rupture had a higher mortality (97%) than patients with retroperitoneal rupture (25%). Patients at increased risk were older than 80 years, presented with syncope, experienced a short duration of symptoms prior to emergency department (ED) arrival, had initial systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, and/or initial hemoglobin level less than eight on arrival at the ED and delay in beginning surgery. Multivariate analysis demonstrated preoperative blood pressure, preoperative hemoglobin, presence of syncope, and the amount of blood transfused were largely reflections of the type of rupture and had only slight independent relationship to mortality. The authors concluded that treating emergency physicians and surgeons have little control over the most important risk factors for mortality after aneurysm rupture, but may improve the prognosis by expediting diagnosis in the ED and surgical therapy. 
2	Chilaiditi's syndrome. A diagnostic challenge. Chilaiditi's syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal and chest pain. Although interposition of the right colon is a relatively common radiologic finding, there is a distinct paucity of information in the medical literature. Chilaiditi's syndrome is usually asymptomatic, but when symptoms occur, conservative treatment is usually effective. Recognition is important because this syndrome can be mistaken for more serious abnormalities, which may lead to unnecessary surgical intervention. 
4	Long term follow-up of descending thoracic aorto-iliac/femoral bypass. A prospective study of 26 patients undergoing descending thoracic aorto-iliac/femoral (DTAI/F) bypass was conducted over a 13-year period with an average follow up of 53 months. Reasons for selecting the procedure were occluded aortic bifurcation grafts (9 patients), hostile abdomen (6), infected aortic graft (1), microaorta (10, and surgeons preference in 8 patients who had juxtarenal aortic occlusion. The operative mortality was 3.8% (1 patient). A late mortality of 36% was due to myocardial infarction (1), lung carcinoma (2), renal failure (4), stroke (1) and pulmonary insufficiency (1). Graft failure occurred in 4 patients at 23, 26, 54 and 109 months respectively. Primary cumulative patency was 86% statistically valid at 42 months. DTAI/F bypass is recommended in selected patients when conventional approaches to the aorta are considered unduly hazardous. 
4	Left ventricular mid-cavitary obstruction after balloon dilation in isolated aortic valve stenosis in children. A hyperdynamic left ventricle can lead to post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction in the absence of any preballoon mid-cavitary obstruction in children with aortic valve stenosis. The purpose of this study was to define the incidence and course of post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction. We reviewed the catheterization and echocardiographic data of 35 patients, ages 3 days to 18 years (mean = 7.9 years), with isolated aortic valve stenosis who underwent balloon dilation with a fall in aortic valve gradient to less than 20 mm Hg. Post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction was suspected from post-dilation left ventricular angiogram and was quantitated by echocardiographic and Doppler examinations performed immediately after dilation and in a 1-3 month follow-up period. Continuous wave Doppler directed by color flow Doppler was used for evaluation and differentiation of post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction and residual aortic valve stenosis. Three children (3/35 [9%]) all under 2 years of age developed post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction immediately after dilation. The obstruction within the cavity resolved spontaneously in all three patients. Conclusions: 1) Post-dilation left ventricular mid-cavitary obstruction can occur in children under 2 years of age after balloon dilation of severe aortic valve stenosis, and 2) total regression of post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction occurs spontaneously in all patients. 
1	Pituitary hemorrhage into a Rathke's cleft cyst This report describes a case of symptomatic pituitary hemorrhage into a Rathke's cleft cyst in a 25-year-old woman. The literature on pituitary hemorrhage in nonadenomatous sellar tumors is reviewed. 
1	Spontaneous necrosis in osteosarcoma. The percentage of necrosis in a primary osteosarcoma after the patient has received preoperative chemotherapy is prognostic and is usually used to select subsequent chemotherapy. However, the percentage of necrosis that occurs spontaneously, without preoperative chemotherapy, has not been adequately studied. The examination of histologic macrosections of 76 osteosarcomas from patients who had not received preoperative treatment and of 20 patients who had received preoperative chemotherapy revealed a significant difference in the percentage of necrosis. There was minimal spontaneous necrosis, but necrosis after preoperative chemotherapy was usually extensive. The larger the tumor, the greater the percentage of spontaneous necrosis; however, size did not correlate with the percentage of necrosis with preoperative chemotherapy. Survival among those patients who did not receive preoperative treatment correlated with the size and percentage of necrosis. Necrosis in an osteosarcoma in a patient who has received preoperative chemotherapy can be considered the result of chemotherapy and not a spontaneous event. 
1	Chemotherapy for medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the posterior fossa. Chemotherapy has only marginal efficacy in adult malignant brain tumors. In contrast, drug therapy is considerably more effective in medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (MB/PNET) of the posterior fossa, the most common childhood primary central nervous system tumor. At the time of disease recurrence, a variety of different single agents and drug combinations result in tumor shrinkage and increased survival. The addition of chemotherapy to standard radiotherapy improves the rate and length of disease-free survival for those children with MB/PNET who have the most extensive tumors at diagnosis. It remains to be determined which drug or drug combinations are the most effective in MB/PNET, and which patients are most likely to benefit from chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may be useful to reduce or, in selected cases, obviate the need for radiotherapy and reduce treatment-related sequelae. 
3	Carbamazepine dose requirements during stiripentol therapy: influence of cytochrome P-450 inhibition by stiripentol. The inhibitory effect of stiripentol (STP) on disposition of carbamazepine (CBZ) and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZE) was quantitated to establish CBZ dosage reduction guidelines for future clinical add-on efficacy trials of STP. In seven epileptic patients, STP (1,500-3,000 mg/day for 2 weeks) inhibited CBZ clearance by 50 +/- 16% (p = 0.001) and reduced the CBZE/CBZ plasma ratio by 45 +/- 14% (p = 0.0005). The inhibitory effect was gradually manifested over a period of 7-10 days after initiation of STP therapy. In contrast to inhibition of CBZE formation, STP had no effect (p greater than 0.05) on elimination clearance or half-life (t1/2) of CBZE in six healthy volunteers. STP most likely exerts inhibitory effects through inhibition of cytochrome P-450. This hypothesis was confirmed in the present study by the finding that a therapeutic concentration of STP (7 micrograms/mL) inhibited 10,11-epoxidation of CBZ in human liver microsomes by 40-50%. On the basis of results from this study, we propose that (a) CBZ dosage should be reduced in steps over a period of 7-10 days after initiation of STP, and (b) a CBZ dosage of 4.3 to 8.7 mg/kg/day will maintain therapeutic CBZ plasma levels of 5-10 micrograms/mL. 
3	Systemic alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine: a diagnostic test for sympathetically maintained pain. The diagnosis of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP) is typically established by assessment of pain relief during local anesthetic blockade of the sympathetic ganglia that innervate the painful body part. To determine if systemic alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine can be used to diagnose SMP, we compared the effects on pain of local anesthetic sympathetic ganglion blocks (LASB) and phentolamine blocks (PhB) in 20 patients with chronic pain and hyperalgesia that were suspected to be sympathetically maintained. The blocks were done in random order on separate days. Patients rated the intensity of ongoing and stimulus-evoked pain every 5 min before, during, and after the LASB and PhB. Patients and the investigator assessing pain levels were blinded to the time of intravenous administration of phentolamine (total dose 25-35 mg). The pain relief achieved by LASB and PhB correlated closely (r = 0.84), and there was no significant difference in the maximum pain relief achieved with the two blocks (t = 0.19, P greater than 0.8). Nine patients experienced a greater than 50% relief of pain and hyperalgesia from both LASB and PhB and were considered to have a clinically significant component of SMP. We conclude that alpha-adrenergic blockade with intravenous phentolamine is a sensitive alternative test to identify patients with SMP. 
5	Postoperative complications in patients with disabling psychiatric illnesses or intellectual handicaps. A case-controlled, retrospective analysis. The purpose of this study was to quantitate the operative risk and costs encountered in the surgical treatment of institutionalized patients. Operative complications and duration of hospitalization for 200 institutionalized patients were compared with those in a control group of patients matched for age, sex, and type of operation drawn from the general hospital population. Postoperative complications occurred in 53 (26.5%) of the patients in the study group compared with 15 (7.5%) of the patients in the control group. Elective laparotomy was followed by a complication in 48% of institutionalized patients compared with 11.6% of matched controls. Emergency celiotomy carried a 75% complication rate in the study group. Atelectasis and pneumonia accounted for 50% of the postoperative complications and occurred with greatest frequency following intra-abdominal procedures. The median hospital stay for all institutionalized patients was 3 days more than for matched controls. A strategy for postoperative treatment is presented, with particular emphasis on prevention of pulmonary complications. 
1	Nuclear medicine in otolaryngology. Nuclear medicine has a distinct role to play in otolaryngological practice. Accurate diagnosis of endocrine conditions is now possible using precise in-vitro hormone measurement. Specific clinical questions can be answered using in-vivo investigations. 99mTcO-4/123I scintigraphy is used to evaluate thyrotoxicosis and solitary thyroid nodules. 99mTc/201T1 subtraction scanning is of value in the preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas and 99mTcO-4 is particularly useful in assessing salivary and lachrymal gland function and drainage. 99mTc-MDP bone scanning is useful in the evaluation of osteomyelitis, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, bone graft viability and some facial fractures. The role of radioisotopes in the management of differentiated and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is now well established. Although there are many other agents available to image head and neck cancer, few can actually achieve the required diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The introduction of monoclonal antibodies into routine imaging has been hampered by distinct practical problems and the search is now on for more sensitive non-specific diagnostic agents. It is now possible to evaluate new 99mTc labelled tumour-imaging agents using animal tumour model systems and the use of radioactivity in all aspects of otolaryngological research adds an extra quantitive dimension. Together with SPECT, and the introduction of positron emission tomography (PET) to image the physiology of normal tissues and tumours, the use of radionuclide investigations can lead only to an increase in ENT diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and, subsequently, to an overall improvement in the way we diagnose, stage and treat head and neck cancer. 
5	Acute naming deficits following dominant temporal lobectomy: prediction by age at 1st risk for seizures. Age at 1st risk for seizures may predict anomia following dominant anterior temporal lobectomy. We assessed confrontation naming before and 2 to 3 weeks after surgery in 45 right-handed patients grouped by side of focus and presence or absence of early (less than or equal to 5 years) risk factors. After left lobectomy, 6 of 10 (60%) patients with no early risks demonstrated significant decline (greater than or equal to 25%) in naming, but none of the patients with early risks showed this decline. After right lobectomy, there was no change. Cerebral representation of naming may be atypical in patients with early risks. 
3	Anorectal function in incontinent patients with cerebrospinal disease. Anorectal manometry and the electrical activity of the external anal sphincter were measured in 20 patients with well-defined, incomplete spinal lesions who were referred because of fecal incontinence and in 30 normal subjects. Six patients had a high spinal lesion, 11 had a low spinal lesion, and 3 had mixed high and low spinal lesions. Patients with high spinal lesions had normal basal pressures but abnormally low squeeze pressures and impaired rectal sensation. Unlike normal subjects, there was no relationship between the depth of sphincter relaxation and the distention volumes. The external sphincter responses to rectal distention and increases in intraabdominal pressure were enhanced, and leakage of perfusion fluid was uncommon. Patients with low spinal lesions had abnormally low basal and squeeze pressures, blunted rectal sensation, and showed impaired external anal sphincter responses to rectal distention or increases in intraabdominal pressures. Most of these patients leaked the infused fluid during these maneuvers. Sphincter function in patients with mixed lesions was more severely impaired than in patients with low and high spinal lesions. Patients with mixed lesions showed abnormally low basal and squeeze pressures, impaired rectal sensation, and no external anal sphincter responses to either rectal distention or increases in intraabdominal pressure. Leakage occurred during these maneuvers in all patients with mixed lesions. 
1	Photochemotherapy alone or combined with interferon alpha-2a in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Eighty-two patients with either mycosis fungoides (MF) or parapsoriasis en plaques were treated with psoralens ultraviolet A light (PUVA). Clinical and histologic parameters were followed for a period from 6 months to 10 years. Complete clinical clearing of lesions was observed in 51 patients (62%) and most of them were in limited-plaque MF group or parapsoriasis en plaque. The mean total dose of PUVA for complete clearing was less for early MF. Thirty-one patients (38%) relapsed and responded to additional PUVA. Patients in early stages of the disease remained clear for up to 68 months after the first course of PUVA. Post-treatment skin biopsies with early MF showed histologic clearing. A new combination therapy for MF is presented in 15 patients. Recombinant interferon alpha-2a (Roferon-A), administered intramuscularly combined with PUVA were tested in a phase I trial. Interferon doses were from 6-30 million units three times weekly. Disease stages ranged from I-B to IV-B. Complete responses were obtained in 12 of 15 patients, and partial responses seen in 2 of 15 patients, for an overall response rate of 93%. The median duration of response exceeded 23 months (range, 3 to 25 months). All responding patients have been maintained on therapy. The dose-limiting toxicities were constitutional symptoms such as fevers and malaise (93.3%), leukopenias (40.0%), mental status changes consisting of depression and confusion (33.3%), and photosensitivity (26.6%). Interferon plus PUVA appear to be highly effective regimens for the treatment of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. 
5	Haematuria frequency syndrome in patients with positive HIV serology: observations in Zambia. Observations are presented on 9 patients recently treated in the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia, for painful urinary frequency, suprapubic pain and microscopic and/or macroscopic haematuria without any demonstrable urinary tract infection. At cystoscopy the bladder mucosa of all patients depicted a highly characteristic, uniformly congested appearance with no demonstrable ulcers; there was no significant reduction in bladder capacity. The histological appearance was essentially non-specific in type with an apparent resemblance to that of interstitial cystitis; mast cells were, however, absent in all specimens. An important feature common to all patients was an associated HIV infection; cytochemistry of the bladder tissue did not reveal an associated cytomegalovirus cystitis. No such case was observed in Zambia prior to the advent of HIV infection and the phenomenon was observed only in seropositive patients. It has been suggested that the virus is likely to be associated with the genesis of the bladder symptoms. The natural history of the disorder, its incidence among the seropositive individuals and its pathogenesis remain unclear. 
1	The ras oncogenes in human lung cancer. The three well-characterized genes of the ras gene family H-ras, K-ras, and N-ras, code for closely related 21-kD proteins that have a role in the transduction of growth signals. The ras proteins acquire transforming potential when a point mutation in the gene leads to replacement of an amino acid in one of the critical positions 12, 13, or 61. Overexpression of the normal protein, usually associated with gene amplification, can have similar effects. The detection of mutationally activated ras genes has been facilitated by the development of oligonucleotide hybridization assays that allow the identification of each possible mutation at the critical sites. Employment of the polymerase chain reaction has greatly increased the sensitivity of these assays. Studies of human lung cancer have shown that adenocarcinoma is the only subtype associated with ras mutations. These occur in about 30% of primary tumors. In almost all cases, the mutation is present in codon 12 of the K-ras gene. No mutations have been observed to date in tumors of nonsmokers, suggesting that the mutation may result from exposure to carcinogenic ingredients of tobacco smoke. Amplifications of ras genes were shown to be very uncommon in clinically early stages of lung cancer. Analysis of the clinical data of patients who were operated on for adenocarcinoma of the lung shows that K-ras mutations are not associated with particular histologic characteristics of the tumors or with specific presenting features. Patients with K-ras mutations, however, had significantly worse survival than did those without an activation. 
3	Characteristics of an elderly driving population referred to a geriatric assessment center. A retrospective, case-control study was performed to determine the characteristics of elderly drivers referred to an outpatient geriatric assessment center. It was hypothesized that the driving population was operating at a higher cognitive and functional level than nondrivers. One hundred eighty-two subjects meeting the entry criteria were studied. Twenty-three percent of the subjects were driving at the time of their assessment. Compared to nondrivers, drivers were younger (P = .0001), were more likely to be male (P = .003), scored higher on a mental status examination (P = .0001), and were more independent in Physical and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (P less than .0001). Despite these findings, the mean Folstein Mini-Mental score for drivers (23.7) was below normal; 40% of drivers were diagnosed as having Alzheimer's dementia at the time of their evaluation, and over 26% of the drivers needed help with either dressing or bathing. The frequency of impaired elderly drivers in this referral setting was high. The authors conclude that conditions that affect the driving task are common in geriatric assessment centers. Prospective studies of elderly drivers are needed to answer the difficult question of who among the elderly should drive. 
5	Hiccups and breathing in human fetuses. Serial recording in 45 low risk fetuses throughout the second and third trimesters showed that hiccups were the predominant diaphragmatic movement before 26 weeks' gestational age and that there was a significant negative correlation with gestational age. There was a pronounced reduction between 24 and 26 weeks, which was the result of a decrease in the number of episodes of hiccups rather than a change in the duration of episodes. In contrast, fetal breathing was positively correlated with gestational age, the greatest increase in breathing occurring between 26 and 32 weeks' gestation. This was the result of both an increase in the number and duration of episodes. From the time that rest-activity cycles of behaviour could be determined in recordings, both breathing and hiccups were dependent on behavioural state or cycle, occurring predominantly during active episodes. This association between quiet and active behaviour and breathing did not alter with increasing gestational age, and the variables in fetal behavioural state became increasingly closely linked. The importance of prolonged and repeated recording, and also the need to take account of other variables in fetal behaviour, before any sinister conclusions can be drawn about the absence of fetal breathing is emphasised. 
5	Locked intramedullary nailing of femoral shaft fractures. One hundred twenty-three femoral shaft fractures were treated with Grosse-Kempf slotted, locked nails and followed for a median 20 (range, 12-60) months. There were eight intraoperative and 11 postoperative complications, among them two superficial and two deep infections. Most of the intraoperative complications and some postoperatively lost reductions could have been prevented by a better operative technique and judgment of stability. Seventy-eight results were graded as excellent, 24 as good, 19 as fair, and two as poor (one 9-cm shortening and one 40 degrees external malrotation). All fractures united without further procedures during the first year. 
1	A case of massive true thymic hyperplasia with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A case of massive true thymic hyperplasia with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the mediastinum is reported in a 14-year-old boy. Computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a mass of the anterior mediastinum and conspicuous swelling of the lymph nodes in the upper and lower mediastinum. They were grossly resected. The tumor of the anterior mediastinum was histologically diagnosed as true thymic hyperplasia. All of the mediastinal lymph nodes were diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse, mixed small and large cell type. 
1	Effect of dietary alpha-linolenic acid on growth, metastasis, fatty acid profile and prostaglandin production of two murine mammary adenocarcinomas. The purpose of this study was to determine whether dietary (n-3) fatty acids would affect mammary tumor growth and metastasis. Weanling female BALB/c mice were fed diets that contained 10% corn oil (CO), linseed oil (LO) or a fish oil-corn oil mix (FO) for 3-8 wk prior to receiving subcutaneous injections of one of two syngeneic mammary tumor cell types (410 and 410.4). Tumor growth was assessed by monitoring mean tumor diameter and tumor weight upon removal. Feeding LO, but not FO, reduced the growth (p less than 0.05) of 410.4 mammary tumors compared with growth in those fed CO. Metastasis data paralleled the tumor growth rate. Feeding LO and FO enhanced (p less than 0.005) incorporation of (n-3) fatty acids into tumors. Tumor prostaglandin E (PGE) production was reduced (p less than 0.005) by LO and FO, compared with CO. FO feeding reduced 410.4 tumor PGE synthesis more (p less than 0.05) than LO feeding, yet tumor growth was only inhibited by LO. These data suggest an inhibitory effect of dietary linolenic acid [i.e., 18:3 (n-3)] on mammary tumor growth and metastasis. However, this effect did not directly correlate with diet-induced changes in PGE synthesis. 
5	A paradigm for restenosis based on cell biology: clues for the development of new preventive therapies. Angioplasty causes substantial injury to the coronary artery intima and media that is unrecognizable by angiography. On the basis of a substantial body of research in oncology and wound healing, it is hypothesized that restenosis is a manifestation of the general wound healing response expressed specifically in vascular tissue. The temporal response to injury occurs in three characteristic phases: inflammation, granulation and extracellular matrix remodeling. The specific expression of these phases in the coronary artery leads to intimal hyperplasia at 1 to 4 months. The major milestones in the temporal sequence of restenosis are platelet aggregation, inflammatory cell infiltration, release of growth factors, medial smooth muscle cell modulation and proliferation, proteoglycan deposition and extracellular matrix remodeling. Each step has potential inhibitors that could be used for preventive therapy. Resolution of restenosis, however, probably requires both creation of the largest possible residual lumen and substantial inhibition of intimal hyperplasia. 
1	Oral cancer: a survey of 566 cases from the University of Connecticut Oral Pathology Biopsy Service, 1975-1986. A survey of the University of Connecticut Oral Pathology Biopsy Service was undertaken to analyze cases of oral cancer accessioned during the 12-year period, 1975 through 1986 inclusive. Of 33,429 total specimens accessioned, there were 546 malignant oral neoplasms diagnosed and reported. Sixty-five (11.5%) originated from out of state. Invasive intraoral squamous cell carcinoma was the predominant tumor (69.7% of total), whereas lip cancer constituted only 2.8% of all malignancies. Minor salivary gland adenocarcinomas accounted for 11% of total malignancies whereas verrucous carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, and miscellaneous other forms of oral cancer accounted for the remainder (4.6%, 5.3%, and 6.6%, respectively). Cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma were further analyzed by year, sex distribution, location subsite, age at diagnosis, and histologic grade. With the exception of histologic grading, we found that the characterization of cases of squamous cell carcinoma within the biopsy service tended to parallel results from a separate but related statewide analysis of both oral cancer and intraoral squamous cell carcinoma from Connecticut over a much longer time span. We concluded that the picture of oral cancer as characterized by cases within the University of Connecticut Oral Pathology Biopsy Service is generally reflective of the disease on a statewide level. 
5	Coronary flow and mental stress. Experimental findings. The hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, and coronary flow responses to a psychological test were studied in 13 pigs both in the absence (group 1, n = 8) and the presence (group 2, n = 5) of a transient occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The psychological test consisted of presenting food to a fasting but restrained animal for 3 minutes. In group 1, stress increased the heart rate from 128 +/- 5 to 176 +/- 8 beats/min (mean +/- SEM) and arterial pressure from 93 +/- 4 to 112 mm Hg. Comparing the individual increase in rate-pressure product with the increase in coronary conductance during the test, a parallel response was found in only two animals, whereas a relatively lower coronary conductance was observed in the remainder, suggesting vasoconstriction. Clinical signs of ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmias were never observed in this group of animals. Each group 2 animal underwent two occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery, randomly performed on separate days both in the presence and the absence of the food deprivation stress. When the latter was applied in the presence of occlusion, all animals developed ventricular fibrillation in less than 2 minutes (mean, 81.4 seconds). Conversely, only one animal had ventricular fibrillation when a 3-minute occlusion was performed without exposure to stress. This occurred despite the fact that more severe ischemia (as detected by an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and decreases in dP/dt and systolic pressure) was recorded at 3 minutes of occlusion. 
2	Does auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation reverse hypersplenism and portal hypertension? In this study, performed to assess the effect of auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation on portal hypertension and hypersplenism, eight patients with chronic liver disease who underwent the procedure and had functioning grafts for at least 6 months were analyzed. The transplantation resulted in (a) normalization of platelet and leukocyte counts, (b) reduction of splenomegaly by 20% +/- 3% (P less than 0.02), (c) disappearance of ascites, and (d) diminution of esophageal varices in all patients. Intraoperatively, the mean portacaval pressure gradient decreased with 54% +/- 7% after recirculation of the graft (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, a functioning auxiliary heterotopic liver graft decompresses portal hypertension and reverses hypersplenism. 
3	Traumatic subarachnoid-pleural fistula in a child. A case report. A seven-year-old girl sustained a gunshot wound to the chest and spine. Evaluation of a persistent pleural effusion demonstrated a subarachnoid-pleural fistula. Surgical closure of the dural defect resulted in resolution of the fistula. Traumatic subarachnoid-pleural fistulae are rare. The diagnosis is reached by an awareness of fistula formation from penetrating or blunt trauma to the chest. 
3	Spatial dispersion of magnetic stimulation in peripheral nerves. To assess the longitudinal dispersion of the stimulus induced by the magnetic coil, collision experiments were performed in seven normal ulnar nerves. A supramaximal electrical stimulus S1 was delivered at the wrist, and followed by a supramaximal stimulus S2 in the upper arm, which was either electrical (electrical collision studies), or magnetic (magnetic collision studies). The interstimulus interval was varied by 0.2 msec increments from the time of complete cancellation of the S2 evoked motor response onwards, to include the entire span of recovery of that compound motor action potential. Collision curves were obtained for both magnetic and electrical stimuli by plotting the amplitude of the motor response elicited by S2 as a function of the interstimulus interval. In all seven normal ulnar nerves, comparison of the collision curves showed that the S2 evoked motor response is restored significantly more slowly when magnetic stimulation is used. This finding is best explained by longitudinal dispersion of the stimulus induced by the magnetic coil relative to conventional electrical stimulation, the large fibers being stimulated further away from the coil than the small ones. This interpretation is confirmed by the findings obtained with the same method in two cases of ulnar neuropathy, and by comparison of different intensities of magnetic stimulation. 
1	Growth of group A rotaviruses in a human liver cell line. Recent observations in children with rotavirus gastroenteritis and in infant mice given rotavirus vaccine by oral administration suggest that this well-known gastrointestinal pathogen may infect the liver. To examine this possibility, the susceptibility of Hep G2 cells to infection with a variety of rotavirus strains was tested. These cells were used because they are considered to be well differentiated and exhibit many liver-specific functions. The Hep G2 cells supported the growth of the simian strain rhesus rotavirus (MMU 18006), a strain currently being used in vaccine trails, but did not support the growth of any human strain (D, DS1, Price or ST3). The rhesus rotavirus infection was cytopathic and resulted in release of lactate dehydrogenase. Rhesus rotavirus growth in Hep G2 cells displayed trypsin-enhanced infectivity and was inhibited by pretreatment of cells with Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase but not with neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens. Hep G2 cells were also permissive for another simian strain (SA11), a bovine strain (UK) and single gene substitution reassortants containing VP7 (the major outer capsid neutralization protein) from a human rotavirus strain and the remaining 10 genes from either rhesus rotavirus or UK. In general, UK and its reassortants produced lower levels of antigen than did rhesus rotavirus and its reassortants. Hep G2 cells and other hepatic cell lines may prove to be useful tools to explore the hepatotropic potential of wild-type rotaviruses and candidate vaccine strains. 
4	Transesophageal echocardiography in acute aortic transection. Confirming the diagnosis of acute transection of the descending aorta can be problematic. Unnecessary patient movement and time delay are often associated with conventional investigations. We describe a patient in whom such an injury was clearly and quickly defined at the bedside by transesophageal echocardiography. 
2	Current concepts of cholesterol transport and crystal formation in human bile. The presence of vesicles in human bile probably accounts almost entirely for the frequently observed, but hitherto unexplained, phenomenon of metastable cholesterol supersaturation. This, in turn, largely explains the prolonged stability of cholesterol solubilized in supersaturated human bile. Under certain overall compositional conditions for a supersaturated native bile, the vesicular phase in its contribution to total cholesterol transport also becomes supersaturated in cholesterol. Because of this, the vesicles also become unstable, leading to formation of cholesterol crystals. A simple but common example of one factor affecting composition in this way is concentration of total solutes, especially the biliary lipids. Conversely, dilution of bile (e.g., hepatic bile) markedly reduces the cholesterol saturation level in biliary vesicles. The result is that such vesicles become much more stable. Under these conditions, cholesterol crystal formation becomes unlikely and rarely, if ever, occurs. 
5	Synergism of herpes simplex virus and tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines in cell transformation. Previous studies indicate that herpes simplex virus (HSV) enhances the carcinogenic activity of smokeless tobacco and tobacco-related chemical carcinogens in animals. Since tobacco-specific N'-nitrosamines (TSNAs) such as N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(N-methyl-N'-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) are major chemical carcinogens of smokeless tobacco and are known to be responsible for the development of oral cancers in smokeless tobacco users, the combined effects of TSNAs and HSV in cell transformation were investigated. Exposure of cells to NNN or NNK followed by virus infection resulted in a significant enhancement of transformation frequency when compared with that observed with chemical carcinogens or virus alone. This study suggests that TSNAs and HSV can interact together and show synergism in cell transformation. 
1	Intratumoral oxygen pressure in malignant brain tumor. Oxygen pressure (pO2) in brain tumors, pO2 in brain cortex surrounding the tumors, and PaO2 were measured simultaneously during total resection in 16 patients with previously untreated brain tumors in order to detect hypoxic regions within the tumors. When the inhaled O2:N2O ratio was 1:3 under enflurane anesthesia, mean PaO2 was 109.2 +/- 5.8 mm Hg, a rather high value when compared with that obtained when air is inhaled under atmospheric pressure. The simultaneously measured intratumoral pO2 and pO2 in brain cortex surrounding the tumor were 15.3 +/- 2.3 and 59.8 +/- 6.5 mm Hg, respectively. Each intratumoral pO2 value was significantly lower than that of pO2 in brain cortex surrounding the tumor (mean less than 30 mm Hg, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p less than 0.005) and influenced the oxygen effects on radiation. These results appear to confirm that there are hypoxic regions within human brain tumors. A comparison between intratumoral pO2 and either the angiographic or contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scans of the tumor vasculature disclosed no correlation. 
1	Idiopathic and glucocorticoid-induced spinal epidural lipomatosis. Pathological overgrowth of the epidural fat in the spine has been described and reported nearly exclusively in patients either with Cushing's syndrome or on chronic intake of glucocorticoids for a variety of clinical disorders. The authors report four patients with documented spinal lipomatosis (three pathologically and one radiologically). Only one of these patients received corticosteroids, and none had an underlying endocrinological abnormality. All four patients were adult males with a mean age at onset of symptoms of 43 years (range from 18 to 60 years). The symptoms ranged from simple neurogenic claudication and radicular pain to frank myelopathy. Myelography followed by computerized tomography were instrumental in the diagnosis of the first three patients; the fourth was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. The thoracic spine was involved in two cases and the lumbosacral area in the other two. The different treatment modalities were tailored according to the symptomatology of the patients. These included weight reduction of an overweight patient with minimal neurological findings in one case and decompressive laminectomy and fat debulking to achieve adequate cord decompression in the remaining three cases. Two patients improved significantly, the condition of one stabilized, and the fourth required a second decompression at other spinal levels. The various modalities of treatment and their potential complications are discussed. 
5	Langerhans cell histiocytosis in monozygotic twins. Langerhans cells histiocytosis, one of a group of histiocytosis syndromes characterized by Langerhans cell infiltration, has many clinical manifestations. In the past 30 years, numerous cases of presumed Letterer-Siwe disease, the acute multiorgan variant, have been reported in twins and siblings. Only recently has the Histiocyte Society established a criterion for a "definitive diagnosis" of Langerhans cell histiocytosis--the presence of Birbeck granules within the cells of the histiocytic infiltrate. We report the fatal outcome of Langerhans cell histiocytosis in monozygotic twin infants. There is no satisfactory explanation why Langerhans cell histiocytosis occurs concurrently in twins. We suggest that cytokines may provide an endogenous signal that triggers the pathologic proliferation of Langerhans cells. 
4	Increasing the yield of ventricular tachycardia induction: a prospective, randomized comparative study of the standard ventricular stimulation protocol to a short-to-long protocol and a new two-site protocol. Programmed ventricular stimulation with a standard protocol that used up to three extrastimuli was compared prospectively with a short-to-long protocol and a two-site protocol in 77 consecutive patients undergoing electrophysiologic study in an attempt to increase the yield of ventricular tachycardia (VT) induction. The short-to-long protocol uses a train of eight stimuli at a short cycle length and up to two extrastimuli. The two-site protocol is similar to the standard protocol but delivers the last extrastimulus via a second spatially separated right ventricular catheter. Patients were divided into two groups based on indications for study: group 1 included 45 patients with syncope, nonsustained VT, or both, and group 2 included 32 patients with a history of sustained VT, sudden cardiac death, or both. The yield of VT induction with the short-to-long protocol was less than that with the standard protocol. In none of the patients in group 1 in whom the standard protocol results were negative did the short-to-long protocol produce sustained VT. Only two patients, both in group 2, had sustained arrhythmias induced by the short-to-long protocol when the standard protocol results were negative: one had sustained VT induced and one with long QT syndrome had ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced with the short-to-long protocol. However, the short-to-long protocol failed to induce sustained VT in seven patients in whom the standard protocol produced sustained VT. All seven of these patients required three extrastimuli with the standard protocol for induction of VT. 
3	Effects of vagal stimulation on experimentally induced seizures in rats. Repetitive stimulation of the vagus nerve inhibits chemically induced seizures in dogs. We report here the results and conclusions from studies designed to answer some of the immediate questions raised by this finding. (1) Maximal stimulation of vagal C fibers at frequencies greater than 4 Hz prevents or reduces chemically and electrically induced seizures in young male rats. (2) Antiepileptic potency is directly related to the fraction of vagal C fibers stimulated. (3) Vagal stimulation shortens but does not shut down a chemical seizure once it has begun. (4) In rats, optimal stimulus frequency is approximately 10-20 Hz; duration of stimulus, 0.5-1 ms; and stimulus strength, 0.2-0.5 mA/mm2 of nerve cross-section. These results, when taken together with similar results obtained from dogs, monkeys, and humans, strongly suggest that periodic stimulation of the vagus nerve using appropriate stimulation parameters is a powerful method for preventing seizures. The data from the literature suggest that the antiepileptic actions of vagal stimulation are largely mediated by widespread release of GABA and glycine in the brainstem and cerebral cortex. The probable pathway is via projections from the nucleus of the solitary tract to the reticular formation and thence by diffuse projections to the cortex and other areas. Intermittent vagal stimulation has the potentiality of reducing the number and/or the intensity of seizures in patients with intractable epilepsy. These results indicate that feasibility studies in humans should be continued and expanded. 
3	Percutaneous thecoperitoneal shunt for syringomyelia. Report of three cases. Between January and April, 1990, three consecutive cases of syringomyelia were treated by percutaneous placement of thecoperitoneal shunts. Two of these patients had undergone craniovertebral decompression earlier at other centers and the third was treated primarily by a thecoperitoneal shunt. In each case, the syrinx was associated with Chiari I malformation, although the clinical presentation was due to a myelopathy. All three patients obtained unequivocal benefit from this simple procedure. Postoperative magnetic resonance images showed considerable shrinkage of the cysts corresponding with clinical improvement. 
5	Which cardiac disturbances should be treated with digoxin immune Fab (ovine) antibody? Digoxin excess can produce characteristic bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, and hyperkalemia. The bradyarrhythmias, which consist of disturbances in conduction and block at the level of the atrioventricular and sinus nodes, are mediated by a direct and vagotonic effect. The vagotonic effect of excess digoxin may also result in a marked slowing of the sinus rate in the setting of severe toxicity. Digoxin increases automatic and triggered electrical activity in atrial muscle, His-Purkinje system, and ventricular muscle, which predisposes to tachycardias. Many of the tachyarrhythmias are relatively specific for the toxic effects of digoxin. Atrial tachycardias with variable atrioventricular block, accelerated junctional rhythms (especially in the setting of atrial fibrillation), and fascicular tachycardias are characteristic digoxin toxic rhythms. Digoxin-specific antibody fragments should be considered the treatment of choice for any digoxin toxic arrhythmia associated with hemodynamic compromise or the threat of hemodynamic compromise. Hyperkalemia, when due to acute severe digoxin toxicity, is also an appropriate indication for digoxin-specific Fab fragment therapy. When assessing the risk:benefit ratio for using digoxin-specific Fab fragment therapy, one needs to determine, in addition to the electrocardiographic manifestations and patient's hemodynamic status (1) the severity of toxicity, as indexed by the amount ingested and/or the serum digoxin concentration; (2) the expected time course for reversal of toxicity, which is usually determined by the status of renal function; (3) the need for digoxin to provide ventricular rate control or improved ventricular contractility and therapeutic alternatives to digoxin; (4) the presence of a strong allergy history; (5) the presence of such factors as increased age and severity of heart disease that may predispose to digoxin toxicity. 
4	Morbidity, mortality, and quality of life for patients treated with levothyroxine In a population study of 1462 middle-aged women initiated in 1968 and 1969 we identified 29 women treated with levothyroxine from 1 to 28 years. In a 12-year follow-up in 1980 and 1981 we investigated the subjects for end-point myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, stroke, cancer, and death (the status of 99.7% of the initial participants was established). The women treated with levothyroxine showed no increase in morbidity or mortality. Of the 24 women still receiving levothyroxine in 1980 and 1981, 22 had serum thyrotropin and triiodothyronine concentrations with-in reference limits. These individuals were compared with the 968 women from the population study having no history of thyroid disease, and appeared identical as to laboratory and clinical data, with the exception of a slightly higher body mass, taller stature, and lower serum cholesterol concentration. The treated group did not differ in a life quality estimate based on 19 questions regarding life satisfaction and sensory function. We conclude that the levothyroxine-treated woman suffers no side effects from her life-long therapy. 
2	Peritoneal dialysis in the geriatric patient. Elderly patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) from two large chronic peritoneal dialysis programs were compared with younger patients in regard to peritonitis rates, catheter problems, hospital days, transfers to other forms of therapy, and mortality. Peritonitis rates and organisms were similar in younger and older patients. Catheter replacements were less common in the elderly. Differences in hospital days were attributable to hospitalization for vascular disease. The elderly were more likely to have the first episode of peritonitis, to die and to change dialysis modalities at all times after the first year of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) treatment, although other than increased mortality, differences between the two groups were small. CPD appears to be an acceptable form of renal replacement therapy in the elderly. 
1	Peptic ulcer perforation as the presentation of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. We examined the characteristics of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome who developed a perforation prior to diagnosis to determine whether any clinical features were useful markers of the syndrome. Of 160 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, perforation occurred prior to the diagnosis being made in 11 (7%). At surgery, perforations were found in the duodenum in six cases and in the jejunum in five. In no case was tumor identified at emergency surgery, and the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome was made only in the postoperative period when excessive gastric secretions were noted. Neither acid output nor serum gastrin concentration were useful predictors for perforation. The patients, six men and five women, were 27-61 years old (median 48) and one had MEN-1. Three patients had no symptoms prior to the perforation. The other eight had symptoms for 1-15 years, with diarrhea occurring in 45% of the cases. Following the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, patients were given medication to control gastric acid hypersecretion. Eight patients remained well, but the three patients who had had a partial gastrectomy had a complicated course despite medical therapy. Although features of perforation in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are not specific, jejunal perforation or perforation associated with a history of diarrhea is suggestive of the diagnosis. Serum gastrin should be measured in every case and a partial gastrectomy avoided. 
5	Carotid-esophageal fistula following a penetrating neck injury: case report. Carotid arterial injuries frequently are associated with injuries to adjacent structure of the neck, particularly the esophagus and trachea. Complications from these repairs are common and fistula formation is herein described between the carotid artery and esophageal repair. 
5	Pressure-curve variations after trabeculectomy for chronic primary open-angle glaucoma. We report the results of a 5-year study of the influence of trabeculectomy on the maximum intraocular pressure (IOP) and the amplitude of its diurnal oscillation in 26 eyes (14 patients) with open-angle glaucoma. Pressure-curves were recorded before surgery and at 1 year and 5 years after surgery. The latter two pressure-curves demonstrated that trabeculectomy significantly reduced both the maximum IOP and the amplitude of the oscillations below preoperative values. 
5	Fixation of intertrochanteric fractures of the femur. A randomised prospective comparison of the gamma nail and the dynamic hip screw. We have prospectively compared the fixation of 100 intertrochanteric fractures of the proximal femur in elderly patients with random use of either a Dynamic Hip Screw (DHS) or a new intramedullary device, the Gamma nail. We found no difference in operating time, blood loss, wound complications, stay in hospital, place of eventual discharge, or the patients' mobility at final review. There was no difference in failure of proximal fixation: cut-out occurred in three cases with the DHS, and twice with the Gamma nail. However, in four cases fracture of the femur occurred close to the Gamma nail, requiring further major surgery. In the absence of these complications, union was seen by six months in both groups. 
3	Strapless oral-nasal interface for positive-pressure ventilation. A custom-fabricated strapless oral-nasal interface (SONI) is described. It was used in the long-term administration of intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) by 18 patients with paralytic or restrictive pulmonary insufficiency. This interface is an acrylic shell which is firmly fixed to an orthodontic bite plate; it is designed to form a seal over the nose and mouth for the entry of IPPV. Eight patients were ventilator dependent 24 hours a day. The ten patients who required only nocturnal aid had improvement in daytime arterial blood gases. Although nine of these patients could manage less than 15 minutes of unassisted breathing (free time) supine, all slept supine on SONI IPPV. The 13 patients who underwent sleep monitoring maintained a mean oxygen saturation of 95.3% +/- 1.7% and acceptable end-tidal pCO2 (30 to 45 mmHg). These 13 patients have used SONI IPPV for an average of 22 months (range = 3 to 63 months). Impediments to successful long-term use of a SONI include the presence of a hyperactive gag reflex or stimulation of excessive oral secretions. When combined with mouth IPPV, glossopharyngeal breathing, the intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator, or the cuirass ventilator for daytime use, SONI IPPV is an option for the patient who prefers total ventilatory support by noninvasive means. 
3	Acquired childhood aphasia. Outcome 1 year after onset. The effects of the variables age at onset, cause, severity and bilaterality of lesion, and type of aphasia on course and outcome were investigated in a group of 28 aphasic children. Analysis of spontaneous speech and tests of auditory verbal comprehension were used to determine the presence of aphasia. The severity of the cerebral lesion was assessed using a rating scale for computed tomographic scans. Most of the children had not recovered completely 1 year after onset. Recovery was significantly different according to etiological categories. Complete recovery was seen in the majority of traumatic cases. 
4	Interpreting results of exercise studies after acute myocardial infarction altered by thrombolytic therapy, coronary angioplasty or bypass. Numerous studies have assessed the ability of exercise modalities to predict patient outcome after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Implicit in the use of these prior data to assess the prognosis of patients currently undergoing exercise studies is the assumption that patients selected for exercise assessment are similar over time and that the data generated in the past are therefore applicable to the current patient populations. This study retrospectively assessed the clinical, exercise, and rest and exercise radionuclide angiographic data in 791 consecutive patients referred for exercise radionuclide angiography within 1 month after AMI during a 5-year period to determine if the clinical and exercise characteristics of patients referred for exercise evaluation after infarction have changed significantly over time. Most parameters examined demonstrated significant increasing trends, including thrombolytic therapy at the time of AMI, revascularization procedure between AMI and exercise assessment, age, beta-blocker usage, Q-wave AMI, inferior infarction, exercise double product, exercise capacity, significant ST-segment depression with exercise, peak ejection fraction, and change in ejection fraction with exercise. These data indicate that the characteristics of patients selected to undergo exercise after AMI in a large referral center have changed significantly over time. If these data are applicable to other referral centers and to other exercise testing modalities, previously published results regarding exercise assessment after AMI will need to be reconfirmed in patients currently selected for testing, since these results may no longer be applicable in this current era of aggressive medical and interventional management. 
5	Massive splenomegaly. Superior results with a combined endovascular and operative approach. Splenectomy for massive splenomegaly (drained splenic weight, greater than 1000 g) has an uncommonly high morbidity and mortality because of technical challenges and problems of hemostasis. In a group of 10 patients with massive splenomegaly due to myeloproliferative disorders (average splenic weight, 4193 g), we developed a management algorithm based on preoperative angiographic embolization of the splenic artery. Average operating time was 1.7 hours (range, 1 to 2.5 hours). Average blood loss was 528 mL; six of the 10 patients had blood loss less than 250 mL. There were four minor complications and one major complication (gastric ulcer requiring reoperation). There were no deaths in the perioperative period, and no patients required reoperation for hemorrhage. 
5	Septic arthritis of the C1-C2 lateral facet joint and torticollis: pseudo-Grisel's syndrome. We present the case of a 76-year-old man who experienced the sudden development of fever, rightsided neck pain and stiffness, and torticollis. A soft tissue mass was noted on the right side of his neck, but his head was tilted to the left. Computed tomography scans (with reformatted sagittal and coronal images) of the patient's cervical spine revealed destructive changes of the right lateral masses of C1 and C2 and the clivus, and a well-delineated peridontoid soft tissue mass (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging). After the second episode of right-sided hemiparesis, he underwent transoral surgical exploration, with anterior decompression and odontoidectomy. Histologic examination of the surgical material revealed granulation tissue, fibrosis, and chronic inflammation, consistent with abscess formation with invasion and compression of the spinal cord and bone. This case suggests that nonreducible rotational head tilt to the side opposite the side of lateral mass collapse should raise the suspicion of a possible infection. 
4	Segmented turboFLASH: method for breath-hold MR imaging of the liver with flexible contrast. A method called segmented turboFLASH imaging allows high-resolution, multisection, short-inversion-time (TI) inversion-recovery (STIR), T1- or T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) studies of the liver to be completed within a breath-hold interval. The method was applied in a phantom and in 19 patients with hepatic lesions. Sequence comparisons were performed among segmented turboFLASH, single-shot turboFLASH, T1-weighted gradient-echo with ultrashort echo time, and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) techniques. Signal from fat and liver could be nulled with the segmented turboFLASH method, with TIs of 10 and 300 msec, respectively; signal from these tissues could not be eliminated with the single-shot approach. Signal-difference-to-noise ratios and contrast for the best segmented sequences were comparable with those of the best T2-weighted SE and T1-weighted gradient-echo techniques. It is concluded that it is feasible to obtain breath-hold images with arbitrary tissue contrast by means of segmented turboFLASH imaging. The method may prove helpful for the detection and characterization of hepatic lesions and will likely have applications to other anatomic regions such as the chest and pelvis. 
5	Anterior lingual mandibular salivary gland defect. Evaluation of twenty-four cases. Lingual mandibular salivary gland defects in the posterior part of the mandible are not uncommon. Analogous defects in the anterior region, however, are rare, and the four new cases presented in this report bring the total number of reported cases up to 24. The purpose of the present study was to review and analyze the clinical, radiographic, and histologic features of the previously reported cases together with those of the present study. The majority of these defects were located in the cuspid and/or premolar area and were diagnosed in men in their fifth and sixth decades of life. Almost all defects contained normal salivary gland tissue. The differential diagnosis, treatment, and pathogenesis of these defects are discussed. 
1	Improved silver staining of nucleolar organiser regions in paraffin wax sections using an inverted incubation technique [published erratum appears in J Clin Pathol 1991 Jun;44(6):528] A new simple modification to the silver staining of nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs) was devised which, by performing the incubation with the slide inverted, results in minimal undesirable background staining, a persistent problem. Inverted incubation is facilitated by the use of a commercially available plastic coverplate. This technique has several additional advantages over other published staining protocols. In particular, the method is straightforward, fast, and maintains a high degree of contrast between the background and the AgNORs. 
1	Intra-abdominal "angiosarcomatosis" report of two cases after pelvic irradiation. Angiosarcomas account for only 1% to 2% of all soft tissue sarcomas with the most common site of origin being skin and subcutaneous tissue particularly on the face and scalp of elderly patients. These neoplasms rarely arise in the small or large bowel with presentation as diffuse abdominal "angiosarcomatosis." Two patients are reported who were treated with adjuvant pelvic irradiation for gynecologic malignancies (squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and adenocarcinoma of the endometrium) in whom diffuse abdominal angiosarcoma of intestinal origin developed 7 and 18 years later. Both patients were treated with standard megavoltage irradiation. The clinical course was rapid in both cases with death due to intra-abdominal hemorrhage and bowel obstruction. The pertinent literature relating to the association between radiation therapy and subsequent development of angiosarcomas of soft tissues and other sites is briefly reviewed. 
4	Effects of two chest tube clearance protocols on drainage in patients after myocardial revascularization surgery. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of two methods of clot clearance on chest tube drainage in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. Two hundred adult patients immediately after myocardial revascularization were randomly assigned to a specific chest tube manipulation group. The dependent variables were drainage, incidence of cardiac tamponade, incidence of surgical reentry, hemodynamic values, and number of manipulation episodes. Statistical analyses revealed no difference in any of the dependent variables when milking and stripping were used. Of the 200 patients, 78 did not require any manipulation of the chest tubes in the first 8 hours after surgery. One patient had signs of cardiac tamponade and six other patients required surgical reentry. Positioning of the connecting tube in a nondependent position assisted with the removal of drainage from the chest cavity. In conclusion, patients having myocardial revascularization did not need their chest tubes manipulated the first 8 hours after surgery. Visible drainage in the chest tube did not cause a lack of patency. 
5	Thalidomide: treatment of severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis in patients with AIDS. An increasing number of AIDS patients have been noted to suffer severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), a condition often associated with high morbidity that remains unresponsive to conventional therapeutic interventions. In two cases thalidomide was administered to successfully treat AIDS patients with RAS. Both patients experienced complete abatement of pain shortly after therapy was initiated. Ulcerations that were present for months resolved after three or four weeks of thalidomide therapy without any adverse effects. Thalidomide appears to be an effective agent for the treatment of severe RAS unresponsive to traditional therapies. 
4	Interaction of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and plasma renin activity in high renin essential hypertension. Renin secretion by the kidney is inhibited by an increase in free intracellular calcium concentration. This increase in free intracellular calcium content may be augmented by serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. In 10 subjects with high renin hypertension, an increase in dietary sodium intake resulted in an increase in urinary calcium excretion (2.5 to 3.4 mmol/L, P = .011) and an increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (51.2 to 61.0 pmol/L, P = .045). An inverse correlation existed between the change in vitamin D and the change in plasma renin activity (r = -0.765, P = .01). An inverse correlation also existed between the change in plasma renin activity and the change in mean arterial blood pressure (r = -0.757, P = .011). It is postulated that the increase in dietary sodium led to an increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration, which may have contributed to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, a decrease in renal secretion of renin, and a fall in plasma renin activity. The resultant fall in PRA in part effected the change in blood pressure to the increased sodium intake. Therefore, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may be a mediator in the response of high renin hypertension to increased sodium intake. 
5	A monoclonal antibody against the CD18 leukocyte adhesion molecule prevents indomethacin-induced gastric damage in the rabbit. The role of leukocyte adherence in the mechanism of gastropathy induced by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was investigated using a rabbit model. Gastric damage was induced by intragastric instillation of indomethacin [5 mg/mL] for a period of 30 minutes. Histologically, this treatment resulted in extensive vascular congestion and leukocyte margination within the mucosa. Pretreatment with a monoclonal antibody [IB-4] directed against the common beta subunit of the CD11/CD18 adhesion glycoprotein complex significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced both the vasocongestion and the prevalence of leukocyte margination. Macroscopically, indomethacin treatment resulted in the formation of numerous hemorrhagic lesions in the corpus region of the stomach. Pretreatment with IB-4 reduced the extent of gastric hemorrhagic damage by approximately 85% (P less than 0.001). Damage in the group pretreated with IB-4 did not differ significantly from that in rabbits that did not receive indomethacin. In separate experiments, the dose of IB-4 used was shown to completely suppress the recruitment of granulocytes in response to two different agonists. These results support the hypothesis that leukocyte adherence to the vascular endothelium is an important event in the pathogenesis of ulceration induced by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Leukocytes might contribute to ulceration by occluding microvessels, thereby reducing mucosal blood flow, and by releasing various mediators, proteases, and free radicals that can produce tissue necrosis. 
3	Cervico-ocular function in patients with spasmodic torticollis. The cervico-ocular (COR) and active and passive vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VOR) were measured in seven patients with spasmodic torticollis (ST) and six normal controls. The COR was found to be weak or absent in both groups. The VOR gain was similar in the two groups but five patients had a significant asymmetry of the response. There was no evidence of abnormal cervico-vestibular interaction during active head rotation. The study suggests that the VOR asymmetry frequently found in ST cannot be explained on the basis of an abnormal cervical input. 
1	All-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemias. II. In vitro studies: structure-function relationship. All-trans retinoic acid induces leukemic cells from patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3) to differentiate in vitro to mature granulocytes which express the CD15 antigen and are capable of respiratory burst function. Of 35 M3 samples, only one failed to respond. In eight cases, we compared the efficacy of two naturally occurring isomers of retinoic acid, all-trans RA and 13-cis RA. Both isomers induce maximal differentiation at 10(-6) mol/L. The maximal response was maintained at 10(-7) mol/L for the all-trans but not for the 13-cis RA. We also observed that the metabolites 4-oxo-all-trans and 4-oxo-13-cis were effective at 10(-6) mol/L. This 1 order of magnitude difference in the in vitro differentiating potencies of all-trans RA and 13-cis RA in the blasts of promyelocytic leukemias predicts a difference in the clinical efficacy of the two drugs. 
4	Ponderal index as a predictor of postoperative complications. Four hundred sixty-eight patients undergoing elective surgery were prospectively followed for the development of postoperative complications. There was a trend toward increasing complication rate with a lower ponderal index. However, lower ponderal indices were associated with increasing rates of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Of these patients, forty cases with postoperative complications were matched to 40 control cases for sex, age, concomitant illness and operation performed. The cases of postoperative complications had a statistically significantly lower ponderal index than the controls (11.98 versus 12.43). The increased risk of postoperative complications in those patients with a ponderal index of less than 11 was 3.36, and less than 13 was 3.44. Surgeons who treated patients with lower ponderal indices need to have a high index of suspicion for the development of postoperative complications in these patients. 
1	Prognostic factors in yolk sac tumors of the ovary. A clinicopathologic analysis of 29 cases. Twenty-nine ovarian cancer patients with yolk sac tumors and germ cell tumors with yolk sac tissue as a component of their disease (16 endodermal sinus tumor, 11 mixed germ cell tumors, one embryonal carcinoma, and one polyembryoma) were treated with cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy. Prognostic factors were investigated in this group. Patients with Stage I disease had a more favorable prognosis (P less than 0.003) than those with Stages II and IV disease. The difference in prognosis was significant in cases where residual tumor was absent (P less than 0.003) and in cases where ascites was either absent or less than 100 ml in volume (P less than 0.05). Endodermal sinus tumor with either an intestinal (P less than 0.05) or microcystic pattern (P less than 0.01) was more common in survivors than in those who died. The age, preoperative serum alpha-fetoprotein level, maximum tumor size, and tumor weight had no significant correlation with prognosis. In advanced cases, chemotherapy regimens including cisplatin gave better results than those containing vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (P less than 0.05). The optimal treatment of yolk sac tumors or tumors with yolk sac tissue as a component of the ovary is discussed in light of these results. 
5	Preoperative piroxicam for postoperative analgesia in dental surgery. Fifty patients were allocated randomly to receive placebo or piroxicam 40 mg, 2.5 h before surgical removal of lower third molars under general anaesthesia. A significantly greater number of patients in the piroxicam group did not require opioid analgesia after operation (P less than 0.05). The piroxicam group also required fewer doses of paracetamol in the first 24 h after recovery from anaesthesia (P less than 0.05), and the time from recovery to first postoperative analgesia was longer in those patients who had received piroxicam (P less than 0.05). Piroxicam did not significantly prolong the duration of recovery from anaesthesia. 
3	The headache-specific locus of control scale: adaptation to recurrent headaches. This paper describes the development, psychometric properties, and construct and incremental validity of a Headache-Specific Locus of Control Scale (HSLC). The HSLC is a 33 item scale designed specifically for recurrent headache sufferers. It assesses the individual's perceptions that headache problems and headache relief are determined primarily by: the individual's behavior (Internal factors), Health Care Professionals, or Chance factors. The psychometric properties of the HSLC were satisfactory. Among our findings were that: (1) the belief that headache problems and relief are determined by chance factors was associated with higher levels of depression, physical complaints, reliance on maladaptive pain coping strategies (p less than .001), and greater headache-related disability (p less than .01); (2) the belief that headache problems and relief are influenced primarily by the ministrations of health care professionals was associated with higher levels of medication use (p less than .01) and preference for medical treatment (p less than .001); and (3) the belief that headache problems are determined by the individual's responses and behaviors was associated with a preference for self-regulation treatment (p less than .01). These findings suggest adaptation to headache problems is influenced not only by the frequency and severity of the headache episodes, but by locus of control beliefs. The assessment of locus of control beliefs may provide useful information not typically obtained from standard medical evaluations. 
4	Randomised single blind trial to compare the toxicity of subconjunctival gentamicin and cefuroxime in cataract surgery. Comparatively little attention has been paid to the conjunctival toxicity of antibiotics administered at the time of cataract surgery. We have observed the effect of subconjunctival gentamicin and cefuroxime injection, using colour photography in a randomised single blind trial of 121 patients undergoing routine cataract surgery. Our results suggest that a hyperaemic eye is likely to occur about twice as often in patients injected with gentamicin (p less than 0.001). Gentamicin is associated with more pain postoperatively (p less than 0.05). Significant manifestations of gentamicin toxicity are conjunctival oedema and capillary closure. Cefuroxime has some theoretical advantages over gentamicin in its antibacterial spectrum. 
1	Prognosis and treatment of advanced squamous cell carcinoma secondary to epidermodysplasia verruciformis: a worldwide analysis of 11 patients. Data were collected from three medical centers in the USA, Poland, and Japan regarding 11 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) secondary to epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). Analysis was conducted regarding primary tumor location, age at onset of EV, age at diagnosis of SCC, treatment of SCC, history of local tumor recurrence, presence of metastases, and age at death. Three of 11 patients developed both lymph node and visceral metastases and the mean patient age at death was 44 years (N = 6) with no patient to date living past 54 years. Mean patient survival time following metastases was 1.7 years (N = 2). Human papilloma virus typing of nine patients was performed. Current controversies regarding the treatment of patients with advanced SCC in the setting of EV are reviewed. 
3	Endoscopic coagulation of the choroid plexus using the Nd:YAG laser: initial experience and proposal for management. Although most patients with hydrocephalus are treated effectively with ventriculoperitoneal shunts, a small group fails to respond to diversion procedures. In some patients within this group, hydrocephalus may be caused in part by the overproduction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In other patients, previous shunt infections may limit the ability of the peritoneum to absorb fluid, and patient response to a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be improved by reducing CSF production. We discuss a case of a 29-month-old hydrocephalic infant with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt who had ascites. Computed tomography showed bilateral symmetrical enlargement of the choroid plexus. Repeated cultures of the CSF and shunt tubing were sterile, and the daily production of the CSF exceeded 1000 ml. Therapy with acetazolamide decreased the CSF output temporarily, but it was discontinued after serious electrolyte abnormalities occurred. The endoscopic coagulation of the choroid plexus with a neodymium:YAG laser transmitted through a flexible quartz fiber decreased CSF production effectively. This procedure may be useful in a variety of clinical conditions associated with hydrocephalus or with other intraventricular lesions. 
2	Ileocolic nipple valve anastomosis for preventing recurrence of surgically treated Crohn's disease. Long-term follow-up of six patients. To prevent coloileal reflux after ileocecal resection, an ileocolic nipple valve anastomosis was constructed in six patients with Crohn's disease. The patients were observed for more than 7 years and were compared with 21 Crohn patients in whom conventional end-to-end ileocolic anastomosis was performed during the same period. The outcome was more favorable in the group with nipple valve anastomosis, i.e., longer interval between surgery and symptomatic relapse, and tendency to less frequent recurrence and re-resection. An association was found between radiologically preserved nipple valve and remission, and two patients with intact valve at long-term follow-up remained symptom-free. The observations implied that protection of the terminal ileum from coloileal reflux after ileocecal resection for Crohn's disease may favorably influence the prognosis. 
1	An immunohistochemical evaluation of progesterone receptor in frozen sections, paraffin sections, and cytologic imprints of breast carcinomas. Two monoclonal antibodies to progesterone receptor (PR), JZB39 and KD68, were used for the immunocytochemical visualization of PR in different kinds of breast cancer specimens including (1) cryostat sections of tumors frozen at -80 degrees C; (2) paraffin sections of tumors fixed in formalin or in Bouin's fixative for varying periods of time at room temperature or at 4 degrees C; and (3) imprints and cryostat sections prepared from the tissue used for frozen section diagnosis and stored at -80 degrees C after fixation in Zamboni's solution. Sections of conventionally frozen specimens as well as imprints and cryostat sections stored for varying periods of time were stained with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique, whereas the avidin-biotin technique was used for paraffin sections. In all types of specimens the PR immunostaining was localized to the nuclei of carcinoma cells and displayed considerable heterogeneity both in intensity and in distribution of positive cells. Close correspondence was found between the different immunohistochemical techniques as well as between immunostaining and steroid-binding assays. PR staining was more frequently positive in well-differentiated than in moderately or poorly differentiated carcinomas, whereas no meaningful correlation was found between PR staining and extent of the disease. Similar results were obtained with the immunostaining of estrogen receptor in the same material using monoclonal antibodies H222 and D75P3 gamma. Thus, by choosing the technique that best suits the type of specimen available, it is possible to obtain valid information on the receptor status of any breast carcinoma, regardless of its size and clinical presentation. 
5	Open-heart surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses. During a 7-year period, 11 adult members of the religious sect Jehovah's Witnesses underwent cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation. No homologous blood transfusions were given. Blood-conserving procedures were employed, viz. initial collection of autologous blood, haemofiltration or processing (Cell Saver) of blood collected during extracorporeal circulation and reinfusion of shed mediastinal blood. The total perioperative blood loss averaged 1080 ml (15 ml/kg body weight), equalling 19% of total body blood volume. The mean haemoglobin on discharge from hospital was 11.0 g/100 ml. There was no perioperative mortality. Postoperative pulmonary function was good and there was no serious morbidity. Jehovah's witnesses with serious, surgery-necessitating heart disease can be offered operation comprising recognized blood-conserving procedures. 
3	Task-dependent variations in parkinsonian motor impairments. Studies of visually-guided arm movements in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have suggested a relationship between slowness of movement and a reduction in the ratio of movement amplitude and peak velocity. Recent studies indicate, however, that PD impairments may be different for well-learned, natural movements performed without visual guidance, or movements associated with sequential motor behaviours such as speech. To address this issue, PD subjects and age/sex-matched controls were compared on the performance of three tasks, all of which required lowering the jaw: (1) single, rapid, visually-guided movements; (2) equivalent movements associated with a single speech syllable (inherently without visual guidance), and (3) well-learned speech movements produced in a natural sequence. PD subjects manifested similar deficits for visually-guided jaw lowering as those previously reported for arm movements, namely reduced velocity/amplitude ratios and increased movement durations. By contrast, analogous jaw movements during the sequential speech tasks were unimpaired on these measures. These results suggest that PD motor impairments are influenced by a variety of factors, including the degree to which tasks are familiar and natural, and the availability of visual information. 
2	Effect of epidermal growth factor in combination with sucralfate or omeprazole on the healing of chronic gastric ulcers in the rat. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to enhance healing of experimental gastric ulcers when given subcutaneously or orally in the drinking water. This effect of EGF occurs without reducing gastric acid secretion. On the other hand, EGF reportedly is excreted rapidly from gastric lumen when administered by intragastric bolus. This suggests that further stimulation of ulcer healing may be expected if EGF is given with an acid-suppressive agent or with an agent allowing EGF to remain in rat gastric lumen at high concentrations. In the present study, EGF administered by gastric intubation at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg, which is three times smaller than reported in previous studies, was evaluated for its effect on acetic acid-induced rat gastric ulcers in combination with sucralfate or omeprazole. Sucralfate is well known selectively to bind proteins covering the ulcer base, and omeprazole is a potent acid-suppressive agent. Prior to the study of combined EGF and sucralfate, oral sucralfate was confirmed to allow endogenous gastric EGF and mouse EGF given exogenously to remain at high concentrations in gastric contents and tissues. EGF and sucralfate (2 g/kg/day) given alone failed to stimulate ulcer healing in submandibularectomized rats (SMR rat) whose endogenous gastric EGF was depleted. However, the combination of both drugs administered at the same doses significantly accelerated ulcer healing in the SMR rat. Omeprazole (200 mg/kg/day) significantly enhanced ulcer healing regardless of removal of the submandibular glands. The combination of EGF and omeprazole further stimulated ulcer healing in the SMR rat. 
3	Diurnal differences in response to oral levodopa. Diurnal differences in duration and quality of motor response to levodopa are frequently described by patients. The quality and duration of motor responses were objectively assessed to morning and afternoon oral levodopa doses in five patients with Parkinsonian motor fluctuations who complained of diurnal variation in response to their normal levodopa medication. Results suggest that under controlled conditions which eliminated the effects of diet and overlapping levodopa effects the response to levodopa remained unchanged throughout the day, and that the duration of response could be predicted by plasma levodopa levels. 
3	Rehabilitation in brain disorders. 2. Clinical manifestations and medical issues. This self-directed learning module highlights advances in clinical manifestations of brain disorders. It is part of the chapter on rehabilitation in brain disorders for the Self-Directed Medical Knowledge Program Study Guide for practitioners and trainees in physical medicine and rehabilitation. This chapter is composed of four articles, and each builds on principles established in the others. This article covers medical complications, neurobehavioral aspects, and cognitive deficits seen in patients with brain disorders, specifically seizures, hydrocephalus, heterotopic ossification, and cardiovascular/pulmonary, neuroendocrine, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, communication, motoric, and visual/spatial/sensory disorders. Advances that are covered in this section are neuroendocrine complications, seizure prophylaxis, and coma treatment. The learner is directed to articles 1, 3, and 4 in this chapter for supporting information. 
3	Brain-stem auditory evoked responses in 56 patients with acoustic neurinoma. The brain-stem auditory evoked responses (BAER's) recorded from 56 patients with acoustic neurinomas were analyzed. Ten of the patients had intracanalicular tumors and 46 had extracanalicular tumors. It was possible to obtain BAER's following stimulation of the affected side in 28 patients and after stimulation of the unaffected side in all 56. Five patients (11%) had normal BAER's following stimulation of both sides; three of these patients had intracanalicular tumors. Among BAER's obtained following stimulation of the affected ear, the mean interpeak latency (IPL) for peaks I to III associated with extracanalicular tumors was significantly prolonged relative to controls (p less than 0.001), and linear regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between tumor size and IPL of peaks I to III (p less than 0.05). Analysis of the 56 BAER's recorded after stimulation of the unaffected side revealed a significant positive correlation between the IPL's of peaks III to V and tumor size (p less than 0.001). This correlation was not strengthened when accounting for the degree of brain-stem compression. Finally, evidence of preserved function within the auditory pathway, even in the presence of partial hearing loss, is presented. This finding suggests that more patients might benefit from surgical procedures that spare the eighth cranial nerve. 
5	Severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage in Crohn's disease. Twenty-one of fifteen hundred twenty-six patients with Crohn's disease (CD) treated at The Mount Sinai Hospital between 1960 and 1986 developed severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage. There were 26 separate episodes of severe hemorrhage: 17 patients bled only once, three bled twice and one bled three times. The frequency of bleeding was significantly higher among patients with colonic involvement (17 of 929; 1.9%) than among those with small bowel disease alone (4 of 597; 0.7%) (p less than 0.001). Twelve patients required surgery on 13 occasions, which involved colon resection in all but one case. Eleven of these patients underwent surgery during their first hemorrhagic episodes, and 1 of 11 had a second operation for recurrent bleeding; the 12th patient, whose first hemorrhage had been treated medically, had surgery during a repeated episode of hemorrhage. The precise bleeding points could be located in only 2 of the 26 bleeding episodes, both at the ileocecal area. Three patients died, of whom two had not undergone surgery when they had bled a few weeks earlier. Primary bleeding episodes subsided without surgery in 10 of 21 cases, but 3 of these 10 patients (30%) rebled massively. By contrast primary excisional surgery was followed by recurrent hemorrhage in only 1 of 11 cases (9%). These differences in mortality and in recurrent bleeding rates, although not statistically significant, seem to favor removal of diseased bowel at the time of the first episode of massive hemorrhage. 
2	Appendiceal carcinoma masquerading as primary bladder carcinoma. We report 2 cases of appendiceal adenocarcinoma invading the bladder. Both tumors masqueraded as primary bladder carcinomas. Cystoscopic biopsies obtained adenocarcinomatous tissue and the secondary nature of the bladder lesion became apparent at laparotomy in both cases. One patient was treated with surgical resection of the appendix, the adjacent cecal wall and the bladder wall, and postoperative irradiation. She was well 10 years later. The other patient was treated with right colectomy and segmental bladder resection. She died of diffuse peritoneal recurrence 6 years later. 
3	Natural death as viewed by the medical examiner: a review of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease. A study of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease was conducted. Cardiovascular disease was responsible for 60.9% of all deaths with coronary artery disease--not only the main cause of cardiovascular death but also the main cause of all natural deaths--accounting for 45.1% of such cases. Diseases of the central nervous and respiratory systems accounted for 8.7 and 8.6%, respectively, of the natural deaths. Seizure disorders and pneumonia were the main causes of death in these organ systems. There were 124 deaths of children less than one year in age, 91 of which were due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). All of the SIDS deaths were in children less than 10 months old. 
2	Closure of refractory perineal Crohn's lesion. Integration of hyperbaric oxygen into case management. A case is reported in which a comprehensive program of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), surgical debridement and reconstruction, and continuing medical management resulted in complete and sustained closure of an extensive perineal Crohn's lesion refractory to conventional medical and surgical management. It is emphasized that in this case healing occurred in the setting of previous removal of all diseased intestinal tissue and only with the combined use of all three treatment modalities. HBO may be a useful adjunct in the therapy of large nonhealing perineal lesions post-proctocolectomy in patients who are unresponsive to metronidazole or to immunosuppressant therapy or who experience limiting side effects from continued medical therapy. 
1	Comparisons of diet and biochemical characteristics of stool and urine between Chinese populations with low and high colorectal cancer rates. In an investigation of the roles of diet and stool biochemistry in human colorectal carcinogenesis, 24-hour food, urine, and stool samples were collected from randomly selected participants from two populations with a fourfold difference in colorectal cancer risk: Chinese in Sha Giao, People's Republic of China (low risk), and Chinese-Americans of similar ages in San Francisco County, Calif, in the United States (high risk). The findings supported the hypotheses that colorectal cancer risk is increased by the consumption of high-fat, high-protein, and low-carbohydrate diets and is associated with high levels of cholesterol in stool as well as increased daily outputs of 3-methyl-histidine and malonaldehyde in urine. However, risk does not increase with low stool bulk and low total stool fibers. 
1	Acral melanoma: a review of 185 patients with identification of prognostic variables. One hundred eight-five patients with acral melanoma treated since 1972 were reviewed. These included 53 subungual lesions, 123 plantar lesions, and 9 palmar lesions. Eighty percent presented with stage I disease. Mean age was 57 years. Males outnumbered females 1.1:1. Seventeen percent (17%) were blacks. Actuarial 10-year survival was 58% for stage I patients and 35% for stage II patients. Univariate Cox regression analyses identified 5 prognostic variables affecting survival: stage at diagnosis (P less than 0.001), race (P less than 0.001), ulceration (P = 0.012), Clark's level (P = 0.014), and thickness of the primary lesion (P = 0.013). Factors unrelated to survival included sex of the patient, site (volar vs. subungual), histology, and treatment with amputation. Multivariate analysis for patients with stage I lesions identified race (P = 0.001) and ulceration (P = 0.018) as significant variables, with thickness approaching significance (P = 0.094). In an additional series of 71 patients with melanomas arising from extremity sites near the junction of glabrous and non-glabrous skin, survival was significantly poorer for those arising from glabrous skin (P = 0.024), and reflects a higher incidence of metastatic disease at diagnosis. Specific active immunotherapy was the principal adjuvant used for these patients, and survival was comparable to that reported with regional perfusion therapy. Acral melanoma a) has a strong racial predilection, b) carries a grave prognosis, and c) arises from glabrous skin. It is a clinical entity distinct from other extremity melanomas. Surgical management with either wide excision or amputation is appropriate for the primary lesion. 
5	Long-term morphology of spastic or flaccid muscles in spinal cord-transected rabbits. Despite difficulty in long-term maintenance of spinalized rabbits, muscular pathologic changes in chronic spinalized rabbits could be observed for a period of four weeks. Rabbits were prepared by spinal cord transection at T10 (spastic paralysis) or by spinal cord removal below L7 (flaccid paralysis). Spastic preparations showed hind-limb spasticity and reflex incontinence one to two days after operation. Hypertrophic fibers began to appear in spastic muscles after two weeks. This hypertrophy, thought to be caused by phasic repetitive contraction, was verified by electron microscopy to be different from normal exercise hypertrophy. Flaccid preparations maintained hind-limb flaccidity and overflow incontinence. In flaccid muscle, marked muscle fiber necrosis indicated rapid atrophy. Spinal deformity and joint contracture inactivate spinalized rabbits, and cause pressure sores. However, feeding assistance and avoidance of complications make long-term maintenance possible. 
5	Skeletal muscle as an alternative specimen for alcohol and drug analysis. In a random group of medical examiner cases, muscle tissue, as well as blood and vitreous humor, was analyzed for ethyl alcohol, and the results were compared. When the blood concentration was greater than 0.10 g/dL, the muscle to blood ratio was 1.00 or less (average 0.94), and when the blood concentration was less than 0.10 g/dL, this ratio was greater than 1.00 (average 1.48). The author proposes that this ratio is dependent upon the time course of absorption and distribution, as has been observed for vitreous humor, but with a more rapid equilibration. Muscle tissue was also analyzed in another group of cases found to be positive for one or more drugs in blood. The concentrations of the drugs in muscle varied from none detected to 6.5 times those in blood and seemed to be dependent on the time course between ingestion and death, as well as on the nature of the drug. For most common basic drugs, the ratios were often near unity. Muscle is proposed as a useful alternative specimen to postmortem blood. 
4	Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction presenting as ascites: the importance of clinically assessing central venous pressure. A 66-year-old man without history of heart disease or symptoms of left ventricular (LV) failure was admitted with transudative ascites. Echocardiography showed no valvular or pericardial disease and normal LV function. Gated pool scintigraphy confirmed normal LV systolic function but demonstrated severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Catheterization revealed left ventricular diastolic dysfunction as the cause of right-sided failure. The clinician evaluating transudative ascites cannot exclude LV failure on the basis of noninvasive assessment of systolic function alone. Appreciation of an elevated central venous pressure remains the most important evidence of a cardiac source of ascites. 
3	Magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents: theory and application to the central nervous system. The theoretical aspects of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agents are reviewed, and their current applications to the central nervous system (CNS) and their future applications are discussed. Profound differences exist between contrast agents used for MR imaging and computerized tomography (CT). In MR imaging, the contrast agents are not imaged directly but rather act on adjacent protons to shorten T1 and T2 relaxation times. This in turn results in signal intensity changes. The lanthanide metal, gadolinium, in the form of gadopentetate dimeglumine, has been found to be both safe and efficacious as the only currently approved contrast agent for MR imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging revolutionized the detection and treatment of disease affecting the brain and spine. Initially, it was thought that signal characteristics on MR imaging would allow differentiation of specific pathology. It was soon found that MR studies were able to detect more abnormalities but were less able to characterize them. The recent development of contrast agents for MR imaging has allowed this modality to surpass CT for the evaluation of most CNS lesions. At present, contrast-enhanced MR imaging is generally accepted as the study of choice for evaluating acoustic neurinomas, pituitary lesions, meningeal disease, primary and secondary brain tumors, active multiple sclerosis, intradural spinal neoplasms, intramedullary spinal disease, and postoperative states in both the spine and brain. Even when contrast-enhanced CT can detect the same abnormalities, evaluation of the lesions in multiple planes on MR imaging can sometimes yield invaluable information, especially prior to surgery. Future developments of contrast material for MR imaging include non-gadolinium compounds, intrathecal contrast media, cerebral blood flow and volume evaluation, and, possibly, antibody-labeled contrast agents. 
2	Colonoscopy during an attack of severe ulcerative colitis is a safe procedure and of great value in clinical decision making. Thirty-four patients who had severe ulcerative colitis had a colonoscopic examination during the attack. The indications were resistance to therapy and/or differential diagnostic purposes. Total colonoscopy was performed in 25 cases and less extensive examination in nine. Biopsy was taken in 22 cases. No clinically significant complications occurred. The procedure helped us to postpone immediate surgical intervention in 19 cases. Fourteen of these patients have maintenance treatment and are still well after a follow-up median time of 5 yr (6 months to 10 yr). 
5	Chronic pain in primary care. Identification and management of psychosocial factors. Chronic pain is a problem of great public health importance that is frequently seen in the primary care setting. Pain chronicity shows a strong association with psychosocial factors. Assessment of these factors should be composed of two parts: (1) psychological factors and (2) psychiatric illness. Psychological factors include all those pain-associated alterations in the patient's environment that reinforce illness behavior. Psychiatric illness includes those syndromes that retard recovery from illness or injury, such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and dementia. Psychiatric and psychological interventions can be successfully introduced in the context of a comprehensive rehabilitation effort. Usually these interventions can be accomplished by the family physician in concert with a consultant psychiatrist or psychologist. In severely disabled or resistant patients, referral to a multidisciplinary pain clinic will be necessary. 
5	Spreading depression-like depolarization and selective vulnerability of neurons. A brief review. If oxygen is withdrawn from rat hippocampal slices, a spreading depression-like response occurs earlier and is of larger amplitude in the CA1 area than in the dentate gyrus. After reoxygenation, recovery of synaptic transmission correlates inversely with the time spent in spreading depression. Recovery occurs more frequently in dentate gyrus than in CA1. Chlorpromazine and the gangliosides GM1 and AGF2 promote recovery from hypoxic depression of synaptic transmission in CA1. Prevention of irreversible loss of function correlates closely with a shortening of the time spent in spreading depression. If Ca2+ is withdrawn before hypoxia, then synaptic function recovers upon restoration of oxygen and [Ca2+]o, despite prolonged spreading depression. When spreading depression lasting more than 6-9 minutes is induced in fully oxygenated slices by superfusion with high-K+ solution, then transient recovery is followed by long-lasting loss of synaptic function. In intact brain of anesthetized rats, synaptic transmission in CA1 recovers after spreading depression-like depolarization lasting more than 30 minutes, but is lost irreversibly after 60 minutes. We conclude that entry of Ca2+ into neurons caused by spreading depression-like depolarization is important in the selective vulnerability of neurons; the duration of depolarization is critical to cell survival; and in the presence of a normal blood supply, neurons resist protracted spreading depression-like depolarization. 
1	Laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy in the staging of early carcinoma of the cervix. Laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 39 patients. An incision of the peritoneum between the round and infundibulo-pelvic ligament on each side gave access to the retroperitoneal space. Subsequently, laparoscopic surgery allowed precise dissection of external and internal iliac vessels, umbilical artery, and obturator nerve. The peritoneum was left open, and the lymph was drained into the peritoneal cavity. No lymphocele was observed. Three to 22 (mean, 8.7) nodes were removed, and there was no significant morbidity. Sensitivity and specificity were 100% in this preliminary experience. It is thus possible to remove the first-line regional lymph nodes of the cervix for pathologic examination. Because "skip" metastases are quite rare in early cervical carcinoma, the risk of missing a positive node is low. Brachytherapy alone, vaginal surgery, or, in microinvasive carcinoma, conization alone can be applied safely without the need of a staging laparotomy in cases with negative nodes. 
3	Methsuximide for intractable childhood seizures. Methsuximide was added to the therapeutic regimens of 25 children with intractable epilepsy. In 15 patients the drug was well tolerated and resulted in a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency. No serious or irreversible adverse effects were seen. Methsuximide is frequently overlooked and may be an effective adjunctive antiepileptic for children with intractable seizures. 
3	Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is frequently made by taking a meticulous history coupled with a high index of suspicion. Snoring and hypersomnolence are clinical features common to individuals with sleep apnea. Since snoring is said to be a "disease of listeners," it is not uncommon that bed partners reported an increased incidence of depression and marital displeasure. It is for this reason that the spouse or bed partner should be interviewed, since the patient may not be aware of any sleeping problems. Physicians should also be alert to complaints of excessive daytime somnolence, because studies have shown that patients with obstructive sleep apnea are at increased risk for automobile crashes. It has been estimated that approx 58,000 motor vehicle accidents involving people with sleep apnea will occur in the US each yr. By proper diagnosis and treatment, the physician is in a unique position to prevent at least some of the automobile accidents that result from falling asleep while driving. Polysomnography is the only definitive way to obtain a diagnosis of sleep apnea. This allows the physician not only to diagnosis the disorder, but also helps in the evaluation of the severity of the syndrome and selection of therapy. An ENT evaluation is also important in ruling out anatomic disorders that can cause upper airway obstruction. Certain factors, such as alcohol and sedative ingestion, may aggravate the condition in a person predisposed to sleep apnea, and subtle changes, such as unexplained hypertension, polycythemia, and cor pulmonale, should lead one to investigate the possibility of sleep apnea as the etiology. 
3	The large striatocapsular infarct. A clinical and pathophysiological entity. We examined 29 patients with strictly subcortical large striatocapsular infarctions. Eight of them had aphasia or neglect. All patients underwent transcranial Doppler ultrasonography or selective carotid angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single photon emission tomography for assessment of cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and cerebral perfusion reserve. The signs were compatible with cortical territorial infarctions rather than lacunes. On both magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic scans, the lesions corresponded to the territories of the medial and lateral group of the lenticulostriate arteries, Heubner's artery, or the anterior choroidal artery. The infarctions were either due to cerebral embolization into the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery or due to stenosis at the same site, ie, lesions that acutely and simultaneously occluded the orifices of the lenticulostriate or neighboring arteries. Persistent occlusion of the middle cerebral arteries and a decrease of cortical regional cerebral blood flow were only found in patients with aphasia or neglect. All patients without aphasia or neglect showed a rapid recanalization of the middle cerebral artery occlusion or a stenosis of the M1 segment and no cortical regional cerebral blood flow decrease. Large striatocapsular infarctions occur due to occlusive disease of the middle cerebral artery (large-vessel disease) and not due to a disseminated in situ occlusion of the long penetrating arteries (small-vessel disease), as in lacunes. Neuropsychological deficits can be explained by decreased cortical blood flow due to a persistent occlusive lesion of the middle cerebral artery. 
5	Acute pulmonary embolism triggered by the act of defecation. Pulmonary embolism associated with the act of defecation has not been previously well described. Recently, we reported our experience with four patients who presented to us over a 12-month period with syncope, near syncope, or sudden death following the act of defecation. In all four cases, acute pulmonary embolism was shown to be the etiology of the defecation-associated events. A retrospective chart review of all patients with the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism at our institution over a three-year period yielded five additional patients with the diagnosis of defecation-associated pulmonary embolism. These nine patients accounted for 6.8 percent of all patients with a discharge diagnosis of pulmonary embolism seen at our institution during the three-year study period. Six of the nine patients died from their defecation-associated pulmonary embolism. These six deaths accounted for 25 percent of all deaths from pulmonary embolism seen at our institution during the study period. Based on our experience, we suggest that the act of defecation may trigger the development of acute pulmonary embolism in some patients with deep vein thrombosis. 
2	Use and misuse of oral therapy for diarrhea: comparison of US practices with American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations. To determine how closely US pediatricians follow the 1985 American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition's recommendations on oral therapy for acute diarrhea, a questionnaire was administered to four groups: New England private practitioners, pediatricians from 27 states attending a postgraduate course, representatives of departments of pediatrics at US schools of medicine, and housestaff at Boston Children's and Massachusetts General hospitals. The responses from departments of pediatrics and housestaff were not significantly different from those of community practitioners in most categories. The reported rate of use of glucose-electrolyte solutions recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics was not different from the use of nonphysiologic, high-osmolar, low-salt solutions such as sodas and juices. The usage rate for glucose-electrolyte solutions meeting the American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended carbohydrate-to-sodium ratio of less than 2:1 was less than 30%. Other findings included the general lack of agreement on the use of a single type of therapy and the common use of oral therapy only for mild or no dehydration. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that feeding be reintroduced in the first 24 hours of a diarrheal episode, the majority of respondents withhold feeding until the second day or later. These findings indicate that educational programs on oral therapy during acute diarrhea are needed in the United States. 
1	An electron and optical microscopic study of juxtaposed odontogenic keratocyst and carcinoma. Odontogenic keratocyst and squamous cell carcinoma commonly occur within the oral cavity; however, the juxtaposition of these lesions is rare. The light microscopic and ultrastructural features of such an event are reported. Although some morphologic similarities between the cyst and tumor were observed, definitive evidence of a common origin was not obtained. 
1	Bolus versus infusion regimens of etoposide and cisplatin in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: a study of the North Central Cancer Treatment group In an effort to test clinically the hypothesis that the duration of cellular exposure to etoposide (VP-16) and cisplatin (CDDP) is an important determinant of cytotoxicity, we performed a phase III randomized trial comparing an outpatient bolus regimen of combined VP-16 and CDDP with a sequential infusion over 72 hours of these same two drugs. All patients had stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, and survival was the primary end point. Of 113 patients randomly allocated to the study, 108 were assessable for response, survival, and toxicity. A major response was observed in 20 (37%) of 54 patients on the bolus regimen and in 16 (30%) of 54 patients receiving infusion therapy. The median time to progression was 61 and 88 days for bolus and infusion therapy, respectively. The median survival time was 148 and 157 days, respectively (P = .71). Study results were not consistent with the possibility that infusion therapy could be associated with a 50% improvement in median survival, i.e. from 5 months to 7 1/2 months. Toxicity was primarily myelosuppression and was significantly greater with the infusion regimen. We conclude that infusion therapy as tested in this protocol with VP-16 and CDDP does not offer any advantage in response rate, time to disease progression, or survival as compared with bolus therapy. In addition, infusion therapy is associated with a greater degree of neutropenia and more treatment-related deaths. 
4	One hundred percent oxygen reverses muscle hypoxia in a rat hindlimb model of acute arterial occlusion. Significant morbidity results from extremity ischemia after acute arterial occlusion. Reestablishment of arterial flow is considered to be the ideal treatment, yet substantial tissue loss can occur before this is accomplished. Using a rat hindlimb model we investigated whether the administration of 100% oxygen would decrease tissue hypoxia from acute arterial occlusion. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used, and Po2 recordings were taken from the gastrocnemius muscle by use of an oxygen electrode. Baseline muscle Po2 was recorded, and then the femoral artery was occluded. Repeat recordings were made after 20 minutes of ventilation with room air and after an additional 20 minutes of ventilation with 100% oxygen (N = 10). Control groups consisted of animals undergoing occlusion but continued on room air (N = 3) and animals undergoing sham occlusion but receiving the period of 100% oxygen ventilation (N = 3). Femoral artery occlusion produced a reduction in muscle Po2 from 28.0 +/- 1.4 to 6.1 +/- 2.0 (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001). Ventilation with 100% oxygen reversed the tissue hypoxia produced by occlusion (27.3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.001). The administration of 100% oxygen without femoral artery occlusion resulted in a higher tissue Po2 than the occluded + oxygen group (94 +/- 12 vs 27.3 +/- 2.0, p less than 0.001). Mean arterial blood pressure increased in the experimental group concomitant with the administration of 100% oxygen, but there was no correlation between final blood pressure and final tissue oxygen tension. 
5	Hepatomuscular failure in septic catabolism: altered muscular response to plasma proteolytic factor in decreased hepatic mitochondrial redox potential. To estimate the contribution of muscle protein in whole-body protein catabolism, the muscular contribution index (MCI; urine 3-methylhistidine/urine total nitrogen) was determined in 49 cases of elective laparotomy, together with the arterial blood ketone body ratio (KBR; acetoacetate/beta-hydroxybutyrate), which reflects hepatic mitochondrial redox potential. MCI increased after operation and the occurrence of severe infection, provided KBR was maintained above 0.7. In patients with sepsis, however, MCI decreased dependently with KBR (n = 33; p less than 0.01). In these patients, plasma proteolysis-inducing activity determined by in vitro bioassay increased in inverse proportion to KBR (n = 20, p less than 0.01). Moreover, plasma concentrations of not only aromatic but also branched-chain amino acids markedly increased when KBR decreased to below 0.4 (n = 23; p less than 0.05). Thus the role of muscle protein in septic catabolism is diminished under reduced hepatic mitochondrial redox potential, despite the rapid increase of proteolysis-inducing activity. This finally leads to the failure of amino acid uptake by muscles, as well as liver. These results suggest that the deteriorated substrate exchange may form the metabolic background for multiple systems organ failure, which is often preceded by reduced KBR. 
4	Dural spinal cord arteriovenous malformation. After multiple hospital admissions and an inpatient rehabilitation stay, a 68-year-old woman was transferred to our rehabilitation facility with a paraparesis of unknown etiology. Previous studies included four CT scans and three MRIs which did not demonstrate the lesion. A myelogram was noncharacteristic. The correct diagnosis, confirmed by selective angiography, was ultimately contingent upon recognition of the clinical features and natural history of dural spinal cord arteriovenous malformations (SCAVM). The unusual combination of this multitude of nondiagnostic imaging studies in the uncommon dural SCAVM served to delay diagnosis and treatment. Such delay may have great functional consequences. This report illustrates the importance of suspecting SCAVM and recognizing its features. Emphasis is placed on the physiatrist's role in assuring proper diagnosis to expedite a timely treatment and to obtain the best functional outcome. A brief review of the classification, clinical features, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and prognosis of SCAVM is presented. 
5	Chilaiditi's syndrome. A diagnostic challenge. Chilaiditi's syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal and chest pain. Although interposition of the right colon is a relatively common radiologic finding, there is a distinct paucity of information in the medical literature. Chilaiditi's syndrome is usually asymptomatic, but when symptoms occur, conservative treatment is usually effective. Recognition is important because this syndrome can be mistaken for more serious abnormalities, which may lead to unnecessary surgical intervention. 
1	Nd:YAG-laser in the microsurgery of frontobasal meningiomas. Forty-three patients with big frontobasal meningiomas underwent a microsurgical removal of the tumor. The 1.32 microns Nd:YAG-laser has proved useful in this prospective series particularly with the contactless shrinkage of the tumors and the necrotization of the dural and bony attachments. Tumor shrinkage was achieved by radiating the tumor surface with the Nd:YAG-laser. This technique facilitated the microsurgical dissection and reduced the blood loss by half. The Nd:YAG-laser necrotization of the dural and bony attachments reduced the recurrence rate following grade two resections from 20% to zero. The postoperative quality of life was excellent with a complete rehabilitation in 76% of the patients. The use of the 1.32 microns Nd:YAG-laser improved significantly the results of microsurgery for frontobasal meningioma. 
5	Colon carcinoma associated with ureterosigmoidostomy. A patient developing a colonic adenoma 38 years following ureterosigmoidostomy is presented. The mechanisms of neoplastic transformation associated with ureterosigmoidostomy is now better understood. This knowledge is being applied to develop modifications both of the surgical technique and the management of patients with this form of urinary diversion, and is a subject of discussion. 
4	Clinical cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool providing high-resolution images of the heart and great vessels without the use of ionizing radiation or contrast agents. MRI systems currently in use at many hospitals can be used effectively in the routine, clinical evaluation of many forms of cardiovascular disease, including great vessel disease, ischemic cardiac disease and congenital cardiac disease. Moreover, quantitative and cine MRI techniques are now available, which provide highly accurate measures of chamber size, wall motion and wall thickening. Recent developments in the areas of myocardial tagging, high-speed imaging and MR assessments of flow and perfusion suggest potential for an increasing role of MRI in the clinical evaluation of the cardiovascular system. 
2	Nonoperative management of bile duct stones. The treatment of choice for most retained bile duct stones is by nonoperative means. If a T-tube is in place, percutaneous techniques via the T-tract are indicated. Percutaneous access via puncture of a Roux-en-Y loop is also practical. In the absence of a T-tube, retrograde endoscopic techniques should be used. Both techniques are very effective and safe. Stones in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts also can be treated nonoperatively. Endoscopic sphincterotomy has a role in the treatment of selected patients with gallstone pancreatitis, acute cholangitis, and choledocholithiasis with in situ gallbladders. In difficult cases, endoscopic and percutaneous techniques are employed in combination. 
1	Gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 in salivary gland tumors. Gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15) is a 15-kd glycoprotein that is expressed by normal apocrine epithelia and in a majority of breast carcinomas. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this substance is also present in tumors of the salivary glands, sweat glands, and prostate gland. To determine whether the expression of CGDFP-15 might aid in the differential diagnosis of salivary gland lesions, the anti-GCDFP-15 monoclonal antibody D6 was applied to paraffin sections of 133 such neoplasms. Benign tumors (76% reactive) were more often labeled than malignant lesions (28% reactive) by this antibody; overall, 53 (41%) of 133 cases were positive for GCDFP-15. Notably, the tubuloglandular components in 17 (81%) of 21 pleomorphic adenomas were reactive, but no example of either adenoid cystic carcinoma or polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma were labeled. In contrast, 24% of adenocarcinomas stained with this antibody. The apparent expression of GCDFP-15 by a spectrum of salivary gland tumors supports their biologic relationship to lesions of the cutaneous apocrine glands and breast. Furthermore, the demonstration of this determinant may be of use in suggesting the salivary gland nature of poorly differentiated carcinomas of the head and neck, and it may facilitate the separation of pleomorphic adenoma from histologically similar malignant neoplasms in the salivary glands themselves. 
5	Modification of atrioventricular node transmission properties by intraoperative neodymium-YAG laser photocoagulation in dogs. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd-YAG) laser photocoagulation of the atrioventricular (AV) node to control the ventricular rate during rapid atrial rhythms without creating AV block. In 12 dogs on normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, short laser pulses were delivered to an area between the coronary sinus orifice and the site of the most proximally recorded His deflection until second degree AV block occurred at a paced atrial rate of 200 beats/min. Long-term effects on AV node function were followed up for 3 months. Three animals developed chronic high grade AV block. In nine animals with preserved 1:1 conduction, the mean (+/- SEM) critical atrial cycle length resulting in AV node Wenckebach periodicity increased from 183 +/- 6 to 261 +/- 24 ms (+43%), the mean RR interval during induced atrial fibrillation increased from 248 +/- 14 to 330 +/- 27 ms (+32%) and the shortest RR interval during atrial fibrillation increased from 215 +/- 11 to 275 +/- 20 ms (+28%). Laser effects were not reversed by isoproterenol infusion. Histologic examination of the irradiated area showed fibrotic changes in the AV node and fatty metamorphosis. This study suggests that 1) graded Nd-YAG laser photocoagulation of the AV node region in dogs results in long-term modification of anterograde AV node transmission properties; 2) 1:1 conduction during sinus rhythm usually remains preserved, but ventricular rate during rapid atrial rhythms is chronically reduced; and 3) progression to high grade AV block occurs in a minority of animals. 
4	Probe angioplasty of total coronary occlusion using the Probing Catheter technique. Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of total coronary occlusion is limited by the inability of guidewires and conventional dilating catheters to cross all such lesions. A new technique was therefore prospectively evaluated for PTCA of these lesions using the ultra-low-profile Probe "balloon on a wire" device. An intracoronary Probing Catheter was used to facilitate crossing the stenosis with a guidewire and then to deliver a Probe into the obstruction for balloon dilatation. This technique was utilized in 64 consecutive patients with "absolute" coronary occlusions demonstrating no angiographically detectable antegrade coronary flow. Successful dilatation was achieved in 47 (73%). Among 33 occlusions of less than 3 mo duration 31 (94%) were successfully dilated whereas only 16 of 31 more chronic occlusions were dilated (P less than .01). Chronic occlusions with a tapered morphology and those located more than 1 cm from a branch point were more frequently dilatable. There were no serious complications including no vessel perforations with this technique. The Probing Catheter technique offers a safe and effective method for the dilatation of recent coronary occlusions by using balloon on a wire technology. 
3	7th nerve palsy after extradural blood patch. We describe a patient who developed a 7th cranial nerve palsy following an extradural blood patch; full recovery followed. The likely aetiology is discussed. 
2	Hepatic injury associated with small bowel bacterial overgrowth in rats is prevented by metronidazole and tetracycline. Susceptible rat strains develop hepatobiliary injury following the surgical creation of self-filling blind loops that cause small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Luminal bacteria or their cell wall polymers were implicated in the pathogenesis of the lesions because sham-operated rats and rats with self-emptying blind loops, having only slightly increased bacterial counts, did not develop hepatic injury. In this study, antibiotics with different spectra of activities were continuously administered starting 1 day or 22 days after surgery to determine which intestinal flora may be responsible for the development of hepatic injury in rats with small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Four weeks following surgery, Lewis rats with self-filling blind loops receiving no antibiotics had elevated liver histology scores (8.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.4) and plasma aspartate aminotransferase levels (269 +/- 171 vs. 84 +/- 24) compared with sham-operated rats, P less than 0.001. Oral gentamicin as well as oral and intraperitoneal polymyxin B, which binds endotoxin, did not prevent hepatic injury in rats with self-filling blind loops. However, oral metronidazole and tetracycline therapy continuously administered beginning 1 day after surgery diminished hepatic injury (histology score 3.0 +/- 1.8, 2.9 +/- 1.1; aspartate aminotransferase 87 +/- 25, 98 +/- 34; respectively P less than 0.001 compared with self-filling blind loops receiving no antibiotics). Metronidazole also protected Wistar rats that require 12 weeks to develop hepatic injury following experimentally induced small bowel bacterial overgrowth compared with rats with self-filling blind loops that received no antibiotic treatment (histology score 10.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 0.7 +/- 1.1, and aspartate aminotransferase 273 +/- 239 vs. 76 +/- 20, P less than 0.001). When rats started metronidazole therapy 22 days after self-filling blind loop surgery, elevated aspartate aminotransferase values decreased to normal during the next 77 days and final histology scores were normal. All rats with self-filling blind loops had negative peritoneal, liver, spleen, and blood cultures but approximately 75% of mesenteric lymph node cultures were positive irrespective of antibiotic treatment. Because Bacteroides species have been implicated in causing vitamin B12 and disaccharidase deficiencies in rats with self-filling blind loops, we documented the presence or absence of these organisms from blind loops using selective culture techniques. Metronidazole and tetracycline eliminated Bacteroides sp. from blind loops, but polymyxin B and gentamicin did not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
1	A phase I clinical, plasma, and cellular pharmacology study of gemcitabine. A novel deoxycytidine analog, gemcitabine (2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine [dFdC]), has been studied in a phase I clinical and pharmacology trial. Doses ranging from 10 to 1,000 mg/m2 were administered over 30 minutes weekly times 3 weeks every 4 weeks. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) was 790 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression, with thrombocytopenia and anemia quantitatively more important than granulocytopenia. Nonhematologic toxicity was minimal. Two responses in patients with adenocarcinomas of the colon and lung were documented. The maximum dFdC plasma concentration, reached after 15 minutes of infusion, was proportional to the total dose administered. Elimination, due mainly to deamination, was rapid (terminal half-life [t1/2], 8.0 minutes) and dose independent. The deamination product 2',2'-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) was eliminated with biphasic kinetics characterized by a long terminal phase (t1/2, 14 hours); it was the sole metabolite detected in urine. The concentration of dFdC 5'-triphosphate in circulating mononuclear cells increased in proportion to the dFdC dose at infusions between 35 and 250 mg/m2. No further increment in dFdC 5'-triphosphate (dFdCTP) was observed at higher doses, which resulted in plasma dFdC concentrations greater than 20 mumol/L (350 to 1,000 mg/m2), suggesting saturation of dFdC 5'-phosphate accumulation. The recommended dose for phase II clinical trials in solid tumors is 790 mg/m2/wk. 
3	Brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic evaluation of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We compared brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic performance in 20 neurologically asymptomatic patients suffering from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (mean age 41 [range 18-49] years) and 20 age-matched controls (mean age 38 [range 28-49] years). Patients exhibited a significantly higher rate of cerebral infarcts (20% versus 0%, p less than 0.05) and cortical (50% versus 5%, p less than 0.01) and ventricular (55% versus 15%, p less than 0.02) atrophy than controls. Accordingly, semiquantitative volumetric measurements yielded a significantly increased ventricular-to-intracranial cavity ratio in the patients (6.2 +/- 2.9% versus 4.1 +/- 1.3%, p less than 0.01). This ratio and the cortical atrophy ratings correlated positively with disease duration (r = 0.63 and 0.54, p less than 0.05). Cognitive test performance was significantly worse in patients than in controls and was most impaired in those patients with morphologic cerebral abnormalities. 
2	Chronic functional gastrointestinal symptoms in Holocaust survivors. In Nazi-occupied Europe (1939-1945), Jews were submitted to extreme mental and physical hardships (the Holocaust). This study was designed to investigate the impact of the severe protracted suffering on the development of chronic functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Thus, we studied 623 consecutive patients of Eastern European origin who had been admitted for nongastrointestinal complaints. They filled out detailed questionnaires, and were divided into the following two groups: A) Holocaust survivors [237 subjects who had been for at least 6 months in either German concentration/extermination camps (95 subjects), ghetto and/or underground movements (65 subjects), labor camps not directly supervised by Germans (79 subjects)], and B) a control group (384 subjects from the same demographic background, who had not been exposed to Nazi persecutions). The symptoms investigated were the following: abdominal pain, irregular bowel habits, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal distension, heartburn, flatulence, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, mucus in stool, tenesmus, and aerophagia. Patients were defined as having functional symptoms after these had been present for at least 5 yr and relevant organic disease had been excluded. The prevalence, duration of suffering, and frequency of appearance of most symptoms were significantly higher in the group of Holocaust survivors. This study supports the clinical observations that severe and protracted suffering contributes to the development of chronic functional gastrointestinal symptomatology. 
1	Time to recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis after curative resection of adrenal tumors in patients with Cushing's syndrome. The recovery time of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis after curative resection of adrenal tumors in patients with Cushing's syndrome is poorly documented. Eight consecutive patients were treated with a standardized hydrocortisone replacement strategy after curative resection of a cortisol-secreting tumor and the time to recovery of the HPA axis was determined. Hypercortisolism was documented by elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. Cure was documented by undetectable postoperative morning serum cortisol levels. Each patient received replacement hydrocortisone after surgery and was reevaluated every 3 to 6 months with an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Each patient was also monitored carefully for symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency, which was defined as symptoms consistent with this diagnosis that responded to increases in hydrocortisone levels. After surgical resection, each patient was cured of hypercortisolism. Subsequently, despite replacement hydrocortisone, each patient had symptoms of hypocortisolism, and in four of eight patients the dose of hydrocortisone was increased to relieve the symptoms. Patients required a median time of 15 months (range, 9 to 22 months) to recover a normal ACTH stimulation test and 19 months (range, 12 to 24 months) to allow discontinuation of replacement doses of hydrocortisone. The results suggest that surgical resection of a cortisol-secreting adrenal tumor will result in rapid cure of hypercortisolism, but complete recovery of the HPA axis and discontinuation of replacement steroids will require between 1 and 2 years. Normal adrenal function, as assessed by the cortisol response to ACTH, returns despite replacement doses of hydrocortisone, and replacement doses of hydrocortisone can be tapered rapidly or discontinued after a normal ACTH stimulation test. 
5	Thermographic findings in cranio-facial pain. This work assesses the differences in the thermographic findings in the craniofacial and neck areas between normal individuals and patients with craniofacial pain or headache, and investigates the influence of muscle contraction on such findings. Thermographic records were taken in 10 healthy subjects and 47 patients suffering from craniofacial pain or headache of different kinds. In the patients with painful episodes the record was taken between attacks. In all the normal subjects and in 19 patients lateral thermograms were also taken during and after maximal tooth clenching for three minutes. The majority of the patients, as compared to the normal group, showed some thermal alterations and asymmetry. Such alterations seem to be due both to vascular instability and muscle contraction: these two factors may be variably superimposed in the different conditions. In patients with cluster headache or chronic paroxysmal hemicrania the presence on the symptomatic side of a cold spot along the supraorbital area and/or the inner orbital canthus, was a constant finding. We conclude that thermography is useful as an additional diagnostic means in patients with head and face pain, and that the clenching test may increase the amount of information provided. 
5	Molecular analysis of acute promyelocytic leukemia breakpoint cluster region on chromosome 17. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; FAB M3) is characterized by a predominance of malignant promyelocytes that carry a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17, t(15;17) (q22;q11.2-q12). This translocation has become diagnostic for APL, as it is present in almost 100 percent of cases. A Not I linking clone was used to detect this translocation initially on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and subsequently with conventional Southern (DNA) analysis. The breakpoints in ten APL cases examined were shown to cluster in a 12-kb region of chromosome 17, containing two CpG-rich islands. The region is the first intron of the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene (RARA). 
1	Management of superficial G2 (pTa and pT1) bladder cancer. A total of 143 patients with superficial G2 (pTa, pT1) bladder cancer (48 G2pTa; 95 G2pT1) presenting between 1970 through 1987 were reviewed. Of 48 patients with G2pTa followed for up to eighteen years, G3 recurrence developed only in 1 (2.0%), and invasive cancer (greater than pT2) developed only in 2 (4.2%). They both received radiotherapy and have responded completely. There have been no cancer-related deaths. In contrast, in the 95 patients in whom the basement membrane had been breached (pT1), higher grade tumor (G3) developed in 11 (11.5%), and 15 (16%) had recurrences with invasion of muscle (greater than pT2). Among these there were 7 (7.3%) cancer-related deaths. 
1	Contiguous enlarged dental follicles with histologic features resembling the WHO type of odontogenic fibroma Defective odontogenesis and/or retarded eruption of teeth can be associated with histologic features akin to odontogenic fibroma in the dental follicles. Unerupted mandibular premolar and molar teeth of a 24-year-old man were surgically exposed, yet the teeth failed to erupt. About a year and a half later, radiographs indicated further enlargement of the follicle of the premolar, and both teeth were subsequently surgically removed. Histologically, the follicles were composed of mature collagenous tissue among which epithelial islands and numerous clusters of calcified bodies were present. Indirect immunofluorescence showed positive staining for type I and type III collagen, which exhibited a sparse distribution, but not for the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen. The hamartomatous nature of the lesions is discussed with emphasis on their histologic resemblance to the WHO type of odontogenic fibroma. 
2	Association of hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody with acquisition and manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. We examined the associations between seropositivity for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with the presence or development of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and with HIV-1 induced T-helper lymphocyte deficiency or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Serologic data on HBV and HIV-1, cytometric enumeration of CD4+ lymphocytes, clinical events (AIDS by Centers for Disease Control criteria) and hepatitis B vaccination histories were available on 4,498 homosexual participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, Men were classified as to previous infection with HBV and prevalent or incident infection with HIV-1. Although there was an association between seropositivity for HBV infection and HIV-1 infection at enrollment (odds ratios anti-HBc 2.6; HBsAg 4.2), the relation between HBV seropositivity and subsequent seroconversion to HIV-1 was weaker (odds ratios 1.3 and 1.6). HIV-1 seroconversion was also associated with a history of certain other sexually transmitted diseases, but predisposing sexual practices did not account for the association between HBV and HIV-1 infection. Seropositivity for HBV infection at entry was not related to initially low or more rapid subsequent decline in T-helper lymphocyte counts and was not associated with an increased incidence of AIDS during 2.5 years of follow-up. History of vaccination against HBV did not appear to decrease susceptibility to HIV-1 infection or to subsequent progression of immunodeficiency. We conclude that prior HBV infection is unlikely to be specifically associated with acquisition of HIV-1 infection and is unrelated to more rapid progression of HIV-1-induced immunodeficiency. 
5	Prognostic factors in craniofacial surgery. From 1979 to 1989, 21 patients underwent craniofacial resection for malignancies involving the anterior skull base. Histologic types included 8 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 chondrosarcomas, 2 melanomas, 2 basal cell carcinomas, 2 adenocarcinomas, 2 poorly differentiated carcinomas, 1 malignant schwannoma, and 1 malignant hemangiopericytoma. Survival was 57%, with follow-up of 41 months. A 50% complication rate included osteomyelitis, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, meningitis, brain abscess, epidural abscess, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. Recurrent disease occurred in 9 patients (41%), the most reliable predictor being dural invasion indicated preoperatively by CT scan or at operation. Patients demonstrating dural involvement (N = 9) had a 22% survival rate, while patients without (N = 12) had a survival rate of 83%. The impact of dural invasion on long-term survival is emphasized. Though complications were frequent, long-term results were favorable. 
1	Introduction: nutritional aspects of palm oil. The production, composition, and food uses of palm oil are outlined in this introduction to a detailed appraisal of the nutritional and health implications of the use of palm oil in the food supply. The putative role of dietary fats and oils in general, and of palm oil in particular, in the etiology of coronary heart disease and cancer is critically assessed. It is concluded that the evidence available is difficult to interpret unambiguously. Some evidence to suggest that the minor components of palm oil might have useful biological effects is also discussed. 
1	NB4, a maturation inducible cell line with t(15;17) marker isolated from a human acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3). Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a well-defined entity among acute leukemia, cytogenetically characterized by a t(15;17) (q22;q11-12) translocation. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that all-trans retinoic acid (RA) treatment restores cell maturation. We have isolated the first permanent cell line with t(15;17), derived from the marrow of a patient with APL in relapse. The establishment of the cell line, its morphologic, karyotypic, and immunohistochemical features are reported. RA induced cell line maturation. Cells strongly expressed myeloid markers, but also some T-cell markers. Additional karyotypic abnormalities, a 12p rearrangement and the possible presence of a homogeneous staining region (HSR) on 19q+ are discussed both in relation to T-cell (CD2, CD4) and monocyte (CD9) markers, and to the acquired cell growth autonomy. The cell line represents a remarkable tool for biomolecular studies. 
2	Chemical peritonitis secondary to intraperitoneal vancomycin. Although previously reported in the literature, the existence of chemical peritonitis due to vancomycin in patients on peritoneal dialysis remains controversial. We report four similar episodes of sterile peritonitis in three patients receiving intraperitoneal (IP) vancomycin. The prior report implicated a change in the brand of vancomycin preparation, from Vancocin to Vancoled, as a contributing factor. We noted the occurrence of such episodes following a switch from Vancocin to a generic preparation from Abbott Laboratories. High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) profiles of the three preparations show Vancocin to have a lower level of impurities than the other two; the presence of certain contaminants in the other brands may be contributing to the clinical difference observed. We conclude that chemical peritonitis due to IP vancomycin administration does occur, and that increased awareness of this entity could allow other cases to be identified. 
1	Interferon-alpha produces sustained cytogenetic responses in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the frequency and the course of complete cytogenetic responses in interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha)-treated patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. DESIGN: Two prospective trials in consecutive patients. SETTING: A major tertiary cancer center. PATIENTS: Ninety-six consecutive patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia with disease duration of less than 1 year. INTERVENTION: Patients received partially pure IFN-alpha intramuscularly, from 3 to 9 million U/d (51 patients) or recombinant IFN-alpha 2a (Roferon, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., Nutley, New Jersey), 5 million U/m2 body surface area daily (45 patients). MEASUREMENTS: Hematologic and cytogenetic tests were administered. MAIN RESULTS: Seventy of the patients (73%) achieved hematologic remission (95% CI, 63% to 81%), and 18 (19%) had complete suppression of the Philadelphia chromosome on at least one cytogenetic test. A complete cytogenetic response was induced in 7 of 51 or 14% (CI, 6% to 26%) of the patients treated with the partially pure IFN-alpha and in 11 of 45 or 24% (CI, 13% to 40%) of the patients treated with recombinant IFN-alpha 2a. The difference in complete cytogenetic response between the two groups was 10.7% (CI, - 5% to 26%; P greater than 0.2). Eleven patients had durable, ongoing, complete cytogenetic responses from 6 to more than 45 months (median, more than 30 months). CONCLUSION: This study was the first to show sustained, complete cytogenetic responses in a subset of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with single-agent therapy. The nature of this remission, that is, whether it depends on continuous therapy, requires further study. 
3	Impact of day care on dementia patients--costs, well-being and relatives' views. Forty-seven patients in psychogeriatric day centre were analysed regarding use of resources, costs and well-being. The level of well-being was based on interviews with staff and relatives and related to the economic outcome--a cost utility analysis. A 6 month period prior to day care was compared with the first 6 months in such care. The use of resources at home increased by 20% while the use of institutional care was reduced by 22%. Fifty-three percent of the patients improved in their well-being after participation in day care. When the cost of utility analysis was applied, the cost for a well-year was 4293 pounds. 
1	Acute renal dysfunction during interleukin-2 treatment: suggestion of an intrinsic renal lesion. Adoptive immunotherapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells has been effective in treating some advanced malignancies in animals and humans. One complication of this treatment is a reversible, oliguric, acute renal failure, which has been ascribed to renal hypoperfusion and resultant prerenal azotemia. We serially studied renal function in 10 patients receiving high-dose regimens of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) to attempt to delineate further the nature of the renal dysfunction caused by IL-2 treatment. Renal plasma flow was computed from iodine 131 (I-131 Hippuran; Mediphysics, Paramus, NJ) orthoiodohippurate, excretion curves, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined by creatinine clearance. Studies done prior to and on day 4 of treatment showed that GFR fell in nine of 10 patients, with a mean decrease of 43% +/- 8%, and renal plasma flow fell in five of the 10 patients with a mean decrease of 5% +/- 10%. The average pretherapy filtration fraction was calculated to be 23% +/- 1% and after 4 days of treatment, decreased to a mean value of 15 +/- 2%. The BUN to creatinine ratio also declined in all patients. These findings collectively suggest that IL-2 nephrotoxicity may result from an intrarenal defect in addition to the previously described prerenal azotemia. Additionally, radionuclide studies of renal function are a reliable and reproducible noninvasive method of assessing these changes in renal function. 
5	Heart rate variability before and after myocardial infarction in conscious dogs at high and low risk of sudden death. Heart rate variability has been demonstrated both experimentally and clinically to be of prognostic importance in determining mortality after myocardial infarction. However, no paired studies have been reported to examine heart rate variability before and after myocardial infarction. The hypothesis was tested that low values of heart rate variability provided risk assessment both before and after myocardial infarction with use of an established canine model of sudden cardiac death. Risk for sudden death was assessed 1 month after myocardial infarction by a protocol in which exercise and myocardial ischemia were combined; dogs that developed ventricular fibrillation were classified at high risk for sudden death (susceptible) and the survivors were considered low risk (resistant). In resistant dogs, myocardial infarction did not affect any measure of heart rate variability: 1) mean RR interval, 2) standard deviation of the mean RR interval, and 3) the coefficient of variance (standard deviation/RR interval). By contrast, after myocardial infarction, susceptible dogs showed significant decrease in all measures of heart rate variability. Before myocardial infarction, no differences were seen between susceptible and resistant dogs. However, 30 days after infarction, epidemiologic analysis of the coefficient of variance showed high sensitivity and specificity (88% and 80%, respectively), predicting susceptibility. Therefore, results of analysis of 30 min of beat to beat heart period at rest 30 days after myocardial infarction are highly predictive for increased risk of sudden death. 
5	Multiple organ failure: inflammatory priming and activation sequences promote autologous tissue injury. Systemic inflammation promotes multiple organ failure through the induction of diffuse microvascular leak. Inflammatory cells such as neutrophils propagate this process. Tissue injury by neutrophils may be viewed as a normal process, inflammation, that has become uncontrolled and generalized. Multiple inflammatory stimuli synergistically promote neutrophil-mediated tissue injury in priming and activation sequences. In some settings, cellular priming is mediated by platelet-activating factor and can be prevented by platelet-activating factor antagonists. Inhibiting cellular priming could be efficacious in the therapy of multiple organ failure. 
5	Endoscopic management of postoperative biliary leaks: review of 77 cases and report of two cases with biloma formation. Biliary leaks are uncommon complications of abdominal surgery. Left untreated, they may result in significant morbidity and mortality. The traditional treatment has been surgical, but several authors have reported successful endoscopic management. We review 77 cases of endoscopically managed postoperative biliary leaks reported in the literature over the past 15 yr. Endoscopic treatment was technically successful in 95% of cases, and resulted in biliary leak healing in 82%. Cystic stump leaks had a better prognosis for healing compared with common bile duct or hepatic duct leaks. We also present two additional cases of postoperative biliary leaks with biloma formation successfully treated with endoscopic stent placement. Our experience lends additional support to endoscopic management as the preferred approach to postoperative biliary leaks. 
1	The association of selected cancers with service in the US military in Vietnam. III. Hodgkin's disease, nasal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, and primary liver cancer. The Selected Cancers Cooperative Study Group As part of a series of investigations into the health of Vietnam veterans, we conducted case-control studies involving 310 men with Hodgkin's disease, 48 with nasal carcinoma, 80 with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 130 with primary liver cancer, and 1776 controls between 1984 and 1988. All men born between 1929 and 1953 and diagnosed in an area covered by eight cancer registries were considered eligible as cases; controls were recruited by random-digit dialing. Whereas the study had excellent power (96%) to detect a twofold increase in risk for Hodgkin's disease among Vietnam veterans, its ability to detect a similarly elevated risk in the other cancers was limited, ranging from 38% (nasal carcinoma) to 75% (primary liver cancer). Analyses showed that risks among Vietnam veterans relative to other men were 1.1 (Hodgkin's disease), 0.7 (nasal carcinoma), 0.5 (nasopharyngeal carcinoma), and 1.2 (primary liver cancer). None of these relative risks was significantly different from 1.0. Similar results were obtained if Vietnam veterans were compared with (1) other veterans or (2) men who never served in the military. An examination of several attributes of military service in Vietnam (eg, branch, duration of service, and other characteristics that may have been associated with the use of Agent Orange) failed to identify any groups of veterans who were at increased risk for Hodgkin's disease. Small numbers limited further analyses of nasal, nasopharyngeal, and liver cancer. These results provide no evidence that, 15 to 25 years following service in Vietnam, the risk of these malignant neoplasms is higher among veterans. 
1	Elevated serum bromide concentrations following repeated halothane anaesthesia in a child. A 20-month-old child received 25 brief halothane general anaesthetics over a five-week period to allow cranial irradiation treatments for a posterior fossa ependymoma. Personality change during the last week of the treatment protocol raised the question of possible bromide intoxication. Serum bromide concentrations, using a gold chloride assay technique, were monitored at that time, and at four- and six-week intervals thereafter. Serum bromide concentrations demonstrated a four-fold change during this period ranging from peak levels of 2.2 mEq.L-1 (176 micrograms.kg-1) during the fifth week of treatment decreasing to less than 0.5 mEq.L-1 (less than 40 micrograms.ml-1) six weeks following the end of treatments. This demonstrates the possibility for repetitive, short halothane exposures to result in elevations of serum bromide and the potential of bromide intoxication in paediatric neuro-oncology patients. 
5	Acute psychosis. Functional versus organic. Acute psychosis is a true emergency and is a manifestation of multiple organic and functional disorders. The emergency medicine physician's role in dealing with the acutely psychotic patient is to control the patient's behavior, to delineate the etiology of the psychosis, and to provide appropriate initial treatment and disposition. When making initial contact with the psychotic patient, behavioral control can be accomplished through supportive, physical, or pharmacologic interventions. Judicious use of rapid tranquilization permits rapid control of these patients when supportive and other nonpharmacologic therapies fail. Initial examination is directed at identifying immediate life-threatening organic disorders and promptly treating them. Historical data, mental status examination, physical examination, and appropriate radiologic and laboratory investigations give information that assist in delineating functional from organic psychosis. Most acute organic psychoses, with the exception of some drug intoxications that clear in the Emergency Department, require medical or surgical admission. Acute functional psychotic patients who are a danger to themselves or others, who are without a reliable social support system, or who present with their first psychotic episode require admission to the psychiatric service for further evaluation and treatment. 
2	Rectal mucosal dysplasia in Crohn's disease. Serial sections of 812 rectal biopsy specimens from 356 Crohn's disease patients were analysed for mucosal epithelial dysplasia. Dysplasia was found in 18 patients (5%), with four showing dysplasia on repeat biopsy specimen. In these 22 biopsy specimens the dysplasia was mild in 13, moderate in nine, and severe in none. Subsequently, three patients (17%) developed neoplasms including carcinoma in two and an adenomatous polyp in one. In colectomy specimens which showed dysplasia, significantly more dysplastic changes were found in seven patients who underwent colonic resection than in 10 others who underwent operation but had no prior dysplasia (p less than 0.001). Thirteen patients still have their rectum in situ and remain at risk of developing colonic cancer. Four carcinomas developed in patients with Crohn's disease who did not have dysplasia on rectal biopsy specimen. 
1	Cisplatin-fluorouracil interaction in a squamous cell carcinoma xenograft. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck are treated with cisplatin and fluorouracil according to a schedule based on the findings of clinical studies. A similar schedule showed a supra-additive effect in the treatment of xenografted human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We sought to ascertain whether this schedule was optimal. A single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg) was combined with three injections of fluorouracil given during a 24-hour period (total dose, 150 or 80 mg/kg) before, during, or after cisplatin administration. The combined effect of cisplatin and fluorouracil on tumor growth and toxic effects was schedule dependent. Consideration of both toxic effects and tumor growth inhibition, as assessed by reduction of the area under the growth curve, the optimal administration interval was found to be fluorouracil given 3 days after cisplatin administration. 
5	Rounded atelectasis complicated by obstructive pneumonia and pulmonary arterial thrombosis [published erratum appears in Chest 1991 Jun;99(6):1556] A patient with a history of asbestos exposure developed rounded atelectasis. The mass was associated with local bronchial obstruction, obstructive pneumonia and arterial thrombosis. Autopsy demonstrated marked pleural thickening and radiographically inapparent asbestosis. This is the first reported case in which seemingly benign rounded atelectasis not only increased morbidity, but also contributed to mortality through airway obstruction and local arterial thrombosis. 
3	Treatment of patients with aortic dissection presenting with peripheral vascular complications. The incidence of peripheral vascular complications in 272 patients with aortic dissection during a 25-year span was determined, as was outcome after a uniform, aggressive surgical approach directed at repair of the thoracic aorta. One hundred twenty-eight patients (47%) presented with acute type A dissection, 70 (26%) with chronic type A, 40 (15%) with acute type B, and 34 (12%) with chronic type B dissections. Eighty-five patients (31%) sustained one or more peripheral vascular complications: Seven (3%) had a stroke, nine (3%) had paraplegia, 66 (24%) sustained loss of a peripheral pulse, 22 (8%) had impaired renal perfusion, and 14 patients (5%) had compromised visceral perfusion. Following repair of the thoracic aorta, local peripheral vascular procedures were unnecessary in 92% of patients who presented with absence of a peripheral pulse. The operative mortality rate for all patients was 25% +/- 3% (68 of 272 patients). For the subsets of individuals with paraplegia, loss of renal perfusion, and compromised visceral perfusion, the operative mortality rates (+/- 70% confidence limits) were high: 44% +/- 17% (4 of 9 patients), 50% +/- 11% (11 of 22 patients), and 43% +/- 14% (6 of 14 patients), respectively. The mortality rates were lower for patients presenting with stroke (14% +/- 14% [1 of 7 patients]) or loss of peripheral pulse (27% +/- 6% [18 of 66 patients]). Multivariate analysis revealed that impaired renal perfusion was the only peripheral vascular complication that was a significant independent predictor of increased operative mortality risk (p = 0.024); earlier surgical referral (replacement of the appropriate section of the thoracic aorta) or more expeditious diagnosis followed by surgical renal artery revascularization after a thoracic procedure may represent the only way to improve outcome in this high-risk patient subset. Early, aggressive thoracic aortic repair (followed by aortic fenestration and/or abdominal exploration with or without direct visceral or renal vascular reconstruction when necessary) can save some patients with compromised visceral perfusion; however, once visceral infarction develops the prognosis is also poor. Increased awareness of these devastating complications of aortic dissection and the availability of better diagnostic tools today may improve the survival rate for these patients in the future. The initial surgical procedure should include repair of the thoracic aorta in most patients. 
5	Diagnostic value of DNA analysis in effusions by flow cytometry and image analysis. A prospective study on 102 patients as compared with cytologic examination One hundred twenty-six effusion samples from 102 patients were examined by cytology and flow cytometry (FCM). Overall, there was an 84% correlation between cytologic and FCM results. Of the 36 malignant cases determined by cytologic examination, FCM revealed an aneuploid peak in 20 (56%). Image analysis (IA) performed on the malignant cytologic cases with a diploid flow pattern detected two additional aneuploid peaks. In addition, FCM indicated three aneuploid cases in which cytologic characteristics were initially interpreted as benign (false negative). Aneuploidy was therefore detected in 64% of the malignant effusion specimens by FCM and IA. Twenty-three of the total of 24 aneuploid cases detected by FCM were associated with malignancy (predictive value = 96%). The one nonmalignant case was that of hemorrhagic pancreatitis with infected pseudocyst. FCM is an excellent tool when moderate to large numbers of tumor cells are present, whereas use of IA is advantageous for specimens containing smaller numbers of malignant cells because these can be directly analyzed. When an aneuploid peak is present, a diagnosis of malignancy must be suspected, and, if the initial cytologic screen is negative, a critical review of the cytology slides is justified. In those cases with an equivocal atypical cytology report and an abnormal cytometric histogram, additional investigation is warranted. In some malignancies the tumor cells will be diploid (in this study 36%) and neither FCM nor IA will add to tumor detection, leaving cytologic examination as the definitive technique. 
1	Staging and follow-up of breast cancer patients. Staging systems for breast cancer, unlike those of neoplasms in distant or recessed sites, allowed for the early development of clinical staging evaluation. It was established that clinical assessment of the breast lesion was often wrong compared with the pathologic examination (benign vs. malignant); clinical measurement of the tumor in centimeters was often larger than histologic size; and clinical assessment of axillary nodes (clear or metastatic) was incorrect in about 30% of cases. Although both clinical and pathologic staging provide effective discriminants for prognosis of treated patients, prognosis is more accurately determined by the pathologic stage. The single most important prognostic indicator is the axillary nodal status, and when positive, the number of positive nodes. The American Joint Committee on Cancer and the Union International Contra Cancer have agreed on a TNM staging for breast carcinoma, and this is the preferable staging system. Follow-up of treated patients is of most value in detecting local recurrence on the chest wall (after mastectomy) or in the irradiated breast (after lumpectomy), and also in early detection of contralateral breast cancer. Physical examination and periodic mammography are most useful. There is a tendency to overinvestigate asymptomatic patients (with bone scans, blood tests, etc.), but this has been correctly criticized in recent years. 
2	Isolated lipase and colipase deficiency in two brothers. Two brothers of Arab origin, aged 15 and 10 years, with isolated congenital lipase and colipase deficiency are described. Both were normally developed with a history of passing greasy stools since early infancy. Both have remarkable steatorrhoea and low serum carotene and vitamin E concentrations. After exocrine pancreatic stimulation, lipase and colipase activities in the duodenal fluid were almost completely absent, while amylase trypsin, bile salt, and pH values were normal. No other aetiology for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was found. This is the first report of congenital combined lipase and colipase deficiency in two brothers. 
3	Anaesthetic management of the brain dead for organ donation. An increasing number of anaesthetists is being called upon to manage organ donors during organ retrieval procedures. We briefly describe the technical aspects of the surgical procedure together with a guide to the anaesthetic management. The aims of the latter may be summarized as the "Rule of 100": systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg, urine output greater than 100 ml.hr-1, PaO2 greater than 100 mmHg, haemoglobin concentration greater than 100 g.L-1. Common management problems (hypotension, arrhythmias, diabetes insipidus, oliguria, and coagulopathy) are discussed in detail. The intraoperative management of the brain-dead organ donor provides the anaesthetist with the challenge of a major surgical procedure in a subject with important physiological derangements. 
5	Relationship between histologic features, DNA flow cytometry, and clinical behavior of squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content was done on 133 primary squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Overall, 76 tumors (57.1%) were not diploid (aneuploid or tetraploid). The DNA index (DI) was calculated and grouped into three levels. Fifty-seven cases had a DI in a range of 1.85 to 2.15 (44 diploid and 13 tetraploid). The cases were grouped in relation to ploidy, proliferative index, and the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system. Every group was analyzed with respect to survival rate. Ploidy was related to histocytologic grade. In well-differentiated tumors (G1) survival rates at 48 months were 41.7% in diploid cases and 27.7% in nondiploid ones (relative risk [RR], 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89, 4.52). In NO cases that underwent surgery, survival rates at 48 months were, respectively, 81.8% and 49.2% (RR, 5.07; 95% CI, 0.76, 33.93). These results suggest that ploidy may be a new independent parameter of prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. This is useful in clinical practice because it allows the clinician to recognize those cases with poorer prognosis among the early tumors at a stage where other prognostic parameters are not yet available. 
1	Reconstitution of high-affinity opioid agonist binding in brain membranes. In synaptosomal membranes from rat brain cortex, the mu selective agonist [3H]dihydromorphine in the absence of sodium, and the nonselective antagonist [3H]naltrexone in the presence of sodium, bound to two populations of opioid receptor sites with Kd values of 0.69 and 8.7 nM for dihydromorphine, and 0.34 and 5.5 nM for naltrexone. The addition of 5 microM guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]) strongly reduced high-affinity agonist but not antagonist binding. Exposure of the membranes to high pH reduced the number of GTP[gamma-35S] binding sites by 90% and low Km, opioid-sensitive GTPase activity by 95%. In these membranes, high-affinity agonist binding was abolished and modulation of residual binding by GTP[gamma S] was diminished. High-affinity (Kd, 0.72 nM), guanine nucleotide-sensitive agonist binding was reconstituted by polyethylene glycol-induced fusion of the alkali-treated membranes with (opioid receptor devoid) C6 glioma cell membranes. Also restored was opioid agonist-stimulated, naltrexone-inhibited GTPase activity. In contrast, antagonist binding in the fused membranes was unaltered. Alkali treatment of the glioma cell membranes prior to fusion inhibited most of the low Km GTPase activity and prevented the reconstitution of agonist binding. The results show that high-affinity opioid agonist binding reflects the ligand-occupied receptor-guanine nucleotide binding protein complex. 
4	Transient myocardial ischemia and its relation to determinants of myocardial oxygen demand. Because of conflicting data and a clear need to establish the relative role of increase in myocardial oxygen demand versus reduction in coronary blood flow in the causation of transient ischemia, the role of heart rate and blood pressure changes immediately preceding and during the transient ischemic events observed during daily life were evaluated in 25 patients with coronary artery disease. Elevations in heart rate before onset of ischemia were observed in 61% of the episodes. Similarly, 73% of the ischemic events were preceded by an increase in arterial pressure. These data provide evidence for a significant role of increased myocardial oxygen demand in the genesis of transient myocardial ischemia. 
5	Denervation in hemiplegic muscles. This study examined the frequency of denervation activity in hemiplegic muscles in relation to the size and location of the central lesion. We studied 20 patients, 14 with major unilateral cerebral infarctions in the middle cerebral or internal carotid territories; four with a single lacune in the pons, internal capsule, or thalamus; and two with precentral infarcts. Using somatosensory evoked potentials, motor conduction studies, and assessments of conduction across the plexus and roots, we detected no conduction abnormalities on the affected side. Fibrillation was common in both groups, especially in distal and intermediate muscles. The distribution of the fibrillation and the normal conduction studies suggested that trauma of peripheral nerves was not a factor. Although the normal conduction studies and pattern of fibrillation activity do not exclude peripheral nerve trauma as the cause of the fibrillation, we suggest that transsynaptic degeneration is a reasonable alternative explanation. 
1	Molecular pathologic study of human papillomavirus infection in inverted papilloma and squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses. Nasal inverted papilloma is a rare benign tumor occasionally associated with squamous cell carcinoma. To determine the etiological role of human papillomavirus in inverted papilloma, and to clarify the relationship between human papillomavirus and malignant transformation of this benign tumor, we retrospectively analyzed inverted papillomas from 26 patients, 7 of whom had squamous cell carcinoma. We used an immunohistochemical method and molecular pathologic techniques, or dot-blot hybridization of DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction. Human papillomavirus was detected in 5 of 26 patients (19%), 3 patients with human papillomavirus 11 and 2 patients with human papillomavirus 16. The latter 2 patients had inverted papillomas associated with squamous cell carcinoma. We speculate that human papillomavirus may be related to the malignant transformation of inverted papillomas. 
3	Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: life-threatening complication of neuroleptic treatment in adolescents with affective disorder. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an uncommon, potentially fatal side effect of neuroleptic treatment characterized by hyperthermia, rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, and delirium. In recent clinical studies of adults it was suggested that affective disorder is a risk factor for the development of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The cases of two adolescents with neuroleptic malignant syndrome who were treated with neuroleptic therapy because of psychotic symptoms in association with primary affective disorders are reported. The occurrence of these cases, as well as the observations in adults, suggests that attention to the primary psychiatric diagnosis is important in neuroleptic usage and that physicians should be vigilant to the occurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in the pediatric population. 
4	Essential thrombocythemia in young adults. Essential thrombocythemia is typically a disorder of adults in the sixth or seventh decade of life and is characterized by frequent thrombohemorrhagic complications. In young patients, the optimal management of complications is controversial. We studied 56 young adults (33 female and 23 male patients) with a diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. The mean duration of follow-up was 4.68 years. The mean platelet count at diagnosis was 1,328,000/mm3. Platelet aggregation studies in 21 patients demonstrated hypoaggregation to epinephrine; spontaneous platelet aggregation was present in 4. At diagnosis, 39 patients were asymptomatic, and thrombocytosis was discovered incidentally. Throughout follow-up (up to 20 years), 24 patients remained asymptomatic. Thrombotic complications developed in 24 patients; they were life-threatening in only 3. The most common vaso-occlusive symptoms were migraine headache (in 12 patients) and erythromelalgia (in 3). Minor hemorrhagic complications occurred in six patients, and none was life-threatening. Serious complications (one cerebral and two myocardial infarctions) occurred in three patients, all of whom recovered. Two deaths occurred, neither of which was attributable to essential thrombocythemia. The treatment regimens used were chemotherapy in 9 patients, antiaggregating agents in 7, radioactive phosphorus in 1, the newer platelet-lowering agent anagrelide in 10, and only observation in 29. No treatment-related acute leukemias developed. This series of young patients with essential thrombocythemia, the largest to date, demonstrates a low incidence of life-threatening complications and a favorable long-term prognosis. Therapeutic recommendations should remain conservative, and potential leukemogens should be avoided unless serious complications develop. Anagrelide may be useful in young patients with thrombocythemia who are symptomatic. 
2	Hepatic portal venous gas: an unusual presentation of Crohn's disease. Hepatic portal venous gas is associated with numerous conditions and traditionally has been regarded as an ominous prognostic sign. There are several reports of hepatic portal venous gas occurring in patients with inflammatory bowel disease after or during the performance of colonic diagnostic studies. We report an unusual case of Crohn's disease whose initial presentation included hepatic portal venous gas. The literature of hepatic portal venous gas associated with inflammatory bowel disease is reviewed. 
5	Acute renal failure in obstructive jaundice in cholangiocarcinoma. This study was aimed at defining the natural history of renal failure in obstructive jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma, which is an important health problem in northeastern Thailand. Sixty-four patients among a total of 130 patients with obstructive jaundice secondary to cholangiocarcinoma who developed acute renal failure were studied retrospectively. Analysis was made with respect to clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcome. The development of renal failure before surgery was observed in all patients. It was nonoliguric in 80% and was associated with severe jaundice, gram-negative infection (42%), hypotension (31%), hypoproteinemia (30%), hyponatremia (56%), and hypokalemia (63%). The mean duration of renal failure was 2 weeks. All patients underwent surgery for the relief of jaundice. Seventy-seven percent of the patients survived and had recovery of renal function after the relief of jaundice. Twenty-three percent of the patients died of infection. Clinical data highlight the higher serum bilirubin levels and the frequent occurrence of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypotension in renal failure. Their possible roles in contributing to the development of renal failure are discussed. 
5	A biphasic pattern of anti-pre-S responses in acute hepatitis B virus infection. The clinical relevance of the immune response to the translation products of the pre-S1 and pre-S2 regions of hepatitis B virus was examined by testing sequential serum samples from 17 patients with acute self-limited hepatitis B and from two patients in whom chronic liver disease developed. Anti-pre-S antibodies were determined by enzyme immunoassays based on the inhibition of binding of monoclonal antibodies to epitopes in the pre-S1 and pre-S2 sequence. In acute, self-limited infection, anti-pre-S antibodies appeared in a biphasic pattern. The early antibodies were detected at the time of clinical signs of acute disease when HBsAg and often HBeAg were present, but hepatitis B virus DNA was no longer detectable in serum. Anti-pre-S levels then fell, but subsequently reappeared as the late antibody during the recovery phase, after development of anti-HBe, but before anti-HBs. Anti-pre-S responses were detected in 15 of 17 patients who recovered (88.2%) and in both patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection evolving to chronic liver disease. Although the early antibodies to pre-S1 and pre-S2 proteins appeared at the time of decreasing levels of infectious virus in serum in cases of self-limited infection, these antibodies also were transiently or continuously present with high levels of serum hepatitis B virus DNA in patients in whom chronic hepatitis B infection developed. Thus the anti-pre-S response in acute hepatitis is not a prognostic marker for clinical resolution. 
1	Chemotherapy for children with aggressive fibromatosis and Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. Two disorders involving histologically benign proliferations of fibrous tissue or of histiocytes occur preferentially in children and often require combined management by an orthopedic surgeon and a pediatric oncologist. Treatment of young people with aggressive fibromatosis usually begins with wide local excision of the lesion. However, some tumors cannot be completely removed either because of their location or because of the risk of subsequent serious dysfunction. Not infrequently, local recurrence supervenes despite previous wide local excision, and sometimes multiple tumors are present. In these situations a trial of multiple-agent chemotherapy incorporating vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide may be indicated in an attempt to control the disease. Radiation therapy may also be useful, but the relatively high dose (5000 cGy or more) needed in a growing child is at times a less attractive alternative. Biopsy of a lytic bone lesion in young patients with Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, formerly known as histiocytosis X, is also indicated for initial diagnosis. Biopsy and curettage are usually curative in the patient with an isolated lesion. Patients with multiple simultaneous or recurrent lesions need chemotherapy if dysfunction of the liver, spleen, or lungs is present. Drug therapy may also be beneficial for children with systemic symptoms. This article outlines suggestions for chemotherapeutic treatment in both diseases. 
2	Esophageal 24-h pH monitoring: is prior manometry necessary for correct positioning of the electrode? In 24-h esophageal pH monitoring, the electrode is usually positioned 5 cm above the manometrically localized esophagogastric junction. In order to replace esophageal manometry for this purpose, we tested whether the esophagogastric junction can be identified correctly by fluoroscopy or the determination of the pH-step between stomach and esophagus, compared with esophageal manometry. The distance from the nares to the esophagogastric junction was determined three times with each of the three methods in 46 patients and 14 volunteers. Fluoroscopy assumed the esophagogastric junction 1.23 +/- 0.23 cm (mean +/- SE) lower than the peak pressure point determined at manometry, pH-step only 0.45 +/- 0.16 cm. With pH-step, only one subject had a difference of more than 3 cm to the manometrically defined esophagogastric junction, whether gastroesophageal reflux disease (as proven by pH monitoring) was present or not. We conclude that the esophagogastric junction can usually be identified with sufficient accuracy by the measurement of the pH-step between stomach and esophagus. Fluoroscopy is far less accurate than pH-step, and should not be used. 
1	A novel metalloproteinase gene specifically expressed in stromal cells of breast carcinomas. A gene has been identified that is expressed specifically in stromal cells surrounding invasive breast carcinomas. On the basis of its sequence, the product of this gene, named stromelysin-3, is a new member of the family of metalloproteinase enzymes which degrade the extracellular matrix. The suggestion is that stromelysin-3 is one of the stroma-derived factors that have long been postulated to play an important part in progression of epithelial malignancies. 
4	Cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma. We report the cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma, using a retrospective review of 115 patients' records obtained from tumor registry files. Five patients were found to have biopsy-proved extramedullary plasmacytomas without extension from an underlying bony focus. Twelve patients had ecchymoses without thrombocytopenia; two of them had biopsy-proved amyloidosis. One patient presented with pyoderma gangrenosum and was subsequently diagnosed with multiple myeloma. The last patient initially presented with what clinically appeared to be leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and, in the course of a standard workup, he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. These findings are discussed with regard to the current literature on the cutaneous manifestations of multiple myeloma. 
5	Kupffer cell activation and endothelial cell damage after storage of rat livers: effects of reperfusion. Reperfusion injury characterized by loss of endothelial cell viability occurs after cold ischemic storage of livers for transplantation surgery. Here, ultrastructural changes in stored rat livers were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. With increasing times of storage in Euro-Collins solution (4 to 24 hr) followed by 15 min of reperfusion at 37 degrees C, a sequence of structural alterations was observed involving endothelial and Kupffer cells. Widening of endothelial fenestrations occurred after 4 hr and progressed over 8 to 24 hr to retraction of cellular processes, ball-like rounding, sinusoidal denudation and ultrastructural derangements consistent with loss of cell viability. Kupffer cells exhibited progressive rounding, ruffling of the cell surface, polarization, appearance of wormlike densities, vacuolization and degranulation over a similar time course. By contrast, the structures of parenchymal and fat-storing cells were relatively undisturbed by cold storage and reperfusion. Alterations to endothelial and Kupffer cells were also studied as a function of time of reperfusion. After 24 hr of storage, endothelial cells showed retraction of cytoplasm before reperfusion that progressed quickly to loss of viability and denudation during reperfusion. Kupffer cell activation (ruffling, degranulation) during reperfusion was slower and occurred after deterioration of endothelial cells. Livers stored in Euro-Collins solution were also compared with livers stored in University of Wisconsin cold storage solution, an improved preservation medium for transplantation. University of Wisconsin solution provided better preservation of endothelial structure and markedly reduced parenchymal cell blebbing and swelling before reperfusion. University of Wisconsin solution also reduced Kupffer cell activation and release of lysosomal enzymes. In conclusion, endothelial cell deterioration followed by Kupffer cell activation occurred after increasing times of cold ischemic storage and reperfusion of rat livers. Both changes may contribute to the pathophysiology of graft failure caused by reperfusion-mediated storage injury. 
5	Infections of the clavicle in children. Of 23 children with infections of the clavicle, 11 had pyogenic osteomyelitis, four had tuberculosis, and eight (infants) had congenital syphilis. Acute pyogenic infections were treated by drainage. Resection of the clavicle was performed in chronic cases. Curettage and antituberculosis drugs were effective for children with tuberculous infection of the clavicle. Procaine penicillin was used for the treatment of congenital syphilis. Biopsy is generally necessary to differentiate chronic infection from neoplasm. 
5	Anterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury following femoral artery reconstructive surgery. Two cases are presented exhibiting symptoms and signs of bilateral anterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury, clinically sparing femoral nerve branches to the saphenous nerve and quadriceps muscles. This occurred following surgical dissection in the femoral triangles associated with femoral artery reconstructive surgery. Anterior femoral cutaneous nerve injury should be considered when anterior medial thigh pain and numbness occur following aortofemoral bypass graft surgery and other types of femoral artery reconstructive surgery. 
4	New technologies for the treatment of obstructive arterial disease. The well-known limitations of balloon angioplasty include unpredictable abrupt closure, chronic total occlusion, diffuse disease, and restenosis, among other factors. These limitations have prompted the development of new technologic approaches to angioplasty including laser applications for plaque ablation, mechanical device applications for plaque removal/debridement, and stent devices for structural maintenance of vascular lumen patency. Devices which directly apply laser energy for ablation of plaque material include a balloon-centered laser angioplasty system, excimer laser ablation catheter systems, and a fluorescence-guided spectral feedback laser system. Experience with these devices indicates that plaque can be successfully ablated by using laser energy. Vessel perforation and dissection are complications reported with these devices and the effects of laser angioplasty on restenosis remain unclear. Indirect application of laser energy has been tested by using a "hot tip" catheter and a laser balloon angioplasty system. Although the hot tip device has received FDA approval for use in peripheral arteries, it appears to have very limited applications in the coronary arteries. Laser balloon angioplasty appears to be beneficial in the setting of threatened acute closure; the device continues to be evaluated for potential beneficial impact on restenosis. Mechanical atherectomy catheters are designed to remove atherosclerotic plaque from the arterial system and include the AtheroCath, the Transluminal Extraction Catheter (TEC), and the Pullback Atherectomy Catheter (PAC). The Rotablator is an atheroablation device which debrides the obstructing plaque material with distal embolization of the particulate debris. Successful removal/debridement of atherosclerotic plaque has been demonstrated with the AtheroCath, Rotablator, and the TEC device. Pre-clinical studies demonstrate successful removal of plaque material with the PAC device. Despite the theoretic advantage of removing plaque material when performing angioplasty with these devices, there has been little or no reduction in restenosis rates based on a significant experience with the AtheroCath and the Rotablator. Intravascular stent devices including one self-expanding device design and two balloon-expandable device designs have been employed successfully in the elective setting to treat recurrent restenosis lesions. Two of the devices have been successfully tested in the setting of threatened acute closure. Early follow-up studies suggest some improvement in restenosis rates in certain clinical settings following intravascular stenting. Acute and subacute thrombosis remain substantial problems for stent devices and very aggressive anticoagulation regimens are necessary to minimize the adverse events. In summary, a number of a new technologic approaches for treatment of atherosclerotic lesions have been developed and are undergoing significant clinical evaluation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Codeine plus paracetamol versus paracetamol in longer-term treatment of chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the hip. A randomised, double-blind, multi-centre study. This randomized, double-blind, multi-centre study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment for 4 weeks with codeine plus paracetamol versus paracetamol in relieving chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the hip. A total of 158 outclinic patients entered the study. Eighty-three patients (mean age 66 years) were treated with codeine 60 mg plus paracetamol 1 g 3 times daily, and 75 patients (mean age 67 years) with paracetamol 1 g 3 times daily. Ibuprofen 400 mg was prescribed as rescue medication. Due to an unexpected high rate of adverse drug reactions, the study was closed before the planned 400 patients had entered. Over weeks 1-4, 87%, 64%, 61% and 52% of patients in the codeine plus paracetamol group, and 38%, 31%, 22% and 29% of patients in the paracetamol group had one or more adverse drug reactions. Significantly more patients in the codeine plus paracetamol group had adverse drug reactions in each of the 4 weeks. Nausea, dizziness, vomiting and constipation were predominant adverse reactions in the codeine plus paracetamol group. During the first week of treatment, 30 patients (36%) in the codeine plus paracetamol group and 9 (12%) in the paracetamol group dropped out. As evaluated from patients completing the first week of treatment, the pain intensity during that week compared to their baseline pain was significantly lower in the codeine plus paracetamol group than in the paracetamol group. Moreover, during the first week the paracetamol group received rescue medicine significantly more frequently. In conclusion, when evaluated after 7 days of treatment, the daily addition of codeine 180 mg to paracetamol 3 g significantly reduced the intensity of chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the hip joint. However, several adverse drug reactions, mainly of the gastrointestinal tract, and the larger number of patients withdrawing from treatment means that the addition of such doses of codeine cannot be recommended for longer-term treatment of chronic pain in elderly patients. 
2	Hilar malignancy: treatment with an expandable metallic transhepatic biliary stent. An expandable metallic transhepatic biliary endoprosthesis was used to treat 20 patients with hilar malignancy and isolated right and left intrahepatic ducts. In 12 patients, only one intrahepatic ductal system was drained; in eight patients, both systems were drained. In five patients, both systems were drained through a single transhepatic track by arrangement of two stents in a T configuration. The initial technical success rate in placing the stents and achieving internal drainage was 100%. Complications necessitating further intervention occurred in two of the 20 patients. Short-term clinical follow-up was available for 19 of the 20 patients. Two months after stent insertion, two patients complained of persistent jaundice, two patients died without jaundice, and 15 patients were free of symptoms of biliary obstruction. A variety of geometric configurations are possible with this endoprosthesis. The relative merits of these stent arrangements are discussed, and a new technique for placing the stents in a T configuration is described. 
1	Beta-carotene and cancer prevention: the Basel Study. In 1971-1973 at the third examination of the Basel Study started in 1959, the major antioxidant vitamins and carotene were measured in the plasma of 2974 men. A subsample and their families were reinvestigated in 1977-79. During the 12-y observation period (1973-85) 553 men died, 204 of cancer (lung cancer 68, stomach cancer 20; colon cancer 17, all other malignancies 99). We found significantly lower mean carotene levels for all cancer, bronchus cancer, and stomach cancer (all P less than 0.01) compared with the 2421 survivors. The relative risk of subjects with low carotene (less than 0.23 mumol/L) was significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) for lung cancer (Cox's model). Higher risks were noted for all cancer (P less than 0.01) if both carotene and retinol were low. Low plasma carotene which is known to reflect carotene intake is in our study associated with increased cancer risk. 
3	Environmental risk factors in siblings with Parkinson's disease. To investigate possible risk factors in Parkinson's disease, we conducted a case-controlled study of 19 families having two or more siblings with Parkinson's disease. Demographic data were collected, including lifetime histories of places of residence; sources of drinking water; occupations, such as farming; and exposure to herbicides and pesticides. Rural living and drinking well water, but not farming and herbicide exposure, were significantly increased in 38 parkinsonians compared with 38 normal control subjects. A comparison of parkinsonian siblings with siblings with essential tremor revealed no differences in any risk factors for the years of shared environment. These data suggest that living in a rural environment and drinking well water are risk factors for Parkinson's disease and that the total life exposure to an environmental toxin may be more important than exposure in early life. 
4	Effects of salt, race, and hypertension on reactivity to stressors. Blood pressure and heart rate reactivity to a psychological stressor and to a cold pressor test were examined in a group of 51 normotensive and 37 unmedicated hypertensive men. All were studied twice, once while the participants were maintained on a moderately high salt (200 meq sodium/day) diet and once while the participants were maintained on an extremely low salt (10 meq sodium/day) diet. Dietary salt had no effect on blood pressure or heart rate responses to the two stressors. The systolic and diastolic responses of the white participants to the psychological stressor were greater than those of the black participants (both p less than 0.05); however, there was no difference between blacks and whites in reactivity to the cold pressor challenge. As compared with the normotensive group, the hypertensive group reacted to the psychological stressor with increased responses in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate (all p less than 0.05). The hypertensive group also hyperresponded in terms of the systolic pressure response to the cold pressor task (p less than 0.05). Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine responses were not significantly different across the two diets, races, or diagnoses. 
2	Mucocele of the cystic duct remnant in eight liver transplant recipients: findings at cholangiography, CT, and US. The case histories and radiologic studies of eight liver transplant recipients who developed a mucocele of the allograft cystic duct remnant were retrospectively evaluated. All patients had clinical and/or laboratory evidence of biliary obstruction or cholangitis from 2 weeks to 3.3 years following transplantation. Cholangiographic, ultrasound (US), and computed tomography (CT) images were available for review in eight, five, and four patients, respectively. Cholangiograms demonstrated an extrinsic mass compressing the common hepatic duct in seven of eight patients. US and CT showed fairly well- to well-defined round fluid collections adjacent to the common hepatic duct in three and two patients, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that the detection at cholangiography of an extrinsic mass compressing the common hepatic duct appears to be specific for a mucocele of the allograft cystic duct remnant. CT and US images may offer confirmatory evidence. 
5	Growth in children from the Wosera subdistrict, Papua New Guinea, in relation to energy and protein intakes and zinc status. In a cross-sectional study of 123 children aged 24-120 mo from the Wosera subdistrict of Papua New Guinea, height, weight, hematocrit, hemoglobin, hair zinc, and presence of malaria were measured. Two 24-h recalls were undertaken in 67 of the children aged 72-120 mo; 52%, 73%, and 76% had energy, protein, and zinc intakes, respectively, less than two-thirds of the FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations. Stunting was prevalent (29%); 16% were moderately wasted. The prevalence of stunting and hair zinc concentrations less than 1.68 mumol/g was gender related; 38% of males vs 20% of females had Z scores for height-for-age (HAZ scores) less than -2 (P = 0.04); 26% of males vs 11% of females had hair zinc less than 1.68 mumol/g (P less than 0.05). Analysis of variance showed that age, sex, hemoglobin, and log hair zinc influenced HAZ scores, depending on the age group; both sex and the log of the hair zinc values were significant factors in the older children. Stunting in Worsera children was related to chronic deficits in energy and protein and was excerbated in the older male children by suboptimal zinc status. 
4	Simulated left ventricular aneurysm and aneurysm repair in swine. Patch reconstruction of left ventricular aneurysm may be superior to linear closure, but this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally. Accordingly, six anesthetized domestic pigs were instrumented to measure regional left ventricular wall thickening, stroke volume, systolic left ventricular pressure, and myocardial oxygen consumption. With total bypass and cardioplegia, a 6 by 8 cm Dacron patch was inserted into the anteroapical left ventricle. Simulations were as follows: left ventricular aneurysm, patch open; patch reconstruction, 50% patch plication; standard repair, ventriculotomy edges approximated. Global function, from stroke work (stroke volume x integral of left ventricular pressure)-left ventricular end-diastolic pressure curves, was depressed in all three simulations compared with control. A tendency for stroke work to be greater for standard repair than for left ventricular aneurysm and patch reconstruction at higher preloads was not statistically significant. Mechanical efficiency, from stroke work/myocardial oxygen consumption (joules per milliliter oxygen per beat), was 2.43 +/- 0.52 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) (control), 2.22 +/- 0.94 (standard repair), 1.27 +/- 0.39 (patch reconstruction), and 1.09 +/- 0.37 (left ventricular aneurysm) (no significant differences). Regional work was calculated as regional left ventricular wall thickening x integral of left ventricular pressure. The slope of the regional work-end-diastolic wall thickness relation decreased in the posterior wall 14.0 +/- 2.9 (control) versus 8.4 +/- 2.0 (left ventricular aneurysm), 6.9 +/- 1.4 (patch reconstruction), and 7.4 +/- 1.4 (standard repair) (p less than 0.05). In the anterior wall, contractility did not change significantly (7.4 +/- 1.2, control; 7.8 +/- 2.7, left ventricular aneurysm; 5.0 +/- 0.4, patch reconstruction; and 5.3 +/- 0.4, standard repair). Decreased end-diastolic wall thinning anteriorly suggested tethering. These results in the normal left ventricle suggest that patch ventriculoplasty is of no greater benefit than linear repair. Either repair may impede function of adjacent myocardium through restriction of regional diastolic lengthening. 
5	Hyperplastic gastric polyps associated with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection and active gastritis. We report two cases of patients with 3-yr histories of upper gastrointestinal symptoms, hyperplastic gastric polyps, and active chronic gastritis. Biopsies retrospectively stained with Giemsa revealed the persistent presence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) in gastric biopsies of both patients throughout the 3 yr. After treatment with amoxicillin and bismuth subsalicylate, both became asymptomatic, one demonstrating disappearance and recurrence of the gastric polyps in conjunction with the HP. These cases demonstrate 3 yr of hyperplastic gastric polyps associated with HP and active gastritis. 
5	Penetrating keratoplasty after ocular trauma. We reviewed the records of 41 patients who underwent penetrating keratoplasty for a corneal opacity caused by trauma between Jan. 1, 1983, and Dec. 31, 1988. Most of the patients were young males whose average age was 35 years. Common tools accounted for many injuries (14 of 41, 34%). Sixteen injuries (39%) were work-related. Thirty-six patients (88%) had corneal scars from a perforating injury, four patients (10%) had corneal edema, and one patient (2%) required emergency penetrating keratoplasty for extensive tissue loss. Of the 39 patients with one year of follow-up, 31 (82%) maintained clear corneal grafts. Rejection occurred in nine of 39 patients (23%) and only three (33%) of the rejections resolved. Visual outcome was favorable with 20 patients (51%) attaining best-corrected postoperative visual acuity of 20/20 to 20/40, nine patients (23%) attaining visual acuity of 20/50 to 20/100, and ten patients (26%) attaining visual acuity of 20/200 or worse. Preoperative retinal disease (six of 39, 15%), astigmatic errors (five of 39, 13%), graft failures (four of 39, 10%), and postoperative glaucoma (12 of 39, 31%) adversely influenced the outcome. Although the prevalence of postoperative complications is relatively high, good visual results can be obtained in patients who undergo penetrating keratoplasty after ocular trauma. 
4	Normalization of increased sodium sensitivity by maintenance hemodialysis. Blood pressure (BP) becomes more sodium and body fluid sensitive as renal function deteriorates. Thus, hypertension in chronic renal failure is mostly of the sodium sensitive type. We studied whether the increased sodium sensitivity (SS) can be restored to normal on the maintenance phase of hemodialysis (HD) therapy. Body weight (BW) and BP (specifically, mean arterial pressure [MAP]) were measured after HD and before the next HD, and the body fluid sensitivity (BFS) was calculated as the ratio of changes in these factors on both introduction and maintenance phases in HD patients (n = 56) who were not taking any antihypertensive drugs (BFS = delta MAP/delta BW). In a preliminary study, the amount of interdialytic sodium intake (QNa+) was measured (n = 30), and SS was calculated as the ratio of the change in MAP to QNa+ (SS = delta MAP/QNa+). Interdialytic BW gain (3.1 +/- 0.1 kg) was correlated with the amount of sodium intake (136 +/- 17 mEq), resulting in a positive relationship between BFS and SS (r = 0.79, P less than .0001). Therefore, BFS was used as an index of SS. As a whole, BFS decreased from the introduction to the maintenance phase (6.5 +/- 1.0 to 3.5 +/- 0.6 mm Hg/L, P less than .01). This decrease was marked (6.2 +/- 1.1 to 2.9 +/- 0.6 mm Hg/L, P less than .01) in patients (n = 46) whose BP was normalized in the maintenance phase, while not significant (7.9 +/- 1.9 to 6.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg/L) in patients (n = 10) whose BP was still high. 
1	Occult vascular malformations of the optic chiasm: magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis and surgical laser resection. Angiographically occult vascular malformations of the optic nerve and chiasm are extremely rare. Before the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it was difficult to diagnose these lesions preoperatively. We report MRI scan findings of optic chiasm cavernous angiomas in two patients with chiasmal syndrome. MRI was useful in localizing the vascular malformation and delineating its characteristics, especially chronic hemorrhage. One patient underwent biopsy of the lesion. The other patient underwent complete microsurgical resection of the malformation with the carbon dioxide laser with preservation of vision. Occult vascular malformations of the optic nerve and chiasm may be a more common cause of visual deterioration than previously recognized. The MRI scan is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing and following these lesions. In certain patients, these vascular malformations may be amenable to complete surgical removal with stabilization or improvement of visual function. 
5	"Cloggology" revisited: endoscopic or surgical decompression of malignant biliary obstruction. In this study, 50 consecutive patients over age 60 with obstructive jaundice secondary to malignant stricture of the distal common bile duct were identified by endoscopic cholangiography. The patients were then randomized to palliative therapy with either endoscopic endoprosthesis or bypass surgery. Prospective indices of survival time, complication rates, hospitalization requirements, and quality of life were followed. All 25 patients randomized to endoprosthesis were treated by this procedure, whereas only 19 of 25 patients randomized to bypass surgery underwent operative biliary-digestive anastomosis. No difference in the above indices were found between the two groups. The authors concluded that palliation of obstructive jaundice due to a malignant bile duct stricture with endoscopically placed biliary stent is as effective as operative bypass. 
5	Effects of inflammation and copper intake on rat liver and erythrocyte Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase activity levels. Stress such as inflammation produces an acute phase response that includes elevated levels of ceruloplasmin, the main copper component of plasma. Inflammatory effects on cellular copper enzyme activity levels are largely unknown. Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in liver, the main site of ceruloplasmin secretion, decreased with turpentine-induced inflammation (0.1 mL, intramuscular, leg) in rats fed any of three copper levels (adequate = 6 mg/kg, marginal = 2.5 mg/kg and deficient less than 0.5 mg/kg). Ceruloplasmin activities rose significantly with inflammation in the adequate and marginal groups but not in the deficient animals. Hepatic Cu-Zn SOD immunoreactive protein levels were unaffected by copper status or inflammatory state. Erythrocyte Cu-Zn SOD activities were influenced by dietary copper but not inflammation. An additional group of rats fed 15 mg copper/kg did not show a turpentine-induced decrease in liver Cu-Zn activity levels. Inflammatory effects on other copper enzyme activities did occur as evidenced by increases in ceruloplasmin and decreases in serum extracellular SOD. In conclusion, an acute phase response in rats increased the amount of dietary copper required to maintain hepatic Cu-Zn SOD activity at levels equal to those of nonstressed, copper-adequate rats. Rat erythrocyte Cu-Zn SOD activities provided a blood measurement reflective of copper intake with or without stress, but these values did not reflect decreases in liver Cu-Zn SOD activities after 3 d of inflammation. 
5	Comparison of symptom characteristics of indwelling ureteral catheters. The signs and symptoms produced by 4 different types of 7F double pigtail catheters, including Cook polyurethane pigtail stent, Surgitek Silitek Uropass, Cook C-Flex and Van-Tec Soft stent, were analyzed prospectively. The stents were placed in 45 men and 28 women ranging in age from 23 to 72 years old. A total of 44 catheters had a suture attached to the bladder end of the catheter, which exited from the urethral meatus to facilitate removal. The remaining 29 catheters had no suture attached. Symptoms were evaluated at 2 and 6 days after insertion and 1 week following removal of the catheter, and included urinary frequency, nocturia, hematuria, flank pain, suprapubic pain, dysuria and pain on removal of the catheter. Frequency and nocturia were evaluated in minutes, pain was graded on a subjective scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain), and dysuria and hematuria were assessed qualitatively. There were no significant differences among the 4 types of catheters in terms of frequency, nocturia, hematuria, flank pain, suprapubic pain and dysuria. In addition, there was no significant difference in urinary symptoms between catheters with and without a suture at either 2 or 6 days after insertion nor was there any difference in pain on removal of catheters with (mean 3.9) and without (mean 5.0) suture. We found that catheter composition and use of suture to facilitate removal did not significantly affect patient morbidity. 
5	Touch and surgical division of the anterior quadrant of the spinal cord. An investigation was carried out to determine whether tactile sensibility was affected by anterolateral cordotomy. There were 65 patients who had cordotomies for painful forms of cancer. Thirty eight had necropsy examination with histological investigation of the spinal cord. No form of mechanoreception was removed in any of the 65 patients and in the majority no forms of tactile sensibility were altered by division of the pathways in the anterolateral and anterior columns. In no case was graphaesthesia affected. Knowledge of joint position and movement and awareness of vibration was normal in 62 of the 65 patients. But information carried by these anterolateral pathways does reach neural levels of consciousness, for with total lesions of the posterior columns, previously reported, touch and pressure are still felt. Itch was removed by division of the anterolateral pathways. Although the posterior columns are essential for discrimination in mechanoreception, discrimination may be disturbed by lesions of the anterolateral pathways, notably two-point discrimination. The evidence on the pathways essential for conveying impulses giving rise to tickle was inconclusive. 
3	Haemophilus influenzae meningitis with prolonged hospital course. A retrospective evaluation of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis observed over a 2-year period documented 86 cases. Eight of these patients demonstrated an unusual clinical course characterized by persistent fever (duration: greater than 10 days), cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, profound meningeal enhancement on computed tomography, significant morbidity, and a prolonged hospital course. The mean age of these 8 patients was 6 months, in contrast to a mean age of 14 months for the entire group. Two patients had clinical evidence of relapse. Four of the 8 patients tested for latex particle agglutination in the cerebrospinal fluid remained positive after 10 days. All patients received antimicrobial therapy until they were afebrile for a minimum of 5 days. Subsequent neurologic examination revealed a persistent seizure disorder in 5 patients (62.5%), moderate-to-profound hearing loss in 2 (25%), mild ataxia in 1 (12.5%), and developmental delay with hydrocephalus which required shunting in 1 (12.5%). One patient had no sequelae. 
1	Carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct. A review of 39 instances of excision of a cyst of the thyroglossal duct performed at St. Paul Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, revealed two patients with carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct. A review of the English literature yielded 146 instances of this uncommon tumor. Eighty-four per cent were papillary adenocarcinoma of thyroid type and 5 per cent were squamous cell carcinoma. The patients were from six to 81 years old with a 2:1 female to male ratio. Metastatic disease to lymph nodes was noted in 11 per cent and invasion of overlying strap muscles was found in 4 per cent. Carcinoma of the thyroid gland occurred in 14 per cent. Preoperative diagnosis was rare. The Sistrunk procedure is recommended for initial surgical therapy with further surgical or adjuvant therapy dependent on associated clinical findings. Prognosis for carcinoma of the thyroglossal duct of thyroid type parallels that of carcinoma of the thyroid gland. 
3	Quantitative assessment of extradural bupivacaine analgesia. Bupivacaine (0.5%) 20 ml was administered extradurally to six healthy volunteers. It was found that simultaneous application of 10 needles to the skin could evoke pain when analgesia was obtained to one needle stimulation. In addition, a laser beam was used as a quantitative technique to activate simultaneously many cutaneous nociceptors. For 7 h, thresholds (sensory and pain) and pain-evoked brain potentials (amplitude and latency) to laser stimulation were monitored and used for quantitative assessment of onset, efficacy and duration of analgesia at various dermatomes (C7, T8, T10, T12, L1, L3, S1). The onset time of analgesia was shortest and conduction delay longest at the dermatome related to the site of injection (L3). Full analgesia was obtained at L1, L3 and S1, although the peak efficacy at S1 was delayed for 120-180 min after injection. A minor effect was found at dermatome C7 approximately 60 min after injection. 
3	Chiari pelvic osteotomy for osteoarthritis. The influence of the torn and detached acetabular labrum. We assessed the results of Chiari pelvic osteotomy in 64 hips with early osteoarthritis in terms of acetabular labral detachment detected pre-operatively by arthrography. At an average follow-up of four years, assessment by the Merle d'Aubigne score showed 83% excellent or good results. These satisfactory results were achieved in only half the cases with a detached labrum, but in nearly all cases with normal or torn acetabular labra. Other factors such as the acetabular index, the level and angle of osteotomy, and the displacement following osteotomy did not affect the results. Chiari pelvic osteotomy is a worthwhile procedure for early osteoarthritis in selected cases, but a detached acetabular labrum increases the risk of clinical failure. 
1	Ureteral stump carcinoma incidentally found at cystectomy for bladder cancer. We report on a sixty-five-year-old man with hematuria secondary to superficial bladder cancer. Because of previous urethral trauma, a complete transurethral resection of his bladder tumor could not be done. He, therefore, underwent cystectomy, at which time we incidentally found a transitional cell carcinoma of the left ureteral stump that had been left from a previous left nephrectomy for a World War II-related injury. This case underscores the importance of a thorough investigation of the complete urinary tract in a patient with hematuria or other urinary tract symptoms even if an obvious cause is found for his symptoms. 
2	Polyneuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, leukoencephalopathy, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction: POLIP syndrome. We describe 5 individuals (from three separate families) with a progressive neurological disorder characterized by sensorimotor peripheral polyneuropathy, cranial neuropathies (external ophthalmoplegia, deafness), and the syndrome of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Magnetic resonance imaging showed widespread abnormality of the cerebral and cerebellar white matter in the 2 patients studied. Autopsy examination in 3 revealed widespread endoneurial fibrosis and demyelination in the peripheral nervous system, possibly secondary to axonal atrophy, and poorly defined changes in cerebral white matter (leukoencephalopathy). The cranial nerves and spinal roots were less severely involved and the neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord were intact. The fatal gastrointestinal dysmotility was due to a severe visceral neuropathy. We suggest that these patients manifested a hereditary disorder with distinctive clinical, radiological, and neuropathological features, and propose the acronym POLIP to emphasize the distinctive tetrad of polyneuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, leukoencephalopathy, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. 
2	Sulphasalazine and prednisone compared with sulphasalazine for treating active Crohn disease. A double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether sulphasalazine plus prednisone is more effective than sulphasalazine alone in treating active Crohn disease. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Multicenter trial in one university hospital and nine general hospitals. PATIENTS: Patients with active Crohn disease and a Van Hees Activity Index of 140 or more. Of 71 patients who were randomly assigned, 60 completed treatment and were analyzed. INTERVENTIONS: For 16 weeks, 30 patients received sulphasalazine, 6 g/d (or 4 g/d if adverse effects occurred) and prednisone, 30 mg/d initially. Prednisone therapy was tapered in increments of 5 mg/2 wk to 10 mg/d after 8 weeks. Thirty other patients received sulphasalazine and a placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the first 6 weeks of treatment, the Van Hees Activity Index decreased to a median of 70% (interquartile range, 57% to 81%) of the initial value in patients treated with sulphasalazine and prednisone and to a median of 87% (interquartile range, 70% to 94%) in patients treated with sulphasalazine alone (P = 0.001). In the last 4 weeks of treatment, the corresponding figures were 63% (interquartile range, 40% to 75%) and 70% (interquartile range, 54% to 90%) (P = 0.10). The Crohn's Disease Activity Index decreased in the first 6 weeks to a median of 65% (interquartile range, 57% to 86%) in patients receiving sulphasalazine and prednisone and to a median of 75% (interquartile range, 58% to 101%) in patients receiving sulphasalazine alone (P = 0.13). In the last 4 weeks of treatment, the corresponding figures were 65% (interquartile range, 42% to 90%) and 76% (interquartile range, 49% to 110%) (P = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: The use of prednisone in addition to sulphasalazine in patients with active Crohn disease results in a significantly faster initial improvement, but not in a significantly better result after 16 weeks of treatment, when disease activity is measured by the Van Hees Activity Index. 
1	Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to study the genetic origin of complete hydatidiform mole. To determine the genetic origin of the complete hydatidiform mole, 20 abnormal pregnancies were studied with restriction fragment length polymorphism with five genomic probes: EJ 6.6, beta-globin gene, 3'alpha-hypervariable region, J-Bir, and St14. In the 12 cases of molar pregnancy, pure paternal origin was proved in 11 cases, but both maternal and paternal inheritance were shown in only one case. In the cases with pure paternal origin, all of the restriction fragment length polymorphisms were homozygous, although those of the fathers were heterozygous at 15 loci. In the four cases that mimicked hydatidiform mole but were diagnosed as hydropic change of villi, both paternal and maternal inheritance were noted. In the four pregnancies with blighted ovum, both paternal and maternal inheritance were shown in three cases; and in one case with a balanced translocation between chromosomes 13 and 14, only paternal inheritance was noted. This study showed that most of the complete hydatidiform moles were caused by fertilization of an empty egg by a duplicated haploid sperm, but rare exceptions may exist. 
2	(A)typical symptoms during single needle dialysis. In 5 elderly patients, an abnormally high occurrence of some symptoms was noted during dialysis. All patients were dialyzed with biocompatible membranes, bicarbonate dialysate, and a blood flow of 250 to 300 ml/min by a single needle system, on a fistula 14 Gauge catheter-needle. These symptoms were: 1) "angina," resistant to O2 and nitrates, with biochemical stigmata of infarction, but without electrocardiogram (ECG) localization; 2) intractable persistent hypotension, not hypovolemic, lasting 1 or 2 days; 3) esophagal spasms, with inability to swallow solid food. Because we knew that these symptoms were compatible with hemolysis (biochemically proven by the increase in serum LDH during dialysis and by a fall in haptoglobin) due to red cell fragmentation (RCF), we switched these patients from fistula dialysis (A) to central catheter dialysis (B), with the same apperture, blood flow, etc. The total number of sessions of A versus B were 512 and 891; the mean LDH ratios (serum LDH postdialysis divided by predialysis) were 1.8 and 1.0 (= no RCF); angina events were 132 (26%) for A, and 25 (3%) for B; persistent hypotension was seen 37 (7%) times in A and 5 (0.6%) times in B; esophagal spasms were noted 65 (13%) times for A, and 0 times for B. This clinical improvement was so overwhelming that 3 patients refused to be dialyzed again using their well functioning fistulae. This study also proved the need for a better designed and manufactured peripheral dialysis catheter-needle. 
3	Cerebrospinal norepinephrine concentrations and the duration of epidural analgesia This study was performed to determine whether the addition of norepinephrine to local anaesthetics prolongs epidural analgesia in man. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were measured. In the first part of the study, epidural catheters were inserted in 14 patients before herniotomy. Mepivacaine, 1.5 per cent (0.35 ml.kg-1), was administered and norepinephrine (5 micrograms.ml-1) was added in seven patients. The duration of anaesthesia was prolonged from 54 +/- 11 min to 83 +/- 12 min (P less than 0.05) and CSF NE concentrations increased from 68 +/- 12 pg.ml-1 to 336 +/- 85 pg.ml-1 in the NE group (P less than 0.01). In the second part, eight patients with herpetic neuralgia received epidural analgesia at the fourth to eighth thoracic interspace, using bupivacaine 0.25 per cent, with and without NE. The CSF NE concentrations in this group were greater than in the surgical patients before operation and increased from 254 +/- 58 to 406 +/- 58 pg.ml-1 30 min after administration of bupivacaine with NE. The duration of pain relief was prolonged with NE. These results suggest that adding NE to local anaesthetics prolongs epidural analgesia. Moreover, NE concentrations in surgical patients increased to levels similar to those found in patients suffering from herpetic analgesia. This suggests that the increase of CSF NE in chronic pain states has an antinociceptive effect. 
5	Putative mechanisms of cytoprotective effect of certain antacids and sucralfate. An investigation of cytoprotective activity of certain antacids and inert particles was carried out by treating ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage in rats in order to clarify possible mechanisms by which aluminum-containing antacids act. Al(OH)3 inhibited gastric mucosal damage in a dose-related and time-dependent manner. Neither aluminum ions themselves nor the particle size of the Al(OH)3 complex were responsible for the observed cytoprotection, since neither AlCl3, chemically inert Al2O3*C, nor sea sand showed protective effects. Hyperosmolality in the gastric lumen was not a deciding factor in inducing cytoprotection. Silicic acid and titanium dioxide, with superficial charge similar to Al(OH)3 proved to be effective in inhibiting gastric hemorrhagic lesions and releasing PGE2, suggesting that the surface charge of Al(OH)3 may be important in its cytoprotective properties. The same may also be valid for sucralfate. Since antacid-induced cytoprotection was only partly reduced by pretreatment with indomethacin, it is likely that additional mechanisms and mediators other than prostaglandins, such as nonprotein sulfhydryls, also are involved in gastric cytoprotection arising from aluminum-containing antacids. 
3	Autologous transplantation of adrenal medulla in Parkinson's disease. 18-month results. Eighteen of 19 patients who underwent autologous adrenal medullary transplantation to the right caudate nucleus have been followed up for 18 months. During the course of this study, a statistically significant improvement was noted in percent "on" time, percent "on" time without dyskinesia, activity of daily living (ADL) scores during the "on" stages, and ADL, motor, and Schwab-England scores during the "off" stages. Benefits tended to be maximal at 6 months and to gradually lessen thereafter, although statistically significant improvement in comparison with baseline was still present at 18 months for ADL, motor, and Hoehn-Yahr scores during the "off" stages. Almost all parameters had deteriorated by 18 months compared with 12 months, including those remaining significantly improved in comparison with baseline. These patterns were similar for each of the three participating centers. Complications were largely restricted to the perioperative period. 
4	Pharmacokinetics of indium-111-labeled antimyosin monoclonal antibody in murine experimental viral myocarditis. The pharmacokinetics of indium-111-labeled antimyosin monoclonal antibody Fab were investigated with use of murine experimental viral myocarditis as a model. The biodistribution of indium-111-labeled antimyosin antibody Fab on days 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28 after encephalomyocarditis virus inoculation demonstrated that myocardial uptake increased significantly on days 5, 7 and 14 (maximum on day 7) in infected versus uninfected mice (p less than 0.001). In vivo kinetics in infected mice on day 7 demonstrated that the heart to blood ratio reached a maximum 48 h after the intravenous administration of indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab, which was considered to be the optimal time for scintigraphy. The scintigraphic images obtained with indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab demonstrated positive uptake in the cardiac lesion in infected mice. The pathologic study demonstrated that myocardial uptake correlated well with pathologic grades of myocardial necrosis. High performance liquid chromatography revealed the presence of an antigen-antibody complex in the circulation of infected mice after the injection of indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab. This antigen bound to indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab in the circulation might be whole myosin and this complex may decrease myocardial uptake and increase liver uptake. It is concluded that indium-111-labeled antimyosin monoclonal antibody Fab accumulates selectively in damaged heart tissue in mice with acute myocarditis and that indium-111-labeled antimyosin Fab scintigraphy may be a useful method for the visualization of acute myocarditis. 
3	Epidemiology of epilepsy in Guaymi Indians from Bocas del Toro Province, Republic of Panama. This cross-sectional study was conducted to describe the epidemiology of epilepsy in Guaymi Indians residing in Changuinola, a small town on Panama's Caribbean coast near Costa Rica. We randomly selected households and attempted to enroll all residents aged less than or equal to 1 year; 337 eligible subjects agreed to participate (93% response rate). We administered a standard neurologic disease screening examination to all subjects and, if any abnormality was found, we administered a standard neurologic evaluation. We detected 19 cases of active epilepsy; the mean age at onset was 12 years, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures were the most common diagnosis (10 of 19, 53%). The prevalence of active epilepsy among Caribbean coastal Guaymi (57/1000) is considerably greater than that in lower class Panama City populations (22/1000) or in other parts of the world. To identify risk factors for epilepsy, we collected epidemiologic data and serum (for Cysticercus antibody) from subjects with active epilepsy and from 44 age/sex-matched controls. Significantly more cases (47%) than controls (6%) had other family members with epilepsy (relative risk, RR = 14); 44% of cases and 13% of controls reported a history of febrile seizures during childhood (RR = 6). 
3	Practical aspects of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone administration. Pulsatile administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone represents a major advance in the treatment of anovulation in women who fail to ovulate with clomiphene citrate and is an alternative for many women who currently receive human menopausal gonadotropin. Four issues must be addressed before administering pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone: (1) safety, (2) efficacy, (3) convenience, and (4) cost. Each of these issues will be affected by the three major decisions a physician makes with gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy: (1) patient selection, (2) route of administration, and (3) dose of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The ideal candidate for gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy is a patient with an absence of endogenous pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone, as seen in hypothalamic amenorrhea. Although women with polycystic ovarian disease can be treated with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone, a decreased ovulation rate should be expected. The route of administration, intravenous or subcutaneous, and the degree of monitoring can be tailored by the physician to fit each patient's needs. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy is a safe, effective, convenient, and economical alternative to human menopausal gonadotropin for ovulation induction in women resistant to clomiphene. 
4	Use of the metabolic tracer carbon-11-acetate for evaluation of regional myocardial perfusion. The high first-pass myocardial extraction fraction of carbon-11-acetate suggests that its initial uptake depends on blood flow. Accordingly, regional uptake of 11C-acetate at 4 min was compared to regional perfusion determined with nitrogen-13-ammonia in 119 segments in 15 patients with stable coronary artery disease by two methods. A close correlation was observed between initial relative myocardial concentrations (segmental activity normalized to maximal activity) of both tracers (11C-acetate = 0.88; 13N-ammonia + 0.079; s.e.e. = 0.064, r = 0.94, p less than 0.001). Furthermore, segmental net extractions (E.F), as calculated from the input function and segmental activities, of the two tracers correlated closely by E.FC-11 = 0.55E.FN-13 + 0.080 (s.e.e. = 0.045, r = 0.87, p less than 0.001). These relationships indicate that initial regional myocardial uptake of 11C-acetate reflects perfusion and that 11C-acetate permits near simultaneous evaluation of regional oxidative metabolism and of regional myocardial perfusion. 
3	Cerebral malaria in children Cerebral malaria is a rapidly progressive encephalopathy with up to 50% mortality. A cardinal feature is the massing of red cells containing mature Plasmodium falciparum within the cerebral capillaries. Adhesion of these parasitised red cells to endothelium, an event which may initiate cerebral malaria, is being studied at the molecular level. However, the relevance of these studies to the pathophysiology and treatment of human cerebral malaria is uncertain. Although chloroquine is still widely used to treat falciparum malaria, resistance has spread to most of the endemic zone. Quinine is emerging as the only effective treatment for cerebral malaria, though resistance to this drug threatens to become a problem. Alternative drugs are urgently needed. 
5	Protein synthesis required to anchor a mutant p53 protein which is temperature-sensitive for nuclear transport. The p53 protein is rendered temperature-sensitive by a point mutation. Rat cells transformed by this mutant p53 and an activated ras oncogene grow well at 37 degrees C but cease DNA synthesis and cell division when shifted to 32 degrees C. Immunostaining demonstrates that the mutant p53 protein is in the nucleus of the arrested cells at 32 degrees C but in the cytoplasm of the growing cells at 37 degrees C. This is the first example of a protein which is temperature-sensitive for nuclear transport. The translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus and vice versa occurs 6 h after temperature shift and is coincident with the inhibition of DNA synthesis; transport from cytoplasm to nucleus does not require protein synthesis. Remarkably, inhibition of protein synthesis at 37 degrees C also results in the rapid appearance of mutant p53 in the cell nucleus. These results suggest the presence of a short-lived protein responsible for holding p53 in the cytoplasm at 37 degrees C but not at 32 degrees C. Analysis of a non-temperature-sensitive mutant p53 protein shows that its cytoplasmic location is sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors but not to temperature. 
5	Progression through the cell cycle: an overview. Tissues in adults can be maintained at constant mass or they can increase or decrease in size because of imbalances of synthetic and degradative processes acting at the cellular and molecular levels. Some size changes are caused by physiologic conditions to which the tissue must adjust. Alternatively, the balance may be distorted in favor of net tissue increase in pathologic situations such as cancer. Strict regulatory mechanisms are required to keep proliferation responsive to the organism's needs; these mechanisms may be defective in disease. Net tissue proliferation requires repeated rounds of cell duplication in excess of that necessary to counterbalance cell death. Duplication of a cell requires a net doubling of its every molecule and structure. The myriad of molecular events required for cell proliferation such as DNA duplication and its partitioning at mitosis are tightly regulated in normal cells. One may conceive of two classes of molecules: those required for "housekeeping," which constitute the cell's structural and functional machinery, and those such as growth factors, their receptors, and second messengers involved in signal transduction responsible for regulating the activities of the housekeeping molecules. These molecular events and the cascade of processes that control them can be organized within the sequence of the cell cycle. In this brief overview, we illustrate these issues with a few examples taken from very recent discoveries of novel proteins that appear to have major regulatory roles. Most of these results have been obtained with mammalian fibroblasts, but some have originated with discoveries made using two very different yeasts. 
1	Contemporary management of a potentially lethal fetal anomaly: a successful perinatal approach to epignathus. Prenatal diagnosis of epignathus (a teratoma originating in the oropharynx) has been reported previously. However, in many of these cases the neonates succumbed to acute respiratory distress secondary to airway obstruction at the time of birth. We describe a case of antepartum diagnosis of epignathus using ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging as complementary techniques. The ability to accurately define the fetal anomaly permitted us to plan a unique strategy for peripartum management. After cesarean delivery of the infant from the uterus, the umbilical cord was not clamped and the fetoplacental circulation was left undisturbed. A tracheostomy was then performed, after which the umbilical cord was clamped and the infant was stabilized. Several hours later, a debulking procedure was performed in the operating room to remove the tumor from its attachment to the bony palate. Both mother and infant did well postoperatively. The ability to plan and perform a controlled tracheostomy while the infant remained oxygenated and ventilated proved to be lifesaving in this case. 
4	Progress in cardioprotection: the role of calcium antagonists. Calcium antagonists are now widely used for the treatment of clinical hypertension and angina pectoris. They are efficacious for the treatment of vasospastic, fixed atherosclerotic and mixed angina; they reduce the incidence of silent ischemia; and they have been shown to reduce postmyocardial infarct angina. Experimental data suggest that they may have certain cardioprotective properties in cases of acute myocardial ischemia and infarction, stunned myocardium, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy and atherosclerosis. Moreover, they have been shown to improve exercise performance, as well as the diastolic abnormalities in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In animals, they may delay or reduce the extent of myocardial necrosis after coronary occlusion or coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion, and in low doses that do not alter the hemodynamic profile, they have been shown to enhance the return of ventricular function in animals with stunned myocardium. However, the early first-generation calcium antagonists (nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem) have not been shown to reduce myocardial infarct size or to enhance survival in patients with acute myocardial infarction. There now are clinical studies that suggest that, unlike beta blockers or nitrates, nifedipine may slow the development of atherosclerotic progression in humans over a 2-year period, and it seems likely that in the 1990s there will be further expansion of the use of calcium antagonists for not only angina and hypertension but also for aspects of cardioprotection. That calcium antagonists may delay, prevent or possibly regress atherosclerotic lesions is an exciting possibility. 
3	Panic disorder and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular problems: results from a community survey. Follow-up studies of psychiatric patients with panic disorder have shown an abnormally high mortality rate in men due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The authors report that in the New Haven portion of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area program the risk for stroke in persons with lifetime diagnoses of panic disorder was over twice that in persons with other psychiatric disorders or no psychiatric disorder. After adjustments for demographic differences between groups, the risk was even higher. While the results should be interpreted cautiously because of the small sample and absence of medical examinations, these findings are consistent with clinical studies showing an association between panic disorder and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events. 
4	Prognosis and prognostic factors of retinal infarction: a prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE--To determine the prognosis and adverse prognostic factors in patients with retinal infarction due to presumed atheromatous thromboembolism or cardiogenic embolism. DESIGN--Prospective cohort study. SETTING--University hospital departments of clinical neurology. PATIENTS--99 patients with retinal infarction, without prior stroke, referred to a single neurologist between 1976 and 1986 and evaluated and followed up prospectively until death or the end of 1986 (mean follow up 4.2 years). INTERVENTIONS--Cerebral angiography (55 patients), aspirin treatment (37), oral anticoagulant treatment (eight), carotid endarterectomy (13), cardiac surgery (six), and peripheral vascular surgery (two). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death, stroke, coronary events, contralateral retinal infarction; survival analysis confined to 98 patients with retinal infarction due to presumed artheromatous thromboembolism or cardiogenic embolism (one patient with giant cell arteries excluded), and Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis, including age as a prognostic factor. RESULTS--During follow up 29 patients died (21 of vascular causes and eight of non-vascular or unknown causes), 10 had a first ever stroke, 19 had a coronary event, and only one developed contralateral retinal infarction. A coronary event accounted for more than half (59%) of the deaths whereas stroke was the cause of only one death (3%). Over the first five years after retinal infarction the actuarial average absolute risk of death was 8% per year; of stroke 2.5% per year (7.4% in the first year); of coronary events 5.3% per year, exceeding that of stroke; and of stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death 7.4% per year. Prognostic factors associated with an increased risk of death were increasing age, peripheral vascular disease, cardiomegaly, and carotid bruit. Adverse prognostic factors for serious vascular events were increasing age and carotid bruit for stroke, and increasing age, cardiomegaly, and carotid bruit both for coronary events and for stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. CONCLUSIONS--Patients who present with retinal infarction due to presumed atherothromboembolism or cardiogenic embolism are at considerable risk of a coronary event. The risk of stroke, although high, is not so great. Not all strokes occurring after retinal infarction relate directly to disease of the ipsilateral carotid system, although this is probably the most common cause. Few patients experience contralateral retinal infarction. Non-arteritic retinal infarction should be diagnosed or confirmed by an ophthalmologist, and the long term care of patients with the condition should involve a physician who has an active interest in managing vascular disease. 
1	Primary central nervous system lymphoma in a pediatric patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Treatment with radiation therapy. Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, an otherwise rare pediatric tumor, has been reported with increasing frequency in children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). With current therapy, the outcome of this disease is invariably fatal. The authors present a case of primary CNS lymphoma in a 3.5-year-old girl with AIDS who received treatment with total brain irradiation. After treatment, the patient's mental status improved, the seizures resolved, and she had no further progression of her neurologic symptoms until she died of pneumonia 6 months later. The autopsy revealed a necrotic mass at the site of the original tumor. The brain stem and spinal cord, unirradiated, contained lymphomatous lesions. The patient had extensive fibrinoid necrosis and leukoencephalopathy that were consistent with radiation-induced CNS damage. Coexisting AIDS encephalopathy also contributed to the patient's CNS injury. Effective palliation of CNS lymphoma in children with AIDS may be obtained with cranial irradiation. Pediatric AIDS patients may show more severe tissue effects from irradiation than unaffected children. 
5	Radionuclide imaging of asymptomatic versus symptomatic total knee arthroplasties. Ninety-eight total knee prostheses were evaluated by roentgenograms and bone scans. Fifty-three were asymptomatic, and 45 were symptomatic. Thirteen prostheses required revision surgery. At a mean of 54 months, asymptomatic knee replacements generally showed only mild uptake in one or more zones. Only one knee had uptake equal to surrounding bone. However, symptomatic knee replacements showed significantly greater uptake in the patella, femur, and medial and lateral tibial plateau regions (Mann-Whitney two-sample rank test). Bone scans in the symptomatic group were obtained at a mean of 44 months. Excluding those patients who had revision surgery, the differences remained significant. Furthermore, symptomatic knee replacements with normal roentgenograms also had significantly greater uptake. Radiolucent lines were noted in 30% of asymptomatic patients, whereas 29% of symptomatic knees had radiolucencies. Radiolucencies were not generally associated with significantly greater uptake. Lateral release had no effect on the patellar score. 
4	Cardiac contractility and conduction: a comparison of antihypertensives. The four classes of first-line antihypertensive agents recommended in the 1988 report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure are reviewed here. Particular consideration is given to the effects of these agents on heart rate, atrioventricular nodal conduction, and myocardial contractility in patients with other cardiovascular diseases. Diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have no significant direct effects on cardiac function. beta-Blockers inhibit catecholamine stimulation of the heart and may be particularly beneficial in treating patients with a history of myocardial infarction. Calcium channel blockers reduce blood pressure by dilating arterial resistance vessels. They are structurally heterogeneous and highly selective in their sites of action. As a consequence, cardiac effects can be minimized by selecting a calcium channel blocker with more potent peripheral vasodilatory effects. A new calcium channel blocker, isradipine, currently undergoing clinical trials, is highly selective for arterial smooth muscle and appears to be a safe and effective antihypertensive agent. 
3	Lyme disease: recommendations for diagnosis and treatment The incidence and the endemic range of Lyme disease in the United States have increased steadily since the disease was originally recognized in Lyme, Connecticut, in 1975. Because of the varied clinical manifestations of this illness and the use of unstandardized serologic testing methods, diagnosis is often uncertain and treatment outcomes are often difficult to evaluate. The antibiotic regimens that are commonly used in clinical practice have changed rapidly. They show much regional variation with little critical comparison of treatment results. The clinical diagnosis and the literature on the treatment of the various stages of Lyme disease are reviewed. The reported data are supplemented with recommendations based on 15 years of clinical experience with this illness. 
1	A comparative analysis of three different techniques for the detection of breast cancer cells in bone marrow. Three different methods, morphologic, immunocytochemic, and fluorescence activated cell sorter (FC) analysis, were compared with respect to their efficiency in detecting breast cancer cells in bone marrow. In the first series of experiments, the three techniques were compared using bone marrow cells artificially mixed with a known amount of breast cancer cells, whereas in a second series bone marrow from breast cancer patients with bone metastases were used. The following results were obtained: When mixtures of the first series were analyzed, FC analysis detected from 1% to 10% of breast cancer cells in bone marrow (0.2% was a border line value), the morphologic method detected from 0.05% to 10%, and the immunocytochemic method, which was clearly superior, detected breast cancer cells in all mixtures (from 0.00025% to 10%). It was noted that, with both the morphologic and immunocytochemic methods, the percentage of breast cancer cells detected was 2 to 360 times higher than the percentage of added cells, and enrichment was inversely proportional to the percentage of added cells. This result could be a result of different separation of cells during centrifugation due to the different density of breast cancer cells. The superiority of the immunocytochemic method was confirmed in the second series of experiments. 
4	Indapamide: a diuretic of choice for the treatment of hypertension? In recent years, the therapeutic approach to mild hypertension has evolved from a stepped care approach to one including varied, initial monotherapies, with the selection of drug based on factors present in an individual patient, followed by combination therapy. The greatest cumulative experience of the value of antihypertensive therapy has been obtained with diuretics. The reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease with successful antihypertensive therapy using conventional agents, including diuretics, is not as great as might have been anticipated by the magnitude of change in blood pressure. This could be due to antecedent cardiovascular injury prior to therapy or to risk factors induced by therapy. The recent introduction of a new generation of drugs with combined diuretic and hypotensive effects that reduce blood pressure without inducing the biochemical changes associated with thiazides, offers an opportunity to evaluate this question. Indapamide is the first of this new generation to be released. Its pharmacologic characteristics show that it has the prerequisites to be considered a first-line drug for use in hypertension. It meets the requirements of a Phase II or second generation drug in that it has similar efficacy, but less short term toxicity than first generation drugs. It has been introduced at a cost that is competitive with thiazides and potassium-sparing combination drugs and is cheaper than many other classes of antihypertensive drugs. The major caution in promoting its use is that its long term effect on morbidity and mortality in hypertensive disease has not yet been evaluated. In summary, this is a promising new drug that has the potential to replace first generation thiazides in the routine management of hypertension. 
5	The role of the iliolumbar ligament in the lumbosacral junction. The biomechanical function of the iliolumbar ligament in the human lumbosacral junction was investigated by analyzing the three-dimensional movements of the whole lumbar and lumbo-sacral-ilium specimens. The experiment was repeated in the following three conditions: 1) intact iliolumbar ligament, 2) right iliolumbar ligament transected, and 3) bilateral iliolumbar ligaments transected. The representative values of the increased motions, compared with intact, after transection of the bilateral iliolumbar ligaments were 1.7 degrees (23%) in flexion, 1.1 degrees (20%) in extension, 0.3 degrees (18%) in axial rotation, and 1.2 degrees (29%) in lateral bending. The most restricted motion governed by the iliolumbar ligament in the lumbosacral junction was lateral bending. The bilateral iliolumbar ligament specimen could restrict flexion and extension of the lumbosacral junction, but the unilateral iliolumbar ligament preparation alone could not restrict these motions. The iliolumbar ligament also had the function of restricting the rotational movement of the lumbosacral junction. 
2	Primary biliary cirrhosis. Quantitation of autoantibodies to purified mitochondrial enzymes and correlation with disease progression. Primary biliary cirrhosis is characterized by the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies. Recently, six of the autoantigens have been identified as components of the 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes located within mammalian mitochondria. Immunoblotting studies have shown that two of these components, namely E2 and protein X of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, are the major antigenic polypeptides recognized by autoantibodies. This study shows the development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect and quantitate antibodies to these two purified antigens. Coded serum samples from 166 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 140 patients with other liver and/or autoimmune disease, and 52 normal women were analyzed for reactivity using this immunoassay. These results indicate that this rapid, simple method has a 93% sensitivity and 96% specificity in the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis. The titer of immunoglobulin G autoantibodies correlated not only with antimitochondrial antibody titer measured by indirect immunofluorescence (P less than 0.0001) but also with histological stage of disease (P less than 0.04) and prognostic biochemical variables such as higher serum bilirubin and lower serum albumin levels (P = 0.038 and 0.028, respectively). There was no significant correlation between titer of autoantibodies and serum globulin or immunoglobulin G levels, indicating that the positive correlation with disease progression was not secondary to hypergammaglobulinemia. 
1	Point mutation, allelic loss and increased methylation of c-Ha-ras gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma. Somatic alterations of the c-Ha-ras gene were examined in 21 Japanese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Restriction endonuclease analysis by double digestion with MspI and HpaII revealed that DNAs from two of 21 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues were affected by nucleotide substitution at the twelfth amino acid coding sequence of the c-Ha-ras gene. DNAs from cirrhotic noncancerous liver tissue, but not leukocytes, of one of these patients possessed the mutation, whereas DNAs from noncirrhotic liver tissue and leukocytes of the other patient did not. In one of the nine patients harboring heterozygosity for c-Ha-ras-related BamHI-fragments, the loss of one allele was demonstrated as a somatic change not only in DNA from the tumor tissue but also in DNA from the cirrhotic nontumorous tissue. In two of the 19 patients comparatively examined for digestion patterns of c-Ha-ras locus with HpaII and MspI, extensive methylation was observed as a somatic modification in both DNAs from the tumor and the cirrhotic nontumorous tissues. These results thus indicate that the genetic lesions affecting the c-Ha-ras gene do occur in human hepatocellular carcinoma and probably serve as one of the multiple steps in the process of hepatic carcinogenesis. 
1	Basal cell-specific and hyperproliferation-related keratins in human breast cancer. In normal breast tissue and in noninvasive breast carcinomas, various keratin-14 antibodies were reactive predominantly with the basal/myoepithelial cell layer, although mainly in terminal and larger ducts luminal cells sometimes also were stained. A similar reaction pattern was found with an antibody directed against keratin 17, although this antibody was more often found negative than keratin 14 in the pre-existing myoepithelial cells in intraductal carcinomas. Furthermore antibodies reactive with hyperproliferation-related keratins 6 and 16 were used. One of these (LL025) was completely negative in normal breast tissue and noninvasive breast carcinomas. However 10% of the invasive carcinomas were diffusely or focally positive with this latter antibody, while in 18 of 115 cases of invasive breast carcinomas studied, a basal cell phenotype was detected. A relatively high concordance was found between the carcinomas immunostaining with the basal cell and the hyperproliferation-related keratins, but not between these markers and the proliferation marker Ki-67. This supports the conclusion that basal cells in breast cancer may show extensive proliferation, and that absence of Ki-67 staining does not mean that (tumor) cells are not proliferating. 
4	Ventricular responses to mental stress testing in patients with coronary artery disease. Pathophysiological implications. Recent research examining the effects of mental stress on left ventricular wall motion and/or ejection fraction has used four techniques to measure contractile function: radionuclide ventriculography, a stationary nuclear probe, two-dimensional echocardiography, and an ambulatory radionuclide left ventricular function monitor. This research has consistently revealed that mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia occurs frequently during laboratory stress testing, particularly among patients with exercise-induced ischemia. This ischemia is usually silent, occurs at low heart rate elevations but with significant blood pressure increases compared with exercise-induced ischemia, and is frequently not detected when electrocardiographic markers are used alone. Exploration of factors underlying differences between mental stress- and exercise-induced ischemia has provided a means for studying the complex pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia. 
3	Persistent segmental cutaneous anesthesia after a brown recluse spider bite. Patients with brown recluse spider bites commonly suffer from pain, muscular aching, and a variety of local dysesthesias during the acute and resolution phases of toxin-induced injury. This is our first well-documented observation of persistent cutaneous anesthesia caused by a spider bite. The anesthetic area conformed to the distribution of a specific nerve, the transverse cervical cutaneous nerve. The identification of the spider as a brown recluse and the location of the bite over the nerve's usual pathway strongly suggest that the venom was responsible for this complication. 
2	On-table pancreatography: importance in planning operative strategy. We describe our experience with 124 on-table pancreatograms performed during 117 operative procedures on 112 patients in a wide variety of clinical settings. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed on 84 occasions with a 73 per cent success rate for visualization of the main pancreatic duct. On-table pancreatography (OTP) was performed by one of five different techniques: retrograde, prograde or ambigrade ductography, cystography and ascending loopography after pancreaticojejunostomy. OTP provided important information about the main pancreatic duct when endoscopic visualization was unsuccessful (n = 23), incomplete (n = 17) or not performed (n = 33); there was a failure rate of 4 per cent. In 35 patients either the additional information or discrepancies between ERCP and OTP findings resulted in a change of operative plan (19 extra procedures, 16 altered procedures). Complete ductography was especially helpful in the 63 patients with chronic pancreatitis. OTP is technically simple, free from complications and invaluable for planning operative strategy. 
3	Sudden death and sleeping history among Finnish men. An autopsy was performed in 460 consecutive cases of sudden death among 35- to 76-year-old men. The closest cohabiting individual known to each decreased subject was interviewed. Snoring history was obtained in 321 of the 371 interviews. In 86 cases there was a history of 'habitual' (almost always or always) snoring, and 88 men snored 'often'. The mean age of subjects was 55.4 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.3 kg m-2. Among the obese snorers (n = 82), apnoeas had been observed 'occasionally', 'often', or 'habitually' in 49 cases. Death was classified as cardiovascular in 186 (40.4%) cases. Cardiovascular cause of death was more common among those who snored habitually or often than among those who snored occasionally or never (P less than 0.05). 'Habitual' snorers died more often while sleeping (P less than 0.05). Habitual snoring was found to be a risk factor for morning death (P less than 0.01). The possibility of obstructive sleep apnoea as a cause of sudden death should at least be considered if the decreased is known to have been a habitual snorer. 
2	Strongyloides stercoralis associated with a bleeding gastric ulcer. Infection with the helminthic parasite, Strongyloides stercoralis, is usually acquired by skin invasion (or occasionally via ingestion of larvae). After transformation to the adult form, the parasite preferentially localises in the small intestine, especially in the duodenal and jejunal part. A remarkable feature of Strongyloides is its property of endogenous reinfection. In the case of an immunocompromised host a massive infection, called hyperinfections Strongyloides, may occur. Numerous gastrointestinal complications of strongyloides infections, sometimes with a lethal outcome, have been reported. The intestinal manifestations are usually limited to the small bowel, and rarely involve the stomach. We report a patient with complicated strongyloides infection of the stomach. 
5	Transoesophageal pacing for perioperative control of neonatal paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The perioperative management of a 16-day-old infant with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is discussed. Vagal manoeuvres and medication were not adequate in controlling the SVT. Since the patient was scheduled for extensive surgery in the prone position, it was decided to use transoesophageal pacing as the method of choice for conversion of SVT. Transoesophageal pacing succeeded several times in overriding the SVT and restoring normal heart rate and haemodynamic variables. The advantages and disadvantages of various methods of treating SVT in the newborn are discussed. 
4	Cardiovascular sequelae of therapeutic thoracic radiation. Mediastinal radiation damages endothelial cells, with resulting loss of capillaries and ischemia at the level of the microcirculation. These changes lead to increases in collagen and proliferation of fibrous tissue throughout the heart. Cardiac dysfunction following radiotherapy is surprisingly common and may be due to pericardial, myocardial, valvular, conduction system, or coronary artery disease. Greater awareness of cardiotoxicity has prompted changes in radiation techniques that appear to reduce clinical cardiovascular complications. 
3	Platelet monoamine oxidase activity in female migraine patients. Platelet monoamine oxidase activity (MAO) in a group (n = 17) of white, female migraineurs during an acute migraine attack was similar to both the values obtained for the same group of patients two to three weeks after the headache episode (pain-free period) and to the results obtained for a group (n = 18) of sex and race-matched, age-comparable, drug-free healthy volunteers (blind study; substrate p-tyramine, 38.7 +/- 5.7, 41.9 +/- 8.8 and 43.0 +/- 3.4 or p-methoxybenzylamine, 178.9 +/- 11.3, 177.2 +/- 6.9 and 181.0 +/- 9.7 nmole/hr/10(9) platelets +/- SD respectively). With each patient serving as its own control, MAO activity during the migraine episode and when pain-free failed to show a significant trend. Neither a number of other medical conditions nor the use of several medications appeared to significantly influence our results. The present work, while dealing only with a small but well defined patient population, argues against the possible usefulness of platelet MAO activity as a biological marker for migraine headaches. 
4	Linking in accessory pathways. Functional loss of antegrade preexcitation. BACKGROUND. Concealed retrograde activation has been proposed as a mechanism for antegrade conduction block in the bundle branches and atrioventricular accessory pathways. We studied this hypothesis (linking) in 10 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in whom antegrade preexcitation could be persistently blocked by overdrive atrial pacing. METHODS AND RESULTS. An atrial pacing protocol, with a decremental ramp followed by an incremental ramp, defined a range of atrial paced cycle lengths (linking window) associated with both persistent conduction and block in the accessory pathway. Within the limits of the linking window, the ability of an atrial impulse to conduct over the accessory pathway was dependent on the preceding state (i.e., conduction or block). The observed linking window ranged from 70 to 290 msec (mean, 185 +/- 68 msec) and closely approximated the measured delay in retrograde activation of the accessory pathway during persistent antegrade block. The mean antegrade effective refractory period of the accessory pathways was long (486 +/- 156 msec), and in each case, it exceeded the antegrade refractory period of the normal atrioventricular pathway. Critically timed premature ventricular extrastimuli, delivered while linking was maintained in the accessory pathway, were able to interrupt the linking and restore antegrade accessory pathway conduction. CONCLUSIONS. These observations suggest that accessory pathway linking is associated with bidirectional block in the accessory pathway. The ability to initiate linking (and the stability of the phenomenon) depends on a critical relation between antegrade accessory pathway refractoriness and the magnitude of retrograde accessory pathway activation delay. 
1	Colorectal cancer: evidence for distinct genetic categories based on proximal or distal tumor location PURPOSE: To examine studies of normal colon and colorectal cancer for evidence that the location of the primary tumor proximal or distal to the splenic flexure of the colon may determine distinct genetic categories of this disease. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies were identified through a manual search of journals, through MEDLINE, and through review of bibliographies in identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Approximately 300 articles were examined. About 150 articles were excluded because tumor location was not reported or was reported in a way that did not permit correlation with results or conclusions. DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were selected either because the presentation of data permitted correlation of results with anatomic regions of the colon or because they were relevant to inherited colorectal cancer. RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS: Differences were noted in biologic properties of proximal and distal segments of normal fetal and adult colonic epithelium and in the epidemiologic, pathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular features of proximal and distal colorectal cancer. Some differences correlated with the features of inherited colorectal cancer (proximal, nonpolyposis or distal, and polyposis forms). CONCLUSIONS: Developmental and biologic differences in proximal and distal colon may reflect differing susceptibilities to neoplastic transformation. Differences in proximal and distal colorectal cancer suggest that each may arise through different pathogenetic mechanisms. Proximal tumors appear to represent a genetically more stable form of the disease and may arise through the same mechanisms that underlie inherited nonpolyposis colon cancer. Distal tumors show evidence of greater genetic instability and may develop through the same mechanisms that underlie polyposis-associated colorectal cancer syndromes. 
1	A comparison of induction and maintenance therapy for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in childhood: results of a Pediatric Oncology Group study. Two hundred fifty-six children with previously untreated acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) were evaluated on a Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) phase III randomized trial of both induction and continuation chemotherapies. Induction therapy compared vincristine, cytarabine, and dexamethasone (VADx) with daunorubicin, cytarabine, and thioguanine (DAT). The complete remission (CR) rate using DAT was superior (82% v 61%, P = .02). Postremission therapy consisted of either "standard" two-cycle therapy or a more intensive four-cycle regimen given for 2 years. Overall, there was no difference in outcome for patients randomized to either continuation regimen. The overall complete continuous remission rate (CCR) for the "best" induction/continuation therapy combination at 2 years was .50 (SE = .06), at 3 years was .35 (.04), and at 4 years was .34 (.05). Analysis of selected clinical and laboratory parameters demonstrated differences in induction responses favoring DAT induction but did not impact eventual disease-free survival. There were two subgroups of patients who responded better to four-cycle continuation therapy. These were patients with French-American-British (FAB) M1/M2 (2-year CCR was .20 v .44, P = .01) and patients older than 10 years at diagnosis (.32 v .62, P = .004). 
5	Pain relief achieved by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and/or vibratory stimulation in a case of painful legs and moving toes. A patient is described with painful legs and moving toes. The pain had been occurring for more than 15 years, and a variety of therapies had been attempted with only partial, if any, success. Only morphine had succeeded in relieving the pain, but it had to be discontinued to avoid tolerance and dependence. We devised a treatment consisting of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), vibratory stimulation (VS), and a combination of the two methods (TENS + VS). TENS brought about partial pain relief, but was less effective than VS; dual stimulation (TENS + VS) led to complete alleviation of the pain. Four months later, the patient was applying dual stimulation himself at home and was thus able to maintain complete relief with 3 or 4 weekly sessions. We suggest that dual stimulation results in a large-scale recruitment of large-diameter afferent fibres and may thus set up a powerful inhibitory control of nociception in our patient. 
3	Seizure outcome from anterior and complete corpus callosotomy. Eighty patients underwent anterior corpus callosotomy for treatment of generalized seizures. The patients' mean age was 18.3 years (range 4 to 53 years); the mean age at seizure onset was 5.27 years (range 0.1 to 27 years). The mean intelligence quotient (IQ) of 41 testable patients was 71.12 (range less than 30 to 114). The seizure outcome was as follows: 13% were seizure-free, 65% were significantly improved, and 22% were unchanged. Ten patients subsequently underwent a second operation to complete the callosal sectioning which resulted in additional seizure improvement in only five of them. Five complications resulted from 90 operations: two epidural hematomas, one delayed subdural hematoma, one bone-flap infection, and one postcallosotomy disconnection syndrome; two patients died. A younger age at onset of seizures, a higher IQ, and generalized tonic-clonic, atonic, complex-partial, and mixed seizure types were associated with improved seizure outcome. 
5	Immune functions during treatment of growth hormone-deficient children with biosynthetic human growth hormone. Immune functions, including cell surface markers, interleukin-2 receptor levels and responses of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation were evaluated in seven growth hormone deficient children ages 4-15 years, during treatment with biosynthetically derived human growth hormone. Treatment resulted in a decrease in % B cells and in % T total cells and also decreases in most individual patients' mitogen responses and interleukin-2 receptor levels. Most of the changes noted were transient and similar to those previously demonstrated during pituitary-derived human growth hormone treatment. Although not resulting in overt clinical manifestations in our patients, we think that potential interactions between growth hormone and immune functions need to be considered by physicians treating children with growth hormone. 
4	An assault on old friends: thiazide diuretics under siege. The adverse biochemical effects of thiazide use are of uncertain clinical significance. Thiazides raise LDL cholesterol only slightly in long-term studies and do not decrease HDL cholesterol. The evidence linking thiazide-induced hypokalemia with arrhythmias and sudden death is tenuous at best. Thiazide diuretics cause glucose intolerance, but no strong evidence has been advanced to suggest that this is dangerous. Because these effects are probably related to hypokalemia, a randomized trial comparing the effects of thiazides with thiazides plus a potassium-sparing diuretic on LDL cholesterol, ectopy on 48 hour ambulatory cardiac monitoring, fasting glucose and insulin, and post-glucose tolerance glucose and insulin would be of interest. The most compelling reason for continuing to use thiazides is that they have been shown in long-term randomized studies to reduce cardiovascular risk. Beta-blockers are the only other class of anti-hypertensive agent for which this claim can be made. The importance of long-term clinical trials in assessing the efficacy and toxicity of therapeutic agents is illustrated by the study that found clofibrate reduced cholesterol levels and coronary disease but increased total mortality. This finding remained undetected until a large randomized long-term trial was completed. Thiazide diuretics have not reduced the rate of coronary disease to the degree expected from epidemiologic studies, but the short length of the randomized trials may be responsible. It is not clear that other anti-hypertensive agents will be superior. Thiazides are less expensive than other anti-hypertensive agents being touted as metabolically safer; the cost issue is not a trivial matter. 
5	Use of a management plan for treating asthma in an emergency department. A standardised management protocol has been developed for the assessment and treatment of adults with acute asthma attending an emergency department. The management protocol consists of an assessment sheet for recording essential features of the history and examination findings and a flow diagram with guidelines for initial management that were based on spirometric recordings. The protocol was introduced at Wellington Hospital in 1986. The effect of this intervention was assessed by analysing emergency department records during the three months before and one year after the introduction of the protocol. The use of the assessment sheet improved history taking and led to the increased use of serial measures of airflow obstruction and improved documentation of follow up arrangements. The provision of management guidelines influenced the emphasis of management, including an increased use of corticosteroids intravenously and more frequent use of an additional dose of nebulised bronchodilator. In the light of the initial experience the protocol has been modified and its use either in an emergency department or in general practice is recommended. 
5	Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a pharmacologic study of five cases. Five children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (epilepsy, acquired aphasia, and continuous spike-wave discharges during sleep), were treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), sleep-modifying drugs, and corticosteroids. The pharmacologic profiles differed from those observed in focal epilepsies, resembling instead those of certain generalized epilepsies, such as West or Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. Phenobarbital (PB), carbamazepine (CBZ), and phenytoin (PHT) were ineffective or worsened the EEG and neuropsychological symptoms, whereas valproate (VPA), ethosuximide (ESM), and benzodiazepines were partially or transiently efficacious. Dextroamphetamine produced a dramatic but transient improvement in waking and sleep EEG in one of two children; aphasia did not change. Corticosteroid treatment resulted in improved speech, suppression of seizures, and normalization of the EEG in three of three children. Our own experience and data from the literature suggest that corticosteroids should be given in high doses as soon as the diagnosis is firmly established and should be continued in maintenance dose for several months or years to avoid escape. Early diagnosis, before mutism or global deterioration develops, appears to be essential for effective therapy with minimal neuropsychological sequelae. 
3	Antivenom therapy in Russell's viper bite. Bleeding and renal failure are the two main manifestations responsible for the high morbidity and mortality in untreated Russell's viper bite victims. This study was an effort to find prognostic factors and a practical therapeutic approach for the care of such patients. Early detection of abnormalities in the clot quality test and/or evidence of systemic bleeding followed by immediate correction of the clotting defects using specific antivenom can reduce morbidity in Russell's viper envenomation. 
5	Emergency portosystemic shunt in patients with variceal bleeding. Thirty-five patients for whom emergency sclerotherapy or conservative treatment, or both, failed to arrest variceal bleeding, or who had early rebleeding and required emergency portosystemic shunts (EPSS) were studied. EPSS permanently controlled the variceal bleeding in all but one patient. In this patient, the shunt was patent as demonstrated by angiography. Esophageal varices disappeared in 18 patients and were reduced in 14. Three patients died before the endoscopic examination could be performed. The causes of death were hepatic failure in two and bleeding ulcerations of the gastric fundus in the other patient. One patient was classified in Child's category B and two in Child's category C. Thirty-two patients submitted to EPSS and were discharged alive. Twelve of these patients subsequently died, at an average of 11.2 months after undergoing the shunt procedure. Four of 12 patients died of hepatic failure; two patients died of hepatomas; two, other neoplasia; three, hemorrhaging duodenal ulcers, and one patient, renal failure. Analysis of actuarial survival rates showed that the five year survival rate was 43 per cent. The long term survival rates were fewer for patients with Child's category C than for those with combined Child's categories A and B (five year survival rates were 21 versus 55 per cent; p less than 0.05). During the follow-up period, none of the patients had variceal bleeding. Chronic encephalopathy developed in six, which was mild in three, moderate in one instance and severe in two. It developed soon after EPSS, with onset in the first month after discharge in three. Thus, when conservative treatment fails to arrest variceal bleeding, EPSS should be performed to guarantee definitive control of hemorrhage and prolong the survival period. 
1	Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia complicating somatostatin therapy of Cushing's syndrome in a patient with metastatic pancreatic islet cell carcinoma and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Described is the case of a 73-yr-old woman with metastatic pancreatic islet carcinoma that manifested initially as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome followed by onset of endogenous Cushing's syndrome, who developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on therapy with a long-acting somatostatin analog. Although P. carinii pneumonia has been observed in patients with Cushing's syndrome associated with other conditions, this is the first reported case in a patient with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Heightened awareness of the possibility of opportunistic infections in patients receiving somatostatin therapy for Cushing's syndrome of any cause, particularly Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, may be warranted. 
2	Sexual and physical abuse in women with functional or organic gastrointestinal disorders. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of a history of sexual and physical abuse in women seen in a referral-based gastroenterology practice, to determine whether patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders report greater frequencies of abuse than do patients with organic gastrointestinal diseases, and to determine whether a history of abuse is associated with more symptom reporting and health care utilization. DESIGN: A consecutive sample of women seen in a university-based gastroenterology practice over a 2-month period was asked to complete a brief questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS: The self-administered questionnaire requested information about demographics, symptoms, health care utilization, and history of abuse. Physicians indicated the primary diagnosis for each patient and whether she had ever discussed having been sexually or physically abused. RESULTS: Of 206 patients, 89 (44%) reported a history of sexual or physical abuse in childhood or later in life; all but 1 of the physically abused patients had been sexually abused. Almost one third of the abused patients had never discussed their experiences with anyone; only 17% had informed their doctors. Patients with functional disorders were more likely than those with organic disease diagnoses to report a history of forced intercourse (odds ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.03 to 4.21) and frequent physical abuse (odds ratio, 11.39; CI, 2.22 to 58.48), chronic or recurrent abdominal pain (odds ratio, 2.06; CI, 1.03 to 4.12), and more lifetime surgeries (2.7 compared with 2.0 surgeries; P less than 0.03). Abused patients were more likely than nonabused patients to report pelvic pain (odds ratio, 4.05; CI, 1.41 to 11.69), multiple somatic symptoms (7.1 compared with 5.8 symptoms; P less than 0.001), and more lifetime surgeries (2.8 compared with 2.0 surgeries; P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found that a history of sexual and physical abuse is a frequent, yet hidden, experience in women seen in referral-based gastroenterology practice and is particularly common in those with functional gastrointestinal disorders. A history of abuse, regardless of diagnosis, is associated with greater risk for symptom reporting and lifetime surgeries. 
4	Low-dose aspirin does not influence the clinical course of women with mild pregnancy-induced hypertension. The effect of low doses of aspirin on women with mild pregnancy-induced hypertension was investigated by means of a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial. Forty-seven women hospitalized at 30-36 weeks' gestation because of mild pregnancy-induced hypertension were treated by a daily dose of either 100 mg aspirin or placebo. The mean blood pressure values, rates of development of severe preeclampsia, gestational ages at delivery, newborn weights, and 5-minute Apgar scores were similar in the aspirin-treated and the placebo-treated groups. We conclude that low-dose aspirin is not curative but is essentially a preventive treatment which, in order to be effective, should be started weeks before clinical signs of preeclampsia are present. 
5	Healing of experimental intestinal anastomoses. Parameters for repair. Anastomotic dehiscence remains a major complication in surgery of the large bowel, and studies on the healing sequence of experimental anastomoses are necessary to define underlying mechanisms and find ways to improve surgical outcome, particularly in high-risk situations. For the quantitative description of anastomotic repair, both mechanical and biochemical parameters are employed, each with their own limitations. Mechanical parameters, either bursting pressure or breaking strength, only reflect growing anastomotic strength as long as disruption occurs within the anastomotic area, which is less than one week after surgery for the bursting pressure and probably up to two weeks for the breaking strength. The biochemical description of anastomotic repair has been limited to behavior of collagen, as represented by its rather unique constituent amino acid hydroxyproline. Conclusions based on collagen concentrations--per unit weight--should be considered with caution since they may change as a consequence of changes in noncollagenous substances. In this respect, collagen content, per unit length, is probably a better parameter to describe anastomotic collagen levels. Few investigations have addressed the quality of collagen (e.g., crosslinking or type). Since, at this time, no distinct correlations have been demonstrated between development of mechanical strength or occurrence of leakage and collagen levels in the healing anastomosis, attention should not be restricted to a description of the quantity of collagen present: the quality of anastomotic collagen should be investigated, perhaps even more so. 
1	Papillary cystic neoplasm of the pancreas: radiological and pathological characteristics in 11 cases. Clinical charts, radiological features, macroscopic and microscopic findings, and clinical follow-up data were retrospectively reviewed in 11 patients with papillary cystic neoplasm of the pancreas (PCNP). The patients were nine women and two men, aged from 13 to 51 years with a mean age of 25 years. The greatest diameter of the PCNPs ranged from 2.5 cm to 14.0 cm with a mean size of 7.5 cm. Six tumours were located in the tail of the pancreas, two in the body and three in the head. Most patients complained of abdominal pain or a mass. Ultrasonographic and/or computed tomography findings showed five solid, four mixed (solid and cystic) and two cystic types of tumour. Angiographically, PCNP was either a hypovascular or mild hypervascular mass with a displacement of the surrounding vessels. No vascular encasement was seen. Macroscopically all 11 tumours consisted of a well defined solid mass with degenerative change of various widths, including haemorrhage, necrosis or dystrophic calcification, and were represented by three radiological types of PCNP. The 11 patients with PCNP survived for from 3 to 253 months after curative resection without any signs of local recurrence or remote metastasis. PCNP usually affects the distal portion of the pancreas of young women. Despite its huge size, PCNP should be explored with aggressive surgical intent because of the inherently good prognosis. 
3	Alteration of platelet serotonin in patients with chronic tension-type headache during cold pressor test. Change of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentrations in platelets from patients with chronic tension-type headache (TH) and controls were observed during cold pressor test (CPT). Before cold stimulation, 5-HT concentrations in platelets from patients with TH were significantly lower than those found in controls. One minute after the start of cold stimulation, 5-HT levels in platelets from patients with TH were significantly much lower than in the controls, as control levels rose and TH levels fell. The results show that, under stress, the absorbance of 5-HT into the platelets in patients with TH is reduced. It is suggested that, in patients with TH, there are abnormalities of 5-HT uptake into platelets and factors which cause release of 5-HT from platelets. 
4	Treatment of congenital coronary arteriovenous malformations with micro-particle embolization. The successful treatment of a symptomatic coronary arteriovenous malformation (CAVM) by a percutaneous embolization technique with micro-particles is described. Objective evidence of ischemia and its subsequent disappearance after embolization is presented. The embolization technique and possible indications and contraindications are discussed. 
4	The dynamics of antegrade cardioplegia with simultaneous coronary sinus occlusion. Effects on aortic root infusion pressure, coronary sinus pressure, and myocardial cooling. It has been suggested that antegrade cardioplegia with coronary sinus occlusion improves homogeneous myocardial cooling and reduces myocardial injury in the presence of coronary artery occlusion. Little data are available on the exact relationships among the basic elements or this intervention, including antegrade infusion rate, aortic root pressure, the degree of coronary sinus occlusion, coronary sinus pressure, and myocardial cooling. The purpose of this study was to determine these relationships and to provide some basic guidelines for better understanding of this intervention. Twenty-two sheep were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, the distal left anterior descending artery was occluded, and the proximal coronary sinus was snared. Sixteen combinations of infusion rate (3, 5, 7, or 9 ml/kg/min) and coronary sinus occlusion (total, subtotal, or moderate occlusion or no occlusion) were adopted for each 2 minutes of antegrade cardioplegia, yielding 96 measurements. Myocardial temperatures in the occluded and nonoccluded regions, aortic root infusion pressure, and coronary sinus pressure were measured during each infusion of cardioplegic solution. Coronary sinus occlusion was then released, and the whole heart was reperfused for 30 minutes for another infusion of cardioplegic solution and measurements. Results showed good degrees of linearity between infusion rate and aortic root infusion pressure for all coronary sinus occlusion and noninfusion groups (p less than 0.01). A positive effect of coronary sinus occlusion on aortic root infusion pressure was observed. The graded increases in infusion rate with various degrees of coronary sinus occlusion were constantly associated with elevation of coronary sinus pressure (p less than 0.01). It was also noted that myocardial temperatures in the region of the occluded left anterior descending artery were significantly lower in coronary sinus occlusion groups than in nonocclusion groups (p less than 0.01 or 0.05). Myocardial temperature in the nonoccluded region decreased significantly with the stepwise increases in infusion rate (p less than 0.01), but not with the increases in coronary sinus occlusion (not significant). Based on this and previous studies, we recommend that the induced coronary sinus pressure be safely maintained in the range of 25 to 35 mm Hg and that further studies be focused on the infusion rate of 5 ml/kg/min with subtotal or total coronary sinus occlusion for the intervention of antegrade cardioplegia plus coronary sinus occlusion. 
3	Risk factors for metastases in patients with retinoblastoma. The study is based upon a review of data from 583 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma over the years 1956 to 1986. Mean follow-up was 8 years, and median was 5.5 years. In 41 patients, metastases developed within 5 years. The influence of clinical and histopathologic risk factors on the occurrence of metastases was first analyzed by univariate tests. Significant variables were then reevaluated using the Cox proportional hazards method. Four factors were found to be independently associated with the development of metastases: optic nerve invasion with and without involvement of the resection line, choroidal invasion and enucleation of an affected eye more than 120 days after initial diagnosis. The 5-year metastatic risks associated with these factors were 67%, 13%, 8%, and 4%, respectively. The relative risk estimate, calculated from the Cox model, was used for a score classification with groups of low, medium, and high metastatic risk. The 5-year incidence of metastases was 4%, 43%, and 68%, respectively. 
4	Digital cutaneous vascular responses to histamine and neuropeptides in Raynaud's phenomenon. The pathophysiology of Raynaud's phenomenon is not well defined, but active cutaneous microvascular vasoconstriction and emptying must occur to account for the pallor and are reasons for studying the microvasculature. It has been proposed that there may be a defect in a local histamine vasodilator mechanism. The role of the peptidergic nervous system in Raynaud's phenomenon has not been previously investigated. To study the histaminergic and peptidergic axes in Raynaud's phenomenon, we measured the cutaneous microvascular responses of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon to digital intradermal injections of saline, histamine, the histamine-releasing agent, compound 48/80, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide. We compared these results with those obtained in normal subjects. Intradermal cutaneous microvascular blood flow responses were quantified by planimetry and laser Doppler flowmetry. The results show: a) that in primary Raynaud's phenomenon there is no evidence of local deficiency in histamine release or insensitivity to histamine in the cutaneous microvasculature; and b) that patients with Raynaud's phenomenon react normally to the neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, providing a rationale for treating Raynaud's phenomenon with vasoactive peptides. 
5	A comparison of host responses of the Mongolian jird to infections of Brugia malayi and B. pahangi. Host responses of jirds receiving a single subcutaneous inoculation of subperiodic Brugia malayi were compared with those of jirds similarly infected with B. pahangi. Parasite burdens, lymphatic lesion severity, granulomatous reactivity, antibody responses to parasite antigens, and complete blood cell counts were assessed at 60 and 150 days post-inoculation. At 60 days post-inoculation, percentages of adults recovered at necropsy and lymphatic lesion severity were greater in B. pahangi-infected jirds. At 150 days post-inoculation, lesion severity and percentages of worms recovered were similar in both infections. No significant differences were noted in either infection in reactivity to homologous or heterologous parasite antigens in any parameter measured. Similarities in the kinetics of the inflammatory reactivities of the 2 infections suggest that previous observations made in the jird-B. pahangi model could be utilized in designing studies using B. malayi. Further, the more marked lesion severity observed in B. pahangi-infected jirds and the relative ease of maintaining B. pahangi in the laboratory support the continued use of this system as a conceptual model for the study of lymphatic lesion pathogenesis. 
5	Electron-microscopic identification of pseudoexfoliation material in extrabulbar tissue. The structure and distribution of pseudoexfoliation material in extrabulbar tissues from five eyes with typical unilateral intraocular pseudoexfoliation syndrome and two intraocularly unaffected fellow eyes were examined by transmission electron microscopy. In all seven eyes, unevenly distributed pseudoexfoliation aggregates were found in limbal conjunctivae, extraocular rectus and oblique muscles, orbital connective-tissue septa, and the walls of the posterior ciliary arteries, vortex veins, and central retinal vessels passing through the optic nerve sheaths. Typical pseudoexfoliation fibers occurred in close association with connective-tissue components, especially elastic fibers; a moderate predisposition of pseudoexfoliation clumps to accumulate around blood vessels was observed. The findings of pseudoexfoliation material in similar extrabulbar locations in intraocularly uninvolved fellow eyes indicates that pseudoexfoliation fiber formation outside the globe precedes its intraocular manifestation. The intermingling of pseudoexfoliation fibers, microfibrils, and elastic and collagen fibers suggests that pseudoexfoliation fiber formation might result from a disordered synthesis and/or assembly of connective-tissue microfibrils. 
5	Retroperitoneal fibrosis after surgery for aortic aneurysm in a patient with periarteritis nodosa: successful treatment with corticosteroids. A 54-year-old man with hepatitis B virus-related periarteritis nodosa developed retroperitoneal fibrosis with bilateral hydronephrosis 2.5 months after placement of an aortobifemoral prosthesis for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Retroperitoneal fibrosis disappeared after treatment with corticosteroids. This observation is interesting in the light of the hypothesis that retroperitoneal fibrosis is caused by vasculitis. 
5	Injuries of the external ear. Ear injuries occur in people of all ages but predominate in active people such as wrestlers, boxers, and bike riders. The types and extent of injury are a function of the force causing the injury. Shearing forces of moderate intensity cause hematoma formation, whereas greater force causes lacerations or even amputation. Sharp objects cause lacerations determined by the force, direction, and point of impact. The high ratio of surface area to mass makes the auricle vulnerable to extremes of temperature. People participating in high-risk activities should wear protective headgear. The goal of treatment is to restore the normal contours while preventing infection. Hematoma results in disfigurement by organization or chondritis. Evacuation and pressure dressings using sterile technique correct the condition. Second-degree burns are treated by regular cleansing and application of topical antimicrobials. Deeper burns require debridement, biologic dressings, or burying the cartilage subcutaneously for later reconstruction. Simple lacerations are closed under aseptic technique using either skin-to-skin sutures only or sutures of the skin combined with intercartilage sutures. Extensive and complex lacerations require meticulous care to match all fragments and prevent infection or loss of tissue. Bare cartilage must be covered with vascularized tissue. The treatment of total amputation is controversial. Some advocate reattachment as a composite graft using intravenous low molecular weight dextrans and heparin as adjuvants. Mladick dermabrades the amputated pinna, reattaches it with sutures, and then slips it into a pocket of elevated postauricular skin for 2 weeks. Others urge microvascular reanastomosis of the small nutrient vessels. Brent and Byrd separate the cartilage from its overlying skin and envelope it first with vascularized temporoparietal fascia and then a split-thickness skin graft. Chondritis is the most feared complication of injury or surgery of the pinna. It is an aggressive process, and prompt removal of pus and necrotic cartilage is required. Exteriorization and removal of all cartilage is effective but disfiguring. Removal of only affected cartilage and constant irrigation with antibiotic solutions is effective but requires prolonged hospitalization. Iontophoresis of antibiotics into the auricle may be effective and conserve tissue. Traumatic deformities are corrected with composite grafts from the opposite ear, costal cartilage, and local pedicled flaps.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
1	DNA and RNA flow cytometric study in multiple myeloma. Clinical correlations. Flow cytometric studies of cellular DNA and RNA content using the acridine-orange technique were conducted in 81 patients with multiple myeloma (MM). All patients were treated with the M-2 protocol and clinical response was evaluated according to the criteria of the Chronic Leukemia-Myeloma Task Force. Aneuploid DNA stemlines were found in 38.2% of untreated patients with a median DNA index (DNA-I) of 1.15 in marrow aspirates and 1.22 in biopsy specimens. The median percentage of cells with abnormal DNA content was 31.5 (aspirates) and 35 (biopsy specimens) and a positive correlation with the percentage of bone marrow plasma cells was observed. Significantly higher proliferation (S-phase) was found in marrow biopsy specimens as compared with marrow aspirates. Significantly higher RNA content (RNA index [RNA-I]) was observed in aneuploid versus diploid patients in biopsy material. There was no difference in response to the Memorial Hospital M-2 protocol between diploid and aneuploid patients. In patients with DNA-I greater than 1.15 remission duration was shorter as compared with DNA-I less than or equal to 1.15. Furthermore, no difference in cellular RNA content was noted between responders and nonresponders. This study demonstrates no correlation between cellular RNA content and response, as previously described for patients treated with vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone (VAD), but DNA aneuploidy appears to be an adverse prognostic factor in MM patients treated with the M-2 protocol. It also demonstrates that prognostic models for MM are not universal but depend on the chemotherapeutic regimen used. 
2	Treatment of duodenitis with cimetidine: a clinical, endoscopic, and histologic study. We studied the effectiveness of cimetidine in the treatment of endoscopically diagnosed duodenitis. Sixty-nine patients with the solitary endoscopic finding of duodenitis (6% of 1,200 patients who underwent fiberoptic endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract in our unit over 3 years) were studied retrospectively: a good clinical response was apparent in 45 of 69 patients treated with cimetidine (65%), and a fair response in another four (6%). In a controlled, randomized prospective study, we evaluated the effectiveness of cimetidine in duodenitis. Statistically significant improvement for the clinical and endoscopic scores was found in 10 patients treated with cimetidine (p less than 0.01). Improvement in the histologic score did not reach statistical significance. No such improvement was demonstrated in seven placebo-treated patients. We believe that duodenitis is a "peptic syndrome," has a good response to cimetidine treatment, and behaves much like duodenal ulcer disease. 
5	The effects of tumor necrosis factor on intestinal structure and metabolism. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a polypeptide produced predominantly by activated macrophages, is an important mediator of sepsis. We analyzed the specific metabolic changes that occur in the gut following TNF administration. Following general anesthesia, hemodynamic and metabolic indices were measured serially in control dogs (n = 7) and animals receiving a continuous sublethal intravenous infusion of TNF (0.57.10(5) IU/kg/6 hours, n = 7). During TNF infusion mean arterial pressure gradually decreased despite fluid administration, which maintained wedge pressure and cardiac index, which were similar to control animals. While TNF significantly reduced intestinal blood flow to 12 +/- 3 mL/min/kg compared to 28 +/- 3 mL/min/kg (p less than 0.01) in controls, intestinal oxygen consumption was maintained due to an increased extraction rate. Despite hypoperfusion the intestinal exchange of metabolic substrate (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, alanine, glutamine, glutamate, and ammonia) was comparable between the control and TNF-infused animals. However, when substrate carbon balance across the intestinal tract was calculated, it appeared that there was a limitation in fuel availability in the TNF animals. This may be due to competition for fuel between the gut and other major organs. Fuel limitation may jeopardize rapid cell proliferation and mucosal repair and with regional hypoperfusion these processes may account for the mucosal ulcerations observed at the termination of the study. 
5	Intravascular stents. General principles and status of lower-extremity arterial applications. The two major types of intravascular stents are balloon expandable and self-expanding. Many animal and, more recently, clinical studies have begun to delineate the real and potential roles of stents. Although the ideal intravascular stent does not exist, it is possible to identify characteristics of the hypothetical ideal stent. Iliac and femoropopliteal arterial applications of metallic stents are reviewed. Stents have proved useful in postangioplasty elastic recoil, in some cases of postangioplasty restenosis, and in angioplasty-induced dissection. Their role in primary angioplasty procedures is still uncertain, although in iliac angioplasty the immediate hemodynamic effects of angioplasty plus stenting are superior to those of angioplasty alone. It is clear that metallic stents have not solved the problem of postangioplasty restenosis, as restenosis still occurs in a significant number of cases. This problem is particularly evident in the femoropopliteal stent procedures, in which angiographic restenosis (more than 50% single diameter stenosis) at 6 months after treatment has occurred in approximately 30% of cases. The existence of poststenting restenosis, which often involves the stented segment, underscores the need for better drug regimens in angioplasty and for better understanding of the intimal fibrocellular proliferative response of the vessel wall to injury. Although potentially very useful, biodegradable stents are still a dream whose realization will demand the development of better materials. 
5	Tympano-cartilago-stapediopexy: a method to improve hearing in open technique tympanoplasty. Canal wall-down technique tympanoplasty was indicated in about 41 per cent of our cases with chronic suppurative otitis media. In this series done during the last four years, of 576 tympanoplasties, 240 cases needed type III tympanoplasty. In 145 cases, myringostapediopexy was carried out using temporalis fascia grafting over the head of the stapes. Tympano-cartilago-stapediopexy was performed in the other 95 cases by using tragal cartilage and perichondrium over the stapes. A comparison between the results of both methods of grafting is discussed. Improvement in hearing was achieved after tympano-cartilago-stapediopexy. This method proved to be suitable for those cases which need open technique tympanoplasty. 
1	The growth inhibition of human breast cancer cells by a novel synthetic progestin involves the induction of transforming growth factor beta. Recent experimental work has identified a novel intracellular binding site for the synthetic progestin, Gestodene, that appears to be uniquely expressed in human breast cancer cells. Gestodene is shown here to inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion, but has no effect on endocrine-responsive human endometrial cancer cells. Gestodene induced a 90-fold increase in the secretion of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) by T47D human breast cancer cells. Other synthetic progestins had no effect, indicating that this induction is mediated by the novel Gestodene binding site and not by the conventional progesterone receptor. Furthermore, in four breast cancer cell lines, the extent of induction of TGF-beta correlated with intracellular levels of Gestodene binding site. No induction of TGF-beta was observed with the endometrial cancer line, HECl-B, which lacks the Gestodene binding site, but which expresses high levels of progesterone receptor. The inhibition of growth of T47D cells by Gestodene is partly reversible by a polyclonal antiserum to TGF-beta. These data indicate that the growth-inhibitory action of Gestodene may be mediated in part by an autocrine induction of TGF-beta. 
4	Tetralogy of Fallot with anomalous pulmonary venous connections: a rare but clinically important association. Anomalous pulmonary venous connections were found in seven (0.6%) of 1183 patients with tetralogy of Fallot. Three patients had totally anomalous connections (one supracardiac, one direct to coronary sinus, and one mixed supracardiac and infracardiac) and four patients had partially anomalous pulmonary venous connections. All patients presented with the clinical features of tetralogy of Fallot. Anomalous pulmonary venous drainage was suspected clinically in only one patient in whom there was a scimitar sign on the chest radiograph. The exact diagnosis was established by cross sectional echocardiography (one), preoperative or postoperative angiography (five), or at necropsy (one). Surgery was performed in six patients. Total correction without re-routing of the anomalously draining veins was successful in all those with partially anomalous connections, with no significant long term sequelae (follow up median 17 years). Of those with totally anomalous connections, the full diagnosis was made only at necropsy in one patient, successful one-stage correction was performed in one, and the other patient, who had partially obstructed mixed drainage, died shortly after one-stage correction. Histological examination of the lung biopsy specimen in this patient showed grade 2 pulmonary vascular disease. Tetralogy of Fallot with anomalous pulmonary venous connections is a rare association. Careful preoperative assessment is required in those with totally anomalous connections. 
1	New findings in treatment of colon cancer. Patients with colon cancer involving regional lymph nodes (stage C disease) have a 5-year survival rate of only 30% to 40%, and the majority die of recurrent disease. Recent trials have shown increased survival rates with postoperative use of fluorouracil plus levamisole. The authors discuss these findings and the implications on treatment recommendations for stage C colon cancer. 
5	Chronic postoperative endophthalmitis associated with Actinomyces species. Actinomyces species, gram-positive, non-spore-forming anaerobic bacilli were isolated from intraocular fluid obtained from four otherwise healthy patients with a delayed onset of postoperative endophthalmitis. One patient had a mixed anaerobic infection with recovery of both Actinomyces israelii and Propionibacterium acnes. In all four patients, early postoperative visual acuity was good but was eventually markedly reduced by intraocular inflammation that was first observed between 21 days and 4 months following uneventful extracapsular cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. Inflammation was characterized by anterior segment and vitreous cellular debris in all cases. All eyes responded to therapy that included intraocular, topical, and systemic antibiotics as well as pars plana vitrectomy and partial iridectomy. These cases further illustrate the need for microbiologic investigation, including anaerobic cultures, in all cases of chronic postoperative inflammation following extracapsular cataract extraction, regardless of the time of onset. 
4	Cavernous hemangioma of the spinal cord: report of 2 unusual cases. We present 2 cases of spinal cord intramedullary cavernous hemangioma; 1 patient is the 1st reported case of multiple spinal cord lesions. Diagnosis is greatly enhanced by the use of MRI. 
4	Home blood pressure readings in borderline hypertensive patients. Home blood pressure monitoring can provide valuable information for physicians managing borderline hypertensive patients. This study was conducted to compare office and home blood pressures in 36 borderline hypertensive subjects, and to determine the accuracy of the home monitoring unit used. The patients were very willing to record their home blood pressures for an extended period of time. The home blood pressure monitors were found to be quite accurate, and blood pressures measured at home were significantly lower than readings obtained in the office. In 39% (14 of 36) of the subjects studied, the average home blood pressures were more than 10 mmHg lower than their office readings. These findings support the hypothesis that home blood pressure monitoring can be useful in the management of borderline hypertensive patients. 
3	Correlation of abnormalities of interictal n-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission tomography with focus of seizure onset in complex partial seizure disorders. Single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) scanning with n-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) was performed on 23 patients with complex partial seizures undergoing long-term video electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure monitoring. Twenty-one of the 23 patients had abnormalities on SPECT scanning consisting of areas of decreased activity reflecting diminished cerebral blood flow. In 15 of these 21 patients, there was good correlation between the site of the abnormality on SPECT scan and the site of origin of seizures monitored by EEG. Of the six remaining patients, four had multifocal SPECT abnormalities, with one of the abnormal areas corresponding with an ictal site. The two remaining patients had SPECT abnormalities and major ictal EEG foci in entirely different areas. In contrast to the high proportion of abnormal SPECT scans, only 10 of 23 focal abnormalities were discovered on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Three patients who had seizures within 2 h of an initial scan were rescanned 4-5 h after injection. Focal areas of increased blood flow were noted on all three scans, although not always at the ictal site. The SPECT scan appears to be useful in interictal localization of seizure foci. Postictal scans may also be useful, although our numbers are too small to draw conclusions. 
3	Study of verbal description in neuropathic pain. The aim of this paper is to study the quality of verbal description and its diagnostic value in neuropathic pain. The verbal description of pain as assessed by a French adjective list questionnaire (QDSA) is compared between a group of 100 patients with neuropathic pain and a mixed group of 97 chronic benign and cancer non-neuropathic pain patients. Seventeen descriptors of the 61 QDSA descriptors have a significant intergroup frequency difference. By principal component analysis and Varimax rotation of the intercorrelation matrix of descriptors in the neuropathic group. 7 factors accounting for 66.0% of the total variance are derived. Six factors reflect purely sensory or affective aspects of the pain experience. Seven descriptors from the discriminant analysis function correctly assign 77% of neuropathic pain patients and 81% of the non-neuropathic pain patients. In a second neuropathic pain group of 32 patients, the discriminant function coefficient permits correct diagnostic categorization in 66% of the cases. Implications for clinical practice and trials are discussed. 
3	Feasibility and safety of vagal stimulation in monkey model. The feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of chronic vagal stimulation were studied in an aluminagel monkey model. Pilot studies to perfect the equipment, determine stimulation thresholds, and insure the comfort and safety of the animals preceded this study. Four monkeys were equipped with an indwelling, 2-electrode cuff (titanium bands spaced 7 mm apart; silicone encased; 1.5 cm total length) in contact around the right vagus nerve; avoidance of the cardiac branch was confirmed by electrocardiograms. After postsurgical recovery, the intact and awake animals received constant-current stimulation (5 mA; 83 Hz, 143 Hz, or 50-250 Hz randomly; 0.5-ms pulse width) at the onset of every spontaneous seizure for the duration of the seizure or every 3 h for 40 s if stimulation had not occurred in the preceding hour. Stimulation periods of 2-6 weeks, with differing levels of stimulation, were preceded and followed by at least a 2-week baseline period of no stimulation. During the stimulation periods, the seizure rate decreased to zero in two monkeys and the interseizure intervals became invariable in the remaining two monkeys. These effects carried over temporarily into the poststimulation baseline periods. Vagal stimulation had no consistent effects on seizure severity or EEG interictal spikes. Histological studies of six vagus nerves were unable to separate electrode cuff damage from any direct effects stimulation may have had on the nerves. Although it appears that chronic vagal stimulation is feasible and that epileptogenic processes are influenced, the safety and efficacy of the procedure are still in question. 
4	Effect of ischemia reperfusion or hypoxia reoxygenation on lung vascular permeability and resistance. The effect of ischemia reperfusion or hypoxia reoxygenation on pulmonary vascular permeability and resistance was studied in 25 isolated blood-perfused dog lungs. Vascular permeability, assessed by determining filtration coefficient (Kf), and vascular resistances were measured at the beginning and end of the experiment. Ischemia reperfusion was produced by occluding blood flow to the lung for 3 h and reperfusing for 1 h, whereas hypoxia reoxygenation was obtained by ventilating the lung with 95% N2-5% CO2 for 3 h and then ventilating with 95% O2-5% CO2 for 1 h with no interruption of perfusion. There was a significant increase in Kf in both ischemia reperfusion and hypoxia reoxygenation groups (51 and 85%, respectively), and total vascular resistance increased greatly in both groups (386 and 532%, respectively). Two additional groups were also studied in which the ischemia reperfusion or hypoxia reoxygenation lungs were pretreated with allopurinol (20 micrograms/ml). The Kf did not significantly increase in either the allopurinol ischemia reperfusion or the allopurinol hypoxia reoxygenation groups (22 and 6%, respectively). However, total vascular resistance significantly increased in both groups (239 and 224%, respectively). Although vascular permeability is modestly increased by both ischemia reperfusion and hypoxia reoxygenation, the predominant change in these conditions is the increased vascular resistance, which predominantly affects the postcapillary resistance and would result in a greater tendency for edema to develop in these slightly damaged lungs. Allopurinol, which inhibits xanthine oxidase, attenuated the permeability changes in both groups and may be useful in preventing ischemia reperfusion injury in certain conditions. 
1	A hepatocellular carcinoma of massive arterioportal shunts without tumor stain treated with CDDP two-route chemotherapy--a case report. Massive arterioportal shunts without tumor vessels or tumor stain are sometimes encountered in advanced cases of liver cirrhosis. Massive arterioportal shunts without tumor stain that responded well to intensive chemotherapy with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II are reported. 
3	Differentiation in embryonal neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system. Ninety-six embryonal neuroectodermal tumors were studied histologically and immunohistologically with a panel of antibodies including glial, neuronal, epithelial, mesodermal, and myelin markers. In 71 tumors there was glial and neuronal differentiation and expression both of an S (photoreceptor) antigen and vimentin. In five tumors there was only glial differentiation and in 20 tumors only neuronal differentiation. No reactivity for myelin and epithelial markers was found. Histologic and immunohistologic findings identified various degrees of differentiation in different tumors, which was bipolar (glial and neuronal) in most tumors and unipolar in the remainder. The authors suggest that their findings may be the result of normal or aberrant oncogenic differentiation, agreeing with the nomenclature of the World Health Organization classification for these tumors with and the inclusion of a category for ependymoblastoma. 
5	Association of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) with herpes zoster. Ogilvie's syndrome, or acute pseudo-obstruction of the colon is characterized by massive distension of the colon in the absence of organic distal obstruction. The syndrome is associated with various unrelated and, most often, extra-abdominal causes. An association between Ogilvie's syndrome and herpes zoster has been reported only once, by Ceccese et al. in 1985. We present a second such case. This patient did not show evidence of any active illness other than the involvement of the T10 dermatome by herpes zoster. The patient's symptoms of colonic obstruction subsided with resolution of the zosteriform rash. 
5	Heparin skin necrosis: delayed occurrence in a patient on hemodialysis. A case of skin necrosis in a patient receiving intravenous (IV) heparin during routine intermittent hemodialysis is reported. Multiple erythematous, tender lesions developed over the abdomen and thighs and rapidly became necrotic. Biopsies showed fibrin thrombi in the dermal venules and capillaries, but no cellular infiltrate. The patient was in her third month of regular hemodialysis. Skin necrosis associated with the use of heparin usually occurs within 2 weeks of beginning heparin therapy and has not been reported in patients receiving heparin with hemodialysis. Possible mechanisms, including acquired antithrombin III deficiency leading to heparin-induced skin necrosis, are discussed. 
5	Nimodipine after resuscitation from out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial. One hundred fifty-five consecutive patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation by a physician-manned advanced life support unit were randomly assigned to receive nimodipine or placebo at a dosage of 10 micrograms/kg as an intravenous injection immediately after restoration of spontaneous circulation, followed by an infusion of 0.5 micrograms/kg per minute for 24 hours. No significant difference was found in the 1-year survival rate of nimodipine-treated (30 [40%] of 75 patients) and placebo-treated patients (29 [36%] of 80 patients). Recurrent ventricular fibrillation during the treatment occurred in one patient in the nimodipine group compared with 12 patients in the placebo group. In a post hoc analysis of patients with very long delays in advanced life support (more than 10 minutes), the 1-year survival rate was higher with nimodipine (eight [47%] of 17 patients) than with placebo (two [8%] of 26 patients). Nimodipine may be of benefit in patients with delayed resuscitation. 
4	Cardiac arrhythmias from a malpositioned Greenfield filter in a traumatic quadriplegic. A case study is presented of premature Greenfield filter discharge with intracardiac migration and resulting life-threatening arrhythmias. These arrhythmias also interfered with the patient's transition from ventilatory support via orotracheal intubation to noninvasive positive airway pressure ventilatory support methods. The patient's arrhythmias were controlled by a demand cardiac pacemaker and cardiac glycoside therapy. No anticoagulants were used. She had no further filter migration nor significant complications for 16 months after hospital discharge. 
1	Secreted or nonsecreted forms of acidic fibroblast growth factor produced by transfected epithelial cells influence cell morphology, motility, and invasive potential. Addition of exogenous acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) to NBT-II epithelial carcinoma cells results in fibroblastic transformation and cell motility. We have generated aFGF-producing NBT-II cells by transfection with recombinant expression vectors containing human aFGF cDNA, or the human aFGF cDNA coupled to a signal peptide (SP) sequence. The effects of the nonsecreted and the secreted 16-kDa growth factor on the morphology, motility, and cell invasive potential (gelatinase activity) were compared. aFGF coupled to a SP was actively secreted out of the producing cells. The secretion of aFGF was not necessary for induction of gelatinase activity, as this was observed in NBT-II cells producing aFGF with or without SP. Production of aFGF, whether secreted or not secreted, resulted in increased in vitro motility of most isolated clones; however, there was no correlation between aFGF level and motility rate. The data suggest that expression of aFGF in NBT-II cells induces metastatic potential through an autocrine or intracrine mechanism. 
4	Pneumococcal anticapsular antibodies in patients with chronic cardiovascular and obstructive lung disease in The Netherlands. Differences in pneumococcal anticapsular antibody concentrations were assessed among patients with various chronic disorders and among young (25-35 years of age) and older adults (55-65 years). Antibody concentrations were determined by ELISA, using the whole 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine as antigen. No differences in mean or distribution of serum antibody concentrations were found among young adults (either healthy or asthmatic) or among older adults (healthy or with chronic obstructive pulmonary or chronic cardiovascular disease). Each group included individuals with low antibody levels. Therefore, the enhanced susceptibility to pneumococcal infections reported for some groups at risk, that is, elderly individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary or chronic cardiovascular disease, cannot be attributed solely to low anticapsular antibody concentrations. 
5	The iris in Williams syndrome. Forty three children with Williams syndrome and 124 control subjects had their eyes photographed. The photographs were examined by three ophthalmologists and four geneticists of varying experience. A stellate pattern was noted more often in the irides of patients with Williams syndrome (51%) than in those of the control subjects (12%), and was more difficult to detect, or was absent, in heavily pigmented irides. We conclude that the stellate pattern is of diagnostic importance, particularly if the pattern is carefully defined and the clinician is experienced. 
1	Breast self-examination in relation to the occurrence of advanced breast cancer. Two hundred nine female enrollees of the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound who developed advanced-stage breast cancer during the period 1982-1988 were interviewed about their practice of breast self-examination (BSE), use of other breast cancer screening modalities, and medical and reproductive histories. Each subject's description of how she performed the examination was scored according to her mention of up to 10 recommended BSE techniques. A random sample of 433 women without advanced-stage breast cancer from the same population was interviewed for comparison. Relative to women not practicing BSE, the risk of advanced-stage breast cancer among BSE users was 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.73-1.81). Frequency of BSE did not differ between women with advanced-stage breast cancer and control subjects, whether in all subjects or in subgroups defined by age, use of mammography, or frequency of clinical breast examinations. While self-described proficiency in BSE was generally low in both case and control subjects, the small percentage of women reporting more thorough self-examinations, regardless of frequency, had about a 35% decrease in the occurrence of advanced-stage breast cancer compared to women who did not perform BSE. These results suggest that, while carefully performed BSE may avoid the development of some advanced-stage breast cancers, BSE as practiced by most Seattle-area women is of little or no benefit. 
4	A consensus approach to electrolytes and blood pressure. Could we all be right? This commentary sets forth the hypothesis that the putative beneficial or detrimental effects of specific electrolytes on blood pressure regulation in fact reflect highly integrated responses to interactions among these cationic and anionic species. In this paradigm, the impact of any given intake of an electrolyte on arterial pressure will be influenced by the concurrent consumption of other electrolytes. Thus, the heterogeneous blood pressure response in humans to isolated manipulations of nutrients such as sodium, calcium, and potassium may be determined, in part, by the adequacy of the dietary intake of other mineral elements. If this hypothesis is validated by continued research in this area, we would have new strategies available to improve blood pressure control in humans. For example, treatment of "NaCl sensitivity" in some humans might be more effectively approached by correcting dietary deficiencies of either potassium or calcium than by restricting dietary NaCl. 
5	Parathyroidectomy in chronic renal failure: a nine-year follow-up study. Seventy-three patients with chronic renal failure who underwent parathyroidectomy between March 1978 and April 1987 were reviewed. Thirty-four patients had undergone sub-total parathyroidectomy, and 39 patients had undergone total parathyroidectomy with parathyroid autograft into the forearm. Eight patients showed persistent hyperparathyroidism requiring a second surgical procedure. In all other patients there was highly statistical improvement in parathyroid hormone, total calcium, ionized calcium, alkaline phosphatase and a significant reduction in calcium x phosphate product. Histological evidence of osteitis fibrosa was present in 21 of 22 patients before surgery. Postoperatively, four showed complete resolution and improvement. Three patients developed histological evidence of osteomalacia during the study period. Only four of the 39 patients who underwent total parathyroidectomy with autograft had true recurrent hyperparathyroidism and only two of the 34 patients who underwent sub-total parathyroidectomy had recurrent disease, indicating that there is little to choose between the two techniques in the control of secondary hyperparathyroidism and its subsequent recurrence. In one patient with recurrence of hyperparathyroidism from a forearm parathyroid graft the histological picture was different from that of normal hyperplastic parathyroid tissue. Although it is probable that abnormal parathyroid tissue had been implanted there was no evidence of invasive growth into the forearm muscle. The most striking feature of long term follow-up was the difference in calcium x phosphate product in patients in whom vascular calcification increased compared to those patients with no change or regression of calcification. Mean calcium phosphate product in those patients with progressive vascular calcification was 4.93 for small and medium size vessels and 5.38 for large vessels compared to 4.10 for small and medium vessels and 4.09 for large vessels. In the former case the serum phosphate was 2.00 and 2.17 as compared to 1.75 or 1.73, suggesting that the aim in patients with end stage renal failure maintained by dialysis should be to control the serum phosphate concentration to 1.8 mmol or less and the calcium x phosphate product to less than 4.2. 
5	Role of tryptophan repeats and flanking amino acids in Myb-DNA interactions. The c-myb protooncogene codes for a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that appears to act as a transcriptional regulator and is highly conserved through evolution. The DNA-binding domain of Myb has been shown to contain three imperfectly conserved repeats of 52 amino acids that constitute the amino-terminal end. Within each repeat, there are three tryptophans that are separated by 18 or 19 amino acids and are flanked by basic amino acids. To determine the role of tryptophans and the flanking basic amino acids in the DNA-binding activity of Myb proteins, we have selectively mutagenized individual tryptophans as well as some of the amino acid residues that flank these tryptophans. Replacement of these tryptophans with glycine, proline, or arginine abolished the DNA-binding activity whereas replacement with other aromatic amino acids or leucine or alanine did not appreciably affect this activity. On the other hand the replacement of two amino acids, asparagine and lysine, that flank the last tryptophan with acidic amino acids completely abolished their DNA-binding activity. These results are consistent with a model we present in which the tryptophans form a hydrophobic scaffold that plays a crucial role in maintaining the helix-turn-helix structure of the DNA binding domain. Basic and polar amino acids adjacent to these tryptophans seem to participate directly in DNA binding. 
1	Management of local and regional recurrence after mastectomy or breast-conserving treatment. Locoregional failures after primary treatment for breast cancer include a diverse group of lesions that represent different categories of failures with various prognoses. Although patients with chest wall recurrences and regional nodal failures after traditional radical surgery have a poor prognosis, many patients can still achieve a significant degree of palliation and even long-term survival or cure with carefully orchestrated multimodal treatment. In patients who have breast failures after breast-conservation surgery and radiation, long-term salvage and cure can be achieved for the majority with prompt detection and appropriate treatment, which, like treatment for primary breast cancer, includes a consideration not only of local control but also of the risk of subsequent systemic failure and its need for treatment. 
1	Giant cell tumor of bone. Giant cell tumor is the second most common benign tumor of bone. Plain radiographs may demonstrate distinctive features but can also be misleading. The diagnosis may be aided by the use of other imaging modalities, such as bone scan, computed tomography and angiography. The recurrence rate is high, but some of the newer treatments seem to be associated with better outcomes. 
3	Ataxia in myxoedema: a neurophysiological reassessment. In a long-standing case of myxoedema with ataxia and dysarthria, neurophysiological investigations were carried out to assess how much of the ataxic dysbasic syndrome depended on the slowness of mechanical contraction and how much resulted from primary cerebellar involvement. It was observed that the Achilles reflexogram showed a marked prolongation of contraction and relaxation time and that in both quadriceps and triceps surae mechanical percussion induced a marked myxoedema and prolonged relaxation time. The EMG of these muscles during voluntary contraction and stopping reaction detected an excessive recruitment of the antagonistic muscles, starting without any abnormal delay, a finding at variance with a typical cerebellar pattern. Post-urographic analysis gave a pattern of oscillations still within the normal range. These findings suggest that the gait alterations of our patient depended on the increase in muscle contraction time and the consequent excessive recruitment of the antagonists. 
5	Reevaluation of the periodic acid-Schiff stain in acute leukemia with immunophenotypic analyses. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain in the diagnosis of acute leukemia in light of the finer characterization of this disorder now available through immunophenotyping, we examined the blasts from 51 patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia by morphological, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic analyses. The 51 patients represented every new case of acute leukemia subjected to cytochemical stains and flow cytometry between July 1987 and February 1989. By cell-surface marker analysis, 29 exhibited lymphocytic lineage, while 21 were myelocytic. One was mixed lineage. The PAS positivity, defined by the presence of blocks or coarse granules in 5% or more of the blasts, was found in 15 of 29 lymphoblastic leukemias and in four of the myeloblastic leukemias. However, PAS-positive lymphoblastic leukemias were negative with the other cytochemical stains: myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase. The PAS-positive myeloblastic leukemias were positive with at least one other stain. Three cases of myeloblastic leukemia exhibited greater than 10% PAS-positive blasts, with all three being acute monoblastic leukemia. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the PAS stain alone for lymphoblastic leukemia was 52% (15 true positives of 29) and 81% (four false positives), respectively. The sensitivity of a cytochemical-staining combination of PAS positivity and myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase negativity in defining cases of lymphoblastic leukemia remained at 52%; however, the specificity of this combination for lymphoblastic leukemia was 100% (no false positives). Thus, a positive PAS stain, in combination with negative myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase stains, continues to have a diagnostic role in the distinction between lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia, and greater immunologic sophistication serves to support this position. 
5	Understanding dizziness. How to decipher this nonspecific symptom. Dizziness is a common but often nonspecific symptom. Through careful history taking and physical examination, primary care physicians can usually determine the type of sensation (vertigo or light-headedness) and its source. Although most causes of dizziness are benign, disorders of the central nervous system tend to be ominous and require immediate referral to a specialist. 
4	Termination of acute atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome by procainamide and propafenone: importance of atrial fibrillatory cycle length. The effects of intravenous procainamide (n = 30) or propafenone (n = 25) were evaluated in 55 patients with acute atrial fibrillation and the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. All patients received either procainamide (12 to 15 mg/kg body weight) or propafenone (1 to 2 mg/kg) during sustained (greater than 10 min) atrial fibrillation or after termination of nonsustained atrial fibrillation. Termination of atrial fibrillation was attributed to a drug if it occurred less than or equal to 15 min after infusion. Measurements included mean cycle length of fibrillatory electrograms (mean AA interval) as measured at the high right atrium and shortest RR interval between pre-excited cycles during atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation terminated more frequently after procainamide administration (65%) than after propafenone (46%), although this difference was not significant. Procainamide prolonged the shortest pre-excited RR interval (228 +/- 41 to 339 +/- 23 ms, p = 0.0001) as did propafenone (215 +/- 40 to 415 +/- 198 ms, p = 0.0001) and the magnitude of increase was greater for propafenone (p = 0.048). Patients with sustained atrial fibrillation had shorter mean AA intervals than did their counterparts with nonsustained atrial fibrillation (123 +/- 25 versus 186 +/- 35 ms, p = 0.0001). Termination of sustained atrial fibrillation by either drug was accompanied by prolongation of the mean AA interval but not necessarily by the shortest pre-excited RR interval. Termination of atrial fibrillation was heralded by a 68% increase in the mean AA interval after procainamide administration compared with a 30% increase when the arrhythmia persisted. For propafenone the increases were 90% and 68%, respectively. 
1	Indwelling epidural catheters for pain control in gynecologic cancer patients. Seven patients with severe pain caused by an advanced, incurable gynecologic malignancy were treated with an indwelling epidural catheter connected to an implantable subcutaneous port through which morphine was infused. There were few major complications associated with insertion or maintenance of the system. The average usage was 60 days, although the system functioned continuously for 6 months in one patient. Pain distribution in these women ranged from the upper abdomen to the lower extremities. All patients, including one with liver metastases, reported good to excellent pain control with the epidural narcotics. Two subjects with upper abdominal pain occasionally required supplemental oral oxycodone, but the other five patients had adequate pain relief with the epidural system alone. The indwelling epidural system provides excellent analgesia for patients with advanced, incurable gynecologic cancer. 
1	Pretreatment neuropsychological status and associated factors in children with primary brain tumors. We report on the neuropsychological status of 31 children with primary brain tumors who underwent assessment before receiving therapy. Overall, the children performed within normal limits in all test areas. The exception was the group with anterior hemispheric tumors who demonstrated deficits in executive cognitive functions. Also, when compared according to tumor type, children with midline tumors and hydrocephalus performed more poorly than others on measures of intelligence, executive abilities, visual-motor skills, and fine-motor functions. Although one-half to two-thirds of the children with supratentorial midline and infratentorial tumors had cranial nerve, oculomotor, or cerebellar deficits, only the latter were associated with specific neuropsychological deficits (poorer performance on fine-motor and visual-motor tests). Age did not appear to be a factor in these children's neuropsychological test performances. 
4	Hemifacial spasm caused by a spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the vertebral artery. Case report. The authors describe the first reported case of dissecting aneurysm presenting with hemifacial spasm. The patient was a 58-year-old woman with left hemifacial spasm of 2 years' duration. Cranial nerve examination was otherwise normal and no other clinical symptoms were observed. Vertebral angiography revealed a fusiform enlargement of the left vertebral artery and contrast medium remaining in the intramural false lumen in the venous phase. Microvascular decompression of the facial nerve with wrapping of the aneurysm resulted in complete relief of the hemifacial spasm. 
1	Hemangiopericytoma of the sternum. Hemangiopericytoma of the chest wall is a rare tumor. We describe a patient with malignant hemangiopericytoma of the sternum who was treated with primary surgical resection and discuss the clinical, radiographic, and histologic features of the case. Surgical resection is the primary mode of therapy. High-dose radiotherapy and chemotherapy with a doxorubicin hydrochloride-containing combination may be warranted in certain cases. 
4	Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia: role in hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary heart disease. Resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and hyperinsulinemia may play a central role in the cause and clinical course of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism, and coronary heart disease. This article summarizes the evidence in support of this general hypothesis. 
3	Functional outcomes following selective posterior rhizotomy in children with cerebral palsy. The recent increase in popularity of selective posterior rhizotomy demands objective documentation of surgical outcome. For this reason, the authors have analyzed the status of 25 children with spastic cerebral palsy before and after rhizotomy to determine the effects of this therapy on muscle tone, range of movement, and motor function. Postoperative tests showed a reduction in muscle tone compared with preoperative assessments. Range of motion in the lower extremities was significantly increased and improvements in functional gross motor skills were noted. An increase in range of motion in the knees and thighs during gait was detected in 18 ambulatory patients studied with computerized two-dimensional motion analysis. Preliminary findings indicate that selective posterior rhizotomy reduced spasticity, thereby increasing range of motion and contributing to improvements in active functional mobility. 
5	Klinefelter's syndrome with anomalous origin of left main coronary artery Klinefelter's syndrome is a rare entity. Even rarer is an anomalous origin of the Left Main Coronary Artery. For both conditions to occur in the same patient is hence exceedingly rare. Reported here is a never previously reported case of a coronary congenital anomaly in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome together with the proper angiographic approach. 
3	High incidence of cardiopulmonary complications associated with implantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus in patients with advanced neurologic disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to examine the cardiopulmonary complications of a group of patients who had undergone implantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus for treatment of neurologic disease. DESIGN: Prospective study with partially matched historical controls. SETTING: Tertiary care community medical center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and three patients with progressive supranuclear palsy underwent implantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus. These patients were compared with respect to their cardiopulmonary complications with a control group who had undergone craniotomy and then compared with a control group who had undergone only abdominal surgery. RESULTS: In the study group, six patients developed major postoperative complications including development of large pleural effusions, lobar atelectasis, pneumonia, upper airway obstruction, and cardiac arrest. Three patients had minor complications including development of small pleural effusions, subsegmental atelectasis, purulent bronchitis, mild congestive heart failure, and atrial flutter/fibrillation. One patient had an unremarkable postoperative course. The first control group, whose only surgery was a craniotomy, had only one major complication. The second control group, the abdominal surgery control group, had one major and five minor complications. CONCLUSION: The particular neurologic disease, its severity, and the type of surgery performed appear to be causative factors in the high incidence of complications in the study group. 
5	Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum with cyclosporine: results in seven patients. The mainstay of therapy for pyoderma gangrenosum has been corticosteroids, but many patients respond poorly. During the past 2 years we have treated seven patients who had pyoderma gangrenosum with cyclosporine after their condition proved resistant to conventional therapy. No evidence of permanent toxicity from cyclosporine was detected and treatment with other immunosuppressive agents was discontinued in five of seven cases. Tuberculosis was reactivated in one patient. Three patients had a remission, three had an intermediate response, and one did not respond. These results indicate that cyclosporine is useful in the treatment of patients with refractory pyoderma gangrenosum and suggest an immune mechanism in the pathogenesis of this disorder. 
5	Necrotizing angiopathy presenting with multifocal conduction blocks. We describe conduction block as an unusual electrophysiologic manifestation in a patient with necrotizing angiopathy. The patient developed subacute symptoms over a 1-month period consisting of progressive pain, tingling, and weakness of the lower extremities. Physical examination revealed a pattern consistent with a polyneuropathy. Electrodiagnostic studies provided evidence of a conduction block in the left ulnar nerve. Pathologic studies confirmed the process to be a necrotizing angiopathy. This report establishes the role of conduction block in human nerve ischemia. 
4	Prediction of pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders by angiotensin II sensitivity and supine pressor test. An angiotensin II sensitivity test and a supine pressor test were done consecutively at 28 weeks gestation in 90 healthy, normotensive nulliparous women. None of the supine pressor tests was positive, applying the predefined threshold of a rise of 20 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure after rolling over; nine tests were positive using a corrected 9 mmHg cut-off level. Ten women had a positive angiotensin sensitivity test using a threshold of the effective pressor dose of 8 ng/kg/min; 22 women were positive using an effective pressor dose of less than or equal to 10 ng/kg/min. Later in pregnancy 12 women (13%) developed pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease (PIH). The specificity of both tests of predicting the development of PIH was about 90%. The sensitivity of the angiotensin sensitivity test at the 10 ng/kg/min level was 92%. Because of its low sensitivity of 25% the supine pressor test appears to have no value for the prediction of PIH. There was a significant positive association between angiotensin II refractoriness and birthweight. 
1	Management of macular puckers associated with retinal angiomas. Monocular visual loss in four patients was caused by epiretinal macular membranes associated with peripheral retinal capillary angiomas or angioma-like lesions. Three patients had solitary vascular lesions and one had two discrete vascular lesions. All patients were in good health, with no evidence of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. In three patients, spontaneous peeling of the macular membranes and visual improvement occurred 2 to 6 months after obliteration of the angioma-like lesions with cryotherapy (two patients), or cryotherapy combined with argon laser (one patient). The fourth patient underwent a vitrectomy 8 months after the macular pucker had failed to respond to treatment of the vascular lesion. 
3	Effects of anticonvulsant treatment and low levels of folate and thiamine on amine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid. A total of 157 epileptic patients were studied with respect to (1) biogenic amine precursors and metabolites in the CSF, (2) levels of folate and thiamine in the blood and CSF, (3) length of treatment with phenytoin (PHT), (4) PHT intoxication, (5) CNS atrophy. Alterations in CSF amine metabolite levels were related primarily to PHT intoxication, and low CSF folate and thiamine levels, but not to length of treatment or CNS atrophy. PHT intoxication increased CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA). Low folate levels were associated with decreased CSF 5HIAA and homovanillic acid, while low thiamine levels were associated with decreased CSF 5HIAA and 3-methyoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol. It remains to be seen to what extent these alterations in biogenic amine metabolism, mediated by low CNS vitamin levels, also lead to deficits in cerebral function. 
5	Asymptomatic and neurologically symptomatic HIV-seropositive individuals: prospective evaluation with cranial MR imaging. As part of a prospective multidisciplinary study of individuals seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed on 119 HIV-seropositive subjects (95 asymptomatic, 24 symptomatic) and the results were correlated with clinical data. MR images regarded as positive included those showing atrophy and/or white matter lesions. On the basis of these criteria, 96 subjects had normal MR images and 23 had abnormal images. Results of chi 2 analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the asymptomatic group (12 of 95 [13%] with abnormal scans) and the symptomatic group (11 of 24 [46%] with abnormal scans) (P = .001). In the asymptomatic group, positive MR images showed fewer, smaller, and/or less extensive abnormalities. The researchers conclude that (a) MR imaging can show indirect evidence of HIV infection early in the disease, but abnormalities will be minor and seen only in a small minority of neurologically asymptomatic subjects; (b) the appearance of clinically recognizable neurologic disease correlates with the MR imaging findings of increasingly severe brain atrophy and white matter lesions; and (c) in some HIV-seropositive subjects, despite neurologic disease, MR images can remain normal. Results indicate that routine screening with cranial MR imaging of neurologically asymptomatic HIV-seropositive individuals would likely result in a low yield of positive findings. 
3	The Woolley and Roe case. A reassessment. In 1953, two patients, Cecil Roe and Albert Woolley, sued their anaesthetist for alleged negligence because they had developed painful spastic paraparesis after spinal anaesthesia. The court found that phenol, which was used to sterilise the outside of the ampoules of local anaesthetic, had percolated the glass through invisible cracks, contaminating the solution, but that the anaesthetist could not have been aware of this risk. The case was important, despite the fact that judgement was in favour of the anaesthetist, because of the fears that it generated over the incidence of paralysis after spinal anaesthesia. The 'invisible crack' theory has been the subject of much scepticism. New information has been obtained, and the case re-examined objectively. The most probable source of contamination, which led to paralysis in the two patients, and in a third who received spinal anaesthesia on the same day, has been identified. A similar explanation may lie behind a number of other episodes of paralysis associated with spinal anaesthesia. 
5	The ventilator-dependent child: issues in diagnosis and management. Infants, children, and adolescents with chronic respiratory failure are surviving in increasing numbers and, thereby, producing a significant population of ventilator-dependent pediatric patients. Chronic respiratory failure can occur as a complication of a wide variety of disease states; in pathophysiologic terms, it generally results from either decreased central nervous system output or inadequate force generated by the respiratory pump. Its laboratory hallmark is hypercapnia with or without hypoxemia. Stabilization of the patient with mechanical ventilatory support may permit long-term survival. Management of the ventilator-dependent pediatric patient is a complex task that must begin with an accurate prognostication of each patient's survival and quality of life. Once a decision is made concerning the practicality and appropriateness of long-term ventilatory support, informed choices must be made with respect to need for an artificial airway, mode of ventilation, and location of care. Many younger patients, especially those with intrinsic lung disease (like bronchopulmonary dysplasia), may require a hospital setting for long-term care, whereas others with neuromuscular or central disorders may benefit from being discharged to home. The patient's family must be thoroughly educated in the child's care, and they must be involved in decision-making. A multidisciplinary team of physicians, therapists, nurses, and other professionals is required to deliver optimal care. Outcome is good for most patients who are carefully selected. 
5	High-resolution linkage mapping for susceptibility genes in human polygenic disease: insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and chromosome 11q. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) has a complex pattern of genetic inheritance. In addition to genes mapping to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), several lines of evidence point to the existence of other genetic susceptibility factors. Recent studies of the nonobese diabetic mouse (NOD) model of IDDM have suggested the presence, on mouse chromosome 9, of a susceptibility gene linked to the locus encoding the T-cell antigen, Thy-1. A region on human chromosome 11q is syntenic to this region on mouse chromosome 9. We have used a set of polymorphic DNA markers from chromosome 11q to investigate this region for linkage to a susceptibility gene in 81 multiplex diabetic pedigrees. The data were investigated by maximization of lod scores over genetic models and by multiple-locus affected-sib-pair analysis. We were able to exclude the presence of a susceptibility gene (location scores less than -2) throughout greater than 90% of the chromosome 11q homology region, under the assumption that the susceptibility factor would cause greater than 50% of affected sib pairs to share two alleles identical by descent. Theoretical estimates of the power to map susceptibility genes with a high-resolution map of linked markers in a candidate region were made, using HLA as a model locus. This result illustrates the feasibility that IDDM linkage studies using mapped sets of polymorphic DNA markers have, both for other areas of the genome in IDDM and for other polygenic diseases. The analytic approaches introduced here will be useful for affected-sib-pair studies of other complex phenotypes. 
5	Vimentin is preferentially expressed in high-grade ductal and medullary, but not in lobular breast carcinomas. Two hundred sixty-two invasive breast carcinomas dating from 1979 to 1984 were tested for vimentin and keratin on formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. None of 26 lobular carcinomas expressed vimentin. Vimentin expression in 10% or more of tumor cells was found in 78% of medullary (14 of 18), in 16% of ductal not otherwise specified (NOS) (35 of 214), and in two of four mucinous carcinomas. A further seven tumors showed vimentin expression in less than 1% to 10% of the cells. Vimentin was expressed in tumor cells of 30% (28 of 93) of grade III invasive ductal NOS carcinomas versus 7% (7 of 105) of grade II and 0% of grade I carcinomas (0 of 10). Vimentin was found to be preferentially expressed in tumors growing in broad, often anastomosing bands or sheets with extensive necrosis, scanty supportive stroma, high nuclear grade, and numerous mitoses. The authors conclude that vimentin is not detected in lobular carcinomas, but is preferentially expressed in medullary and in high-grade ductal NOS breast carcinomas. 
1	Granulocytic sarcoma presenting as an epidural mass with acute paraparesis in an aleukemic patient. Granulocytic sarcomas are rare tumors composed of granulocytic precursor cells. They are most commonly encountered in patients with acute myelogenous leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders in blast crisis. Rarely, patients presenting with granulocytic sarcoma show no evidence of acute leukemia. The authors report an aleukemic patient with acute paraparesis from an epidural granulocytic sarcoma. Only five such cases have been reported previously. Immunoperoxidase stain for lysozyme and chloroacetate esterase stain were used to prove the myeloid origin of the tumor cells. 
4	Association between primary pulmonary hypertension and portal hypertension: analysis of its pathophysiology and clinical, laboratory and hemodynamic manifestations. To determine the clinical, laboratory and hemodynamic profile in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and associated portal hypertension, 7 new cases and 71 previously reported cases were analyzed. There was no gender predilection and the average age at diagnosis was 41 years. Liver cirrhosis was the most frequent cause of hypertension (82%) and a surgical portosystemic shunt was present in 29%. Almost invariably, portal hypertension either preceded or was diagnosed concurrently with pulmonary hypertension, favoring the hypothesis that in portal hypertension, the pulmonary vasculature may be exposed to vasoactive substances normally metabolized or produced by the diseased liver, possibly inducing vasoconstriction or direct toxic damage to the pulmonary arteries. Clinically, exertional dyspnea was the most frequent presenting symptom (81%); other symptoms, such as syncope, chest pain and fatigue, were present in less than 33%. An accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound (82%) and a systolic murmur (69%) were the most common physical findings. At least 75% of these patients had evidence of pulmonary hypertension on electrocardiography (right ventricular hypertrophy) or roentgenography (cardiomegaly or dilated main pulmonary arteries, or both). Hemodynamic findings included severe pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure 59 +/- 19 mm Hg) with normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac output. Treatment was basically palliative and the mean and median survival times were 15 and 6 months, respectively. In brief, on the basis of clinical presentation and laboratory features, patients with combined primary pulmonary hypertension and portal hypertension seldom represent a diagnostic challenge. Further research is needed on treatment, which remains palliative. The survival rate is poor and worse than that seen in isolated primary pulmonary hypertension. 
5	Mental activity, adrenergic modulation, and cardiac arrhythmias in patients with heart disease. All of the electrophysiological mechanisms of arrhythmias are sensitive to the influences of the autonomic nervous system, particularly to its adrenergic limb. Arrhythmogenic areas may also be dependent on the inhomogeneity of these influences because of their pathophysiological structure and/or the neurogenic or humoral nature of the vector of modulation. The complexity of the various possible scenarios, combined with the role of the rate dependence, explains why standardized protocols exploring the autonomic nervous system in clinical arrhythmias are difficult to define. Invasive electrophysiology is not adapted to address the problem. Isoprenaline infusion only reproduces the humoral adrenergic stimulation to which only a few types of arrhythmias are sensitive. The exercise test is a very complex investigation if the multiple parameters involved are considered. Only a part of its limitations are obviated by the mental stress. Under natural conditions, the neurogenic origin, the intensity of the sympathetic stimulation, and its suddenness are all critical factors responsible for severe tachyarrhythmias. Arrhythmias of the long QT syndrome are particularly demonstrative of the importance of the autonomic nervous system, but this evidence can also be documented in more trivial circumstances of diseased or apparently undiseased hearts. Exploring the autonomic nervous system behavior through heart rate variability in ambulatory recordings is the most recent and fruitful method of investigation. This nonprovocative approach has technical obstacles and practical and theoretical limitations related to the fundamental nature of the autonomic nervous system, which is both a marker of the cardiac status and a determinant of arrhythmias. 
5	Measurement of D-dimer in plasma as diagnostic aid in suspected pulmonary embolism The potential of plasma measurement of D-dimer (DD), a specific derivative of crosslinked fibrin, for diagnosis or exclusion of pulmonary embolism was investigated in a prospective series of 171 consecutive patients who attended an emergency department with suspected pulmonary embolism. The diagnosis was made or excluded by means of a clinical decision-making process which included clinical evaluation, ventilation-perfusion (VQ) lung scan, and, as indicated, pulmonary angiography, venography, or non-invasive examination of the leg veins. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed by this process in 55 (32%) of 170 patients with sufficient data. All but 1 of these 55 patients had a DD concentration of 500 micrograms/l or above. The sensitivity and specificity of this cutoff concentration for the presence of pulmonary embolism were 98% and 39%, respectively, which give positive and negative predictive values of 44% and 98%. Among the 115 patients (68%) who had inconclusive VQ scans, 31 were diagnosed as having pulmonary embolism. 29 of the remaining 84 patients without pulmonary embolism had DD concentrations below 500 micrograms/l, which means that further diagnostic procedures could have been avoided in a quarter of the patients with inconclusive VQ scans. The sensitivity of the plasma measurement of DD remained high even 3 and 7 days after presentation (96% and 93%). Plasma measurement of DD therefore has a definite place in the diagnostic procedure for suspected acute pulmonary embolism in attenders at emergency departments: a concentration below 500 micrograms/l rules out the diagnosis. 
1	Primary intratemporal tumours of the facial nerve: diagnosis and treatment. Benign primary tumours of the facial nerve are uncommon. A slowly progressive facial palsy should be considered the result of a nerve tumour until proven otherwise. Improvements in diagnostic imaging techniques of the temporal bone have increased the possibility of a correct pre-operative diagnosis but facial nerve tumours remain a frequently ignored or misdiagnosed entity as a consequence of their subtle and protean clinical manifestations. A series of 12 cases of primary facial nerve tumours is presented. The clinical features, diagnostic modalities and treatment are discussed in relation to a review of the literature. 
1	Structural and functional integrity of ovarian tumor tissue obtained by ultrasonic aspiration. For patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, survival increases when residual disease approaches zero after surgical removal of the tumor. A previous study using the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) (Cavitron Lasersonic Corp., Stamford, CT) showed the successful removal of ovarian tumors from areas often considered unresectable: the diaphragm, spleen, stomach, and small bowel. However, the CUSA has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for gynecologic surgery except on an experimental basis. This study was designed to test whether ultrasonic irradiation produced by the CUSA caused alterations in cell structure or physiology of gynecologic tissue in adjacent areas. Paired tumor samples, unirradiated and irradiated, were obtained from ten patients, and portions were sent for pathologic structural evaluation and physiologic tissue culture evaluation. Histologic sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, showed that CUSA irradiation produced only minor tissue distortion as observed under the light microscope. A correct diagnosis would have been made in all cases had only tissue fragments obtained from the CUSA specimen trap been stained. For nine of ten patients, initial tumor cell viability was similar in the two specimen types. Flow cytometric DNA analysis confirmed that surgical methods produced matched samples. Cells that survived high-frequency ultrasound appeared functionally intact. For five of eight patients, the cells from the CUSA specimen traps survived and/or divided to a greater extent than those from the knife-dissected tumors. Cells from both surgical routes attained a similar number of passages in culture. It seems reasonable to extrapolate these in vitro observations with pelvic tumor tissues to normal surrounding tissue left in situ. Thus pelvic tissue is believed to be uninjured by CUSA ultrasonic irradiation. 
5	Management of hypertension and cardiovascular risk. Blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients is a surrogate for the real therapeutic goal of reducing the risks consequent to hypertension. This surrogate is convenient but its use may have important therapeutic implications. Results of treatment with new antihypertensive agents, data from clinical trials, and insights into underlying mechanisms are reviewed. The overall success of antihypertensive therapy has been undeniable, but has reduced minimally the frequency of atherosclerosis and coronary events; metabolic disarray resulting from the agents used, especially thiazides and beta blockers, may have contributed to this. Electrolyte abnormalities predispose to malignant arrhythmias and sudden death during myocardial infarction. Left ventricular hypertrophy, a chief risk factor for coronary events, arrhythmias, and heart failure, responds selectively to antihypertensive agents. Similarly, progression of renal injury may be sensitive to the agents used. Obesity and hypertension frequently coexist. Evidence is growing that atherogenic abnormalities common in obese patients, such as insulin resistance, also occur in the nonobese patient and are sensitive to the antihypertensive agent selected. 
1	A new phantom for mammography. A new mammography phantom from Du Pont is described. It has a wider range of types of detail than in previous phantoms, including some which closely simulate breast tissues. Experience of its use, and comparisons with an earlier ("Barts") phantom, are reported. The Du Pont phantom appears to have greater sensitivity to changes in tube kV and focal spot size, and better discrimination between different film-screen combinations and between films from different breast screening centres. 
4	Life-threatening complications during anaesthesia in a patient with a ventriculo-atrial shunt and pulmonary hypertension [published erratum appears in Anaesthesia 1991 Mar;46(3):241] A 6-year-old patient with hydrocephalus who underwent revision of a ventriculo-atrial shunt is described. Anaesthesia was complicated by the occurrence of systemic hypertension and arterial hypoxaemia. The patient was subsequently found to have pulmonary hypertension secondary to recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism. The pathophysiological mechanisms for the patient's deterioration are discussed and the anaesthetic management of children with pulmonary hypertension is outlined. It is concluded that patients with a ventriculo-atrial shunt who present for surgery should be screened carefully for the presence of pulmonary hypertension. 
2	Gastro-oesophageal reflux during elective laparoscopy. An oesophageal pH electrode was used to record gastro-oesophageal reflux in 73 women who had elective laparoscopy for various gynaecological procedures. No refluxes were recorded during the 63 procedures from which results could be analysed; the upper 95% confidence limit from this observation is 3 in 63 (4.8%). Two of the excluded women refluxed during episodes of hiccough that occurred shortly after induction of anaesthesia. Tracheal intubation may be required during laparoscopy, although the need to protect against the possibility of aspiration of gastric contents may not be a valid reason unless, with the same logic, it is suggested that all patients who hiccough should be intubated. 
3	Anti-GM1 IgM antibodies in motor neuron disease and neuropathy. We found anti-GM1 IgM antibodies in 23% of 56 patients with motor neuron disease (MND), in 19% of 69 patients with neuropathy, and in 7% of 107 controls with other neurologic and nonneurologic diseases. Most of these patients had anti-GM1 IgM antibody titers of 1:80 or less; slightly higher antibody titers (up to 1:640) were found in 3 patients, 1 with MND and 2 with neuropathy, and very high titers (1:20,480) in a patient with MND and an IgM kappa M protein that reacted with GM1, GD1b, and asialo GM1. Six other patients with anti-GM1 IgM that also bound to GD1b. Reactivity with GD1b did not correlate with anti-GM1 titers but was only present in patients with MND or neuropathy. Anti-GM1 IgM antibodies may be a normal constituent of the human antibody repertoire but their frequency and, in some cases, their levels are higher in patients with MND and neuropathy. The origin and the pathogenetic role of these antibodies in neural impairment remain to be established. 
3	An open trial of high-dosage antioxidants in early Parkinson's disease. High dosages of tocopherol and ascorbate were administered to patients with early Parkinson's disease as a preliminary open-labeled trial for the eventual controlled double-blind study evaluating antioxidants as a test of the endogenous toxin hypothesis of the etiology of Parkinson's disease. The primary endpoint of the trial was the need to treat patients with levodopa. The time when levodopa became necessary in the treated patients was compared with another group of patients followed elsewhere and not taking antioxidants. The time when levodopa became necessary was extended by 2.5 y in the group taking antioxidants. The results of this pilot study suggest that the progression of Parkinson's disease may be slowed by the administration of these antioxidants. A large multicenter, controlled clinical trial currently underway in North America evaluating tocopherol and deprenyl has the potential to confirm these results. 
4	Brief angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor treatment in young spontaneously hypertensive rats reduces blood pressure long-term Our study examines the long-term cardiovascular effects after a brief period of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR were treated with perindopril (3 mg/kg/day) by gavage from 2 to 6, from 6 to 10, or from 2 to 10 weeks of age. Systolic blood pressure was measured in the tail weekly until 25 weeks of age. Corresponding control groups received distilled water for the same periods. In each treatment group blood pressure was reduced significantly during treatment, rose when treatment stopped, but plateaued significantly below control SHR thereafter. This difference in blood pressure at 25 weeks of age was due to reduced total peripheral resistance as determined by microsphere methods, but plasma renin activity and angiotensin II concentrations were not different. Cardiac hypertrophy was also reduced in treated SHR. In a separate experiment, perindopril treatment from 6 to 10 weeks of age resulted in a significant reduction in the media/lumen ratios of mesenteric resistance vessels at 32 weeks of age. Concomitant administration of angiotensin II with perindopril from 6 to 10 weeks of age not only prevented the long-term effects on blood pressure seen with perindopril treatment alone but was associated with cardiovascular hypertrophy in excess of untreated control SHR. Finally, perindopril given for a shorter period (6 to 7 weeks) or later in life (20 to 24 weeks) had no significant long-term effects on blood pressure. These results demonstrate that a 4-week period of ACE inhibitor treatment in young SHR is sufficient to prevent the full expression of genetic hypertension and cardiovascular hypertrophy and that angiotensin II might be important in the development of hypertension in this model, its role in later life being less important. 
1	Regulation of pancreastatin release from a human pancreatic carcinoid cell line in vitro. The objective of these experiments was to investigate the influence of activation of three second messenger systems (protein kinase-C, adenylate cyclase-cAMP, and calcium mobilization) on the secretion of pancreastatin (PST) and chromogranin-A (CGA) by a human pancreatic carcinoid cell line (BON) in tissue culture. Stimulation of protein kinase-C by a phorbol ester (0.025-7.5 microM) caused a significant dose-related release of PST (186 +/- 22-4271 +/- 228% over controls). Treatment of BON cells with graded doses of 8-bromo-cAMP (0.14-3.0 mM) and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; 0.01-1.0 mM) also stimulated a dose-related release of PST (107 +/- 22-284 +/- 28 and 16 +/- 12-1076 +/- 100% over controls, respectively). Incubation of BON cells with ionomycin (0.134-13.4 microM) increased the release of PST (102 +/- 15-554 +/- 21% over controls) in a dose-related manner. A combination of IBMX and ionomycin resulted in an additive effect, whereas treatment with a phorbol ester plus IBMX resulted in a synergistic effect on PST release. Pretreatment of BON cells with monensin, an agent that prevents processing of precursors to smaller peptides, significantly decreased PST, but not CGA, secretion in response to phorbol ester or ionomycin. These findings indicate that protein kinase-C, cAMP, and Ca2+ mobilization participate in CGA and PST secretion. Although the observation that secretions of PST and CGA in response to theophylline are quantitatively associated, the absence of a quantitative relationship in the release patterns of PST and CGA in response to phorbol ester and ionomycin do not support a simple precursor-product relationship between CGA and PST. The monensin experiments are consistent with the notion that PST is derived from CGA in BON cells. 
1	Genetic strategies of tumor suppression. The evaluation of the cancer cell is a complex multigene process. Tumor suppressor genes that are lost or inactivated, as well as genes that are overexpressed, play key roles in tumor progression. The identification of overexpressed genes has been expedited by the presence of transforming genes in some animal retroviruses. However, tumor suppressor genes have been difficult to identify and isolate because of their loss or inactivation during tumorigenesis. By a variety of methods, summarized in this review, a few tumor suppressors have been cloned and characterized, and many more have been recognized indirectly. The general finding at this time is that the same tumor suppressors (and oncogenes) are found associated with many different tumors, that several different altered genes are found typically in the same tumors, and that other oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes seem to be characteristically altered in particular tumor types as well. Functions of tumor suppressor genes include the control of normal cell activities such as proliferation and differentiation as well as senescence, which is a special kind of differentiation in which cells lose their ability to divide. The genetic basis of senescence and identification of genes involved in overcoming senescence, leading to immortalization (i.e., indefinite growth potential), are important areas of current investigation. Our laboratory is engaged in senescence/immortalization studies as a result of our discovery that normal human mammary epithelial cells can be immortalized by DNA of the human papilloma virus. These new studies are summarized here. 
5	Conservative management or closed nailing for tibial shaft fractures. A randomised prospective trial. We performed a prospective randomised trial on matched groups of patients with displaced tibial shaft fractures to compare conservative treatment with closed intramedullary nailing. The results showed conclusively that intramedullary nailing gave more rapid union with less malunion and shortening. Nailed patients had less time off work with a more predictable and rapid return to full function. We therefore consider that closed intramedullary nailing is the most efficient treatment for displaced fractures of the tibial shaft. 
5	Ciprofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in an acute-care hospital. Use of ciprofloxacin as an alternative to vancomycin for treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection has been paralleled by the emergence of resistant strains. This phenomenon has also been noticed in our hospital. To confirm our observation, methicillin and ciprofloxacin susceptibilities were tested by disk diffusion and broth microdilution techniques. We studied 83 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained from various sources over a 4-month period. Ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC, greater than 2 micrograms/ml) was detected in 69 isolates (83%). Prior use of ciprofloxacin was reported for 24 of 69 patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant strains and 0 of 14 patients with ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains. The day of detection during the hospital stay and the location of the source patient were not significantly different between resistant and susceptible strains. Bacteriophage typing showed a higher occurrence of nontypeable strains among ciprofloxacin-resistant strains (54%). Review of our microbiology register showed a progressive increase in the rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin during the first year of use, with initial rates being about 10% and recent rates being higher than 80%. On the other hand, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus remained uniformly susceptible to ciprofloxacin (98.4%). We conclude that prior use of ciprofloxacin is an important factor for the selection of ciprofloxacin-resistant strains and that ciprofloxacin has limited usefulness against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. 
3	The effect of omental pedicle graft transfer on spinal microcirculation and laminectomy membrane formation. The properties of the omentum and its effect on spinal neurologic disease was investigated. Omental pedicle grafts were transferred to the laminectomized lumbar spines of nine neurologically normal dogs. Grafts were placed on either the dura or the spinal cord. Interruption of the graft's circulation was examined. To study the effect, the artery of the graft was injected with contrast and the graft-dura interface studied histologically. All injected specimens demonstrated vascular connections from the graft to the neural elements. The graft was found to decrease postoperative perineural scarring. The omentum appears to possess properties that could be applied to improve outcomes in spinal surgery. 
5	Internal capsule plaque and tonic spasms in multiple sclerosis. A patient developed hemilateral tonic spasms associated with a relapse of multiple sclerosis. An area of demyelination in the right internal capsule was observed on a magnetic resonance imaging scan. This lesion was not detectable on a second magnetic resonance imaging scan 10 months after the spasms had ceased. Paroxysmal symptoms in multiple sclerosis may represent transient phenomena related to inflammation in acute plaques. 
2	Treatment of hepatolithiasis: improvement of result by a systematic approach. In previous decades the result of treatment of hepatolithiasis has been unsatisfactory. The incidence of residual stones after surgery might reach 77%. In the past 6 years we adopted a systematic approach comprised of accurate delineation of disease in the liver and biliary tract by direct cholangiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography; tailored surgical treatment according to the extent of involvement of the liver and biliary tract; access to the intrahepatic ducts through the left duct or round ligament approach when there was difficulty with common bile duct exposure; routine use of flexible choledochoscopy; and application of electrohydraulic lithotripsy for large and impacted stones. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 114 of 127 patients (89.8%). Of those patients who had incomplete stone clearance, only six cases (4.7%) were related to technical failure of postoperative choledochoscopy. The incidence of stone recurrence was 15.8%, the lowest rate so far reported. It was the same regardless of whether a biliary drainage procedure had been performed, but the treatment for recurrent stones was facilitated by previous hepaticocutaneous jejunostomy. Overall the surgical treatment required for stone recurrence was of a lesser magnitude than that in the past. 
5	Penetrating keratoplasty for keratoconus: complications and long-term success. A series of 100 penetrating keratoplasties for keratoconus performed between 1968 abd 1986 were reviewed for long-term results. The mean follow-up was 6.1 years with a range of 4-16 years. The systemic associations and the postoperative complications were analysed. Grafting in cases associated with Down's syndrome had a higher incidence of complications. 93% of grafts remained clear and 81% achieved a final corrected visual acuity of 6/12 or better. 21% of eyes developed a homograft reaction, with 50% of rejection episodes occurring in the first year after operation. Factors associated with higher incidence of rejection included loose sutures, traumatic wound dehiscence, and grafts larger than 8.5 mm. Only three grafts with rejection episodes lost graft clarity, while rejection in the rest was successfully reversed with topical steroid therapy. No relationship was found between donor age and long-term graft clarity. 
4	Low rate of treatment of hypercholesterolemia by cardiologists in patients with suspected and proven coronary artery disease. BACKGROUND. Although specific guidelines for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia have been published, it is not known whether physicians treating patients likely to have lipid disorders have adopted the recommendations. METHODS AND RESULTS. The approach of cardiologists to the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in a metropolitan teaching hospital was assessed by interviewing patients with chest pain who were admitted for coronary angiography in 1988-1989 and by measuring fasting blood lipid profiles. At 1 month and again 12-24 months later, patients were contacted by telephone to determine if there had been any changes in treatment. Of 95 patients evaluated, 81 had coronary artery disease. Only 17% of those with high levels of total cholesterol and/or low density lipoprotein cholesterol were being actively treated with diet and/or drugs. In the remaining patients, either lipid studies had not been done or abnormal results had not been addressed. There was little change in treatment approach during the month after the diagnostic procedure. Furthermore, the experience was similar in those patients subjected to coronary revascularization. One to 2 years after the initial intervention, 69 of the original study group could be contacted again. Although active dietary or pharmacological therapy was initiated in some individuals during this interval, it was stopped in others. Thirty-five percent of hypercholesterolemic patients were receiving targeted therapy. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, only a small proportion of patients with documented coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia were being actively treated for their lipid disorder, suggesting that the published treatment guidelines have not yet been fully accepted. However, an encouraging improvement in frequency of treatment of hypercholesterolemia was documented during the 1-2-year observation period. 
4	Primary prevention of coronary artery disease through a family-oriented cardiac risk factor clinic. Primary prevention of coronary artery disease in children and young adults is important and can be instituted through a family-oriented cardiac risk factor clinic. Such a clinic was initiated at the Medical College of Georgia in March 1988. Children whose total cholesterol level (TC) exceeded 200 mg/dL when screened by their primary care physician were referred with their siblings and parents for fasting lipid profile and further evaluation. Data are available for the initial 21 families, including 30 children and 36 adults. The mean TC level was 258 mg/dL for index cases, 195 mg/dL for siblings, and 233 mg/dL for parents. Follow-up data obtained after therapy at a mean of 6 months are available for 12 families, including 14 children and 14 adults. The mean change in TC was from 265 to 246 mg/dL; 82% of the patients had a decrease in TC. Only one index case was documented as having neither a sibling nor a parent with an elevated cholesterol level. Family-oriented cardiac risk factor clinics are important for the identification and treatment of hypercholesterolemia in asymptomatic young people when primary prevention is possible. 
3	Night waking during infancy: role of parental presence at bedtime. Night waking occurs commonly in infants and young children. The goal of this study is to determine whether parents who report being present when their infant falls asleep at bedtime are more likely to report increased frequency of night waking by the infant. Mothers were consecutively recruited when they brought their infants to the clinic for their 9-month well-child visit. A total of 122 mothers agreed to participate and completed a questionnaire consisting of closed-ended, forced choice questions about their infant's feeding and sleeping behavior, and demographic and psychosocial characteristics. For 33% of the mothers, a parent was routinely present when the infant went to sleep. The entire sample of infants averaged 4.1 night wakings during the week prior to questionnaire completion. Infants whose parents were present at bedtime were significantly more likely to wake at night than infants whose parents were not present (6.2 vs 3.1, P = .01). Frequent night waking (seven or more wakings in the prior week) occurred in 28% of the sample. More of the infants whose parents were present experienced frequent night waking compared with infants whose parents were not present (40% vs 22%, P less than .04). When potential confounding variables were controlled by multivariate analysis, parents being present when the child went to sleep was independently associated with night waking (P less than .03). The association of parental presence at bedtime and night waking has implications for preventing and managing disruptive night waking in infancy. 
1	Management of the pregnant patient with carcinoma of the breast. The diagnosis of carcinoma of the breast during pregnancy poses a challenging dilemma. Although once regarded as incurable, recent reports reveal similar long term survival rates for pregnant and nonpregnant patients who have carcinoma of the breast. When referred to a surgeon, a pregnant woman with a suspicious mammary mass deserves an expedient histologic diagnosis; delay may jeopardize the chances of survival. Once the diagnosis is established, pregnant patients should be treated in a manner similar to nonpregnant patients because there is no evidence that carcinoma of the breast in pregnant women is biologically different than carcinoma of the breast in other premenopausal women. Fears of fetal exposure to radiation should not deter a physician from ordering appropriate preoperative diagnostic tests to stage the patients. Operation may be performed safely when general anesthesia is administered and postoperative adjuvant therapy should be administered when necessary. The involvement of multiple subspecialties in the management of these patients is highly recommended. 
3	Glucosephosphate isomerase as a CSF marker for leptomeningeal metastasis. Glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI), also known as phosphohexoisomerase, is a glycolytic enzyme whose activity is elevated in serum and CSF of patients with primary and metastatic CNS tumors. To improve the diagnostic accuracy of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), we measured GPI levels in CSF of 66 patients with CNS or systemic malignancies with suspected LM. We determined GPI kinetically using a coupled enzyme reaction assay. There were 31 males and 35 females, aged 1 to seventy-six. Thirty-one had primary brain tumors, and 35 had systemic cancer with suspected CNS metastasis. We analyzed 95 samples; GPI values ranged from 0.85 to 329.0 U/l (normal, less than 20 U/l). Compared with positive CSF cytology and myelography, GPI sensitivity was 53.5% and specificity 92.1% for the group as a whole. There was a highly significant association between elevated CSF GPI (greater than 20 U/l) and LM. The results were similar for both primary CNS and systemic malignancies. Although not very sensitive, an elevated CSF GPI strongly suggests LM and may aid in early diagnosis of this serious complication of cancer. 
5	Biochemical evaluation of calcium stone patients: how soon can it be done after stone surgery/passage? Biochemical evaluations were done two times for 29 outpatients with calcium stone disease, the first time within one month after surgical extraction or passage of stones and the second time two months or more later. Classification of the etiologic basis for the stone disease was the same after both tests in 27 patients. In the other 2 patients the diagnosis was changed from renal to absorptive hypercalciuria. Both of these patients had creatinine clearance rates less than 60 percent of normal during the first test. One also had multiple residual stones during both evaluations, and the second had a urinary tract infection during the first test that resolved with a normal creatinine clearance by the second test period. When nephrogenous cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMPn) assays were done on fasting specimens in these patients, the results were consistent with absorptive hypercalciuria. Almost all patients can be evaluated and placed in management programs within a few weeks after surgery. If cAMPn assays are not done, patients with decreased renal function secondary to residual stones or infection can be tested at a later time. 
5	Cytomegalovirus infections in pediatric liver transplantation. From 1986 to 1989, 26 consecutive pediatric liver transplant recipients were followed up at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. The patients were reviewed to assess the incidence of infection with cytomegalovirus, the severity of disease, and the relationship of recipient and donor serostatus to cytomegalovirus disease. Overall, the incidence of infection was 54% (14/26). Over 90% of patients who were seropositive or whose donors were seropositive developed evidence of cytomegalovirus infection after transplantation. Forty-three percent (6/14) of those with cytomegalovirus infections developed severe, fatal cytomegalovirus disease, despite treatment with immunoglobulins and ganciclovir (Syntex Laboratories Inc, Palo Alto, Calif) or foscarnet sodium (Astra, Pharmaceutical Products Inc, Westborough, Mass). Of all posttransplant deaths, two thirds were associated with severe cytomegalovirus infection. Cytomegalovirus-related deaths occurred in three of four seronegative patients with seropositive donors and three of six seropositive patients with seropositive donors. Therefore, a seropositive donor appeared to be a major risk factor for severe cytomegalovirus disease. 
4	Electroencephalography laboratory diagnosis of prolonged QT interval. Patients with prolongation of the QT interval are at risk for significant neurological morbidity and mortality secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. These patients frequently undergo electroencephalographic (EEG) examination to evaluate episodes of loss of consciousness, which may be associated with convulsions. Electrocardiogram recording as a part of the EEG is a simple and common practice, but analysis for possible QT prolongation is not routinely performed by electroencephalographers. This is, in part, due to the fact that while calculation of the corrected QT interval is straight forward, a calculator is generally required. A nomogram that is presented simplifies determination of the corrected QT interval, facilitating diagnosis of prolongation of the QT interval in the EEG laboratory. 
5	An evolutionary perspective on salt, hypertension, and human genetic variability. Natural selection for electrolyte conservation has likely been the norm throughout human evolutionary history. However, the current patterns of excessive dietary salt intake create the potential for salt overload. Under these conditions, hypertension may be considered an expected pathological response to an evolutionarily new constraint. The transatlantic Middle Passage may have created a genetic bottleneck for salt conservation in African-Americans. Although the initial consequences of this important historical event probably constricted genetic variability and further magnified the potential for salt-sensitive hypertension, the Middle Passage undoubtedly also served as a more generalized major source of environmental stress and may have stimulated subsequent hereditary diversity in the survivors of this holocaust and their descendants. Accelerated rates of mutation, genetic recombination, and transposable genetic elements in conjunction with enhanced opportunities for gene flow, new selective pressures, and drift have all contributed to the tremendous heterogeneity of contemporary African-Americans. It is unlikely that a single genetic event, even of the severity of the Middle Passage, can account comprehensively for the apparent susceptibility of this macroethnic group to high blood pressure and hypertension. 
5	Total knee arthroplasty in patients after patellectomy. Twenty-six total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were evaluated in 22 patients who had had a patellectomy. Fourteen knees (12 patients) had a primary TKA, and 12 patients had a revision TKA. Two patients in the revision group, whose prostheses failed, were from the primary TKA group. The mean follow-up time was 8.5 years in the primary TKA group and 7.6 years in the revision TKA group. A group of 14 control knees with patellae was randomly generated but matched for prosthesis, diagnosis, surgeon, age, and time of surgery. This group was similarly evaluated with an average follow-up time of 6.9 years. The primary TKA group had seven knees that were rated as good or excellent, two as fair, and three as poor. The control group had a significantly higher average rating than the primary TKA group. In this group, there were 12 good or excellent knees, three fair, and none poor. Postoperative pain, flexion contracture, extension lag, and range of motion all contributed significant information to the final score, whereas other variables (walking, function, strength, and instability) did not contribute any additional information. Although higher overall scores may have been expected if the patients had patellae, the results during the follow-up examination were satisfactory and justified TKA in these patients. In general, however, patients without patellae may be at a higher risk for failure of the prosthesis, as seen in five patients having primary TKA and another ten patients with failed TKA requiring revision. 
5	Pre-discharge immunization among hospitalized Filipino children. Identifying opportunities to vaccinate eligible children is one way to boost rates of immunization especially in countries with low immunization coverage and where convalescence from infectious illness is a contraindication to vaccination. To determine the safety and immunogenicity of diphtheria-tetanus toxoid-pertussis and oral polio immunization, 210 convalescing infants and children and community controls, comparable image and nutritional status, were studied. Using the pertussis agglutination and poliovirus neutralization tests, quantitative serologic responses were compared in the two study groups. No significant differences in the incidence rates of febrile reactions (23% in controls; 28% in convalescents) of local reactions (92% in controls; 87% in convalescents) and of seroconversion (P greater than 0.05) were noted between the two groups. Our investigation suggests that infants and children convalescing from infectious illnesses can be safely and effectively vaccinated. This study further suggests that hospitalization provides an opportunity to vaccinate such children. 
5	Strapless oral-nasal interface for positive-pressure ventilation. A custom-fabricated strapless oral-nasal interface (SONI) is described. It was used in the long-term administration of intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (IPPV) by 18 patients with paralytic or restrictive pulmonary insufficiency. This interface is an acrylic shell which is firmly fixed to an orthodontic bite plate; it is designed to form a seal over the nose and mouth for the entry of IPPV. Eight patients were ventilator dependent 24 hours a day. The ten patients who required only nocturnal aid had improvement in daytime arterial blood gases. Although nine of these patients could manage less than 15 minutes of unassisted breathing (free time) supine, all slept supine on SONI IPPV. The 13 patients who underwent sleep monitoring maintained a mean oxygen saturation of 95.3% +/- 1.7% and acceptable end-tidal pCO2 (30 to 45 mmHg). These 13 patients have used SONI IPPV for an average of 22 months (range = 3 to 63 months). Impediments to successful long-term use of a SONI include the presence of a hyperactive gag reflex or stimulation of excessive oral secretions. When combined with mouth IPPV, glossopharyngeal breathing, the intermittent abdominal pressure ventilator, or the cuirass ventilator for daytime use, SONI IPPV is an option for the patient who prefers total ventilatory support by noninvasive means. 
1	Weight gain with breast cancer adjuvant treatment. Available information suggests that individuals with breast cancer gain weight during adjuvant treatment and that this weight gain may be associated with poor prognosis. Exploration of the factors which affect weight gain may aid in developing weight control interventions for these patients. To determine the factors which are associated with weight gain, 32 women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy were followed over 2 years from the beginning of adjuvant treatment. Measures of psychologic functioning and self-reports of exercise levels and eating were assessed every 2 months during the course of treatment. Sixty-nine percent of the women gained weight over treatment, resulting in a significant weight gain for the group as a whole. Weight gain was correlated positively with several psychologic measures but not with assessed biologic measures. A multiple-regression equation using psychologic/behavioural measures of emotional discharge, logical analysis, affective regulation, interpersonal sensitivity, average number of symptoms, and obsessive compulsiveness accounted for 58% of the variance in overall weight gain. At 2 years of follow-up, 27 women had gained weight for an average of 6.03 kg. The coping style of logical analysis emerged as a significant predictor of disease recurrence, accounting for 28% of the variance in weight gain at 2 years. The results are discussed in terms of identification of women likely to gain weight during adjuvant treatment, directions for future research, and development of interventions to control weight gain. 
5	Intercostal arteriovenous fistula due to pleural biopsy A 32 year old woman had a pleural biopsy for a left pleural effusion, which showed caseating granuloma typical of tuberculosis. When the fourth biopsy specimen was removed considerable bleeding occurred from the puncture site. Four days later a bruit was audible over the punctured area, radiating to the back. Eight days after the procedure the patient had a massive bleed into the left pleural space. Selective aortic angiography showed an arteriovenous fistula between the 9th intercostal artery and vein and a pseudoaneurysm in the intercostal punctured area. Thoracotomy showed bleeding from the site of the pleural biopsy. The intercostal vessels were ligated and pleural decortication was performed, and the patient recovered uneventfully. 
1	Soft-tissue tumor with abnormal amianthoid collagen fibers. Electron microscopic examination of a solitary soft-tissue tumor from the face demonstrated large areas with abnormal amianthoid collagen fibers in the neoplasm. The lesion was classified as a benign neoplasm of myofibroblasts and tentatively named a myofibroblastoma. The significance of the amianthoid collagen fibers is unknown. Normal native collagen fibers were found in some parts of the neoplasm. 
3	Massive increases in extracellular potassium and the indiscriminate release of glutamate following concussive brain injury. An increase in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]c) of the rat hippocampus following fluid-percussion concussive brain injury was demonstrated with microdialysis. The role of neuronal discharge was examined with in situ administration of 0.1 mM tetrodotoxin, a potent depressant of neuronal discharges, and of 0.5 to 20 mM cobalt, a blocker of Ca++ channels. While a small short-lasting [K+]c increase (1.40- to 2.15-fold) was observed after a mild insult, a more pronounced longer-lasting increase (4.28- to 5.90-fold) was induced without overt morphological damage as the severity of injury rose above a certain threshold (unconscious for 200 to 250 seconds). The small short-lasting increase was reduced with prior administration of tetrodotoxin but not with cobalt, indicating that neuronal discharges are the source of this increase. In contrast, the larger longer-lasting increase was resistant to tetrodotoxin and partially dependent on Ca++, suggesting that neurotransmitter release is involved. In order to test the hypothesis that the release of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate mediates this increase in [K+]c, the extracellular concentration of glutamate ([Glu]c) was measured along with [K+]c. The results indicate that a relatively specific increase in [Glu]c (as compared with other amino acids) was induced concomitantly with the increase in [K+]c. Furthermore, the in situ administration of 1 to 25 mM kynurenic acid, an excitatory amino acid antagonist, effectively attenuated the increase in [K+]c. A dose-response curve suggested that a maximum effect of kynurenic acid is obtained at a concentration that substantially blocks all receptor subtypes of excitatory amino acids. These data suggest that concussive brain injury causes a massive K+ flux which is likely to be related to an indiscriminate release of excitatory amino acids occurring immediately after brain injury. 
1	Squamous carcinoma of the posterior pharyngeal wall. We have reviewed a 12-year experience with 295 patients treated for squamous carcinoma of the pharynx in order to focus on 78 patients whose lesions arose in the posterior wall. Surgery was the definitive therapy for the primary tumor in 57 (73%), including 3 treatment groups. Thirty-two patients had limited resections that preserved the larynx, involving local excision (7 patients), anterior pharyngotomy (7 patients), lateral pharyngotomy (6 patients), median labiomandibular glossotomy (6 patients), or median mandibulotomy with paralingual extension (6 patients). The second group consisted of 21 patients with more extensive tumors who required a laryngectomy and complex reconstruction, often with postoperative radiotherapy. Finally, there were four patients who developed metachronous second primaries in the pharynx subsequent to a laryngectomy. All required flap reconstruction. Of the 21 patients whose primary treatment was radiotherapy, 5 had lesions that were implanted after access was provided by a mandibulotomy. Cumulative 5-year survival was 32% and ranged from 44% in those with favorable lesions to 15% in those with extensive tumors. Our experience highlights the variety of treatment approaches available in patients with pharyngeal carcinomas confined to the posterior wall. Surgery in this setting carries acceptable morbidity and yields survival rates that compare favorably with those achieved by external radiation therapy alone. Results in patients with extensive lesions still leave much to be desired, despite radical surgery and aggressive radiotherapy. Innovative brachytherapy techniques using surgery for access deserve further investigation. 
1	Prognostic factors in stage IB squamous cervical cancer patients with low risk for recurrence. About one-half of cervical cancer patients whose tumors recur after radical surgery have negative lymph nodes and clear resection margins. We evaluated 95 patients with squamous cell tumors who underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy between January 1975 and December 1985 and who were thought to be at low risk for recurrence to see whether other clinical or histopathologic factors were predictive of tumor recurrence. Detailed retrospective record review and complete pathology review were accomplished for each case. The 5-year actuarial survival rate was 89%. Nine patients developed recurrent disease (9.5%), of whom eight died. Several clinical features were evaluated as possible prognostic factors: patient age (P = .26), patient race (P = .60), cervical diameter (P = .24), extent of gross cervical involvement (P = .36), and presence of contact bleeding (P = .82). Histopathologic features were examined: depth of invasion (P = .31), number of mitoses (P = .42), character of the tumor-stromal border (P = .15), histologic differentiation (P = .02), lymph-vascular space invasion (P = .56), and width of tumor (P = .23). Depth of invasion did correlate with increasing tumor width (P less than .001). Once node- and margin-positive patients are excluded, differentiation may be the only feature useful in identifying patients at risk for recurrence. Because almost one-half of our patients had poorly differentiated tumors, sole use of this feature as a criterion for adjuvant therapy would have resulted in overtreatment of low-risk patients. 
1	The recalcitrant perineal wound after rectal extirpation. Applications of muscle flap closure. Perineal wounds developing after abdominoperineal resection result in chronic purulent drainage and intermittent episodes of sepsis and are generally unresponsive to conservative medical and surgical treatment. Thirteen consecutive patients (aged 27 to 74 years; mean, 48 years) who underwent debridement and immediate muscle flap closure of these wounds were analyzed to identify risk factors for delayed healing and to evaluate the effectiveness of muscle flap coverage. Three risk factors were identified: preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy, resection for recurrent carcinoma, and inflammatory bowel disease. A total of 19 muscle flaps (11 gracilis, five gluteal thigh, two gluteus maximus, and one rectus abdominis) were used to close these wounds. During an average 3.5-year follow-up, four (31%) minor complications and one (8%) recurrence were noted to occur. Muscle flaps provide safe, effective, single-stage procedures for the closure of chronic perineal wounds. 
3	Effects of vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl GABA) on neurotransmission-related amino acids and on GABA and benzodiazepine receptor binding in rats. The effect of 12-day intraperitoneal i.p. administration of vigabatrin (GVG, gamma-vinyl GABA) to rats on the neurotransmission-related amino acids in various brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and spinal cord), cisternal fluid (CSF) and blood was studied. Results showed that GVG administration increased the levels of GABA in cortical and subcortical regions of the brain and CSF without affecting GABA and benzodiazepine receptors in the cortex. In addition, a dose-dependent decrease was noted in the concentration of glutamate in the hippocampus and in the concentrations of aspartate and glutamine in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The changes in the levels of amino acids in the brain, except for that of GABA, were not reflected in the CSF, however, and the levels of amino acids in discrete brain regions did not show any correlation with those in the serum or in the CSF. The results suggest that GVG administration might suppress development and spread of seizures not only by elevating the level of the inhibitory amino acid GABA, but also by decreasing the levels of excitatory amino acids in the brain. 
1	Effects of treatment on long-term survivors with malignant astrocytomas. We reviewed the records of 160 consecutive patients with glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma to evaluate the long-term consequences of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. We defined long-term survivors as those patients with glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma who lived at least 100% longer than median survival of historical controls, for example, 2 years for patients with glioblastoma and 4 years for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma. There were 9 (5.6%) long-term survivors. Three (30%) became demented and died without evidence of tumor recurrence. One, after survival of 10 years, died of tumor recurrence. Of the remaining survivors, 2 (22%) have significantly impaired short-term memory function and other neurological deficits such as gait apraxia. Three (30%) can function independently. It is likely but cannot be proved that it is radiotherapy and not chemotherapy that is the causal factor of this dismal therapeutic outcome. Our study suggests restraint in the use of radiotherapy for patients with brain tumors that have more favorable prognoses than glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas, such as low-grade astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. 
5	Assessment of the biliary tract after liver transplantation: T tube cholangiography or IODIDA scanning. Biliary tract obstruction or anastomotic leakage are common problems following liver transplantation. In a sequential study, 31 patients with a liver transplant were investigated by 99mTc-IODIDA (IODIDA) scanning and T tube cholangiography (TTC) and the results were compared with clinical outcome. Seven patients had an extrahepatic biliary obstruction and one patient had a biliary leak. In the detection of biliary complications TTC and IODIDA scanning were similar in terms of sensitivity (63 per cent for both) but TTC had a better specificity (79 per cent versus 60 per cent) and accuracy (74 per cent versus 60 per cent) than IODIDA scanning. When liver function was taken into account, the diagnostic efficacy of both tests in patients with bilirubin levels of less than 200 mumol/l was similar. With levels greater than 200 mumol/l there was a greater number of false positive results with IODIDA scanning (12 per cent versus 54 per cent). The only significant biliary leak was clearly detected by TTC but not IODIDA scanning. TTC remains the more effective way of evaluating the biliary tract after transplantation. IODIDA scanning has limited value when bilirubin levels are elevated, but may provide additional information about blood supply, hepatocyte function and intrahepatic cholestasis. 
1	Usefulness of serum glycoconjugates in precancerous and cancerous diseases of the oral cavity. Sera from 47 healthy controls, 18 normal individuals with the habit of tobacco chewing, 43 patients with oral precancerous (PC) conditions, and 40 patients with oral cancer (OC) were studied for the levels of total sialic acid (TSA), lipid-bound sialic acid (LSA), mucoid proteins, and protein-bound hexoses (PBH) (galactose and mannose). The changes in the glycoconjugate levels were insignificant between the controls and the normal tobacco chewers. All four parameters were significantly elevated in oral PC patients compared with controls. The levels of PBH and LSA showed significant increase in the oral PC patients compared with the normal tobacco chewers. A significant increase was observed in the levels of TSA, LSA, mucoid proteins, and PBH in OC patients compared with controls, normal tobacco chewers, and patients with oral PC. Increasing levels of all the biomarkers were found with progression of the malignant disease. Elevations in the levels of TSA and LSA were statistically significant in Stage IV patients compared with Stage III patients. The patients with metastases had higher levels of the biomarkers than the patients with primary OC. However, elevations only in LSA levels were statistically significant. These results suggest that evaluations of the serum glycoconjugate levels may be useful in diagnosis of the patients with oral PC or OC. In addition to their value in early detection, they can also help in staging of the disease. 
3	Endocrine function and morphological findings in patients with disorders of the hypothalamo-pituitary area: a study with magnetic resonance. Evaluation of the sellar area was performed with magnetic resonance imaging in 101 patients (age range 0.8-27 years) with hypopituitarism, isolated diabetes insipidus, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, and central precocious puberty. The hypopituitary patients (n = 70) included multiple pituitary deficiency (n = 23), pituitary deficiency with diabetes insipidus (n = 5), and isolated growth hormone deficiency (n = 42). The patients with multiple pituitary deficiency showed pathological morphological findings in all cases, with stalk and posterior lobe always involved. The group with associated diabetes insipidus had abnormal stalk in four of five cases and posterior lobe not visible in all cases. Only five of 42 (12%) patients with isolated growth hormone deficiency had abnormalities of the sellar area. In two out of four patients with isolated diabetes insipidus posterior lobe was not seen. All patients with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (three with Kallmann's syndrome, one Prader-Willi syndrome, and two idiopathic hypogonadism) appeared normal. In precocious puberty (n = 21) the three patients with onset of symptoms before age 2 years exhibited a hypothalamic hamartoma, whereas in the others with onset of puberty between age 2 and 7 the magnetic resonance image was normal in 17 of 18 patients. The probability of finding a pathological magnetic resonance image was considerably high in our patients with multiple pituitary deficiency, isolated diabetes insipidus, and precocious puberty with very early onset of symptoms. On the contrary, purely functional abnormality is suggested in most patients with isolated growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, and precocious puberty with later onset of symptoms. 
5	Antibodies to nuclear lamin C in chronic hepatitis delta virus infection. Sera of patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus infection stained the nuclear periphery in indirect immunofluorescence. Using proteins of isolated nuclei, isolated nuclear matrices, the nuclear pore complex-lamina fraction and purified lamins A and C as antigen source in immunoblotting experiments, nuclear lamin C was identified as the reactive antigen. Most sera tested (8 of 10) recognized nuclear lamin C exclusively, but not the nuclear lamins A and B. Antibodies reacting with both nuclear lamins A and C, which share extensive sequence homologies, have been reported to occur in autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. The present findings suggest that the novel autoantibody associated with chronic hepatitis delta virus infection recognizes an epitope localized in the short carboxyterminal region of nuclear lamin C. 
5	Hyperkalaemia during rapid blood transfusion and hypovolaemic cardiac arrest in children. A morbidity and mortality review documented a high occurrence of hyperkalaemia in cardiac arrests associated with rapid blood transfusion, which resulted in further study. In order to stimulate events during rapid blood transfusion and cardiac arrest, the central circulation was modeled as a linear one compartment, and used to stimulate a child who suffered a hypovolaemic cardiac arrest and was resuscitated with rapid blood transfusion (RBT). The simulation suggested that the combination of RBT and a low cardiac output state could be associated with hyperkalaemia, if the potassium concentration in the plasma fraction of the transfused blood was greater than or equal to 10 mmol.L-1. In an associated clinical study the plasma potassium concentration during cardiac arrest was documented from a retrospective review of 138 cardiac arrests in a paediatric population. Patients were divided into two groups. The RBT-group received a rapid blood transfusion during resuscitation. The non-RBT group did not receive blood during resuscitation. During cardiac arrest the plasma [K] in the non-RBT group was 5.63 +/- 2.39 mmol.L-1 compared with 8.23 +/- 1.99 mmol.L-1 in the RBT-group (P less than 0.05). The hyperkalaemia during cardiac arrest in the RBT-group could be explained as a consequence of RBT to a hypovolaemic child with a low cardiac output. 
4	Early detection of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting with chest pain and nondiagnostic ECGs: serial CK-MB sampling in the emergency department [published erratum appears in Ann Emerg Med 1991 Apr;20(4):420] STUDY OBJECTIVES: Patients presenting to the emergency department with chest discomfort are a difficult problem for emergency physicians. Nearly 50% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) will initially have nondiagnostic ECGs on ED presentation. The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with AMI having nondiagnostic ECGs could be identified using new immunochemical assays for serial CK-MB sampling in the ED. DESIGN: Chest pain patients, more than 30 years old, with pain not caused by trauma or explained by radiographic findings, were eligible for the study. Serial serum samples were drawn on ED presentation (zero hours) and three hours after presentation, then analyzed for CK-MB using four immunochemical methods and electrophoresis. Standard World Health Organization criteria were used to establish the diagnosis of AMI, including new Q-wave formation or elevation of standard in-hospital serum cardiac enzyme markers. SETTING: A tertiary cardiac care community hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The serum from 183 patients hospitalized for possible ischemic chest pain was collected and analyzed. Thirty-one of 183 patients (17%) were found to have AMI by standard in-hospital criteria. Sixteen of the 31 patients (52%) with AMI had nondiagnostic ECGs on presentation. Immunochemical determination of serial CK-MB levels provided a sensitive and specific method for detecting AMI in patients within three hours after ED presentation compared with standard electrophoresis. The four immunochemical methods demonstrated a range in sensitivity from 50% to 62.1% on ED presentation versus 92% to 96.7% three hours later. The immunochemical tests demonstrated specificities ranging from 83.0% to 96.4% at three hours, with three of the four tests having specificities of 92% or greater. Electrophoresis had a sensitivity of 34.5% on ED presentation, increasing to 76.9% at three hours, with a specificity of 98.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Immunochemical CK-MB methods allowed rapid, sensitive detection of AMI in the ED. Early detection of AMI offers many potential advantages to the emergency physician. Early detection of AMI, while the patient is in the ED, could direct disposition of this potentially unstable patient to an intensive care setting. Such information may prevent the ED discharge of patients with AMI having nondiagnostic ECGs. The diagnosis of AMI within a six-hour period after symptom onset may allow thrombolytic therapy to be given to patients with AMI not having diagnostic ECGs. This study served as a pilot trial for a multicenter study of the Emergency Medicine Cardiac Research Group, which is currently ongoing. 
1	Expression of platelet-derived growth factors, transforming growth factors, and the ros gene in a variety of primary human brain tumors. Ribonucleic acid was isolated from a wide spectrum of central nervous system tumors to examine the expression of platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) A and B, tumor growth factors (TGF-beta) 1 and 2, and ros messenger ribonucleic acid. Eight glioblastoma cell lines were examined as well as cell cultures from 22 tumor explants. The explants included 6 glioblastomas, 4 anaplastic astrocytomas, 5 astrocytomas, 3 ependymal tumors, 2 meningiomas, 1 medulloblastoma. and 1 ganglioglioma. For comparison, 2 nontumor glial cell cultures were included. The PDGF B-chain was expressed in 5 of 8 glioblastoma cell lines, 2 of 6 glioblastomas, and in 3 of 4 anaplastic astrocytoma explants. There was no PDGF B expression in 4 astrocytomas, 3 ependymomas of varying malignancy, in the remainder of the tumors, or in the nontumor glial cells. The PDGF A-chain was expressed in all of the tumors, with the exception of the malignant ependymoma and in both nontumor glial cell cultures. TGF-beta 1 was expressed in all of the tumors and in nontumor glial cells. The expression of TGF-beta 2 was expressed in many of the benign and malignant tumors and also in both nontumor glial cell cultures. The ros messenger ribonucleic acid was expressed in 1 of 5 glioblastoma cell lines and in 2 of 6 glioblastoma cell explants, but in none of the other tumors or in the nontumor glial cells. 
4	Splenic septic emboli in endocarditis. The significance of septic emboli to the spleen is inferred by the frequency of septic emboli in general seen in patients with left-sided infective endocarditis who are referred for valve replacement. To determine the proper management of splenic infarcts and abscess due to septic emboli, we retrospectively reviewed the records of 108 patients with left-sided endocarditis who underwent valvular surgery at the University of Illinois Hospital from 1980 through 1988. Intravenous drug abuse was the etiology in 68% (n = 73). The incidence of splenic infarcts and abscess was 19% (n = 20), but an incidental finding of splenic infarcts was found in 38% (n = 11) of 29 asymptomatic patients who had computed tomograms. Streptococci and staphylococci were the causative organisms in 85% (n = 17). Localized findings were absent in 90% of splenic infarcts and abscesses. Abdominal computed tomograms were diagnostic of the sequelae of splenic septic emboli in 100%. No patient had intra-abdominal bleeding complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. Splenectomy was performed in 50% (n = 10) of patients 3-24 days (mean, 11.2 days) after valve replacement. Indications for splenectomy included persistent sepsis in 60% (n = 6), large (greater than 2 cm) and peripheral lesions in 30% (n = 3), and splenic rupture in 10% (n = 1). Perioperative mortality of patients who underwent splenectomy was 30% (n = 3). The following conclusions can be drawn: 1) Splenic septic embolus is common in endocarditis. 2) Abdominal computed tomography should be performed for all patients. 
4	Body fluid spaces and blood pressure in hemodialysis patients during amelioration of anemia with erythropoietin. Blood pressure (BP) may increase in hemodialysis patients during treatment of anemia with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO). Since fluid volume is a determinant of BP in dialysis patients, changes in body fluid spaces during r-HuEPO therapy could affect BP. Thus, 51Cr-labeled red blood cell (RBC) volume, inulin extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, and urea total body water (TBW), as well as cardiac output, plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma aldosterone concentration were determined postdialysis before and after r-HuEPO therapy in patients in whom changes in BP could be managed by ultrafiltration alone. Eleven patients entered the study: one had a renal transplant and two required addition of antihypertensive drug therapy and were excluded; eight, of whom two required antihypertensive drug therapy following the study, were included in the analyses. Results revealed an increase in predialysis hemoglobin from 67 to 113 g/L (6.7 to 11.3 g/dL) (P = 0.001) during 18 +/- 6 weeks of therapy. Predialysis diastolic BP increased from 80 to 85 mm Hg (P = 0.07), while postdialysis diastolic BP was unchanged at 73 mm Hg. 51Cr-RBC volume increased, from 0.7 to 1.3 L (P = 0.004). ECF tended to decrease, from 13.7 to 10.8 L (P = 0.064), while TBW decreased to a similar extent, but not significantly, 34.3 to 31.2 L (P = 0.16). Postdialysis ECF volume was positively correlated with mean arterial BP at baseline (r = 0.89, P = 0.007) and after therapy (r = 0.74, P = 0.035). However, the regression lines for this relationship were different (P = 0.022) before and after therapy. 
1	Ultrastructural evidence for differentiation in a human glioblastoma cell line treated with inhibitors of eicosanoid metabolism. Human glioblastoma cells incubated in the presence of inhibitors of eicosanoid biosynthesis show decreased cellular proliferation without cytotoxicity. We studied the ultrastructural morphology of a human glioblastoma cell line cultured with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor, or 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, a cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor. When glioblastoma cells were treated for 3 days with antiproliferative concentrations of either agent, they shared many morphological characteristics, including evidence for increased astrocytic differentiation with only limited signs of toxicity. The inhibited glioma cells demonstrated an increase in the number and length of astrocytic processes containing greater numbers of glial filaments, and the NDGA-treated cells also demonstrated extensive lateral pseudopod formation along the processes. The glioblastoma cell shape also became more elongated, losing the usual nuclear lobularity and nuclear inclusions, especially in NDGA-treated cells. Many cytoplasmic organelles packed the cytosol of the inhibited glioma cells, including prominent Golgi apparatus, dilated smooth endoplasmic reticulum evolving into dilated vesicles, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and numerous concentric laminations. There was limited evidence for toxicity, however, as the mitochondria were more pleomorphic with some mitochondrial distention and disruption of the cristae along with an increase in cytoplasmic vacuolization. We conclude that the inhibitors of eicosanoid biosynthesis, NDGA and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, not only suppress glioblastoma cell proliferation, but also induce increased astrocytic differentiation. 
5	Changes in high-energy phosphate metabolism and cell morphology in four models of acute experimental pancreatitis. Previous studies using the isolated ex vivo perfused canine pancreatitis preparation showed that during a 4-hour perfusion pancreatitis (edema, weight gain, hyperamylasemia) can be induced by four different stimuli. The stimuli include the intra-arterial infusion of oleic acid (FFA), a 2-hour period of ischemia before perfusion (ISCH), partial obstruction of the pancreatic duct with secretin stimulation (POSS), and the intra-arterial infusion of cerulein at supramaximal doses (CER). In the present study, changes in high-energy phosphate metabolism, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and changes in cellular structure, determined by light and electron microscopy, were documented for all four models of acute pancreatitis. The control preparations remained stable for the 4-hour perfusion period, with no decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. In the FFA preparations, ATP decreased to 36% of baseline levels during the 4-hour perfusion (p less than 0.001). In the ISCH preparations, ATP decreased to undetectable levels during the 2-hour period of ischemia, but recovered rapidly and remained at baseline levels during the perfusion. ATP levels remained stable in the remaining two models of pancreatitis (POSS, CER). Microscopy demonstrated that the initial injury was located chiefly in the capillaries (swollen endothelium, intravascular thrombi) in the FFA and ISCH preparations. In the POSS and CER preparations, capillary changes were minimal and the injury was located chiefly in the acinar cells (swollen endoplasmic reticulum, zymogen granule depletion, vacuolization). The POSS preparations also showed striking dilation of centroacinar lumens reflecting duct obstruction. In additional studies it was shown that the ATP decline in the FFA preparations could be significantly reduced by pretreatment with free radical scavengers. The morphologic changes could be reduced by free radical scavengers in the FFA and ISCH preparations. Any amelioration of morphologic injury in the POSS preparations was obscured by dilatation of centroacinar lumens in both treated and untreated groups. The morphologic changes in the CER preparations were reduced by treatment with a cholecystokinin inhibitor. 
1	The role of chemotherapy for node-negative breast cancer. Approximately 25% of women with early stage breast cancer and negative axillary nodes will eventually die of metastatic disease. Some studies have shown a recurrence rate of 40% or more at 10 years in this relatively good prognostic group. The incidence of breast cancer continues to increase approximately 1% per year with a great increase in the frequency of early stage disease (particularly in situ carcinoma). The increased use of mammography and physical examination with appropriate follow-up will increase the frequency of diagnosis of node-negative patients compared with those with more advanced stages. Women with positive axillary nodes who are premenopausal benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas those who are postmenopausal have shown a clear reduction in mortality when treated with tamoxifen. It is even more reasonable to speculate that women with node-negative disease could have an even greater benefit from adjuvant therapy because they have a lower tumor burden at the time of diagnosis. Compared with earlier clinical adjuvant trials, more recent studies (1981-89) have shown a disease-free survival advantage for node-negative breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Hopefully, the differences noticed in disease-free survival will show a similar survival advantage with further observations. The results of these clinical trials suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy may be of benefit to patients with node-negative disease but do not support the contention that all node-negative patients with breast cancer should receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Some prognostic subgroups (tumor size greater than 2 cm) have shown an overall 10-year survival rate of 92% for women who have not received adjuvant therapy. The benefits versus toxicities of adjuvant therapy should be carefully evaluated before the initiation of adjuvant therapy. 
5	Cauda equina anatomy. I: Intrathecal nerve root organization. The three-dimensional organization of the human cauda equina has not been described previously. This is partly due to the difficulties of dissecting individual, unfixed nerve roots. By the use of a newly developed in situ fixation and embedding technique on 15 fresh human cadavers, the cross-sectional anatomy of the cauda equina was defined from L2-L3 to L5-S1. A highly consistent cross-sectional pattern was observed in all specimens. The lower sacral (S2-S5) and coccygeal roots were located in the dorsal aspect of the thecal sac, whereas the lumbar and first sacral roots exhibited an oblique, layered pattern as they ascended. The motor bundle was situated anteromedial to its respective sensory bundle within each layer, Invaginations of arachnoid held the nerve roots in a fixed relationship to one another. This previously undescribed three-dimensional anatomy within the thecal sac may aid in the understanding and treatment of trauma, neurocompressive syndromes, and tumors of the cauda equina. 
5	Comparison of ventricular arrhythmia induction with use of an indwelling electrode catheter and a newly inserted catheter. Two methods of serial electrophysiologic testing are in widespread use. Most commonly, the electrode catheter is removed after each study and a new catheter reinserted through the femoral vein for every subsequent test. An alternative method employs an electrode catheter that remains in place during several days of serial testing. Little is known about differences between these two methods with respect to the likelihood of induction of arrhythmia or the frequency of complications. To determine whether inducibility of sustained arrhythmia is altered or if the frequency of complications is unacceptably high with use of an indwelling catheter, a prospective randomized study was conducted in 78 patients. Each patient underwent baseline testing, several days of electropharmacologic testing with an indwelling catheter, a 24 h drug elimination period and placement of a new electrode catheter. Ventricular stimulation studies were then performed in each patient with both the indwelling and new electrode catheters. No differences were found between the indwelling and new catheter tests with respect to induction of arrhythmia, number of extrastimuli required to induce arrhythmia, rate of arrhythmia or requirement for cardioversion. Ventricular pacing thresholds were higher and effective refractory periods were slightly longer when measured with the indwelling catheter. Complications related to the 156 catheter insertions included two that may have been related to the indwelling catheter (one episode of staphylococcal sepsis and one presumed pulmonary embolism) and four that were related to invasive procedures (pneumothorax in all). There were no long-term adverse sequelae of these complications. 
4	The natural history of left ventricular spontaneous contrast. Spontaneous contrast in the left ventricle is an unusual entity. We retrospectively studied 16 patients who were found to have spontaneous contrast present on two-dimensional echocardiograms, specifically noting their clinical characteristics, the reproducibility of this phenomenon, the presence of thrombi and embolic events, and prognostic implications. Diagnoses included ischemic heart disease in nine patients, dilated cardiomyopathy in six patients, and hypertensive cardiomyopathy in one patient. The mean ejection fraction was 17.6%. There were six thromboembolic events in four patients. The spontaneous contrast was reproducible for periods of time up to 39 months. Patients who had improvement in their left ventricular dysfunction or who underwent aneurysmectomy had disappearance of the spontaneous contrast. Those patients who had spontaneous contrast reproduced on subsequent echocardiograms did not seem to have a worse prognosis than patients with similarly depressed ventricular function, but a larger study is necessary to verify this. 
3	Catecholaminergic systems in the medulla oblongata in parkinsonian syndromes: a quantitative immunohistochemical study in Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and striatonigral degeneration. We investigated tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive neurons in the medulla oblongata corresponding to the A1 and A2 cell groups in autopsy tissue of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 3), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n = 3), striatonigral degeneration (SND) (n = 2), and in controls (n = 4). The estimated total number of TH-positive neurons in the A1 and the A2 regions was normal in PD and PSP patients. The sparing of medullary catecholaminergic cells in PD and PSP may be related to their minor degree of melanization and the possibility that intermediate compounds associated with the oxidative catabolism of norepinephrine and epinephrine may be less cytotoxic than those generated by degradation of dopamine. Patients with SND showed a marked loss of TH-immunoreactive cells in the A1 and the A2 groups, which may contribute to the impairment of vasomotor control characteristic of the disease. 
5	A clinically applicable method for long-term salvage of postischemic skeletal muscle. The clinical significance and applicability of interventions aimed at reducing reperfusion injury in postischemic skeletal muscle remain unproven, since long-term muscle salvage has not been demonstrated by most treatment protocols that attenuate early reperfusion injury. We have shown that reperfusion of ischemic skeletal muscle results in an early and prolonged sequestration of white blood cells and activation of the alternative complement cascade. The purpose of this study was to determine if 40 minutes of reperfusion with blood depleted of white blood cells and complement proteins, followed by 2 days of normal perfusion, would reduce muscle necrosis after 5 hours of ischemia. The isolated paired canine gracilis muscle model was used. The treatment muscle was initially reperfused with arterial blood that had been spun, washed, passed through a leukocyte removal filter, and resuspended in hydroxyethyl starch (greater than 99.9% removal of white blood cells and the complement proteins factor B and C4). The contralateral control muscle was subjected to unaltered reperfusion. Blood flow (ml/min/100 gm) was measured by timed collection of gracilis venous blood. Myeloperoxidase activity (absorbance at 655 nm/min/mg tissue protein) in muscle biopsies was used to monitor white blood cell sequestration. After 48 hours of reperfusion in vivo, necrosis was quantified by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. Initial reperfusion with white blood cell and complement depleted blood significantly reduced muscle necrosis (53% +/- 3% vs 29% +/- 8%, p less than 0.0025, paired t test). Early blood flow was improved, (p = 0.0025, repeated measure-ANOVA), but subsequent white blood cell sequestration was not altered (p = 0.33, repeated measure-ANOVA). This suggests that a significant amount of white blood cell mediated injury occurs during the first 40 minutes of reperfusion. Preventing early complement activation and white blood cell mediated reperfusion injury is an intervention that is feasible during surgery and may result in clinically significant salvage of postischemic skeletal muscle. 
1	Non-Hodgkins lymphoma of the head and neck: experience in the Grampian area. The records of 44 cases of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) presenting to the ear, nose and throat department in the Grampian area from 1980-1988 were examined in relation to site of occurrence, histology, age at presentation, clinical stage, treatment and survival. The median age was 67 years and there was a preponderance of high grade histology, especially in disease affecting the tonsil. Most deaths occurred in the first year; patients with high grade disease and those in stages three and four had a significantly poorer survival during the first year. The site of disease had no influence on survival. 
4	Role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in congestive heart failure. Conventional therapy for congestive heart failure (CHF) includes sodium-restricted diet, diuretics, digitalis, vasodilators, and short-term intravenous administration of beta-adrenergic agonists during episodes of decompensation. A specific class of vasodilators, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, has recently gained predominance in the treatment of congestive heart failure. The primary mechanism of action is to reduce production of angiotensin II by competitive inhibition of the enzyme that converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II. Reduced levels of angiotensin II, in turn, promote vasodilation and lower aldosterone production. The benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in chronic congestive heart failure have been demonstrated by improvement in left ventricular performance, exercise capacity, functional status (using New York Heart Association classification), and survival. 
2	Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of gallstones: results and 6-month follow-up in 141 patients. A study of biliary shock wave lithotripsy of gallstones sponsored by Dornier Medical Systems, Munich, began in the United States in May 1988 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and the need for adjunctive therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). One hundred forty-one symptomatic patients with one to three gallstones 5-30 mm in diameter were randomized to treatment. One week before ESWL, patients were given either UDCA or placebo. This treatment was continued for 6 months. All patients underwent follow-up at predetermined intervals. According to the protocol, re-treatment for fragments larger than 5 mm in diameter could be performed only at 6 weeks; 26 (18%) of the 141 patients were retreated. At 6 months, the stone-free rates for single stones were as follows: patients with noncalcified stones receiving UDCA, 29%; patients with noncalcified stones receiving placebo, 24%; and patients with partially calcified stones receiving either UDCA or placebo, 6%. No significant difference was noted between the UDCA and placebo groups. At 6 months, the stone-free rates in patients with single, noncalcified stones 20 mm or less in diameter were 40% (UDCA) and 32% (placebo), which is superior to rates for those with solitary, noncalcified gallstones 21-30 mm in diameter and those with two or three stones. 
5	The perception of life events and daily stress in nonulcer dyspepsia. Previous studies on the association of nonulcer dyspepsia with major life events were performed without emphasis on the perception of these events, and have yielded conflicting results. The present study examined the perception of life events and, in addition, the role of daily "hassles" (stressful events) in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia. Thirty-three dyspeptic patients as defined by normal endoscopy and ultrasonogram and 33 controls of comparable sex, age, and social class were recruited for study. Both groups were asked to select from 56 major life events those they had experienced and to give a rating on how they perceived them. They were further asked to select similarly from 117 items of daily stress and to rate the severity of each item. The results demonstrated that the number of positive and negative events and the positive score were similar in both dyspeptic patients and controls, but dyspeptic patients had a higher perceived magnitude of negative events and a higher score of total life change as given by the summation of magnitude of positive and negative events (both p less than 0.05). The "hassles" scores were not significantly different between dyspeptic patients and controls. Analysis of individual life events revealed that dyspeptic patients had significantly (p less than 0.05) higher scores than controls in items of minor law violations, major change in closeness of family members, and major personal illness or injury. We conclude that patients with nonulcer dyspepsia have higher negative perception of major life events, which indicates that psychological factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of nonulcer dyspepsia. 
5	Nodular regenerative hyperplasia: a cause of ascites and hepatomegaly after chemotherapy for leukemia. Tender hepatomegaly and ascites occurred in a young woman receiving cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin for acute myelogenous leukemia. Whereas veno-occlusive disease was suspected clinically, liver biopsy showed nodular regenerative hyperplasia with no evidence of hepatic vein abnormalities. It is postulated that nodular regenerative hyperplasia can be initiated by hepatotoxicity of chemotherapy agents used to treat leukemia and/or that these agents exacerbate clinical manifestations of this histological abnormality. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia should be added to the list of liver problems occurring in patients with leukemia. 
5	Risks of intestinal anastomoses in Crohn's disease. Six hundred fifty-eight intestinal anastomoses in 429 operations for Crohn's disease were studied prospectively during an 8-year period to detect variables connected with perioperative morbidity. Postoperative complications occurred in 9.7% of the patients, 4% had to be reoperated on, and the overall mortality rate was 0.5%. In multivariate analysis by stepwise logistic regression, the only variable significantly (p = 0.03) associated with overall rate of complications was long-term corticosteroid therapy. Serious complications were more common in cases of intra-abdominal abscesses (p = 0.01) and preoperative steroid medication (p = 0.03). The combination of both of these risk factors increased the rate of reoperations from 0.6% (no steroids, no abscess) to 16% (steroids and abscess). No significant association with postoperative complications could be found for age, sex, duration of disease, previous operations, nutritional status, emergency surgery, extent of disease, type, number, and localization of anastomoses, presence of proximal ileo-/colostomy, or histologically inflamed margins of resection. 
5	Emergency surgical treatment for nonvariceal bleeding of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic and biochemical data were collected prospectively from 1,530 patients admitted with nonvariceal bleeding of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract between September 1985 and June 1989. Therapeutic endoscopy was done for 93 patients who underwent emergency surgical treatment for bleeding, subsequently required in 29 patients with seven postoperative fatalities. In contrast, 31 (15.7 per cent) of 198 patients (mortality rate of 9.6 per cent at 30 days) died in the hospital who had undergone emergency operation in whom therapeutic endoscopy had not been performed; data for this latter group is now presented. At admission, a greater likelihood of emergency operation was associated with a systolic blood pressure of 100 millimeters of mercury and endoscopic stigmatas of recent hemorrhage (ESRH) (p less than 0.001). Rebleeding rates for the presence of fresh blood, active spurting and oozing hemorrhage or visible vessel in an ulcer base were 26.5, 28.9 and 35.9 per cent, respectively. Endoscopic stigmatas were thus associated with an increased risk of bleeding (p less than 0.0001) and rebleeding led to a sixfold increase in the mortality rate. Congestive cardiac failure, chronic obstructive airway disease, chronic renal failure and a history of previous malignant disease were each associated with postoperative mortality rates of more than 50 per cent. An increased risk of mortality after emergency operation was related to age (p less than 0.0001), preoperative (p less than 0.002) and total (p less than 0.0001) blood transfusion requirement. Immediate operation after resuscitation and endoscopy was required in 87 patients; 11 deaths (hospital mortality rate of 12.7 per cent and 9.2 per cent at 30 days) occurred in this group compared with 20 fatalities (18.0 per cent) documented in 111 patients (9.9 per cent at 30 days) who underwent surgical treatment for rebleeding. We conclude that age, concomitant medical illness and preoperative and total transfusion requirements are each related to outcome after emergency operations. Such urgent intervention is best avoided if at all possible in patients with severe concomitant medical illness. 
5	The Hastings bipolar hemiarthroplasty for subcapital fractures of the femoral neck. A 10-year prospective study. In a 10-year prospective study, 561 displaced subcapital fractures of the femoral neck in 546 patients were treated with the Hastings bipolar hemiarthroplasty. Within six months of their operations, 148 patients had died. In 322 hips followed up, 243 with adequate serial radiographs separated by more than one year, only 14 (5.6%) showed acetabular erosion. A group of 91 had been reviewed for between three and nine years (mean, 4 years 10 months) and of these, 95% had no pain or slight pain only. Comparison with an earlier series of conventional hemiarthroplasties reported from this institution showed that the clinical results were similar, but that the erosion rate had been halved. 
4	Comparison of coronary angiography and early oral dipyridamole thallium-201 scintigraphy in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. We evaluated 50 consecutive patients who received thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction using thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography in combination with oral dipyridamole (300 mg) to assess the frequency of residual myocardial ischemia. Thallium studies were performed early after myocardial infarction at a mean of 4.6 days (range 3 to 11) in 50 patients. The time from the onset of chest pain to the administration of thrombolytic therapy was 2.6 hours (range 0.5 to 5.5). Q wave myocardial infarction was evident in 46 patients; four patients had a non-Q wave infarction (anterior infarction in 31 patients and inferior infarction in 19 patients). The serum mean peak creatinine kinase was 1503 IU/L (range 127 to 6500). Coronary angiography was performed in all patients at a mean of 3.1 days (range 2 to 10) and revealed the infarct-related vessel to be patent in 36 patients (72%). The ejection fraction was 48% (range 26% to 67%). After dipyridamole administration, 13 patients (26%) developed angina that was easily reversed with the administration of intravenous aminophylline. Systolic blood pressure decreased from 122 to 115 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and the heart rate increased from 76 to 85 beats/min (p less than 0.05). None of the patients had significant hypotension, arrhythmias, or evidence of infarct extension. Perfusion abnormalities were present on the initial thallium images in 48 patients. Redistribution suggestive of ischemia was present in 36 patients (72%). Ischemia confined to the vascular distribution of the infarct vessel was evident in 22 patients. Seven patients had ischemia in the infarct zone as well as in a remote myocardial segment. Thus 29 patients (58%) had ischemia in the distribution of the infarct vessel. Ischemia in the infarct zone was evident in 19 of 36 patients (53%) with open infarct vessels and in 10 of 14 patients (71%) with occluded infarct vessels. In conclusion, thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography using oral dipyridamole was safely performed in patients with recent myocardial infarctions who receive thrombolytic therapy. 
5	Myotonic dystrophy: quantification of muscle weakness and myotonia and the effect of amitriptyline and exercise. The purpose of this study was to quantify the degree of muscle weakness and myotonia in 12 patients with myotonic dystrophy (MD), and to quantitatively determine the effects of a four- to six-month therapeutic trial of amitriptyline. Patients had exercised with weights for one or more years. Some had shown initial improvement in muscle strength, but had reached a plateau; others had not improved when the study began. Muscle weakness was quantified by comparing the five-second maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in newtons (N) per kg (body weight) of 12 patients and 20 healthy subjects. Knee extensor, elbow flexor, and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles were compared. Myotonia was quantified by measuring relaxation times (RTs) at the end of the five-second MVC produced by FDI, as the time taken for the MVC to decrease by 50% and 75% (referred to as 1/2 and 3/4RT). The results were as follows: (1) the mean muscle strength of each of the three muscles of the patients was significantly (p less than .001) reduced compared with healthy subjects; and (2) 1/2 and 3/4RT means of the patients (vs healthy subjects) were significantly prolonged (p less than .01). Eight of the patients participated in a therapeutic trial of amitriptyline. Therapeutic effects were quantified by measuring muscle strength, 1/2 and 3/4RT, and percent change in evoked muscle action potential (MAP) from the FDI muscle after a ten-second MVC, to determine change in excitability. Mean muscle strength of FDI improved from .27 to .33N/kg, (p less than .05). 
1	Microstaging of squamous cell carcinomas. The clinical classification of squamous cell carcinoma, which was established primarily by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC), does not permit optimal estimation of expected metastasis. The authors' results indicate that metastasis can be more accurately estimated on the basis of invasion depth, histopathologic grading, and especially tumor thickness. One essential advantage of these criteria is that they can be established by a histopathologist. It is interesting to note that in the authors' collective no carcinoma less than 2 mm thick metastasized, that is, a relatively high percentage of carcinomas (48%) can be graded as no-risk carcinomas. The risk of metastasis for undifferentiated carcinomas greater than 6 mm thick that have infiltrated the musculature, the perichondrium, or the periosteum, however, is quite high. Tumors between 2 and 6 mm thick with moderate differentiation and a depth of invasion that does not extend beyond the subcutis can be classified as low-risk carcinomas. 
5	Giant hemangioma of the liver with pain, fever, and abnormal liver tests. Report of two cases. In conclusion, we report the cases of two patients with large hemangiomas of the liver, abdominal pain, increased ESR and fibrinogen, increased serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase activity, and normal white blood cell counts. Clinical and biochemical abnormalities disappeared after surgical resection. Increased ESR and fibrinogen are probably related to thrombosis within the tumor. This mode of presentation may suggest a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
3	The treatment of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome by limbic leucotomy. A patient with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and severe self-injurious compulsions who had failed to respond to drug treatment and behavioural therapy obtained a complete and sustained resolution of his destructive behaviour and improvement in his tics following bilateral limbic leucotomy. 
5	Area of lateral ventricles measured on cranial ultrasonography in preterm infants: association with outcome. The association between measurements of lateral ventricle area (determined by serial ultrasound scans) and outcome was studied in 70 preterm neonates of 33 weeks' gestation or less. The study group was subdivided into four groups according to cranial ultrasonographic findings at 2 weeks postnatal age: group A (n = 15) had isolated periventricular/intraventricular haemorrhage; group B (n = 20) had periventricular/intraventricular haemorrhage and dilated ventricles; group C (n = 24) had periventricular/intraventricular haemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia with or without dilated ventricles; and group D (n = 11) had isolated periventricular leukomalacia. Eighty seven preterm infants with no evidence of intracranial disease and good neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years formed the control group. A poor outcome was observed in infants in group B, C, and D, particularly in those who had persistent dilated ventricles at 6 weeks postnatal age and extensive periventricular leukomalacia. There was no difference in outcome between group A and controls. During the first six weeks of life ventricular area growth velocities were significantly higher in groups B, C, D, compared with normal controls and group A. We suggest that persistent ventricular dilatation at this early stage carries a bad prognosis, which is the result of atrophy of the brain. 
4	Transtelephonic defibrillation. STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to assess the safety and reliability of a device for transtelephonic defibrillation. DESIGN: The transtelephonic system consists of a patient unit and a base station. The patient unit contains a monitor-defibrillator, electrode pads, microphone, microprocessor, and DC defibrillator. The base station comprises a control panel, computer, and ECG display. SETTING: Fifteen patients who were treated in our emergency department for cardiac arrest were placed on patient units that activated our base station in a remote location within the ED. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen patients were treated for ventricular fibrillation, and two patients were treated for ventricular tachycardia. INTERVENTIONS: Thirty-one shocks were delivered transtelephonically. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In all cases, voice and ECG transmission were established without difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this system represents a safe and reliable method for the treatment of ventricular fibrillation, and we advocate additional use to study the prehospital applications of transtelephonic defibrillation. 
5	Experience with in situ saphenous vein bypasses during 1981 to 1989: determinant factors of long-term patency. From 1981 to 1989, 361 consecutive in situ saphenous vein bypasses were performed. Indications for revascularization were critical limb ischemia (n = 335, 93%), popliteal aneurysm (n = 15, 4%), and claudication (n = 11, 3%). Outflow tract was the popliteal artery in 116 (32%) and tibial artery in 245 (68%) of bypasses. At 6 years primary patency was 63% and secondary patency was 81%. During the performance of the in situ bypass procedure, 86 (24%) venous conduits were modified because of a technical failure (n = 49, 13%) or an inadequate vein segment (n = 37, 10%). Secondary patency at 4 years for bypasses requiring modification was 72% compared to 84% for bypasses not modified (p less than 0.05). Atherosclerotic disease of the inflow artery necessitating endarterectomy, patch angioplasty, or replacement lowered primary patency at 3 years (69%) compared to the inflow artery not requiring reconstruction (46%, p less than 0.02). In the follow-up period, 95 (26%) bypasses were revised because of thrombosis or hemodynamic failure. Bypasses requiring revision had a 4-year secondary patency of 68% compared to 88% for bypasses not revised (p less than 0.02). The first 179 cases (1981 to 1985) were compared to the subsequent 182 cases (1986 to 1989). The secondary patency at 3 years for the latter half (92%) compared to the first half (80%) of the experience was significantly improved (p less than 0.02). The secondary patency for bypasses not requiring revision was significantly improved (p less than 0.02) for the latter half (n = 142, 97%) compared to the first half (n = 124, 83%) of the series. Long-term patency with the in situ saphenous vein bypass is dependent on surgical experience, quality of the venous conduit, and atherosclerotic disease of the inflow artery that necessitates reconstruction. Meticulous surgical technique and compulsive bypass surveillance results in superior long-term patency. 
5	Lack of increased bleeding after paracentesis and thoracentesis in patients with mild coagulation abnormalities. To determine whether untreated mild coagulopathy in patients with no evidence of clinical bleeding is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage after paracentesis or thoracentesis, retrospective examination was conducted of 608 consecutive procedures for which prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), platelet (Plt) counts, and preprocedure and postprocedure hemoglobin concentrations were available. There was no increased bleeding in patients with mild to moderate coagulopathy (defined as PT or PTT up to twice the midpoint normal range or pit count of 50 to 99 x 10(3) per microL [50-99 x 10(9)/L]). However, patients with markedly elevated serum creatinine levels (6.0 to 14.0 mg/dL [530-1240 mumol/L]) had a significantly greater average hemoglobin loss (-0.82 +/- 1.3 g/dL [-8 +/- 13 g/L], n = 11) than patients with normal serum creatinine levels (-0.12 +/- 0.88 g/dL [-1 +/- 9 g/L], n = 450) (p = 0.011). Overall, the frequency of bleeding complications requiring red cell transfusions was very low: 0.2 percent of events. The most common diagnosis for patients who had paracentesis was alcoholic liver disease (72%); for those having thoracentesis, it was infection (37%). It can be concluded that, for these patients, prophylactic plasma or platelet transfusions are not necessary. Patients with markedly elevated serum creatinine deserve close postprocedure observation. 
5	Benign missense variations in the cystic fibrosis gene. The common mutation causing cystic fibrosis is a deletion of phenylalanine 508 (delta F508), which occurs in a putative nucleotide-binding fold of the gene product. We report two additional mutations, substitution of cysteine for phenylalanine 508 (F508C) and substitution of valine for isoleucine 506 (I506V). Three compound heterozygous persons, two delta F508/F508C and one delta F508/I506V, had normal clinical and epithelial physiological studies indicating that the F508C and I506V mutations are benign. This opportunity to study the in vivo function of these mutations suggests that amino acid substitutions are more benign than changes in the length of this portion of the putative nucleotide-binding fold. These mutations must be taken into account when performing molecular diagnosis and carrier detection for cystic fibrosis. 
5	Hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome. A 66-year-old woman with Pendred's syndrome underwent a partial thyroidectomy when she was 17 years old. At the age of 52 years, she had a second thyroid operation because of hyperthyroidism due to a toxic multinodular goiter with a mediastinal extension consisting of several separate nodules. Five years later a hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular carcinoma was diagnosed histologically. After treatment with radioactive iodine, the patient was well. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of a metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome and the first report of hyperthyroidism occurring after malignant degeneration of a dyshormonogenetic goiter. 
2	Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Previous studies have suggested that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a key factor in the syndrome of portasystemic encephalopathy. We report the case of a patient with medically intractable portasytemic encephalopathy after portacaval shunt who had marked clinical improvement after creation of an end ileostomy. Plasma GABA and serum ammonia levels were measured before and after ileostomy. Although the clinical syndrome and the EEG improved markedly after the ileostomy, the plasma GABA levels remained markedly elevated. Preoperative and postoperative GABA levels were 865 and 633 pmol/ml, respectively (nl = 100-180 pmol/ml). Our findings confirm previous reports of the efficacy of colonic exclusion in patients with intractable portasystemic encephalopathy. However, our results conflict with the hypothesis that GABA itself is the key mediator of the syndrome. 
1	DNA sequences 3' of the Ig H chain cluster rearrange in mouse B cell lines. A mouse myeloma cell line MPC11 (IgG2b, kappa) and variants derived from it have been used to study DNA rearrangements that occur at the Ig H chain locus. One variant, F5.5, has acquired both VH gene and C epsilon gene rearrangements. Through genomic Southern blot analysis initially directed to mapping the C epsilon gene rearrangement, we observed that the VH region rearrangement was linked, through an inversion event, to sequences that originate 3' of the CH cluster, i.e., 3' of the C alpha gene. Subsequent studies have shown that DNA rearrangements within the region 3' of the C alpha gene are detected in several other mouse myeloma and hybridoma cell lines and are not associated with the expression of specific isotypes. 
3	Mycosis fungoides-like lesions associated with phenytoin and carbamazepine therapy. We report the cases of four patients who were taking the anticonvulsant drugs phenytoin or carbamazepine and in whom skin lesions developed that showed histologic features suggestive of mycosis fungoides. Two patients had a solitary lesion on the trunk, whereas the other two patients had multiple plaques. In all four patients systemic signs were absent. 
5	MYC rearrangement and translocations involving band 8q24 in diffuse large cell lymphomas. The configuration of the MYC gene in diffuse large cell lymphomas (DLCL) with translocations involving band 8q24 [t(8q24)] has not been systematically studied. We collected cytogenetic and clinical data on 171 consecutive cases of DLCL, including cleaved, noncleaved, and immunoblastic types, of which 96 had DNA available and 124 had abnormal karyotypes. The cases with DNA available were evaluated for MYC rearrangement (MYC-R) by Southern hybridization of EcoRI-digested tumor DNA using an exon-1 probe, a combination of probe and enzyme known to detect over 85% of breaks in sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma. In cases studied at diagnosis, MYC-R, t(8;14)(q24;q32), or other t(8q24) were not prognostically significant. Among the 124 cases with karyotypic abnormalities, seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus was significantly more common in cases with a t(8q24) (72%) than in cases without it (9%) (P less than .05). Of the four cases with an MYC -R, two had a t(8;14), one had a t(7;8;14)(p15;q24;q32), and one had a t(8;?)(q24;?) and a del(8)(q24). In the three previous cases with translocations involving 8q24 and 14q32, comigration of the rearranged MYC band with either the J region or the switch-mu region of the Ig heavy chain gene could not be demonstrated, leaving the 14q32 breakpoint undefined at the molecular level. Among the remaining 72 cases where both an abnormal karyotype and molecular data were available, 11 had a t(8q24), either t(8;14) or t(8;22)(q24;q11), in the absence of an MYC-R. In these cases, the 8q24 break was presumably located outside of the EcoRI MYC fragment. All 15 cases with a t(8q24) were also screened for point mutations in the PvuII site in the first exon of MYC; two cases that were not MYC-R showed loss of this restriction site. These results indicate that in most DLCL with t(8;14) or other t(8q24), the 8q24 breakpoint lies away from the MYC gene; in a minority of these cases, point mutations in regulatory noncoding regions were detected. 
5	Prophylaxis of uric acid stones with alternate day doses of alkaline potassium salts. Uric acid stone formation ordinarily is prevented by increases in the urinary pH after meals. This postprandial alkaline tide is lost in patients who make such calculi. Single dose, alternate day administration of an alkaline potassium salt will increase urinary pH and simulate this normal physiological mechanism. An important part of the regimen is patient self-monitoring to verify that the urinary pH increases to greater than 6.8, 1 1/2 to 2 hours after the medication is taken. In contrast to multiple dose daily regimens, this mode of base administration is tolerated better and easier to follow. In 17 patients, 7 with the recurrent gravel/colic syndrome and 10 with prior stones, this regimen abolished calculus formation during an average followup of 2 1/2 years. However, further studies are needed before this regimen can be recommended as standard therapy for uric acid stone prophylaxis. 
5	Utility of upright tilt-table testing in the evaluation and management of syncope of unknown origin PURPOSE: Vasovagally mediated hypotension and bradycardia are believed to be common, but difficult to diagnose, causes of syncope. Upright tilt-table testing has been proposed as a possible way to test for vasovagal episodes. This study investigated the clinical utility of this technique in the evaluation and management of patients with syncope of unknown origin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with recurrent unexplained syncope and six control subjects were evaluated by use of an upright tilt-table test for 30 minutes, with or without an infusion of isoproterenol (1 to 3 micrograms/minute given intravenously), in an attempt to provoke bradycardia, hypotension, or both. Of the 25 patients, there were 14 males and 11 females, with a mean age of 50 +/- 16 years. Six control patients with no history of syncope were also studied. All tilt-positive patients received therapy with either beta-blockers, disopyramide, transdermal scopolamine, or hydroflurocortisone, the efficacy of which was evaluated by another tilt-table test. RESULTS: Syncope occurred in six patients (24%) during the baseline tilt and in nine patients (36%) during isoproterenol infusion (total positives, 60%). None of the controls had syncope during the test. All patients who had positive test results eventually became tilt-table-negative by therapy, and over a mean follow-up period of 16 +/- 2 months no further episodes have occurred. CONCLUSION: From this study we conclude that upright tilt-table testing combined with isoproterenol infusion is clinically useful in the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope and the evaluation of pharmacologic therapy. 
3	Oxidation reactions in Parkinson's disease. Free radicals generated from oxidation reactions may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Free radicals are capable of reacting almost instantaneously with membrane lipids and causing lipid peroxidation, membrane injury, and cell death. Dopamine is metabolized by oxidation reactions capable of generating free radicals. Recent evidence indicates that the substantia nigra of patients with PD contains increased iron, which enhances oxidation, and decreased glutathione, which protects against the formation of free radicals. Further, the end products of lipid peroxidation are increased in the substantia nigra of patients with PD, supporting the notions that free radicals are being generated and may contribute to dopamine neuronal death. This hypothesis suggests that antioxidant therapies may slow the rate of progression of PD and raises concern that metabolites of levodopa therapy may accelerate the rate of neuronal degeneration. 
1	Cholecystectomy and right colon cancer in Puerto Rico. A case-control study was undertaken to evaluate the possible relationship between cholecystectomy and right colon cancer. Two hundred patients with adenocarcinoma of the cecum or ascending colon (diagnosed between 1984 and 1989) were compared with 200 matched neighborhood controls. Cholecystectomy history was obtained through interviews using structured questionnaires and subsequently validated from hospital records. A statistically significant association (odds ratio = 2.14) was found between right colon cancer and a history of prior cholecystectomy. The altered bile metabolism which occurs after removal of the gallbladder may have a carcinogenic effect on the right colon. Dietary habits of the colon cancer patients in our study were consistent with prior reports in the literature, showing that this group has a lower intake of vegetables and cereal fiber than the control population. 
4	A kallikrein-like enzyme in blood vessels of one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats. Active and inactive kallikrein or a kallikrein-like enzyme are found in the aorta, vena cava, and tail artery and veins of the rat. We studied the concentration of vascular kininogenase in rats with one-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertension and in unilaterally nephrectomized normotensive rats. Six weeks after surgery, active and total vascular kininogenase activity (active plus trypsin-activated) was measured. Blood pressure was 212 +/- 4 mm Hg in the hypertensive rats (n = 33) and 120 +/- 1 mm Hg in the normotensive rats (n = 32) (p less than 0.001). Active kininogenase was lower in the hypertensive rats; although the difference was not significant in the thoracic aorta (56 +/- 8 versus 77 +/- 15), it was highly significant in the abdominal aorta (63 +/- 13 versus 167 +/- 17, p less than 0.001) and tail artery (48 +/- 8 versus 197 +/- 31, p less than 0.003). Total vascular kininogenase activity (active plus trypsin-activated) was lower in the hypertensive rats in all arteries examined: thoracic aorta (183 +/- 16 versus 380 +/- 38, p less than 0.003), abdominal aorta (565 +/- 61 versus 1,093 +/- 74, p less than 0.001), and tail artery (532 +/- 112 versus 1,243 +/- 135, p less than 0.003). Active kininogenase in the vena cava was higher in the hypertensive rats (213 +/- 56 versus 131 +/- 31); however, this difference was not statistically significant, whereas in the tail veins it was highly significant (1,803 +/- 221 versus 771 +/- 79, p less than 0.003). 
5	Esophageal adenocarcinoma in a patient with surgically treated achalasia. Although squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus occurs with increased incidence in primary achalasia, esophageal adenocarcinoma has been considered rare in this condition. We report a patient with long-standing achalasia in whom adenocarcinoma of the esophagus occurred many years after Heller esophagomyotomy, presumably related to Barrett's esophagus complicating gastro-esophageal reflux disease. 
5	Childhood traumas: an outline and overview Childhood psychic trauma appears to be a crucial etiological factor in the development of a number of serious disorders both in childhood and in adulthood. Like childhood rheumatic fever, psychic trauma sets a number of different problems into motion, any of which may lead to a definable mental condition. The author suggests four characteristics related to childhood trauma that appear to last for long periods of life, no matter what diagnosis the patient eventually receives. These are visualized or otherwise repeatedly perceived memories of the traumatic event, repetitive behaviors, trauma-specific fears, and changed attitudes about people, life, and the future. She divides childhood trauma into two basic types and defines the findings that can be used to characterize each of these types. Type I trauma includes full, detailed memories, "omens," and misperceptions. Type II trauma includes denial and numbing, self-hypnosis and dissociation, and rage. Crossover conditions often occur after sudden, shocking deaths or accidents that leave children handicapped. In these instances, characteristics of both type I and type II childhood traumas exist side by side. There may be considerable sadness. Each finding of childhood trauma discussed by the author is illustrated with one or two case examples. 
1	Vascularized full-thickness parietal bone grafts in maxillofacial reconstruction: the role of the galea and superficial temporal vessels. Reconstruction of bony structures of the face is always a problem as big as the defect and the function that must be replaced. Everything from simple grafts to sophisticated distant bone flaps has been used. Based on the studies of Cutting et al., Psillakis et al., and Casanova et al., we have developed the full-thickness galeoparietal bone flap, initially for mandibular reconstruction, but of great use for all maxillofacial reconstructions. From July of 1987 to December of 1988, 14 patients have been operated on. The experience with this flap is shown in four patients as follows: primary reconstruction of a mandible as a result of ameloblastoma, secondary reconstruction of a mandible with associated old fractures and malalignment of segments, bilateral malar reconstruction in a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome, and severe sequelae of an already treated Romberg case. Small variations could be made to best accommodate the technique used to the defect we were treating. Some technical details, the experience, the results, and possible sequelae or complications are also discussed. 
1	Intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy for recurrent locally advanced rectal or rectosigmoid carcinoma. A multimodality approach of moderate-dose to high-dose preoperative radiation therapy, surgical resection, and intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IORT) has been used for patients with locally recurrent rectal or rectosigmoid carcinoma. The 5-year actuarial local control and disease-free survival for 30 patients undergoing this treatment program were 26% and 19%, respectively. The most important factor predicting a favorable outcome was complete resection with negative pathologic resection margins. The determinant local control and disease-free survival for 13 patients undergoing complete resection were 62% and 54%, respectively, whereas for 17 patients undergoing partial resection these figures were 18% and 6%, respectively. There did not appear to be a difference in local control or survival based on the original surgical resection (abdominoperineal resection versus low anterior resection). However, the likelihood of obtaining a complete resection after preoperative radiation therapy was higher in patients who had previously undergone a low anterior resection than patients undergoing prior abdominoperineal resection. For the 30 patients undergoing external beam irradiation, resection, and IORT, the most significant toxicities were soft tissue or sacral injury and pelvic neuropathy. Efforts to further improve local control are directed toward the concurrent use of chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil with and without leucovorin) as radiation dose modifiers during external beam irradiation and the use of additional postoperative radiation therapy. 
5	Severe hypertension after liver transplantation in alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Five children with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and terminal liver disease received liver grafts; all five became hypertensive and four developed hypertensive encephalopathy. There was evidence of renal disease preoperatively and renal biopsy specimens showed variable glomerulonephritic histology with IgA nephropathy in one, mesangial-proliferative changes in two, and mesangio-capillary glomerulonephritis type I in two. Four hypertensive episodes were preceded by a fall in creatinine clearance. The association of glomerulonephritis with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency in children is more common than has been recognised. Affected patients are prone to severe hypertension of probable renal origin after liver transplantation and the renal lesion may affect long term prognosis. 
3	Left alien hand sign and mirror writing after left anterior cerebral artery infarction. A 43-year-old, right-handed man was admitted complaining of peculiar movements of his left hand. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed an infarct area in the territory of the left anterior cerebral artery. The abnormal movements of the left hand were diagnosed as so-called alien hand sign. This patient also exhibited mirror writing with his left hand. The clinical manifestations and neuroradiological findings of this case are described in detail, and the possible mechanisms of these extremely rare combinations of alien hand sign and mirror writing are discussed. 
5	Massive hemorrhage from an arterioureteral fistula associated with chronic renal transplant failure. A case of arterioureteral fistula from the graft artery stump of a failed transplant and the native ureter is reported. This case illustrates one of the possible complications of graft anastomosis. The etiological factors involved in the formation of the aneurysm and eventually the fistula are discussed. 
1	Systematic computer-aided search of optimal staging system for colorectal cancer. Two hundred and ninety-eight patients with curatively resected colorectal cancer were classified into 12 categories according to the depth of tumour penetration (T1-T4), and lymph node status (N0-N2). Using a computer, these categories were grouped into 2-12 stages in every possible combination, so a total of 146,975 logical classifications were generated. The optimal model was selected for each group of classifications with equal stage number, thus giving the greatest prognostic information on 5-year survival according to the Akaike criterion. The results showed that (1) 13% of the total classifications, including 85% of the 3-stage classifications, were better than the Dukes system in predicting our patients' outcomes; (2) the T-level was a stage-determinant even more important than the N-level; and (3) major changes in prognosis occurred at more advanced stages than the classical "turning points". We conclude that in order to find an optimal staging of cancer, systematic computer-aided search through all the possible classifications is necessary, using the appropriate database. 
4	Intraoperative assessment of regional myocardial perfusion using quantitative myocardial contrast echocardiography: an experimental evaluation. To test the hypothesis that myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to quantitate regional myocardial flow in the arrested heart at the time of delivery of cardioplegic solution, data were acquired in 13 dogs on cardiopulmonary bypass. Different degrees of stenosis were placed in random order on the left anterior descending coronary artery. For each stenosis, myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed by injecting sonicated albumin microbubbles into the cross-clamped aortic root at the time of delivery of cardioplegic solution. The resultant echocardiographic images were analyzed on an off-line computer. Background-subtracted time-intensity plots were generated, and an exponential function, f(t) = Ce-alpha t + De- beta t, was applied to each plot. Variables that reflected the total number of microbubbles entering the coronary artery bed, such as the area under the curve and the peak height of the curve, correlated best with radiolabeled microsphere-measured myocardial flow (r = 0.92 and r = 0.91, respectively). Variables that reflected the appearance of contrast microbubbles in the myocardium, such as the initial slope and the slope at 1 s, also had a good correlation with myocardial flow (r = 0.84 and r = 0.89, respectively). Variables that reflected the washout of contrast medium from the myocardium, such as the slope of the descending portion of the curve, had only a fair correlation with myocardial flow (r = 0.65). In six dogs, the technique of injecting contrast medium into the cross-clamped aortic root was also examined. Although continuous infusion of contrast medium produced smaller perturbations in mean aortic and distal left anterior descending artery pressures compared with a bolus injection (p less than 0.01), the correlation between the variables of the time-intensity curves and flow was equally close with both techniques. It is concluded that it is possible to quantitate myocardial flow by using myocardial contrast echocardiography at the time of delivery of cardioplegic solution in dogs on cardiopulmonary bypass. The implementation of this technique in humans might be useful in guiding the sequence of graft placement and thereby improving myocardial preservation during coronary artery bypass operations. 
1	Efficacy of interferons on bowenoid papulosis and other precancerous lesions. Preliminary results of an open randomized trial of recombinant interferon gamma in patients suffering from bowenoid papulosis are described. Recombinant interferon gamma was given subcutaneously to 12 patients at a daily dose of 4 X 10(6) I.U. by injection. Four patients each were assigned to one of three treatment groups consisting of continuous therapy (group A) with three subcutaneous injections per week for 13 weeks; intermittent block therapy (group B) with four six-week cycles consisting of five injections on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 of each cycle; and intermittent single-dose therapy (group C) with six four-week cycles consisting of only one subcutaneous injection on day one of each cycle. At the twenty-sixth week after onset of therapy, complete responses were seen in three of four patients of treatment group A, whereas in the treatment groups B and C only one patient, respectively, responded partially. These results suggest that in contrast to condylomata acuminata bowenoid papulosis lesions respond better to continuous than to intermittent interferon gamma injections. 
5	Oral clofilium produces sustained lowering of defibrillation energy requirements in a canine model. The effect of long-term oral administration of antiarrhythmic drugs on defibrillation energy requirements is not well understood. We examined the effect of clofilium, a drug that prolongs cardiac action potential duration without slowing cardiac conduction, on defibrillation energy requirements and ventricular effective refractory periods in a canine model during a 3-week period. Epicardial patch electrodes were implanted in 12 dogs, and baseline testing was conducted under fentanyl anesthesia on day 7. An oral clofilium (100 mg/day) regimen was started on day 8. Six clofilium-treated and six control dogs underwent repeated testing on days 14, 21, and 28 after surgery. Truncated trapezoidal shocks were given repeatedly at various stored energies in random order; delivered current and impedance were measured; and delivered energy was calculated. The energy and current for 50% success in defibrillation (E50 and I50, respectively) were determined. For control animals, E50 increased by a mean 34 +/- 78%, 60 +/- 83%, and 69 +/- 122% compared with baseline (day 7) on days 14, 21, and 28, respectively. In contrast, E50 in clofilium-treated dogs decreased by 39 +/- 62%, 24 +/- 33%, and 32 +/- 15% on days 14, 21, and 28, respectively. Mean current requirements (I50) remained relatively stable compared with baseline in control animals (-7 +/- 39%, +25 +/- 36%, +40 +/- 75% on days 14, 21, and 28, respectively). After clofilium administration I50 decreased by 36 +/- 22%, 32 +/- 17%, and 33 +/- 17% on days 14, 21, and 28, respectively. 
3	99TCm-HMPAO SPECT studies in traumatic intracerebral haematoma. Traumatic intracerebral haematomas are a common neurosurgical emergency. Their management, particularly the role of surgical removal, is controversial. Deterioration often occurs late, and is unpredictable. Eight patients with traumatic intracerebral haematomas were admitted to the neurosurgical unit to monitor their clinical state. All were studied within 48 hours of admission with single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT), using the recently introduced radionuclide 99Technetiumm-Hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (99Tcm-HMPAO). At the time of the SPECT study, all the patients had been clinically stable. Three patients remained so; in the other five, the conscious level deteriorated, necessitating craniotomy and evacuation of the haematoma. In all the patients, the SPECT studies demonstrated perfusion defects that corresponded to the location of the haematoma, as demonstrated by computerised tomography (CT). However, in the five patients who subsequently deteriorated, the perfusion defects seen on the SPECT scan appeared larger than the haematoma, as seen on the CT scan. In addition, there was widespread poor retention of 99Tcm-HMPAO in the ipsilateral hemisphere. These differences were quantifiable. Interestingly, these differences were present at a time when the patients were clinically stable, before their deterioration. It is concluded that SPECT studies with 99Tcm-HMPAO are of possible use as predictors of late deterioration in the management of traumatic intracerebral haematomas. 
2	Pearson syndrome and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy in a patient with a deletion of mtDNA. A patient is described who has features of Pearson syndrome and who presented in the neonatal period with a hypoplastic anemia. He later developed hepatic, renal, and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. At the age of 5 years he developed visual impairment, tremor, ataxia, proximal muscle weakness, external ophthalmoplegia, and a pigmentary retinopathy (Kearns-Sayre syndrome). Muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy. Analysis of mtDNA from leukocytes and muscle showed mtDNA heteroplasmy in both tissues, with one population of mtDNA deleted by 4.9 kb. The deleted region was bridged by a 13-nucleotide sequence occurring as a direct repeat in normal mtDNA. Both Pearson syndrome and Kearns-Sayre syndrome have been noted to be associated with deletions of mtDNA; they have not previously been described in the same patient. These observations indicate that the two disorders have the same molecular basis; the different phenotypes are probably determined by the initial proportion of deleted mtDNAs and modified by selection against them in different tissues. 
4	Close correlation of intra-abdominal fat accumulation to hypertension in obese women. The relation between intra-abdominal visceral fat accumulation and blood pressure was investigated in 67 obese women (mean body mass index, 33.6 +/- 3.1; average age, 50 +/- 11 years). As an index of intra-abdominal fat accumulation, the ratio of the intra-abdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area was determined using a computed tomographic section at the level of the umbilicus. When the obese subjects were divided into a hypertensive group and a normotensive group, the ratio of the intra-abdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area in the hypertensive group was significantly higher (0.53 +/- 0.33 versus 0.29 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.01). Significant correlations between the ratio of intra-abdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.62, p less than 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.53, p less than 0.001) also were found. However, no significant difference existed in either the body mass index or the waist-to-hip circumference ratio between the hypertensive and normotensive groups. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels were not significantly different between the two groups. Moreover, the correlation between the ratio of the intra-abdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area ratio and blood pressure was found independent of age and body mass index by multiple regression analyses. We conclude that intra-abdominal fat accumulation itself may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension in obesity. 
5	A composite driving system for LVAS and IABP: practical and effective driving and weaning. We have devised a new method, termed alternate synchronous driving (ASD), to wean patients from a left ventricular assist system (LVAS) to a pressure assist intraaortic balloon pump (IABP). We have built a new drive unit, VCT200, to apply ASD easily and automatically. After IABP insertion in the final weaning stage, this method drives the LVAS and IABP alternately, with electrocardiogram (ECG) synchronization. The pumping ratio of IABP increases while that of LVAS decreases according to recovery of natural heart function. In in vitro studies, ASD was effective when bypass flow (BF) was less than 50% of total flow (TF) (TF:BF + cardiac output [CO]), and its advantages increased under lower BF conditions. Mean aortic pressure (mAP) and CO increased 10 mmHg and 15%, respectively, with this method (IABP:LVAS = 1:1) when BF was 30% of TF. During in vivo studies, mAP increased 75.7 +/- 6.7 mmHg to 80.1 +/- 3.6 mmHg (p less than 0.001), and the CO increased from 3.1 +/- 0.5 L/min to 3.3 +/- 0.5 L/min (p less than 0.001), while the endocardial viability ratio (DPTI/TTI) increased 20-30%. This method was used in a 62-year-old man in which LVAS was applied after ventricular aneurysmectomy, BF was reduced from 2.2 L/min to 1.1 L/min by using ASD without any change in systemic perfusion. This reduction of BF could not be achieved with LVAS alone. From these data, this system could wean patients from LVAS and then switch to IABP smoothly, easily, and automatically, without hemodynamic instability. 
1	Ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion. A curable entity using surgery alone without need for adjuvant therapy. Of 408 negative axillary node (NAN) patients surgically treated at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (Buffalo, NY, 1976 through 1987), 36 (8.8%) presented with ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (DCISM). In more than 50% of the patients (20/36) the disease was detected solely by mammography (microcalcifications and/or radiological density less than 1.5 cm). Thirty-three patients underwent modified radical mastectomy; three had wide excision +/- axillary dissection. Residual disease after excisional biopsy was found in 22 of 33 mastectomy specimens (67%): 11 (33%) pure ductal carcinoma in situ, five (15%) DCISM, and six (18%) frankly invasive. Of the 22 incidents of residual disease, 50% (11) were multicentric (one third of all specimens). These findings imply a high likelihood of residual cancer after excisional biopsy in these patients. All patients were free of disease for a mean follow-up of 57 months (range, 16 to 137). These findings indicate that DCISM is an entirely curable disease when treated by mastectomy alone, without the need for adjuvant therapy, regardless of the status of other prognostic factors such as tumor size, histologic differentiation, age, or steroid receptor status. 
4	Successful liver transplantation in a patient with a thrombosed portomesenteric system after multiple failed shunts. Combined portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis preventing restoration of adequate portal venous flow has been considered a contraindication to liver transplantation. We report a patient with failed splenorenal (SR), portocaval (PC), and mesocaval (MC) shunts, who despite the absence of any obvious means for supplying portal venous inflow to a hepatic graft, successfully underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. A method of reconstruction of the portal vein with the use of vein grafts anastomosed to a large splanchnic venous collateral is described. This technique can be used in selected patients in whom orthotopic liver transplantation might otherwise be considered technically impossible. 
5	Mitral valve disruption following percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty. Two cases of massive mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve disruption following percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty are reported. This severe complication occurred in two elderly women with recurrent mitral stenosis after previous surgical commissurotomy. Due to their unstable hemodynamic and clinical condition, both patients underwent emergency valve replacement. At surgery, the commissures appeared fused and heavily calcified; the chordae tendineae thickened, shortened, and fused; and the leaflets presented a large tear with sheared edges. Because the technical aspects of both procedures were unremarkable, the anatomic features of the mitral valve seemed to affect the occurrence of severe mitral regurgitation. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty should be therefore applied carefully to patients with prior surgical valvotomy, in whom the structural alterations of the mitral apparatus may predispose to severe valvular damage. 
5	Late complications in pediatric cardiac transplant recipients. Late complications occurring more than 3 months after cardiac transplantation were analyzed in 29 pediatric patients in whom 31 cardiac transplantations were performed. Age at transplantation ranged from 3 months to 18 years (mean, 11.3 years) with follow-up ranging from 3.5 to 54 months (mean, 21.6 months). There were seven late deaths and two patients with retransplantations. Of nine grafts lost, eight were due to acute rejection, and one was due to coronary disease. Four of the grafts lost were secondary to patient noncompliance with prescribed immunosuppression. The mean rejection frequency more than 1 year after cardiac transplantation was significantly higher in those patients who eventually lost their grafts; however, these patients could not be distinguished by their rejection frequency in the first year. Eight patients had coronary disease, with five diagnosed at autopsy, two at cardiac retransplantation, and one by angiography. All eight patients were on double immunosuppression; none of the 19 patients on triple therapy had coronary disease with similar follow-up. There were 12 serious infections in eight patients (four associated with OKT3) with no deaths. Five patients had arrhythmias requiring treatment including two pacemakers; four of the five were associated with rejection episodes. Twelve of 29 patients developed early hypertension, and five developed late hypertension (greater than 1 year). There were two malignancies; one patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma was cured with chemotherapy, and one patient with histiocytic lymphoma was discovered at autopsy. Two patients had cholecystectomies, and five patients required laser gingivectomies. 
4	Effects of long-term verapamil therapy on serum lipids and other metabolic parameters. Calcium antagonists have been used successfully in the management of hypertension for more than a decade, but less is known about their long-term metabolic effects. To define the impact of one calcium antagonist, verapamil, on serum lipids and other metabolic parameters, we placed 45 hypertensive patients on verapamil monotherapy and followed them for 4 to 8 years. After a mean treatment period of 5.3 years, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not significantly different from baseline, whereas the mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol value increased significantly from 1.17 +/- 0.41 mmol/L at the initiation of treatment to 1.39 +/- 0.36 mmol/L at 5.3 years (p less than 0.05). Other important biochemical parameters, including serum glucose, potassium and uric acid levels were unaffected by verapamil therapy. No serious side effects or adverse cardiovascular events occurred during verapamil therapy, and there were no study dropouts. It therefore seems likely that this agent will become increasingly useful in the long-term management of essential hypertension. 
5	Tropical neuromyelopathies and retroviruses: a review. Debilitating disorders of the nervous system have a relatively high prevalence in the tropics, a geographic region that is often deficient in specialists in the fields of neurology and epidemiology. During World War II, attention was called to a possible nutritional origin for most of these diseases. Recently, however, human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), formerly linked only to a rare form of leukemia (adult T cell leukemia), has been associated with a spastic paraplegia observed mostly in tropical areas and referred to as tropical spastic paraparesis. This entity is also observed in nontropical areas endemic for HTLV-I, including Japan, South America, and the southern United States. Viruses of the HTLV family are being associated increasingly with pathology in humans. The pathogenesis of HTLV-I-associated tropical spastic paraparesis remains to be understood. However, future research is expected to favor a multidisciplinary approach, with exciting potential insights derived from the fields of neurology, immunology, and infectious diseases. The aim of this review is to summarize contemporary research related to the viral etiology of this clinical entity. 
5	Defining the role of subtotal colectomy in the treatment of carcinoma of the colon. Seventy-two patients with colon cancer were treated by primary subtotal colectomy, including 23 patients with acute and subacute left colon obstruction. There were two operative deaths and no cases of disabling diarrhea. One death occurred in the group with colon obstruction. Other indications for subtotal colectomy included multiple polyps associated with the primary tumor (32), synchronous carcinomas (15), a previous transverse colostomy for obstruction (8), associated severe sigmoid diverticular disease (2), age less than 50 years with a positive family history (3), adherence of the sigmoid loop to a cecal tumor (2), and metachronous carcinoma (2). There were multiple indications in several patients. Subtotal colectomy has a defined role in a wide variety of clinical settings associated with colon cancer, including management of obstruction of the left and sigmoid colon, particularly if the proximal colon cannot be evaluated before operation by colonoscopy or barium enema. Segmental or regional colonic resections are appropriate if the entire colon can be evaluated before operation and no associated neoplasms are revealed. 
5	A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, two-center, pilot trial of Cop 1 in chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. We found Cop 1 to be effective and relatively safe in a previous (exacerbating-remitting) clinical trial. This current trial involves 106 chronic-progressive patients. The major end point, confirmed progression of 1.0 or 1.5 units (depending on baseline disability) on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale, was observed in nine (17.6%) treated and 14 (25.5%) control patients. The differences between the overall survival curves were not significant. Progression rates at 12 and 24 months were higher for the placebo group (p = 0.088) with 2-year probabilities of progressing of 20.4% for Cop 1 and 29.5% for placebo. We found a significant difference at 24 months between placebo and Cop 1 at one but not the other center. Two-year progression rates for two secondary end points, unconfirmed progression, and progression of 0.5 EDSS units, (p = 0.03) are significant.
