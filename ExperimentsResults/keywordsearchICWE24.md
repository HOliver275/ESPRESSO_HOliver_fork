<h3> Experiments for the ICWE'24 paper</h3>
The experiments specifically investigate how controllable ex-
perimental parameters influence search performance across a range of
decentralised settings. This includes examining the impact of different
text dataset sizes (0.5MB to 50MB per pod, divided into 1 to 10,000
files), different access control levels (10%, 25%, 50%, or 100% file ac-
cess), and a range of configurations for Solid servers and pods (from 1 to
100 pods across 1 to 50 servers). The experimental results confirm the
feasibility of deploying a decentralised search system to conduct keyword
search at scale in a decentralised environment.
